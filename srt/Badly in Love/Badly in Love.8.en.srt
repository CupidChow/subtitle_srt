1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,882
- It's you, Tenten.
- Hey.

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,801
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,555
- That's such a host move. You've got it.
- I know, I can't help it.

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,433
Plus, I talk like this.
People get the wrong idea.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,393
You mean they think you're acting?

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:22,188
Even when I'm just talking normally,
they'll still say I sound like a host.

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,232
So, like anyone?

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,736
Have you only gone on a date with Oto?

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,530
I haven't gone with anyone else,
but I'm the most interested in you.

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,906
- No way!
- Yeah.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,366
- I didn't see that.
- Yeah!

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,660
Remember when we met at the host bar?

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,829
- Mmm.
- Right, even back then,

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,706
- it was like you were the leader.
- Mmm.

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,000
And I was like, "Wow."

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,627
I've always liked girls who take charge.

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,048
Watching you lead and light up the room,
I was like, "Oh, she really is something."

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
Good. I made a good first impression?

19
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,134
You really did.

20
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,096
I still don't think
I've quite figured you out yet.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,266
I know. I might be the type of guy
who's hard to read.

22
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,976
- You are.
- That's how I seem.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,603
But I just wanna say how I feel.

24
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,605
That's true.
You're pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,735
So if I like somebody,
I'd rather tell 'em straight-up.

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,570
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,323
- We should go on a date then.
- Yeah, let's do it. For real.

29
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,285
<i>Tenten's easy to talk to</i>
<i>because he's so laid-back.</i>

30
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,871
But he surprised me
when he came on so strong.

31
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,664
It changed the way I saw him.

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,210
I feel like she's a leader
and carries herself very maturely.

33
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,920
I really like that about her.

34
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,839
So I'd really like to be able
to talk to her more,

35
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,925
and be able to get to know her better.

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,303
- Oh, my gosh…
- Oh, wow…

37
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,555
This is getting hard to understand.

38
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,141
- Tenten's still a mystery.
- Yeah, I know, really.

39
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,106
LOVE KITCHEN

40
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>Today, we'll be preparing</i>
<i>the food for the children's cafeteria.</i>

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,446
You look good in an apron.

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,116
- You look good in an apron.
- It matters, you know?

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,910
- It makes me look like I'm naked.
- I can see your clothes.

44
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,286
- Sure?
- You look decent.

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,704
MILK (22)
TEKARIN (21)

46
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,248
Should we cut the octopus?

47
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,626
- Oh, I want this.
- You do? Okay.

48
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,879
A bit thinner?

49
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,548
Nice job. Looks good.

50
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,093
Is this a cooking class?

51
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,179
- What cookies are you guys making?
- A little bit more. Thinner over here.

52
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,015
- Guess they can't hear me.
- Hmm? Oh, sorry.

53
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,352
I'm putting all kinds of stuff in it.

54
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,147
I can't even think
of any questions to ask.

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,648
- You know? Oh, yeah?
- Sure.

56
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,151
- It's all about the feeling.
- Put the octopus in here?

57
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,862
I guess I'll do that.

58
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,909
- Tekarin, your face is looking angry.
- No, I'm not angry.

59
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,870
Why should I be?

60
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,329
I seem like the type?

61
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,709
No, but when you are angry,
I bet you stay that way a while.

62
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,919
- I get quiet when I'm angry.
- Mmm.

63
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,799
I wouldn't want to talk to that person.
I wouldn't wanna see their face.

64
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,176
"I'll do everything for you."

65
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,428
Let's just say you and I
had a kid together…

66
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,930
- It'd be one amazing kid.
- Yeah, amazing. I bet.

67
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,600
- Their eyes, incredible.
- They'd be gifted with looks.

68
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,019
Is this good for <i>takoyaki? </i>Or too big?

69
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,272
Huh?

70
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,691
See, you are angry.

71
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,484
What do you mean?

72
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,406
- Wait, what?
- I think so.

73
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,034
- If you keep this up, Milk…
- Who, me?

74
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,702
- Remember this.
- I will.

75
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm not mad.

76
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,917
Just annoyed.

77
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,754
I mean, Tekarin clearly is very angry.

78
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,756
Well, yeah, of course she is.

79
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,424
Damn!

80
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,177
- Oh, no.
- Put that on the cabbage.

81
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,429
Damn! Damn!

82
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,306
- "No sweat."
- "Piece of cake."

83
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,766
"I'd rule my hometown."

84
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,643
- Insane.
- Gross.

85
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,729
Geez.

86
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,523
CLASSROOM

87
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,901
What are your goals for this project?

88
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,695
- For everyone to get along. Yup.
- Let's make sure that we do.

89
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,739
Don't splash water on people
when you meet them.

90
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,950
I'll try. Or I'll get hurt.

91
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,744
- How about you, Tekarin?
- Me?

92
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,914
- Your goals for the project?
- To not get in any fights.

93
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,501
- Won't happen. They're gonna love you.
- You never get in fights.

94
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,629
Oh, your necklace. This part moved.

95
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,381
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

96
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,383
- It always slips around.
- I get it.

97
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,301
- <i>Hold on.</i>
- There.

98
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,263
Crosses are cool.
They stand for a promise.

99
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,597
Oh, do they?

100
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,851
- So just don't make any of them hate you.
- I wanna get along.

101
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,186
- Try to.
- Yeah.

102
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,617
I'm pissed off, seriously.

103
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,869
- You're pissed?
- Yeah. I'm furious.

104
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,837
- Head-on?
- Yeah.

105
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,255
- Like this?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,512
What do you think I'm angry about?

107
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,264
- Why you're mad?
- Yeah, why?

108
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,934
- Why you're mad?
- Maybe not mad. But why I went, "Ugh."

109
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,438
My only guess is that I talked to Amo?

110
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,066
Mmm, just talking to her

111
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,027
- wouldn't make me go, "Ugh."
- Okay.

112
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,658
- I knew it. That's what I was thinking.
- Hmm.

113
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,244
That's what I thought.
Just wanted to confirm.

114
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,203
Okay.

115
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
It's really been bothering me.

116
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,373
Hmm.

117
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,793
I didn't like the whole necklace thing.

118
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,211
- Hmm? Necklace?
- When you told Amo

119
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,755
you'd fix her necklace and stuff.

120
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,132
Your necklace. This part moved.

121
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,554
- Oh, that's what.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,514
- I get it now.
- Why would you do that?

123
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,225
- I didn't think it's a big deal.
- Yeah?

124
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,227
I totally forgot that happened.

125
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521
- That's insane.
- Hmm. But it's just…

126
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,857
I know, it was up around here, right?

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,401
I get bothered by that stuff.
That's why I did it.

128
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,614
You're not my boyfriend yet,
so I don't think I need to say this, but…

129
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,531
Okay.

130
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,867
Hmm. That's how I felt.

131
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,621
Oh. So you just didn't like
seeing that happen in front of you?

132
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,872
I was just like, "Why?"

133
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,041
I didn't think you had to do that
in front of me.

134
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,585
- That's what you thought?
- Hmm. That was.

135
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,589
Well, I appreciate you telling me that.

136
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,341
Now I get it.

137
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,928
But now I kind of feel bad
about bringing it up.

138
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,888
You shouldn't. I'm glad.

139
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,140
- You're glad I brought this up?
- Mmm.

140
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,517
I wouldn't have known otherwise.

141
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,727
Yeah, honestly,
it did bug me a little bit.

142
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,812
I get it.

143
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,232
So I wanted to let you know that it was.

144
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,316
Thank you.

145
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,862
I really do like people
that are able to say "thank you."

146
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,948
I was like, "Here's another guy
that can do that."

147
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,533
Oh, come on now!

148
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,660
- Get a hold of yourself!
- My goodness.

149
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,162
Hold on a second there, Tekarin.
That's way too low of a bar.

150
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,123
She spends big at the host club.

151
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,084
I was like, "Wow, he's such a good guy."

152
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,045
I didn't judge him for being a host
or anything like that.

153
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,505
But my walls were still up.

154
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,632
Now that's completely changed,

155
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,343
and I feel like
it's easier to talk to him.

156
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,303
I can be myself around him.

157
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,683
Sometimes we've been out of sync,
but just emotionally,

158
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,855
I've realized that Tekarin
is really mature, personality-wise.

159
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,817
And also that
she has a really beautiful heart.

160
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,864
<i>But, honestly, at the moment,</i>
<i>I'm still a little unsure about her.</i>

161
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,285
- Her emotional ups and downs are wild.
- They are. Big time.

162
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,829
He just goes, "Thank you,"
and she's like, "Oh, my gosh!"

163
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,539
Like, come on now. Seriously?

164
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,876
Like a chicken that takes a few steps
and forgets everything.

165
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,087
Is she a chicken?
That's what they say about chickens.

166
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,339
They forget everything after a few steps.

167
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,883
- That's good for her.
- Like…

168
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,885
- "Chicken in Love."
- "Chicken in Love"?

169
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,387
- Enough. It's "Badly In Love".
- Badass Chicken.

170
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,062
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

171
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,106
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

172
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,442
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

173
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,945
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

174
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,281
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

175
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,533
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

176
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,869
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

177
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,954
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

178
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,956
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,292
I WON'T WASTE THE LIFE
MY PARENTS GAVE ME

180
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,264
YAKISOBA - SUPER BALL-YO-YO - COTTON CANDY

181
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,599
Ding-dong.

182
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,059
<i>Good morning.</i>

183
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,477
Morning!

184
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,686
Morning.

185
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,023
<i>Today, the boys will ask out the girls</i>

186
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>that they want to get to know better.</i>

187
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,070
TSU-CHAN (30)

188
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,154
TACKLE (24)

189
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,697
<i>So, boys, please announce now</i>

190
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,576
<i>which girl you'd like to talk to the most</i>
<i>over the PA system.</i>

191
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,494
NISEI (27)

192
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,578
Let's do it!

193
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,455
Let's go!

194
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,878
- On PA system, they're calling us out?
- No way!

195
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,796
Crazy.

196
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,839
I'll probably be in here forever.

197
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:09,799
OTO-SAN (22)

198
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,679
<i>And if a girl gets called</i>
<i>by more than just one boy,</i>

199
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,892
<i>she should choose who she wants to build</i>
<i>a deeper emotional connection with.</i>

200
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,396
- More than one?
- Two boys choose the same girl?

201
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,149
- That sucks. That's crazy.
- It does.

202
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,110
- No back and forth?
- Just choose one?

203
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,820
- Painful.
- It's tough.

204
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,364
Tsuu's gonna pick Baby, I think.

205
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,491
- Maybe Milk too?
- For Baby?

206
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,327
- Maybe Nisei will pick her too.
- I think he will.

207
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,122
No, I think Nisei is gonna go
for Amo or Oto.

208
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,707
I think he'll pick Amo.

209
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,417
Yeah, I think Amo too.

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,836
I think Tenten will go for Hikaru.

211
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,725
This is a cool room.

212
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,311
This really is a prison.

213
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,399
- What? A prison?
- Like an interrogation room.

214
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,818
Did he do something bad on the way there?

215
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,111
ON AIR

216
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,529
BROADCAST BOOTH

217
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,453
<i>Uh… Um…</i>

218
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,458
It's Tsuu, Tsukahara speaking.
Good morning. Uh…

219
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,462
The one that I would like to choose is…

220
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,009
is Baby. It's Baby, please.

221
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,223
Baby, huh?

222
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
So, please, I'm going to the courtyard.

223
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,860
Here we go.

224
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,281
Looks like a prison outfit.

225
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,242
He shouldn't keep adding on
even more prison vibes.

226
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,079
- He already looks enough like an inmate.
- It's the outfit, you know?

227
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,288
Straight-up prison.

228
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,379
The heck?

229
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,089
It's Milk here.

230
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,635
I, um…

231
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,307
- I've decided I would like to see Yuria.
- <i>Oh!</i>

232
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,267
I'll be waiting
in the third-floor classroom.

233
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,690
- He'd like to see me.
- How sweet!

234
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,610
To see me?

235
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,743
- Cute.
- So powerful, isn't it?

236
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,830
My heart actually melted.
He's just like a little puppy.

237
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,498
And imagine how cute he looked.

238
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,251
- So cute.
- Gosh. "I'd like to see Yuria."

239
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,060
Uh, Tackle here.

240
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,479
- Tackle.
- He sounds powerful.

241
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,689
He's pumped.

242
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,609
The person I'd like to have
a one-on-one with is Kii.

243
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,826
<i>I'd like you to come</i>
<i>to the sauna room on the third floor.</i>

244
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,786
- The sauna?
<i>- Thanks. That's all.</i>

245
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>But it makes me happy to know</i>
<i>that Tackle hasn't given up.</i>

246
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,129
<i>Right.</i>

247
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,422
I'm relieved.

248
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,007
He really wants to talk.

249
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,394
Good morning, everyone, it's Tenten.

250
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,448
Kii, please come to the smoking area
on the first floor.

251
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,075
Wow.

252
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,995
Thank him for picking the smoking area.

253
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,414
And I wanna go there too,
like really badly.

254
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,836
- So it wasn't Tekarin, huh?
- No, it wasn't. He said Kii.

255
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,174
I don't feel anything. Mmm.

256
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm not like, "Oh, I'm the only one
who didn't get picked," or anything.

257
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,013
<i>Really? Are you sure?</i>

258
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,932
I'm not gonna do anything.

259
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,142
Gonna keep doing what I'm doing.

260
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,864
NATURAL HOT SPRINGS & SAUNA

261
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,537
Whoa, cool!

262
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,426
<i>Mic check.</i>

263
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,428
- Whoa, that's loud.
- He was saying "mic check".

264
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,055
Nisei here.

265
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,060
The girl that I wanna talk to today…

266
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,696
is Amo.

267
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,780
Amo,

268
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,283
give me my sunglasses back.

269
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,286
Oh, okay, sure thing.

270
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,037
'Cause I stole his sunglasses.

271
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>Please come</i>
<i>to the living room on the first floor.</i>

272
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,879
Well, honestly, I didn't think

273
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,423
he was going to end up
picking me to talk to.

274
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>But then, when I found out</i>
<i>that he picked Amo…</i>

275
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,682
Honestly, I was just like,
"Wow, he's got no taste."

276
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,727
I… I like that.

277
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,854
Like, "Oh, so that really is your type."

278
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:01,400
And I was just thinking this is
gonna end up like his past relationships.

279
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
This is hard.

280
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,872
- It's really hard to pick.
- Yeah, it is.

281
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,542
But I don't wanna pick out of sympathy.

282
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,462
That's true. That's the tough thing
about all of this.

283
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,505
Like, they can talk this big game,

284
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,383
but what really matters to me
is if they're actually taking action.

285
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,054
Please don't settle.

286
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,933
- See ya.
- Kii's on the move.

287
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,143
- Have a good time!
- Okay, see you later.

288
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,107
<i>So who's she gonna pick?</i>
<i>Will it be Tackle,</i>

289
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,818
<i>who's single-mindedly pursued her</i>
<i>this whole time?</i>

290
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,461
- Tenten!
- <i>Oh!</i>

291
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>What?</i>

292
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
Oh, wow! Thank you for coming!

293
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,841
Tenten!

294
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,511
- It's hot. Yeah.
- I know, right?

295
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,596
- Is it okay if I sit here?
- There? Sure.

296
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,349
- I'm happy. Thank you so much.
- I picked you.

297
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,768
Wow, I'm just really happy.

298
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,270
- Oh, really?
- Or else I'd be stuck waiting here.

299
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,897
<i>- White again?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

300
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
<i>- Wait, it's a bit blue.</i>
<i>- It's blue.</i>

301
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,235
- I didn't think you'd come.
- Surprised?

302
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,070
Huh? I really was.

303
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,697
- But I'm relieved.
- Mmm.

304
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,198
- So thank you for coming.
- Mmm-hmm.

305
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,574
I feel safe with you.

306
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
Emotionally, I feel like
I can lean on you the most.

307
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,538
- Yeah? That's really nice of you to say.
- Mmm.

308
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,623
So it's like Tackle keeps asking me out,

309
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,500
<i>but when we're sitting</i>
<i>on the couch together,</i>

310
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,918
<i>he doesn't talk to me.</i>

311
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,045
<i>He's starting to feel like</i>
<i>a little brother.</i>

312
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,465
<i>He was like, "I'm going full throttle."</i>
<i>I'm like, "Dude, where is the throttle?"</i>

313
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,887
Tenten's a host, so he's smooth.

314
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:01,228
So the only way for me to match that
is to take action and go for a one-on-one.

315
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,522
She knows I'm only interested in her.

316
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:08,068
So, yeah, now I feel like
it really is just up to me.

317
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,239
But I have to say
that Tekarin was pretty shocked.

318
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,868
Yeah, well, that's, you know, inevitable.

319
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,078
- Don't say that.
- I mean, because, you know,

320
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,747
I'm the one making the choice.

321
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,249
I don't feel great about it.

322
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,174
So Tenten and Tekarin
have definitely had a few moments

323
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,761
where she's gotten a little jealous.

324
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,096
- But they still seemed to get closer.
- Mmm.

325
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,514
So, naturally, I thought

326
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,683
he was gonna end up
picking Tekarin, but then…

327
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,810
And Tekarin was pretty jealous after all.

328
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,936
- Right.
- Yeah.

329
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,564
How does that make you feel as a guy?

330
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:50,110
So I think that jealousy can be cute
at certain times, but annoying at others.

331
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,945
- That's tricky.
- You need distance.

332
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,823
Emotional distance,
and I think that Tenten

333
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,659
quietly just observes the ones
who can't deal with that.

334
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,079
So then, what about
what Tekarin did this time?

335
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,081
- She messed up having distance.
- Oh, really?

336
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,749
- She messed up?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

337
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,584
She got the spacing wrong. Too far inside.

338
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,837
So, that made Tenten
wanna back off real quick.

339
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,549
- Like that.
- Ah! Okay, I see, I get it now.

340
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,802
- I'm gonna head off.
- Okay, have fun.

341
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,053
Have a good time.

342
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,308
- See you later.
- You got a summer vibe.

343
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,434
Totally.

344
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,323
Hey.

345
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
- Morning!
- Morning.

346
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,662
- Nice sunglasses.
- Hmm?

347
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,247
- Trade?
- Nope.

348
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,332
Thief.

349
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,126
They look good on me.

350
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,211
- Please give them back.
- Huh?

351
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,963
- Come on.
- What do you mean?

352
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,091
Because once I put them on,
my look will finally be complete.

353
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,884
- Okay, I see now.
- You know…

354
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,553
You said you had three pairs.

355
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,304
But I didn't bring all of them.

356
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,557
- Oh, so they're at home.
- Yeah, they're at home.

357
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,395
- Are you sure about me?
- Hmm?

358
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,272
- The right choice.
- Good choice? Yeah?

359
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,857
- You're cute.
- You got those back.

360
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,026
Oh, you mean my sunglasses? That's true.

361
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,487
- Do you wanna snuggle?
- What?

362
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,322
- You wanna snuggle?
- Mmm.

363
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,908
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Whoa, what?</i>

364
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,161
There.

365
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,371
- This?
- Hold on.

366
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,789
- Or this?
- Okay, like this?

367
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,541
- Or this?
- Yeah. What?

368
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,334
You're kinda cute, you know?

369
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,378
- You're not used to this, are you?
- Hmm?

370
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,047
You're not the type of person
that goes, "Whoo-hoo!"

371
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,049
- Nope. No, I'm like this…
- No?

372
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,469
- So you don't get overexcited?
- Right.

373
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,013
You're not that kind of guy?

374
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,849
It's this… This…

375
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,017
- Mmm.
- This…

376
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,852
Mmm…

377
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,022
You smell good.

378
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,276
You know what? You're kinda cute.

379
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,494
Wiggle, wiggle.

380
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,749
- Can I kiss you?
- I think--

381
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,833
Mmm.

382
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,753
Why?

383
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,091
No way!

384
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,259
What?

385
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
Wait, why is it like this?

386
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,181
What? Like what?

387
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,017
- Something on me?
- A little something.

388
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,103
- I can get shy.
- Mmm-hmm.

389
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,148
That's my first kiss in a while.

390
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,696
You're blushing, Nisei.

391
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,115
Am I? I guess I'm just happy.

392
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,327
Obviously.

393
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,579
I'm still able to feel it.

394
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,123
Yeah.

395
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,631
I haven't kissed anybody
in such a long time, I'm dying.

396
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,928
Like a heart attack. Oh, my gosh.

397
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,601
Oh, my gosh. That was really amazing.

398
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,520
I don't know a lot
about reality dating shows,

399
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,022
- I was surprised to see this.
- Feel my heart racing.

400
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,693
Maybe you don't usually get to see a kiss
like that happen very often.

401
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,236
- Oh…
- You know what I mean?

402
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,862
They were both really excited.

403
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,324
Nisei said he could still feel the kiss,
and Amo was like…

404
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,702
Amo said it's been
a long time for her too.

405
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,953
She did.

406
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,665
She seems like the type who'd go,
"It's been so long, like three months!"

407
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,294
Three months is a pretty safe answer.
Not too recent, not too long ago.

408
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,336
Maybe.

409
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,547
Even if it's been six months,
she would say three.

410
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,465
- That's my impression.
- That's the impression?

411
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,259
The impression that I got too.

412
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,679
Amo talks like someone
who's been popular on TV for years.

413
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,724
- I know what you mean.
- Where does she get confidence?

414
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,020
And the last time that Oto was with Nisei,
she said that she wasn't going to give up.

415
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,062
Mmm…

416
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,981
She doesn't know
that they kissed just now.

417
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,524
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah.

418
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,900
- Yeah.
- Poor thing.

419
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,694
She doesn't know that yet,

420
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,904
but she can sense
there's something going on.

421
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,699
She can feel that the two of them
have gotten closer somehow.

422
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,535
But I really do hope
that Oto keeps trying.

423
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,329
- You got it!
- I will.

424
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,539
If your ribbon gets loose,
fix it like this.

425
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,498
Like this?

426
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,292
- I'm going.
- Good luck!

427
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,376
Mmm.

428
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,965
Oh, boy.

429
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,276
It's so hot out here.

430
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,083
Hey.

431
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,045
- There she is!
- This is so unexpected.

432
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,506
No way!

433
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,093
I wanted to see you.

434
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,845
- I heard you say that over the PA.
- Yeah.

435
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,598
- I wanted to.
- What are you doing?

436
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,975
I was trying to distract myself.

437
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,019
- With your gloves on?
- Yeah, that's right.

438
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,063
I'm glad you decided to come.

439
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,607
I feel relieved.

440
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,485
So, what made you choose me?

441
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,488
I'm just gonna be honest with you.

442
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,949
- I decided at the last minute.
- Yeah?

443
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,618
I really just couldn't decide.

444
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,622
But then I remembered what you said
over the PA earlier today.

445
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,749
Yeah…

446
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,670
I kind of just thought
that you sounded a little bit down.

447
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,381
I'm okay.

448
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,174
I'm doing great.

449
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,221
I'm fine. I really am.

450
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,683
You don't have to pretend
that you're doing okay, you know?

451
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,435
I'm not pretending. For real.

452
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,353
- I was like, "What do I do?"
- Mmm.

453
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,188
I kept wondering how I should act.

454
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,692
I was overthinking everything,
my brain short-circuited.

455
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,610
My heart was racing.

456
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,785
All of the girls were like,
"That was so sweet,"

457
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,912
when we heard what you said over the PA.

458
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,914
When you said you wanted to see me.

459
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,625
- And I was just like, "Aww."
- I just wanted to be honest.

460
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,587
I wasn't expecting you to say that.
So, thank you, really.

461
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,589
- No problem.
- For always pursuing me.

462
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,841
I'm glad.

463
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,718
- You're glad?
- Yeah, I'm really glad.

464
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,430
I like her.

465
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,891
That was quick.

466
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,642
After trashing her the other day?

467
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,186
Yeah, he really was.

468
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,854
I didn't think she'd come.

469
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:46,067
Because Tsuu said
he wanted to talk to her.

470
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,612
And I thought she might
go for him instead.

471
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,780
I was like, "Whatever, she's not coming."

472
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,451
<i>I was napping.</i>
<i>Then I heard someone say, "Hey."</i>

473
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,495
<i>And I thought, "Oh, I like her."</i>

474
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,956
I guess I've liked her all along.

475
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,542
I do like her.

476
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,297
If I'm also able to get
some one-on-one time with Tsuu,

477
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,883
then I would really like
to talk to him as well.

478
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,386
But Milk has been upfront with
how he feels about me this whole time.

479
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,306
That's why when I got this big chance
to talk with someone,

480
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,641
I decided to pick him.

481
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,775
I'm just gonna keep
proving myself as a man,

482
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,318
all the way until the end.

483
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,445
- <i>Wow.</i>
- I'll do what a man does.

484
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,738
- Yeah.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

485
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,158
Tsuu's not gonna let it end
like this, is he?

486
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,618
Well, we have to remember

487
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,204
that Tsuu has only
really started expressing

488
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,457
his feelings openly
for Baby very recently.

489
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,708
- Right?
- Right.

490
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,378
So I think what he meant
is that he's finally committing.

491
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,462
Right, right.

492
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,548
Like he felt determined right there.

493
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,800
Like he's still not going down
without a fight,

494
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,385
even though he wasn't chosen today.

495
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,263
Her not showing up might've fired him up.

496
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,432
And Milk is kind of starting to act
a little bit girly.

497
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,935
Yeah, kinda like, "Oh, my God!"

498
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,564
Like, "I wanted to see you so much."
A little bit feminine.

499
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,899
Plus, his skin's looking so smooth too.

500
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,735
<i>His heart cleared up,</i>
<i>and so did the tint on his glasses.</i>

501
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,695
<i>True!</i>

502
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,030
<i>When his heart was cloudy,</i>
<i>he was wearing shades.</i>

503
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,448
- Right.
- He was.

504
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,784
It feels like we're watching
a skin care infomercial.

505
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,370
Like, "I really did love
this product after all."

506
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,583
Okay, let's talk.

507
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,627
All right, so then why don't we talk about
what we think of the girls?

508
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,795
Since we're all here.

509
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,796
- All right?
- Yeah.

510
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,465
- I'm into Kii, as always.
- As faithful as ever.

511
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,550
That's cool.

512
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,718
Awesome.

513
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,304
Still the same. Nothing's changed?

514
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,638
- No.
- Cool.

515
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,890
I guess I'm still kind of a bit immature.

516
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,726
That goes for finding love too.

517
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,686
I'm incomplete.

518
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,982
I did have a girlfriend.
But we ended things five months ago.

519
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,568
And I really liked her a lot,

520
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,738
but I could never do anything right.

521
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:01,077
So even though I did still like her,
we eventually broke up.

522
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,913
At the end, she said,

523
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:08,877
"You'll never find another woman
who loves you as much as I do."

524
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,129
And I was just like,
"Man, I'm so pathetic."

525
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,964
I'd taken no responsibility.

526
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,384
I hadn't even been able
to treat this woman right.

527
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,803
<i>Maybe that's how I protected myself.</i>

528
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,805
<i>I got a tattoo to show</i>
<i>I'm determined to change.</i>

529
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,266
It hasn't been long,

530
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:28,021
but I hope I get inspired by you all,
and that I can become a better guy.

531
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:28,980
Mmm.

532
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,651
Hopefully, I become a man
who always acts with integrity.

533
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,405
Honestly, Tackle, I think you've got
a lot of strengths already.

534
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,784
- No doubt.
- And I respect that about you, I do.

535
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,536
There's things that he can do
that I definitely can't.

536
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,540
Yeah, I'll be like, "Where's Tackle?"
And he'll just be working on his bonsai.

537
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,378
I can just tell how much you love bonsai,
you're so devoted to it.

538
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,214
- I think so too.
- He's even got a tattoo.

539
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,340
How 'bout you?

540
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,342
I like Kii too.

541
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,843
Yeah.

542
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,348
She makes solid,
well-grounded comments, you know?

543
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,392
She has great insights,
and she's grounded.

544
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,435
She knows how to keep things smooth.

545
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:13,441
I guess, in my case,
in terms of family and how I was raised,

546
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,943
my dad was really scary.

547
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:21,908
And so, I think that I just got better
at reading his moods.

548
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,952
- To keep him happy?
- Yeah, exactly.

549
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,871
I learned how to please
the people above me.

550
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,582
- I had to do that with my dad.
- Something you developed.

551
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,834
I learned it.

552
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,629
Whenever I got in trouble with someone,
I'd go to someone above them.

553
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,466
So then, after they'd get yelled at,
I would hit them while they were down.

554
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,634
I was so damn sneaky.

555
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,386
- So sneaky!
- Yeah.

556
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,180
That was definitely messed up
and twisted, right?

557
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,349
It was no wonder that people hated me.

558
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,310
So people hated me, and they held grudges,

559
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,770
and I got arrested.

560
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,982
During this, my parents…

561
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,737
They would come and see me
once a week, the entire time.

562
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,238
Oh.

563
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,657
Just before the verdict came down,

564
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,660
my mom, who had always been upbeat,

565
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:10,415
and my dad, suddenly burst into tears.
I'd never seen that before.

566
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,419
And both of them bowed so low
to the judge, almost on their knees.

567
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,588
And as soon as I saw that,

568
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,509
I realized I had to get my act together.

569
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,677
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

570
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,513
And also, that I had to start

571
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,475
actually thinking about others.

572
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,394
And that I needed to change as a person.

573
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,273
- That's how I got to where I am.
- So you really did turn your life around.

574
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,192
Yeah, I did. More or less.

575
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,528
- Wow.
- It's good you could do that. Mmm.

576
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:45,200
What made you become a troublemaker
before you got into boxing?

577
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,993
- I was messed-up.
- Right.

578
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,079
I mean, I went to school
and that kind of stuff,

579
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,956
but it was like I wasn't even there.

580
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,541
- Oh, I see.
- Around then,

581
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,711
a senior from my boxing gym
reached out to my school for me.

582
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,339
- And then, my mom…
- Oh, your mother…

583
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,632
She is such a good mom.

584
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,383
- Cried a lot.
- Ah. At home?

585
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,844
Always at my school.
Got called in all the time.

586
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,888
- Right.
- Spent more time there than me.

587
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,515
She'd cry every time.

588
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:13,603
And I loved my mom,
so I couldn't keep doing that to her.

589
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,941
I really put my mom
through a lot. You know?

590
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:24,614
She wasn't a delinquent
or into that kind of <i>Yankii </i>lifestyle.

591
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,283
She really didn't know anything about it.

592
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,701
She was sheltered.

593
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,370
I guess…

594
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,623
I was a little bit of an odd one to her,
you know what I mean?

595
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,083
Odd with me being her kid.

596
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,252
Like I'd break a window,

597
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,879
blood would gush out of me,
I'd go to the hospital.

598
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,006
And every time, she was there for me.

599
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,134
And I felt really sorry
about doing that to her.

600
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,596
I do still give them trouble, though.
I still make them worry.

601
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,098
Yeah.

602
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,227
<i>The one that I wanna say</i>
<i>"thank you" to is my dad.</i>

603
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,146
<i>But the one I wanna say</i>
<i>"sorry" to is my mom.</i>

604
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,355
<i>Who is it?</i>

605
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
Hey, hello?

606
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,901
<i>- Oh, hey!</i>
- It's me, Nisei.

607
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,653
- Are you there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

608
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,489
Well, it's just like…

609
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,950
Um…

610
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,037
- The reason I called…
<i>- Yeah?</i>

611
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,289
Well, you know, I…

612
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,462
I was such a handful as a second son.

613
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,839
Back in junior high,

614
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,384
you always got called in to talk to…

615
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,803
the teachers, right?

616
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,681
<i>- I'm surprised you remember.</i>
- Yeah, of course I do.

617
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,683
Mmm.

618
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,103
- Well, that's how I was.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

619
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,147
And I…

620
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,567
think that I caused you a lot of trouble.

621
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,110
<i>- Mmm.</i>
- Mmm.

622
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,822
And that was pretty tough for me,
in the sense that…

623
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,451
Well, I love you a lot.

624
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,078
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>
- Mmm.

625
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,913
Well…

626
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,249
And I know I made you cry a lot.

627
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,169
So just let me apologize.

628
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,464
I'm sorry.

629
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,341
I really am.

630
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,885
<i>- No, thank you.</i>
- Yeah.

631
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,972
I remember I broke a kid's backpack.

632
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,850
Kicked someone in the face,
broke their glasses.

633
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,395
<i>- Mmm.</i>
- Yeah.

634
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,441
You were always the first person
to come help me.

635
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,444
And always on my side.

636
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,991
So thank you. I'm sorry…

637
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,493
for all that trouble.

638
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,205
<i>Don't worry about that</i>
<i>or apologizing to me,</i>

639
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,417
<i>- but I do appreciate you thanking me.</i>
- Mmm.

640
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,379
You've given me everything I've needed.

641
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,673
And you raised me.

642
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,174
Thank you.

643
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,093
<i>- You're welcome.</i>
- Mmm.

644
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:38,516
I'm gonna work really hard
to be the best son that I can be.

645
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,227
<i>- You're doing enough.</i>
- Mmm.

646
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,397
<i>- Get along with them. Okay?</i>
- Yeah, I have been.

647
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,190
No fights or anything.

648
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,775
All of them are good kids.

649
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
Some are older, some are younger.

650
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,196
But we've got the same
kind of people gathered here.

651
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,240
So, obviously,

652
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,743
we all kinda click, you know?

653
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,871
<i>So it's a good thing</i>
<i>you joined the show, huh?</i>

654
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,164
Yeah, I think so.

655
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,624
Anyways, thanks for the talk.

656
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,501
<i>- Sure thing. Thank you.</i>
- Okay.

657
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,729
It's pretty hard to say "thank you"
or "sorry" to your mom, you know?

658
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,439
Yeah, I never do.

659
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,316
- Or saying, "I love you."
- Mmm.

660
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,484
That's a hard one too.

661
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,527
And I think 27 is kind of the age

662
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,780
where it's the hardest to say
that kind of thing.

663
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,866
- You're totally right. Exactly.
- Especially saying that to your mom.

664
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,576
I guess that's part of his charm though.

665
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,786
- Right.
- Exactly.

666
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,412
He seems like he's this kinda player,

667
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,415
but then when something hits him,
like when he was on the phone,

668
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,752
he seemed way more genuine than anytime
we've seen him talking to the girls.

669
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,213
So, like, he's actually
a really honest guy.

670
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,298
So I thought
that was very heartwarming to see.

671
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,258
True! Seeing that side of him,

672
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,095
just makes you kind of fall for him
all over again, don't you think?

673
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,222
I think he kind of tickles
your maternal instincts.

674
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,973
Oh, I know it. Yeah, he does.

675
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,392
- He's a tickle-tickle type.
- Totally tickle-tickle.

676
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,561
- Tickles your maternal instincts.
- Totally.

677
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,565
- Hey.
- Yeah.

678
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,400
- We've all made a toast? Not yet?
- Cheers!

679
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,111
- Some people haven't yet.
- Yeah, cheers!

680
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,153
Doing it now?

681
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,696
Yuria, let's go.

682
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,490
- Who, me? You mean me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

683
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,837
CLASSROOM

684
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,381
- At the start of this…
- Yeah?

685
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,801
When we were playing darts with Milk boy,
you asked who I liked.

686
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,804
- And I lost.
- You did.

687
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,890
I said I'd tell you if I liked someone.
I didn't have anyone then.

688
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,102
As soon as you're interested in someone,
you gotta tell us.

689
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,353
- Sure.
- Our secret.

690
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,231
- It's a deal.
- Soon as it happens, I'll tell you.

691
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,608
- Okay, let's pinky swear, all of us.
- Sure.

692
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,235
- <i>I remember this.</i>
- Here we go.

693
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,653
- A<i>t the beginning.</i>
- Okay.

694
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,446
- It's a promise.
- No problem.

695
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,908
I haven't had anyone until now, so…

696
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,035
Yeah, there's someone I like.

697
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,538
- I'll tell you about it now.
- Mmm-hmm.

698
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,251
Well, the person I like is you.

699
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,630
Yeah. So I just wanted to tell you.

700
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,257
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,552
Yup.

702
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,263
- You like me?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

703
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,808
I wanna know more about you,
your family, your personality.

704
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,310
All kinds of things.

705
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,104
We don't have time
to get to everything, obviously,

706
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,565
but I'd like to know more about you
in any case.

707
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,609
- "Any case"?
- Well, anyways.

708
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,486
You're the woman here
that I want to protect.

709
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,323
Just knowing what you went through
in the past.

710
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,908
And…

711
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,454
This is coming from the heart,
not because my face is red from drinking.

712
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,789
- Your face isn't red yet.
- I'm not drunk. It isn't? No.

713
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,291
I meant what I said, drunk or not.

714
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,211
We all made that promise.

715
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,632
So now that there is finally someone,
I thought I should tell them.

716
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,759
You know? Yeah.

717
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:05,181
Milk has obviously been
upfront with you from the start.

718
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,099
You have a lot to think about,
in any case.

719
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,185
- "In any case," stop it.
- Wait, why?

720
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,354
- That's what I wanted to say.
- Mmm.

721
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,105
Yes.

722
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,733
- Indeed it was.
- It was indeed.

723
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,693
Indeed what I want to say.

724
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,780
- Oh, well, okay. So it's me, then.
- Right.

725
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
Mmm.

726
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,369
Honestly, that was very manly of him.

727
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,870
Mmm.

728
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,581
He told me that he still remembered
the promise that we made.

729
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,293
And then he told me
I was the person that he liked.

730
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:38,547
<i>And he was looking me in the eye</i>
<i>when he was telling me that. Yeah.</i>

731
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,678
That made me happy, or actually…

732
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,639
I felt like that hit me
right in the heart.

733
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,558
It's rough.

734
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,644
She said I have a chance,

735
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,771
and then she even picked me
for the one-on-one.

736
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,689
Okay.

737
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,066
But even though we had that,

738
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,360
- she hasn't spent time with me.
- Mmm.

739
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,278
She's with Tsuu.

740
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,696
At first, she was like,

741
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,990
"I'm the one who always asks him
to hang out,

742
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,700
but he never actually shows up."

743
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,535
"Maybe he's just not that into me."

744
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:14,041
- I don't know what to say to that.
- Fair. But that's how it is.

745
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,586
- I get lonely.
- Yeah, me too.

746
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,755
- A couple of strays.
- I'm lonely too.

747
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,093
- Meow, meow, so lonely.
- Meow, meow, I'm so lonely!

748
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,137
Licking our wounds?

749
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,849
- I'll get drinks. I'll…
- Licking our wounds?

750
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,684
Gross.

751
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,155
YURIA IS CUTE
FROM TSUKAHARA

752
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,699
You're the cutest. No doubt.

753
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,077
No doubt.

754
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,496
- All right.
- All right now.

755
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,915
Things are really starting
to move forward now.

756
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,544
"I'm gonna protect you
because of your past."

757
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,714
Honestly, I don't think anyone
says things like that anymore.

758
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,050
Men are supposed to take responsibility.

759
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,634
- Thank you.
- That's what men do.

760
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,470
- That's a good one.
- You're right.

761
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,723
Most guys these days are like,
"I don't wanna protect anyone."

762
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,891
Yeah.

763
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,684
They try and run away from problems.

764
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,228
- A lot want to escape reality.
- No way. That's not right.

765
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,483
That's something that I really admire
about these <i>Yankii </i>type of guys.

766
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,526
They're able to just say things like that.

767
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,071
So, what I'm about to say
might make Tsuu hate me.

768
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,198
I mean, look at the way he looks.

769
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,242
But he's not really much
of a ladies' man, is he?

770
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,869
- He's old school.
- Right.

771
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,455
- Very much a tough guy.
- Know what girls look for?

772
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,751
What they really wanna know about a guy
is just how determined he is.

773
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,836
In that sense,
Tsuu has this thing about him

774
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,588
that's inherently masculine.

775
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,132
It's something that goes beyond
just his looks.

776
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,844
There's something that's just inherently
very attractive about him.

777
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,098
He's such a hardcore <i>Yankii, </i>but even
I'm starting to get attracted to him.

778
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,392
- Yeah, you're so right.
- As a <i>Badly In Love </i>viewer.

779
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,518
Exactly, right.

780
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,395
I bet everyone watching
feels the same way.

781
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,146
- You're right.
- "Tsuu's the man!"

782
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,648
I'm just like, "He is so cool."

783
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,318
I think that's just because he's showing
how determined he is, you know.

784
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,571
I'm just wondering who Baby's gonna choose
at the end of all of this.

785
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,117
I really just have no idea
who she's gonna end up picking.

786
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,411
Milk's a bit too weak emotionally,
don't you think?

787
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,370
Too fragile.

788
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,497
He's just kinda like,
"I don't wanna hurt anyone."

789
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,582
- "I don't wanna get hurt either."
- He did.

790
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,669
If that's how you're thinking
about things, you're not actually in love.

791
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,754
- That's true.
- Because love is all about

792
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,257
still loving someone, despite all that.

793
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,341
Yeah, that's right.

794
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,178
You know, sometimes I wonder
if Milk's just so attracted to Baby,

795
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,639
that he's actually mistaken
that attraction for love.

796
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,724
That might be true. Right on point.

797
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,643
Your commentary again. I mean, come on…

798
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,520
Seriously, you've done it again.

799
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,939
- Gone full Miwa mode again.
- He has.

800
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,901
- I'm just like, "All he says makes sense."
- Couldn't agree more. I'm speechless.

801
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,405
- You need to make a quote-a-day calendar.
- A walking quote-a-day calendar.

802
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,824
- When I look like this?
- Like, "It'll be all right."

803
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,161
"It's gonna be all right.
A real man's determined." Yes!

804
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,371
I'd love to buy AK's
"It's gonna be all right" quote.

805
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,039
"Oh, it's gonna be all right."

806
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,958
- "It's gonna be all right."
- Right?

807
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,714
Did you decide
to pursue Baby from day one?

808
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,215
Mmm, kinda.

809
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,510
What makes you like someone?

810
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:15,097
- I don't know. Instinct.
- Oh, wow, seriously?

811
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,349
That's cool.

812
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,767
Mmm…

813
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,562
I'm not really sure
what I'm feeling right now, though.

814
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,938
Oh, what happened?

815
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,525
I'm not feeling it anymore.

816
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,863
I have to consider things
when a girl's older than me.

817
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,989
Mmm.

818
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,576
When we were talking, she was like,
"I want to be loved and pampered.".

819
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,161
<i>Mmm</i>…

820
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,873
<i>- I was like, "I'm only 22."</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

821
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,917
<i>I wanna be loved and pampered too.</i>

822
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,295
- Mmm. Okay, I see what you mean.
- But I couldn't say that.

823
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,048
- Maybe because I'm serious about her.
- Mmm.

824
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,469
I don't wanna hurt her,
and I don't wanna get hurt either.

825
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,678
Yeah, of course not.

826
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,764
- Nobody wants to get hurt.
- Yeah.

827
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,683
But you're into Nisei, right?

828
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,310
- Nisei?
- Mmm-hmm.

829
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,355
Mmm, well, I thought that I was.

830
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,527
But I have a feeling Nisei's been
playing around a bit.

831
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,654
Yeah, all of the girls are saying that.

832
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,406
For sure.
But if that's what Nisei wants to do,

833
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,159
then he's more than welcome
to go ahead and do that.

834
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,160
Oh, yeah?

835
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,371
But I just can't be
with someone like that.

836
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,581
Mmm.

837
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,084
I don't want him badly enough
to put up with that.

838
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,712
That's not gonna make me happy.

839
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,297
- Yeah, that's true.
- Mmm.

840
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,592
So I guess it just depends
on how he behaves now.

841
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,885
Oh, okay.

842
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,514
So, yeah, a part of me
is definitely still not sure.

843
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:41,225
Because when I see
stuff like that, it's like, "Oh!"

844
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,935
Isn't that such a turnoff?

845
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,063
- Don't you think so?
- I do.

846
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,400
- Me too.
- Definitely.

847
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,736
Crazy, right? Like, "Wow,
he really put his hands on her."

848
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,865
And I think that Oto likes him as well.

849
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,286
<i>He is just playing around after all.</i>

850
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,506
That pisses me off.

851
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,758
- Shall we take that down?
- Isn't it gross?

852
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,385
Maybe we should just burn it.

853
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:20,139
It's just seriously so annoying.

854
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,933
Only loyal guys win, right?

855
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,101
- In the end.
- Mmm.

856
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,811
Are you losing confidence?

857
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,148
- I don't have any left.
- Are you serious?

858
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,025
Come on, now, don't think that.

859
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,069
Being loyal to someone is one of the most
important things you can be.

860
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,280
- I mean, I'm not gonna give up, but…
- Mmm.

861
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:42,119
- Once I start thinking about it…
- Mmm.

862
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,829
Mmm.

863
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,374
I think you're feeling down
right now, and anyone would feel that way.

864
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,959
Who wouldn't be?

865
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,170
- I'm not feeling good.
- That's annoying.

866
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,342
- Yeah.
- Annoying.

867
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,177
- Yeah?
- It's creepy.

868
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,931
If Nisei sees me as just another girl

869
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,100
that he can fool around with
whenever he wants to,

870
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,020
I'll never be happy with him
and I don't wanna be with him.

871
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,024
I am still interested if he actually
wants to get serious about me.

872
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:15,694
But if he's just picking up girls
here and there, then I don't want him.

873
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,656
- Wow, I didn't think she felt like that.
- Right?

874
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,449
Didn't know she was like that.

875
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,621
- So?
- Sure.

876
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,747
Once you're done.

877
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,634
- Okay.
- Mmm.

878
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,177
GIRLS' BEDROOM

879
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,762
- Let me be serious.
- Okay.

880
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,682
- You know those pictures?
- Yeah.

881
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,226
I was looking at those earlier and I saw…

882
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,395
- one where you were…
- Mmm.

883
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,691
sort of posing with Baby
like this, you know?

884
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,651
It was up on the display in the classroom.

885
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,905
- Oh? From when?
- And…

886
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,075
Uh, I don't know, probably from
the glamping day or something.

887
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,245
Yeah, so when I saw it, I was like…

888
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,541
- Oh, really?
- That's what I was thinking.

889
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,584
- Oh, yeah?
- I was.

890
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,379
- <i>Wow, she really said that?</i>
- <i>She did, didn't she?</i>

891
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,463
Mmm.

892
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,591
That's exactly how I felt.

893
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,969
So yeah. And I…

894
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,640
- remembered the way you hugged me too.
- Mmm.

895
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:31,478
And then you kissed me, so I was like,
"Did this mean anything to him?"

896
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,064
"Or is he just doing this
with all the girls here?"

897
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,901
- That's fair. Makes sense.
- Mmm.

898
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,655
- Oh, when I thought about it…
- Can't argue.

899
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,492
I was like, "This is only
gonna make me feel miserable."

900
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,161
Mmm.

901
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,706
And it would be sad, but I have to think
about my own happiness.

902
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,042
Mmm. And so,

903
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:59,298
I don't think that's something
I should have to put up with.

904
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,133
- Okay, I understand.
- Yeah.

905
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,428
- You know? Mmm.
- I do.

906
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,474
Mmm…

907
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,395
If you're gonna keep doing
what you're doing,

908
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,149
like, "I wanna talk to more girls."

909
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,318
Or, "I need to talk to them more,"

910
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,236
if that's what's driving you…

911
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,782
Mmm…
