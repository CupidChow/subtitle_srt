1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,341
Wow, this is beautiful.

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,802
Thanks for inviting me.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,637
You're going no sandals?

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,265
It's going to be pretty hot in here. Ahh!

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,684
It's hot!

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,938
- First time here?
- Yeah. It's exciting.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,482
I usually go to the sauna every day.

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,360
Unlike everyone else here,

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,362
my goal isn't necessarily
to get a boyfriend.

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,447
OTO-SAN (22)

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,325
Like, finding romance
isn't my first priority while we're here.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,494
- So what is?
- I want kids.

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,412
NISEI (27)

14
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,205
- Oh.
- And I want to get married.

15
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,206
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,292
- <i>She's here for a husband.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,960
- Like, right away?
- Mmm-hmm.

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,004
- Sooner the better.
- Seriously?

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,338
- I mean soon-ish.
- Right.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,176
It's not like I want to meet a guy
and then get married right away

21
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,344
- as soon as we start dating or something.
- Mmm.

22
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,680
Ever since I was about 25,

23
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,309
I felt like I could marry every girl
that I was in a relationship with.

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,186
- That's natural, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,271
- That's the girl I'm with at that moment.
- Mmm-hmm.

26
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,690
But there's still stuff
I have to do, for real.

27
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,485
Like, I won't say it's a burden,

28
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,862
- but being married limits what I can do.
- Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,824
I thought you didn't like me.

30
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,618
No, that's not it.

31
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,793
I missed you.

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,006
- <i>Guys never know what to do here.</i>
- <i>I'd be lost.</i>

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>Guys don't know what to do with tears.</i>

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,301
You missed me?

35
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,388
I missed you.

36
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,769
Like, I can't approach you
when everyone's around.

37
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,271
- Huh?
- I can't do it in front of everyone.

38
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,067
Like, you know, ask you out
in front of everyone.

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,861
That feels too forward.
I can't go in strong like that.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,072
I mean, you said you couldn't, but…

41
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,784
But I was hoping that
you would stay with me at least.

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,038
The whole time? Even if I did…

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,041
I don't like that
you're approaching the other girls.

44
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,210
But I don't get why you don't like it.

45
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,879
I just don't like it, that's all.

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,381
What am I supposed to do?

47
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,342
<i>She was so sensitive</i>

48
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,970
and saying she didn't want me
to like anyone else.

49
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,888
It was scary. For real.

50
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,100
Part of me was happy

51
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
but also scared.

52
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,187
It's a fine line.

53
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,399
- Scared, huh?
- It turned him off.

54
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,276
It might have come across
a little intense.

55
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,360
Right.

56
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,696
Well, I'm kinda on the fence now.

57
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>Other than her,</i>

58
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>I'm into Amo and Baby.</i>

59
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,454
It's about time I narrow it down,

60
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,373
or I won't get what I came for.

61
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,918
I haven't been talking
to anyone other than Baby.

62
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,879
I don't like it.

63
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,840
I know you don't,
but I don't like that you don't like it.

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,259
Why don't you ask me out more then?

65
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,386
I can always say no.

66
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,557
I can't. It has to be
when it's just the two of us.

67
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,809
Then try to be alone with me.

68
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,146
Finding opportunities is hard.

69
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,983
Okay then,
I'm going to talk to different girls.

70
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,402
No.

71
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,071
- No.
- No, it's not a big deal.

72
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
- You gotta let me.
- No.

73
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,159
No?

74
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,423
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

75
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,467
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,802
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

77
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,306
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

78
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,642
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

79
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,894
THE PURE LOVE IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

80
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,230
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

81
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,315
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

82
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,317
MY LOVE WILL GO ON EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,653
I WON'T WASTE THE LIFE MY PARENTS GAVE ME

84
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,665
- Wanna smoke?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,832
Great, let's have a smoke.

86
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,626
MILK (22)

87
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,003
- Just, like, 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?

88
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm gonna borrow Baby for a bit.
Sorry, we're going.

89
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,967
- See you later!
- We're off.

90
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,468
- Thank you.
- Get outta here.

91
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,388
<i>Of course he's mad.</i>
<i>They had a good thing going.</i>

92
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,064
- You really are my type.
- Hmm?

93
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,148
I knew from the start.

94
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,692
- You're so direct.
- Seriously.

95
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,778
Be honest with me.
You like to stir the pot?

96
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,032
- A wolf in sheep's clothing.
- No, I'm not.

97
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,910
You surprised me.
I thought you were into Oto.

98
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,417
But to be honest, my first instinct…

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,584
Mmm.

100
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,045
- …has been you the whole time.
- Yeah?

101
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,757
- Seriously?
- For real.

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,221
Oh my.

103
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,015
- Wow, he's popular.
- Huh?

104
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,642
- She didn't hesitate, right?
- I know.

105
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,936
They're all impulse, all the time.

106
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
So, what's up?

107
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,319
I thought maybe you liked someone else,

108
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,988
and we wouldn't be having
this kind of conversation.

109
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,950
- You've always been popular. Right?
- Well-liked.

110
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,035
- I bet you have.
- Yeah.

111
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,662
- I sort of knew it.
- Stop lying.

112
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,873
- The way you gazed at me.
- No, no way.

113
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,541
I didn't gaze at you like that.

114
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,169
And I don't remember flirting
or coming on to you.

115
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,421
I mean, I gotta be the best choice,
of all the guys.

116
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,757
- <i>He's checking on them.</i>
- <i>He heard that.</i>

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,385
I opened the door
and saw two guys in biker gang outfits.

118
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,929
I thought, "This will be an easy win."

119
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,185
- Hey, hey, hey…
- What's up?

120
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,896
I'm just happy I finally got some milk.

121
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,440
- Then you came here.
- I got bored, so I'm here.

122
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,775
- I see that.
- Hope it's cool.

123
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,735
- Are they like, "Where's Nisei?"
- Huh?

124
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,237
- Are they wondering where I am?
- Don't talk to me today, man.

125
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,198
You suck for real.
Take off your sunglasses.

126
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,783
No, not yet.

127
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,493
I'll take them off if I cry.

128
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,660
What did I interrupt?

129
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,623
I said I liked her, and she likes me back.

130
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,422
Whatever. He's so annoying
all the time. That's Nisei.

131
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,926
Tenten's better because he does this.

132
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,889
<i>He taught me how to drain my lymph nodes</i>
<i>and make my face less puffy.</i>

133
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,809
Tenten's the best, the total package.

134
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,227
I'm gonna smack Nisei.

135
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,521
Dude's been acting way too cocky.

136
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,441
He was embarrassing himself, for real.

137
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,610
<i>I understand that Baby likes Milk,</i>

138
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,363
<i>and I'm sure</i>
<i>she's seen a different side of him,</i>

139
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,865
<i>but he was straight up</i>
<i>making a fool of himself.</i>

140
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,159
Who would lose to him?

141
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,869
Seriously.

142
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,162
Good luck to him.

143
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,164
He's inconsequential. Yeah.

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,500
- So much animosity.
- Oh wow.

145
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,001
That's a lot of tension.

146
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
- Right? It's getting heated.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,299
- Today marks the halfway point.
- Yep.

148
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:06,843
Halfway there.

149
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,678
There's still
a bunch of cards to write on.

150
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,888
Let's do something big.

151
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,265
TSU-CHAN (30)

152
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,225
Like, we could send them lover letters.

153
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,561
And since there's only one week left,

154
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,356
instead of just half-assing our feelings,
we should make bold moves.

155
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,441
You're right.

156
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,358
I'll write there.

157
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
I'm gonna go,
find somewhere quiet to write mine.

158
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>They spontaneously decided</i>
<i>to write love letters to the girls.</i>

159
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,783
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

160
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,331
<i>Seriously, there's only</i>
<i>one person on my mind.</i>

161
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,667
<i>I want her to see me trying my best.</i>

162
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,086
I want her to think, "Look at Milk."

163
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,255
"He's going all out. That's impressive."

164
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,303
<i>Out of all the women that are here,</i>

165
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,971
<i>she's my favorite.</i>

166
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,806
<i>She's got such a calm presence.</i>

167
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,226
So I want to get to know her
a lot better. For sure.

168
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,353
TENTEN (25)

169
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,273
- <i>Who's Nisei writing to?</i>
- <i>I know, right?</i>

170
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>When we talked about</i>
<i>who we liked, our first impressions,</i>

171
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,695
<i>she said that she thought I was cool.</i>

172
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,782
<i>I think she's so pretty,</i>
<i>so I'm writing one for her.</i>

173
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,453
<i>There's a girl I haven't talked to yet,</i>
<i>but we're the same age.</i>

174
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,914
She's pretty as well,
and I think we'd get along.

175
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
So I'm writing to her too.

176
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,292
- <i>Oh?</i>
- <i>He's writing two?</i>

177
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,169
<i>I mean, I guess that's allowed.</i>

178
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>Oh, a letter to Baby, okay.</i>

179
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,892
<i>- And what about Tsu?</i>
- <i>Who's he writing to?</i>

180
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,394
- <i>It's Kii, as expected.</i>
- <i>It must be Kii.</i>

181
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,405
Do we bring the bonsai?

182
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,866
- There's the bonsai.
- Let's grab it.

183
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,078
- May we come in?
- If you don't mind.

184
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,079
Here we come.

185
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,331
I didn't think
we'd get together in the morning.

186
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,582
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,167
There's a reason for that.

188
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,377
- There is.
- Yeah.

189
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,546
Stop looking so serious like that.

190
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,339
- But it is serious.
- What, why?

191
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,757
- What?
- Super serious.

192
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,094
We let you have some love letters.
They're in your lockers right now.

193
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,388
- You let us have them?
- In the locker.

194
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,139
"Let us have them?"

195
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,308
"We let you have 'em."

196
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,143
- What the hell?
- "Let you have 'em."

197
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,103
That was weird.

198
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,104
They're love letters.

199
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,356
- You're letting us have 'em.
- I'm curious.

200
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,484
So, we want to know your feelings.

201
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,152
So we're sharing ours.

202
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
That's why we decided
to leave you letters.

203
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,366
- Mmm-hmm.
- We wrote them last night.

204
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,076
- Adorable.
- You wrote them?

205
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,744
- We took it seriously.
- You had time?

206
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,248
- It took about four hours.
- Seriously? And you brought them?

207
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,499
We left them in the locker.

208
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,211
If we brought them
and a girl didn't get any, that'd be sad.

209
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,797
So we shoved them into the shoe locker.

210
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,801
How about each girl goes to her locker,
reads her letters, then comes back?

211
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,387
So we want the girls to write letters too.

212
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,180
Give us a circle or an X.

213
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,602
So the girls can put circles
on as many guys as they want, right?

214
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,688
- No Xs and just circles, okay?
- Ah, okay, yeah.

215
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,064
- You got this!
- Mmm.

216
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,649
- We've got this.
- Yeah.

217
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,112
KIICHAN

218
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,947
TEKARIN

219
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,618
OTO-SAN

220
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,299
<i>So, I think this letter is from Milk.</i>

221
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:37,094
<i>I was pretty sure that he would</i>
<i>end up writing a letter to me.</i>

222
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,349
<i>I can't help thinking that</i>
<i>he is just so adorable.</i>

223
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,267
Milk warmed my heart for sure.

224
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,314
<i>I think this is probably Nisei.</i>

225
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,192
<i>I'm super excited</i>
<i>that he wrote to me, for real.</i>

226
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,695
<i>I'm pretty sure it said</i>
<i>that we were the same age.</i>

227
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,782
<i>So it was probably written by Nisei.</i>

228
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>The fact that we're the same age</i>
<i>is a big factor for me.</i>

229
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,538
Mmm, that's something I'm drawn to.

230
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>Mine is from Tenten, probably.</i>

231
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,629
<i>And he filled up the entire page.</i>

232
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,422
<i>He wrote a ton.</i>

233
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,050
<i>I thought the letters were a nice gesture.</i>

234
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,761
I felt like, "Damn, this feels good."

235
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,680
- <i>She felt it.</i>
- <i>Yeah, clearly.</i>

236
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>"Damn, this feels good."</i>

237
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,936
<i>They're probably</i>
<i>from Tackle, Tsu, and Tenten.</i>

238
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,479
- <i>Three people!</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

239
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>I was glad that I got one from Tackle.</i>

240
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,316
<i>I want all of them to fall for me.</i>

241
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,235
<i>Three down, two more to go.</i>

242
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,407
<i>I didn't think there would be any,</i>

243
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,992
<i>but when I checked, there was one letter,</i>

244
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,661
<i>but the writer was a mystery.</i>

245
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:48,165
By process of elimination,
it's got to be Tackle, right?

246
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,670
Yeah. That's what my gut tells me.

247
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,424
It doesn't seem like
his feelings for Kii have changed,

248
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,926
so maybe he's just trying
to change things up.

249
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,264
Either way, I don't think
he's actually all that interested in me.

250
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,558
<i>So I'm like, "Yeah, whatever."</i>

251
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,893
- <i>She's level-headed, you know?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

252
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,854
From a woman's point of view,

253
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,482
they don't mind that the guys
are sending letters to different women?

254
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,610
Is the playboy attitude
a part of their charm, perhaps?

255
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,363
- No, I would hate it. Totally.
- You would hate it, right?

256
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,323
That's why Oto really hates it.

257
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,325
- That kind of tactic.
- That's a tactic.

258
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,244
There are lots of people
who would hate that.

259
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,038
- Right? Mmm.
- Like, "I wasn't special?"

260
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,249
Baby's the type that would notice this.

261
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,085
- Yeah, right.
- This approach has upsides and downsides.

262
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,879
- That's true.
- You have a good point there.

263
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,882
- Are you writing their names?
- I think we can do that.

264
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,718
Would it be good to write
"Dear fill-in-the-blank"?

265
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,512
- "Dear so-and-so"? Yeah.
- And a circle.

266
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,311
TENTEN

267
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,525
NISEI

268
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,740
MILK.

269
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,701
<i>She's had a good relationship</i>
<i>with Milk this whole time.</i>

270
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,457
<i>Look at that.</i>
<i>Clearly she's going for Tenten.</i>

271
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,712
NISEI

272
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,298
<i>A heart. That's badly in love.</i>

273
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,759
- <i>We got one badly in love.</i>
- <i>Badly in love.</i>

274
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,097
Who's gonna get
a lot of circles? Or all Xs?

275
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,475
- No one's getting all Xs.
- That's unlikely.

276
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,394
So, it's possible that
someone gets five letters?

277
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,355
- Yeah.
- No way.

278
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,651
TENTEN

279
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,444
TACKLE

280
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,279
TSU-CHAN

281
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,950
NISEI

282
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,207
- <i>Wow.</i>
- <i>He's popular.</i>

283
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,209
- <i>Five letters for me.</i>
- <i>Amazing.</i>

284
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>I was surprised.</i>

285
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,839
<i>I thought there might be three or four,</i>
<i>but five? Wow.</i>

286
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,174
I feel like my hard work is paying off.

287
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,885
Yeah. I feel like it's my time.

288
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,890
- <i>What about Tenten?</i>
- <i>What's up with Tenten?</i>

289
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,560
<i>- Oh, three letters. Oh, good, good.</i>
- <i>Three letters.</i>

290
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,436
- <i>What about Milk?</i>
- <i>Milk.</i>

291
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,689
<i>Aww.</i>

292
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,525
- <i>He looks disappointed, right?</i>
- <i>He does.</i>

293
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,527
- <i>Whoa.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

294
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,653
For real?

295
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,156
<i>Having zero letters here has got to sting.</i>

296
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,455
- <i>Oh, what's this?</i>
- <i>That's amazing!</i>

297
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,416
- <i>Insane!</i>
- <i>Incredible!</i>

298
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>Huh?</i>

299
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,836
Finally.

300
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,007
Is this for real? Wow.

301
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,508
You gotta be kidding me!

302
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,052
Seriously?

303
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,138
I think I must be dreaming.

304
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,266
<i>Man, I was so moved.</i>

305
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,519
I didn't think I'd get that many.

306
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,064
For real, I thought it might be
one or two, two at most.

307
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,400
Like, "Wait, I guess I do like him."

308
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,288
- Can you believe it? Tsu had five.
- Right?

309
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,040
- What does this mean?
- He's popular.

310
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,583
I didn't know he was that popular.

311
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,002
He looks like some gang boss to me.

312
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,130
Sporting that robe.
He looks older than me there.

313
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,760
- Thirty, right?
- Thirty. Thirty series.

314
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,179
He looks like
he's about to get shot right now.

315
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,263
- Bang…
- Totally!

316
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,223
Like, "Bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang!" You know?

317
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,726
I feel like Tsu's time has finally come.

318
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,686
- He's having his moment.
- Definitely.

319
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,271
And Nisei has five.

320
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,440
- He's still so popular. Right?
- Amazing.

321
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,319
You think he's so popular with the girls
because he's super confident?

322
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
Confident people do get
more attention, don't you think?

323
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,990
You see that with comedians, right?

324
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,909
Some comedians
are faking their confidence.

325
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,827
- I see, okay.
- Definitely.

326
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,537
Tenten had three letters.

327
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,832
He got one from Tekarin,
from Kii, and from Amo.

328
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,585
- Amo is kind of a mystery, like…
- Yeah.

329
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,796
It was surprising
to see who she liked. Right?

330
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,255
Yeah, I was shocked.

331
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,967
- I can't quite tell who Amo likes.
- Same.

332
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,969
She's not like the others.
She's a mystery.

333
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,222
Right? And Milk got one.
Baby gave him one.

334
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,807
These two seem locked in.

335
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,476
- I feel these two are pretty solid.
- You might be right.

336
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,686
And Tackle had zero.

337
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,605
Tackle. Don't you feel bad for him?

338
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,898
I do feel bad.

339
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,192
But feeling bad for him makes it more sad.

340
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,069
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

341
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,029
- He's the most straightforward.
- Right?

342
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,281
- That's a good point.
- For sure. He definitely is.

343
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,369
I hope they have another change of heart
for Tackle's sake, at least, you know?

344
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,708
BADLY IN LOVE

345
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,751
- <i>Today is a date day.</i>
- Huh?

346
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,086
- What?
- All right!

347
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,881
<i>The date that we've prepared</i>
<i>is luxury glamping.</i>

348
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,675
- That sounds amazing.
- Glamping?

349
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,135
Did she say glamping?

350
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,304
<i>The man we've selected for the date is…</i>

351
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,515
<i>the one who hits on girls nonstop.</i>

352
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,225
<i>He's always stirring the pot.</i>

353
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,144
- Hey! It's me!
- He's like, "My turn!"

354
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,187
- It's a little sad.
- Come on.

355
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,648
- That's harsh. So mean.
- It's sad.

356
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,316
- <i>It's Nisei.</i>
- Yes!

357
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,611
- Released from jail! Getting out!
- It's not a jail.

358
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
- The great outdoors!
- Good for you.

359
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,491
- Just get out.
- I'm on a roll now.

360
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,328
<i>Nisei, please choose the girl</i>
<i>you want to go glamping with.</i>

361
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,455
- Nice.
- For sure.

362
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,873
- Smart.
- Who are you choosing?

363
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,625
The PA is totally exaggerating though.

364
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,420
Who's he gonna choose?

365
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,755
Okay, what's he gonna do?

366
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,881
I have no idea.

367
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,635
All right, let's go.

368
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,184
- Baby.
- <i>Oh!</i>

369
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,477
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

370
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,895
<i>It's Baby.</i>

371
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,563
<i>Wow!</i>

372
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,273
Yeah!

373
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,232
Have fun.

374
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,484
You like glamping?

375
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,236
- You said you liked the outdoors.
- I want to do an obstacle course.

376
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,031
<i>To be honest, I thought</i>
<i>if Nisei could invite anyone,</i>

377
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,365
he'd pick Amo.

378
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,619
But surprisingly, he chose me.

379
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,747
I was like, "Really? You sure about that?"

380
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,792
I'm pretty happy about it though.

381
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,752
Well, this is fantastic!

382
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,712
Glamping is fun.

383
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,214
You guys have fun!

384
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,673
Keep up the good work here!

385
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,342
- We will!
- Have fun!

386
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,010
- We'll be waiting.
- We're off!

387
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,929
- Thanks for everything.
- Have fun!

388
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,556
- Thanks for your support.
- Wait, what? Why?

389
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,477
<i>Wow. She was so confident</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

390
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,563
I don't think they'll come back.

391
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,025
I'm gonna go have a smoke alone.

392
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,486
- He's in a mood.
- Come on, cheer up.

393
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,655
I'm a 22 series. I can still fight.

394
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,032
Hey, you good? Should I join you?

395
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,743
- Don't need you.
- Jesus! You could have just said thanks!

396
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,579
Oh, she was mad. What was that?

397
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,540
- What was that shout?
- She was pissed!

398
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,042
"Just say thanks!"

399
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,419
I don't hold hands very often.

400
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,672
Then hold mine. Let's never let go.

401
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,972
- Hey, Nisei.
- Huh?

402
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,099
- What?
- Have a nice time.

403
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,768
- Okay. Sure.
- You came out to tell us that?

404
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,895
- Don't make her sad.
- She'll be fine with me.

405
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
- Have a great time.
- I'd never make her sad.

406
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,358
I'll be waiting for you
when you get back. Get going.

407
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,652
- Good luck, bro. Don't do that.
- Don't touch me.

408
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,113
- Just go. What are you waiting for?
- Back off, man.

409
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,656
- I said, go.
- I'm not playing.

410
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,991
Oh, no!

411
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,576
- Hey, what's going on?
- Sorry.

412
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,327
- Don't throw bags around.
- Enough.

413
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,204
Okay, you good?

414
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,581
- Just go. Leave.
- Seriously, man.

415
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,748
What's with you? Get out.

416
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,792
- It's okay.
- Please go have fun.

417
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
You think that's gonna impress her?

418
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,130
- For real?
- You threw the first punch.

419
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,673
You pushed me.

420
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,469
- Whatever man, just go.
- You have a weak core, seriously.

421
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,721
Have a nice time.

422
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,392
Just go. Go make her happy.

423
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,603
Of course I'll make her happy. Duh.

424
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,191
- Sorry about the bag.
- It's not a problem at all.

425
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,027
- Let's go.
- Okay.

426
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,862
- Great weather today.
- Yeah, it is.

427
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,614
- Right?
- It'll be great.

428
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,407
Thank you.

429
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,411
I should get back.

430
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,041
- Nisei is really stirring things up.
- Yeah.

431
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,834
- He knows what he's doing.
- Mmm.

432
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,421
It felt like Oto was really
hitting on Nisei in the sauna,

433
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,423
- on their last date, you know?
- Mmm.

434
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,759
But then he does that,
which is pretty bold.

435
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,469
- So bold.
- Mmm.

436
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,304
He also has Amo on the table.

437
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,640
And, of course,
Baby said it made her happy.

438
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,599
That's right.

439
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,269
Although it looked like
she had quite a deep bond with Milk.

440
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,148
But Nisei seems like the type
that is always direct with his feelings.

441
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,275
- Yeah, you're right.
- Makes sense.

442
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,277
Nisei might be the type of guy

443
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,573
who can get through <i>Badly in Love</i>
without a single regret.

444
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,617
- He just says what he feels.
- Totally.

445
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,077
He goes around straight up

446
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,371
telling the girls he likes
that he's interested in them.

447
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,288
Totally.

448
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,374
For example, he makes a move on Baby,

449
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,294
and she surprised him by saying,
"I actually liked you right away."

450
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,256
So he thinks,
"Score! I should go for Baby more."

451
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,383
And if Amo and him
get closer in the future…

452
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

453
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,302
…later in the show,
he can make that happen

454
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,096
because he made a move on her earlier.

455
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,305
You have a point.

456
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,432
I don't want to call it "insurance,"
but I mean…

457
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,433
You're right.

458
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,727
So he's the type
to do that to multiple people.

459
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,605
- He has a better chance.
- That's playboy style, man.

460
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,649
- Yeah, it truly is.
- Playboy style.

461
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,859
That way, he has a better chance
at winning, right?

462
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,736
He's good at spreading his love around.

463
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,738
That is so true.

464
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,366
Does this hurt your hand?

465
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,493
- No, it doesn't.
- Really?

466
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,328
- Your hand is big.
- Yeah, it is.

467
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,580
- I have big hands and feet.
- That's good. I like that.

468
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,832
You like big hands?

469
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,042
Yeah, isn't it better? Yeah.

470
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,504
<i>They're already holding hands.</i>

471
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,011
Amazing!

472
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,305
- Wow, so cool!
- Right?

473
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,889
- Oh, erotic.
- Amazing.

474
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,183
Look at this.

475
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,977
Check out the view first.

476
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,812
It's pretty.

477
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,106
The mountains look great.

478
00:21:56,189 --> 00:22:00,277
If you had two choices for a date,
would you pick mountains or ocean?

479
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,528
I guess the mountains.

480
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,946
- Mountains?
- Yeah.

481
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,699
- Seriously? Oh.
- At night though, the ocean.

482
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,993
You wouldn't go to the mountains at night.

483
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,162
Yeah, you're right.

484
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,956
<i>He even held my hand.</i>

485
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,501
He held it like a boyfriend.

486
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,213
<i>I don't have a lot of experience</i>
<i>holding hands, to be honest.</i>

487
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,924
It made my heart race. Mmm.

488
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,302
Okay, cheers.

489
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,554
Cheers.

490
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,393
Mmm. Ah…

491
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,313
- Can I tell you something super creepy?
- For sure.

492
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,940
- I had two dreams about you.
- <i>Whoa.</i>

493
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,858
<i>Oh wow.</i>

494
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,402
I thought,
"Why is Nisei in my dreams so much?"

495
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,363
- Hmm.
- <i>His eyes are serious.</i>

496
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,822
<i>Look at that stare.</i>

497
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,616
I wanna know more about you.

498
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,159
Yeah, we should talk.

499
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,787
But I'll probably talk a lot.
There's a lot to share.

500
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,246
I wanna listen.

501
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,458
Okay, so, to put it simply,

502
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,628
ever since I was young,
as far back as I can remember,

503
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,047
- my family had a lot of debt.
- Mmm.

504
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,883
There were loan sharks,
like in <i>Ushijima the Loan Shark.</i>

505
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,593
- Lone sharks, yeah.
- Always at the house.

506
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,594
Hmm.

507
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,888
And I would run to the car
in the parking lot

508
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,141
and get inside and cover my ears
so I wouldn't hear them.

509
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,062
And I would get held up at knifepoint.
It was a regular thing.

510
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:17,979
Hmm.

511
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,232
- So, of course, I didn't like going home.
- Mmm-hmm.

512
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,402
And then one day,
I came home, and there was a puppy.

513
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,319
Oh.

514
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,695
Two to three months old.

515
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,658
And at the time, I was at a point where
I wasn't feeling any emotions at all.

516
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,452
I was just sort of numb all the time,

517
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,622
but whenever I'd come home,
the puppy would wag its tail.

518
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,290
- So excited to see me.
- Mmm-hmm.

519
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,585
The puppy was the only one
that seemed happy to see me.

520
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,882
So to me, it was like the first
and only family member I truly had.

521
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,050
Mmm-hmm.

522
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,637
That's what it felt like, at least.

523
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,852
That dog has always
been with me and still is.

524
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,438
- Oh, right.
- Mmm.

525
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,815
Just a second. What else?

526
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,819
So I'd take the puppy with me
every time I ran away.

527
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,530
- We'd go together. We were inseparable.
- Mmm-hmm.

528
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,574
- We went everywhere together.
- Mmm-hmm.

529
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,119
I have so many memories
with my dog. Thanks.

530
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,289
Yeah, so growing up like that,

531
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,709
I never felt like I was loved.

532
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,420
So I don't always trust
that people love me.

533
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,716
If I get a boyfriend, I struggle to say
"I love you" or "I feel lonely."

534
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,633
Mmm-hmm.

535
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,012
I'm bad at putting that stuff into words.

536
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,309
I even tell him, "Go out and party
if you want, no worries," you know?

537
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,395
But if he actually goes,
I'm all up in my head.

538
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,648
- Oh, yeah, I get it.
- Like, "What's he doing at the party?"

539
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,941
Or, "Is he coming home?"

540
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,653
Or, "I wish I could have told him
that I didn't want him to go."

541
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,781
- I just talk to my dog all night.
- Mmm-hmm.

542
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,869
Yeah, so in general,
when I have someone I care about,

543
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,539
I want him to be happy, of course,

544
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,251
but I also have a hard time
telling him that myself, you know?

545
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,379
When was your last boyfriend?

546
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,590
- Like, three years ago.
- Oh, damn.

547
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,468
Since then, it's all been
work, work, work all the time.

548
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,137
- Work, dog, work, dog?
- Yeah, basically.

549
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,640
I want to be pampered, for sure,

550
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,351
but in my past relationships,

551
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,938
I've always ended up
being the one to take care of them.

552
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,898
- Mmm-hmm.
- Like, I always take the lead.

553
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:29,152
You know, I've always pampered them
and gave them the space to be vulnerable.

554
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,238
- Mmm-hmm.
- Boyfriends, at least.

555
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,197
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,076
So, from that perspective,
I guess, I kind of feel like…

557
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,664
I don't know, with Milk, it'll end up
being like my old relationships.

558
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,415
That's how I feel right now.

559
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,917
- Oh!
- Oh my.

560
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,418
He's nice, but…

561
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,547
She thinks she'll end up
taking care of him.

562
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,966
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,634
But, you know, in your case,

564
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,136
I kinda like
all of your pointless chatting.

565
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,429
Mmm-hmm.

566
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,056
That's why, deep down,

567
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,809
I'm secretly laughing like crazy
when we talk.

568
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,768
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,479
So, at the moment, I feel like I can…

570
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,149
probably open up

571
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,569
and lean on you a little.

572
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,486
Mmm-hmm.

573
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,822
Seriously?

574
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,532
- Look, it's starting.
- Right?

575
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,785
- It's officially started for sure.
- Yeah.

576
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,997
<i>I mean, I assumed she had a crazy past,</i>

577
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,124
<i>but I'm glad I got to hear about it.</i>

578
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,625
The past is the past,

579
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,461
but she has to carry it all the time.

580
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,006
And if we date,
I know I have to carry it with her.

581
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,091
Growing up, she didn't feel loved,

582
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,220
so maybe I can be the one
to do that for her.

583
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,266
What do you talk about
when you're with Baby?

584
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,809
Nothing special.

585
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,936
Just regular stuff.

586
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,896
- Like you and I are talking right now.
- Ah.

587
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,983
So, like, you ask her
about herself and stuff?

588
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,985
Yeah, but she hasn't shared

589
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,695
- anything too personal yet.
- Oh.

590
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,488
<i>We haven't really had the chance.</i>

591
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,616
<i>We talked about the past</i>
<i>when we were in the sauna,</i>

592
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,243
<i>- but it was mostly surface stuff.</i>
- <i>Oh.</i>

593
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,329
Baby has been talking about you.

594
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,582
You know, she's got
a pretty messed-up past.

595
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,417
Yeah, what did she say?

596
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,712
So, of course, you're younger than her,

597
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,883
and there's a part of her that worries
about burdening you with her past

598
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,135
and putting all of that on you.

599
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,555
She said it'd be nice if you showed her

600
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,807
that you could make her feel pampered.

601
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,185
She let that slip the other day.

602
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,770
Okay.

603
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,356
So just pamper her a bit, you know?

604
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,108
I mean, age doesn't matter.

605
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,735
No, it doesn't, seriously.

606
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,321
I'm definitely ready for her
to open up as much as she wants.

607
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,322
Yeah.

608
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,116
But the vibe is off
when we talk, like, "Hmm?"

609
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,076
Oh, really?

610
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,953
- You just suck at saying what you feel.
- Oh, shut up.

611
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,081
Yeah, I think that's it.

612
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,001
- <i>Bullseye.</i>
- <i>Everyone's so blunt.</i>

613
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,045
I mean, I don't know.

614
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:57,384
When I talk to you, I never felt like
we didn't understand each other,

615
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,510
know what I mean?

616
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,428
Yeah, you're like,
"Oh, that's how you feel."

617
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,472
Totally. I feel like I get it.

618
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,391
But you like her, right?

619
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,226
- Do I like her?
- Yeah.

620
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,521
Right now, I like her the most,
and I want to get to know her.

621
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,647
Okay.

622
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,608
Yeah, that's where I'm at.

623
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,736
He seems to be pretty aware

624
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,823
that his conversations with Baby
haven't been going too well.

625
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,075
- He is. That surprised me.
- He said that.

626
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,159
That's not good.

627
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,162
Conversations need to have
an organic flow,

628
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,039
or you don't stand much of a chance.

629
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,584
- Ah, you think so?
- It's always about finding balance.

630
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,961
- To make love work.
- Ah, right.

631
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,754
- There he goes.
- He did it again.

632
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,757
- So much wisdom, from reclining Buddha…
- The reclining Buddha.

633
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,718
- …to organic balance.
- And organic balance.

634
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,137
But Oto gave Milk some great advice

635
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,307
about letting Baby
be pampered by him, right?

636
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,892
That was great advice.

637
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,978
My past…

638
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,189
- isn't too tragic or dramatic.
- Mmm-hmm.

639
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,317
We were well off. Grew up in a nice house.

640
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,235
Mmm-hmm.

641
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,447
Dad was a CEO. I had good parents.

642
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,951
And then, in middle school,
I started to think that Yankii,

643
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,788
you know, being that kind of rule breaker,

644
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,081
I thought it was cool.

645
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,875
But I love my mother,

646
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,711
my mom, so much.

647
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,880
- I really do.
- Mmm-hmm.

648
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,424
I have a soft spot
when it comes to my mom.

649
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,760
- I'm about to cry.
- Mmm-hmm.

650
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,887
- She's a stay-at-home mom.
- Mmm-hmm.

651
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,472
And she's such a good person.

652
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,142
But she'd get calls from school,
"Nisei punched someone,"

653
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,394
or "He broke some glass and cut himself."

654
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,979
"He's at the hospital."

655
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,023
Or, "He messed up a teacher's car."

656
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,484
And then they'd have
to go to school and apologize.

657
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,818
- That makes sense.
- Right?

658
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,695
She was probably there more often than me.

659
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,613
Mmm.

660
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,532
- So many meetings.
- Mmm-hmm.

661
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,075
That's how it was.

662
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,912
Then one day, I saw her crying.

663
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,954
Hmm.

664
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,956
- Your mom?
- Mmm.

665
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,171
She was on the stairs.

666
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,383
I remember it so clearly.

667
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,554
I get flashbacks
of her just crying about it all.

668
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,140
Seeing that just hurt.

669
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:14,854
You know? It definitely got to me.
It hit me so hard in that moment.

670
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,064
Mmm-hmm.

671
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,650
I didn't want to cause her more trouble.

672
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,361
I had to stop
messing around, skipping school,

673
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,571
and my grades were shit, but…

674
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,200
- I liked to box.
- Hmm.

675
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,661
- That was it. I had to work hard.
- Mmm-hmm.

676
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,580
- Boxing was the only thing I had.
- Mmm-hmm.

677
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,250
I'd still play some pachinko sometimes

678
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,044
and ride around on my bike, you know?

679
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,840
Somehow, that part of me
that loved boxing never wavered.

680
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,467
- I never ever skipped practice.
- Mmm-hmm.

681
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,887
I was raised
by people around me, at the gym.

682
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,309
- I'm really grateful for them.
- You should be.

683
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,144
I was raised by very mature people.

684
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,063
- Yeah, sounds like it.
- Mmm.

685
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,278
<i>Nisei was getting tears</i>
<i>in his eyes, and I kinda did too.</i>

686
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,031
When someone is a good listener,
when I talk about something deep,

687
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,993
I tend to get emotional
and start crying pretty easily.

688
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,788
I thought, "Wow, he had
such a moving story to tell."

689
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,499
My impression of him changed completely.

690
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,919
Here we go.

691
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,213
Come a little closer.

692
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,048
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>Hey, look at him go.</i>

693
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,758
<i>He's good at stuff like this.</i>

694
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,096
Keep it going. Let's use it up.

695
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,931
Here we go. Yeah.

696
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,642
Oh, I closed my eyes.

697
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,354
It won't come out.

698
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:40,690
Cute.

699
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,319
This one is giving me all the feels.
Am I saying that right?

700
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,697
Oh, for sure.
I get the feels from these photos.

701
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,490
- Nice.
- <i>They're cute.</i>

702
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,534
- <i>Nice, wow. Adorable.</i>
- <i>So cute.</i>

703
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,995
<i>She got some great pictures</i>
<i>with a handsome guy.</i>

704
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,996
Both look great.

705
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,041
You know how you casually put your arm
around someone for a photo?

706
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,500
- Have you ever done that?
- Never.

707
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,295
- You mean you've never done that?
- I have smelled someone though.

708
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,380
Took a big whiff during a photo.

709
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,300
I was posing like this
for a photo of me and this model.

710
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,510
- No way.
- She asked for the photo, by the way.

711
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,387
I stood like this and took a big sniff.

712
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,849
- Her whole body?
- Her entire body, yeah.

713
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,185
- You were trying to snort her?
- To snort he all up, yeah.

714
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,312
I'm still hanging on to that smell.

715
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,230
Also, about Nisei's past.

716
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,399
- He was tearing up a little…
- Mmm-hmm.

717
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,194
…when he talked about
making his mother cry.

718
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,029
But I get that, I've been there.

719
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,281
- So you've had that experience?
- I have, yeah.

720
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,366
I imagined you might.

721
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,742
I mean, when my mom was crying,

722
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,953
she was usually
screaming and hitting me too.

723
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,081
So at the time,
I didn't really care if my mom cried.

724
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,249
But my old man was incredible, honestly.

725
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,752
He was so carefree
and had such a pure heart.

726
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,753
He did?

727
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:46,547
He never got mad at me,
not that I can remember.

728
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,050
But one time, when I did something bad,

729
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,844
and I was going to be sent
to Juvenile Training School,

730
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,972
at the trial,
I saw him cry for the first time.

731
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,182
That sounds hard.

732
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,725
Usually, he was like,

733
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,978
"Your mom is always mad at you.
Don't stress it."

734
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,897
But at the trial,
he started sobbing all of a sudden.

735
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,233
- That's tough. That would sting.
- It shook me.

736
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,276
That's when I knew it was bad.

737
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,696
- You were like, "What have I done?"
- That's tough.

738
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,322
I regretted what I did. You know?

739
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,199
That's what Nisei was going through.

740
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,701
He felt the same way, right?

741
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,997
And Baby was really pouring her heart out
about the hardships she's been through.

742
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,832
Being able to tell him stuff like that

743
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,959
must mean they became
pretty close, you think?

744
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,627
Yeah, that's right. I think they did.

745
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,463
She told him about it even though
she wasn't originally planning to.

746
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,799
She was able
to let her guard down a little.

747
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,968
I mean, her guard is all the way down now.

748
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,012
- Way down, yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

749
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,435
- <i>Oto looks like she's…</i>
- <i>Is she all right?</i>

750
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,186
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

751
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,479
<i>I don't know</i>

752
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:48,860
<i>how far Baby went today</i>
<i>with her one-on-one date,</i>

753
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,903
<i>glamping with Nisei.</i>

754
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,407
I'm left to wonder what they're like
when they're together.

755
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,701
And if I'm honest,

756
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,537
I think that I might have been…

757
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,165
a little jealous, yeah.

758
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,305
<i>I thought I'd go for a smoke,</i>
<i>but once I was alone,</i>

759
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,183
<i>I couldn't stop thinking</i>
<i>about what Yuria was doing.</i>

760
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,771
<i>And, you know, I just</i>
<i>started spiraling, mentally.</i>

761
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,274
I mean, I couldn't help it.

762
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,568
One bad thing after another.

763
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,989
I wonder how far they went.

764
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,746
- <i>Oh. Oh my. Look at that.</i>
- <i>Oh my.</i>

765
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,581
<i>- What?</i>
- <i>They're sharing a bath?</i>

766
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
Come on in.

767
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,377
- This is awkward.
- It feels super nice.

768
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,837
It's so tiny!

769
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,090
The tub looks super small.

770
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,883
Think of it as a love-seat tub.

771
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,176
Yeah, okay.

772
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,720
Wow, it's so nice.

773
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,725
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

774
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,851
<i>Oh wow.</i>

775
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,896
- <i>A tiny bathtub is kinda risqué.</i>
- <i>Right?</i>

776
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,232
Wow, totally relaxing.

777
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,403
You want to come closer?

778
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,948
You don't have to sit there on the edge.

779
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,075
There's too much distance.

780
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,327
It would be weird
if we got that close so quickly.

781
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,578
I wouldn't mind.

782
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,165
He's the kind of guy that just says
what he thinks, no hesitation.

783
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,333
- I'm envious.
- Me too.

784
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,293
I bet that's why
guys like him are so popular.

785
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,962
If he took a split second to say it,

786
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,463
- it'd be sleazy.
- Ah!

787
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,549
But when he says it impulsively,
it's not as weird.

788
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,550
- Of course.
- I see!

789
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,427
- I should keep this in mind.
- I see. A good approach.

790
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,887
Don't wait, just say it.

791
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,515
- Try to keep it in mind.
- Ah, so that's the key.

792
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,103
What?

793
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,109
Do you take baths
together with your girlfriend?

794
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,694
- I do.
- Oh.

795
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,696
- At home?
- At home.

796
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:01,242
When we share the tub, she washes off,
and then she's in the tub and I wash.

797
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,410
I see.

798
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,619
So, yeah, basically.

799
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,455
Well, this is great.
I wish we could stay overnight.

800
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,791
- Overnight together?
- Yeah.

801
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,586
Milk would go insane if that happened.

802
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,921
It's hot!

803
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,133
Hot.

804
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,927
What?

805
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,223
Just checking out your body.

806
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,767
- I used to be bulkier, for real.
- Yeah?

807
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,561
I weighed more back then.

808
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,062
I was like ten kilos heavier.

809
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

810
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,857
- Was it all muscle?
- Yeah.

811
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,693
- My arms were like this big.
- Wow.

812
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,487
- I've lost too much muscle.
- But now it's just the right amount.

813
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,490
I mean, maybe, but I was trying
to bulk up to look good.

814
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,450
Mmm.

815
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,663
<i>We were naked together, you know?</i>

816
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,957
<i>And naturally, I was nervous.</i>

817
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,793
<i>He was in good shape, pretty muscular.</i>

818
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,462
<i>It looked manly.</i>

819
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,715
<i>I thought he looked so good</i>
<i>with his shirt off.</i>

820
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,718
<i>My heart totally skipped a beat</i>
<i>over everything he did.</i>

821
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,220
<i>Oh, boy, listen to her.</i>

822
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,014
<i>I thought, "This is</i>
<i>what it means to be infatuated."</i>

823
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,267
"To feel butterflies in my stomach."
My heart skipped a beat for sure.

824
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,602
<i>She likes him already.</i>

825
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,897
You know, Milk hadn't done
anything too manly

826
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,316
that might make my heart skip a beat,

827
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,985
not since the sauna, at least.

828
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,655
Mmm.

829
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,159
To be honest, I felt way more butterflies
hanging out with Nisei, for sure.

830
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,118
<i>Wow.</i>

831
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,623
I do feel my heart leaning a certain way,
if I'm being completely honest.

832
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,710
This is the one who got mad
and threw the water, right?

833
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,878
That's right.

834
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,673
Now she's the one soaked in water.

835
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,049
- For real.
- Yeah.

836
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,260
That smile says she likes water.

837
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,304
You know, the one who said,
"Not the damn water."

838
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,598
She's in it up to her shoulders now.

839
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,850
Look how big that smile is.

840
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,185
Oh my gosh, she loves it.

841
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,271
- She overcame her dislike of water.
- Absolutely.

842
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,189
Today was the day.

843
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,109
How is Milk doing?
It must be a shock for him.

844
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,569
I mean, he's been into Baby
since the beginning.

845
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,321
Of course, yes.

846
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,616
He had a shy, anxious vibe,
and at first, she liked it.

847
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,285
- Baby did.
- Yeah. Mmm.

848
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,619
But then, after a while,

849
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,329
- things shifted for her.
- Right?

850
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,081
Milk, let's talk.

851
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,666
Okay.

852
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,210
- It's so dark.
- <i>Huh?</i>

853
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,088
<i>She must have asked Milk</i>
<i>for a chat after she got back.</i>

854
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,214
Good evening.

855
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,301
- So formal.
- Of course.

856
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,469
- You don't have to be.
- It's been a while.

857
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,766
How was your day today?

858
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,645
- Since we didn't get to talk.
- Hmm…

859
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,564
I mean…

860
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,192
I kind of screwed up earlier.

861
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,155
- Screwed up?
- Yeah.

862
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,198
I shouldn't have
picked that fight with Nisei.

863
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,491
Ah, yeah.

864
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,493
But I was glad you came to say goodbye.

865
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:54,123
Yeah, at first, I meant to find you
and just tell you to go have fun.

866
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,833
And then he got up in my face.

867
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,168
So, Nisei started it?

868
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,628
Well, both of us started
yelling at each other.

869
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,588
You did, yeah.

870
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,174
I thought the way I behaved was pathetic.

871
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,552
- It was hard for me, you leaving.
- Mmm-hmm.

872
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,847
I was waiting for you to make a move.

873
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,015
If you remember,

874
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,726
I mentioned that,
with the guys I've dated before,

875
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,145
- the gender roles always got reversed.
- Mmm.

876
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,649
A partner should always
be there for the other person,

877
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,818
like a source of comfort, right?

878
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,196
That's what a boyfriend
or a girlfriend should be.

879
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,865
But I couldn't be honest
with previous boyfriends,

880
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,826
like, "I feel lonely,"
or "I don't want you to go,"

881
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,288
or, like, telling them, "I love you."

882
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,250
I was never able to fully open up
in past relationships.

883
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,337
- I was suppressing my feelings.
- You suppressed your feelings.

884
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,963
They would dump their feelings on me.

885
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,716
My boyfriends
were constantly dependent on me.

886
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,261
And I felt like I couldn't vent
my own feelings to them.

887
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,389
So I feel torn right now.

888
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:58,479
I mean, you keep choosing me
and I kind of like you too,

889
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,773
but I'm not sure

890
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:05,403
if I like you as a potential partner
or I just like you as a person.

891
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,198
I never felt very loved growing up,
so it's hard to tell the difference.

892
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,283
And I don't know how to love either.

893
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,619
Mmm-hmm.

894
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,332
I feel like the one that
I can be honest with and lean on,

895
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,501
the one that I can vent to, is Nisei.

896
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,921
That's how I felt at least
after talking to him today.

897
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,756
- <i>Hmm.</i>
- <i>Oh.</i>

898
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,258
Yeah.

899
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,968
<i>That's gotta be tough.</i>

900
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,804
I shared this with Nisei too.

901
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,097
Because of that,

902
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm leaning more towards Nisei,
but I don't know for sure.

903
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,145
For now, you're near
the top of my list, of course,

904
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,479
but Nisei is a puzzle.

905
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,480
Mmm.

906
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,649
Trying to sort out his feelings as well.

907
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,943
I get it.

908
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:55,453
<i>I mean, I honestly thought</i>
<i>I should pursue Milk, up to this point.</i>

909
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,663
And then today happened.

910
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,169
But I still have some feelings
for Milk, you know?

911
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,336
Even after today.

912
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,504
<i>Oh!</i>

913
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:09,383
I'm not quite sure what I feel.

914
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,635
I like guys who have eyes only for me.

915
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,053
<i>Oh, nice. There we go.</i>

916
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,346
But I wonder

917
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,808
if that's just because my emotions
are all mixed up right now.

918
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,519
It might just be compassion.

919
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,272
That might be
what I'm actually feeling for Milk.

920
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,774
I'm kinda wondering
if this isn't really love.

921
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,402
I'm having a hard time sorting it out.

922
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,405
Before talking to Milk,

923
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,992
she was saying that she was
completely leaning towards Nisei, right?

924
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
She was, yeah.

925
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,371
It feels like
she's still playing it a little bit coy

926
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,415
with her feelings about Milk.

927
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,209
Oh, so that's what that is?

928
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,921
Right? I think that Baby is the type
that puts a high value on love.

929
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:47,922
- For sure.
- Naturally.

930
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,049
So if there's a guy that loves her deeply,

931
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,176
a part of her
doesn't want to let go of that.

932
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,469
Oh, I see.

933
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,929
And I think she's being honest

934
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,724
about not knowing which one of them
is the true object of her affection.

935
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,976
You're so wise. You see everything.

936
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,853
- No, no, no, no. No way.
- Really.

937
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,815
He's like the Akihiro Miwa of hip-hop.

938
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,943
This must be how Miwa is like.

939
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,195
- Although I've never met him.
- Right? That is so true.

940
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,072
- Miwa of the hip-hop world?
- You are.

941
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,324
- You guys are crazy.
- Wow, amazing.

942
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,201
- Well, top tier for sure.
- Yeah.

943
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,495
But Baby does see how Nisei is popular

944
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,705
and how he's been
going after other girls too.

945
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,415
- That's true.
- She does.

946
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,378
Also, I was really glad to hear Baby say
that she likes someone who's faithful.

947
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,587
She did say that.

948
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,674
- I was so happy to hear her say that.
- Mmm.

949
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,134
Nisei and Baby are not a done deal.

950
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,012
We don't know yet
because Milk is so faithful.

951
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,890
I'm so glad we got to talk today.

952
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,352
But I also don't want to tie you down.

953
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,479
- You're not tying me down.
- Not at all.

954
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,731
I still feel free to do what I want.

955
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,024
And that's good to hear.

956
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:56,949
In my opinion, I'm just happy
to hear that you care about me.

957
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,993
Not opinion. It's just how I feel.

958
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,497
- Thank you so much for making time for me.
- All good.

959
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,624
- I feel good right now.
- Really?

960
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,085
- I'm glad we were able to check in.
- Thank you.

961
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,296
- Good night.
- Okay, have a good night.

962
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,006
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

963
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,351
I feel like it could all fall apart.

964
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,231
She said she wanted
to be pampered by this 22 series

965
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,067
but thinks I'm the one
who wants to be pampered

966
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,486
<i>and thinks we're not on the same page.</i>

967
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,031
<i>Like, "That's not what I meant."</i>

968
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,408
I'm feeling a bit off, to be honest.

969
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,078
<i>I feel like considering</i>
<i>other options as well.</i>

970
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,204
- <i>Ah!</i>
- <i>Oh?</i>

971
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,832
- But he was so faithful to Baby.
- Right?

972
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,376
So, he wants to be pampered, huh?

973
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,503
I wonder what'll happen now.

974
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,421
- Right?
- Yeah.

975
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,382
- If he starts looking elsewhere?
- I didn't see this coming.

976
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,386
- They're totally unpredictable now.
- I have no idea what's gonna happen now.
