1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,299
- That's how I think about it.
- Mmm.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,469
Okay. I'm not gonna cry anymore.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,930
- So please just let me hold your hand.
- Okay.

4
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,743
- <i>Yikes. Scary!</i>
- <i>And she's gone.</i>

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,870
I went over to check in with them
real quick,

6
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,289
and she was bawling her eyes out.

7
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,708
I figured it wasn't a good time
to join them.

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,169
You shouldn't have showed up
in the first place.

9
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,130
- Right? Yeah.
- Why even go there?

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,425
Even if Oto is making a move on Nisei,

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,178
it shouldn't stop me, and

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,723
me making a move on him
shouldn't keep her from trying either.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,476
In the end, it's his choice.

14
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,812
So, no matter how strong Oto is
pursuing him, it won't affect what I do.

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,647
And vice versa, Oto shouldn't

16
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,316
hold back because of me,

17
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,442
obviously.

18
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,042
What should I do?

19
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,960
- Hmm?
- What should I do?

20
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,755
- What should you do? It's hard to say.
- I mean,

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,591
I just don't know what to think right now.

22
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,676
If I don't have a chance, just tell me.

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,637
- It's fine.
- Hmm.

24
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,308
But…

25
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,436
I just know I'm not at all ready
to give up on you.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,198
She yanked the curtain open,
then left without saying a word.

27
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,700
- At the beginning of this moment.
- That's kind of creepy, right?

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,661
- That was scary. Right there!
- Yeah, this part.

29
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,121
You're not a fan of Amo, right?

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,374
I mean, if I imagine myself
as a 51-year-old man, absolutely.

31
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,835
- She pisses you off?
- She pisses me off, yes.

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,588
Yeah, I think I'd be pissed…

33
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,382
- You'd be mad?
- …if my son brought her home.

34
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,467
- You think so? I see, okay.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,803
I'd be like, "Who the hell are you?" Yeah.

36
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,478
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

37
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,522
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

38
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,858
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

39
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,361
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

40
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,697
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,949
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

42
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,285
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

43
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,370
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

44
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,372
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

45
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,708
I WON'T WASTE THE LIFE
MY PARENTS GAVE ME

46
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,349
<i>Today, please go back to Cafe Chocolate</i>

47
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,101
<i>and continue painting the walls.</i>

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
Off we go to Cafe Chocolate.

49
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,274
- I wish I could stay outside.
- Let's do the walls.

50
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,068
Are you gonna start
painting that wall first?

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,737
Sure! We can do that.

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,113
We'll get started.

53
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,907
- Let's get to it.
- Let's get started.

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,036
The wall is not all that bumpy,
so it just needs a little sanding.

55
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,622
We paint the edges first,
then use the roller, right?

56
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>She's a professional.</i>

57
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,334
- <i>Oh, right, right.</i>
<i>- She paints for a living.</i>

58
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,086
- <i>Yeah, very cool!</i>
- <i>Pretty amazing, right?</i>

59
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,464
<i>Oh, oh, that's how you take that off.</i>

60
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,888
Amazing. Big thanks!

61
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,523
SHO TSUDA "TACKLE" BONSAI CULTURIST

62
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,359
I was thinking of taping up there.

63
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,902
Maybe it's fine without?

64
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,570
Just eyeball it with a brush.

65
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,572
Like a straight line up to the edge?

66
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,450
So, you're saying
we need to be too careful with the prep?

67
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:03,952
Mmm-hmm.

68
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,917
You know, I wanted to tape that edge

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,627
to get a clean line.

70
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,338
I judged her, as a professional.

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,924
I was shocked that she didn't know
the term "color adjustment,"

72
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,259
even though she's a painter.

73
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,760
You know, blending colors.

74
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,263
She said she's like a manager,

75
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,889
and that she does design work.

76
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,976
I asked,
"Hey, Can I do a color adjustment?"

77
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,644
"What's that?" she said.

78
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,020
I didn't say anything.

79
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,108
It's complicated. I'm still not
a full-fledged carpenter myself, either.

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,859
Hmm…

81
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,152
It's tough, you know?

82
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,698
Right now, Tsukahara's the only one
I can trust.

83
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,615
I love that guy.

84
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,118
- First time in a while.
- A banana?

85
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,246
It suits you well.
"Hey, chimp, what's up with you?"

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,958
That's a gorilla.

87
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,254
When I ask him for advice,
he says, "How should I know?"

88
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,006
or "What the hell?" And that's it.

89
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,841
It helps me clear my head.

90
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,051
I tell him,
"This is how things went down."

91
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,095
"Thoughts?" And he's like,

92
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,431
"None of my business," or "Like I care."

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,392
Makes me feel like working harder,
for sure.

94
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,352
Tsukahara gives me strength.

95
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,317
- I'm not good at this.
- No, you're doing great.

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,485
Okay, use this rolling brush.

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,279
- Okay.
- More paint, got it.

98
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,823
- Here ya go.
- <i>They're so nice to the kids.</i>

99
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,533
Gentle, gentle, there you go.

100
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,368
I was worried, you know.

101
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,455
- About what?
- Depending on who was on the team,

102
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,416
I thought we might not finish the prep
and second coat today.

103
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,459
That's true.

104
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,711
Yeah. But I'm happy with our team.

105
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,507
- Isn't this the same color as the wall?
- It is!

106
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,509
I mean, it's a pretty stylish color.

107
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,802
Sure… stylish.

108
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,388
She hesitated.

109
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,017
Sorry, I'm just gonna pull this
outta here.

110
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,268
- Huh?
- What?

111
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,896
- I wrote letters to everyone,
- Really?

112
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,190
- Oh, wow.
- That's awesome!

113
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,108
- Hey, thanks!
- Seriously?

114
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

115
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,779
Thanks so much,
we'll take them back with us.

116
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,198
- Bye-bye.
- I think Tekarin will be happy.

117
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,992
Yeah. Thanks. I'll make sure she gets it.

118
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,161
- Whassup, crew!
- Welcome back!

119
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,246
The workers have returned.

120
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,624
- "Whassup, crew!"
- "Whassup, crew!"

121
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,045
- She's so funny. "Whassup, crew!"
- Yeah. He's got great energy.

122
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,339
We got letters from the kids.

123
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,634
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- For Tekarin and "Tete."

124
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,760
"Tete"?

125
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,513
- Not "Tenten," but "Tete"? That's so cute!
- Looks like I'm "Tete" now.

126
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,183
"Thanks for hanging out
with Mei-Mei and me today.

127
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,060
Come back again anytime.

128
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,521
It was so much fun hanging out with you.

129
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,147
Hurry up and get a girlfriend."

130
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,775
- Whoa, hold up a sec!
- She's told you, didn't she?

131
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,070
- This is so hilarious. I love it!
- She's schooling you.

132
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,196
"To Tekarin.

133
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,491
Thanks for hanging out
with Mei-Mei and me today.

134
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,368
Come back again sometime.

135
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,579
I love you.
I'll never forget you, Tekarin.

136
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,416
I made lifelong memories
hanging out with you.

137
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,084
Thank you for reading my letter."

138
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,713
- "I love you." Isn't that cute?
- Wow! She's the sweetest!

139
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,798
So awesome.

140
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,467
I had no idea she could
express herself like that.

141
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,177
She's incredibly sweet!

142
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,275
- Good morning.
- Hey, man.

143
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,818
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

144
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,154
- Hey there. What's up?
- Good morning!

145
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,448
Scooch over?

146
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,658
Oh, sorry.

147
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,951
Mind if I sit here?

148
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,080
- Come here, sit by me.
- Then Tackle will be alone.

149
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,748
I'll feel bad for him.

150
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,876
- Come here.
- But if I move, Tackle will be alone.

151
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>Oh! Look at Oto.</i>

152
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,221
<i>We have four days until confession day.</i>

153
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,473
Four days left?

154
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,933
<i>To help you with your romantic endeavors,</i>

155
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>a </i>yakatabune <i>has been arranged for you.</i>

156
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,521
- That's awesome!
- Yeah!

157
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,064
- I felt like going out.
- Amazing!

158
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,191
A cruise!

159
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,567
- What's a <i>yakatabune?</i>
- Let's go!

160
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,694
It's a boat that you can eat a meal on.

161
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,446
- What do you mean?
- Nevermind.

162
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,781
- We'll be on a boat? All right!
- Yeah.

163
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,119
NEVER BEND, NEVER SURRENDER

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>Everyone's looking good. Yeah.</i>

165
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,613
- Looking good! Okay. Okay.
- Beautiful!

166
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,448
- Take my hand.
- Amazing!

167
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,826
- If you don't mind.
- Thank you so much.

168
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,246
- Ten out of ten!
- Oh, yeah. Nice!

169
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,166
- Looking good!
- So classy!

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,168
- I love that look!
- Oh, yeah!

171
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,379
- Nice, nice! It's summery!
- Classy, classy.

172
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,297
- You look cute!
- All right. Look at you.

173
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,799
- You look great.
- Awesome!

174
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,176
- Like a big sister.
- So classy!

175
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,594
Cute.

176
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,722
- Oh, look at her!
- Here she comes!

177
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,558
- Hey! That's nice.
- Super cute!

178
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,892
Adorable!

179
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,811
- Amazing! Really cute!
- Very cute!

180
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,145
Looks good, right?

181
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,355
Let's see the back.

182
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,941
- Okay!
- Super cute.

183
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,192
Looks great.

184
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,069
Looks like she could be
on a <i>hanafuda </i>card.

185
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,154
- That's super flashy.
- A <i>gyaru </i>is here!

186
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,532
- Whoa, amazing!
- She looks great!

187
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,910
- Awesome!
- It looks great on you!

188
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,870
- A total <i>gyaru.</i>
- Looks heavy.

189
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
Wow. Never done this before.

190
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,843
- Wow. That is so crazy cool.
- Hello there.

191
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,637
- Watch your step.
- Welcome aboard!

192
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,939
- Oh!
- Wow!

193
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,734
- What? This is amazing!
- This is so cool!

194
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,527
- There's sashimi!
- Wow!

195
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,321
- This is the best!
- Isn't this amazing?

196
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,530
- Sashimi!
- Looks great!

197
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,033
- Sashimi!
- Awesome! Amazing!

198
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,534
Come on, let's sit down.

199
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,411
- This is fantastic.
- I wanna sit by the window.

200
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,205
- Who's gonna sit where?
- Guys sit in-between.

201
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,208
And we put our feet underneath
the table, right?

202
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,669
Oh, nice. A space for our legs.

203
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,504
I wanna eat sashmi.

204
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,757
- Right?
- It does look pretty good.

205
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,217
- Been a while since we ate raw fish.
- Can I sit here?

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,970
- Nowhere to sit?
- You were looking at me.

207
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,930
- It was you. You were glaring at me.
- Look at that.

208
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,683
- So much pink.
- Right?

209
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,352
Who's gonna start?

210
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,980
I made a conscious decision
to sit down at…

211
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,568
the table in a spot where Nisei
couldn't quite see me

212
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,530
I sat in the same row as him
but further away.

213
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,158
I know that he doesn't…

214
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,953
have any romantic feelings for me,
so it made sense.

215
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,082
- She's a little <i>menhera, </i>huh?
- Ah!

216
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,042
- Yeah.
- Is that what's going on?

217
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,919
- Yeah, she seems <i>menhera.</i>
- I see. Interesting.

218
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>She said the reason</i>
<i>she sat for far from Nisei</i>

219
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,967
was because she didn't want him
to have a clear view of her.

220
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,138
But it feels more like she didn't
want to watch him flirt with other girls.

221
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,557
- You know?
- She came on quite strong before.

222
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,310
So maybe she thinks he'll notice her
if she eases up a bit.

223
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,647
- Ah, so strategy.
- That could be what she's doing here.

224
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,400
Could be,
but she might be trying to do too much.

225
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,027
- Yeah, she may be over-strategizing.
- She's doing a lot.

226
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,489
Honesty is the best policy when it comes
to love, right?

227
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,241
- It's obvious watching this.
- Yeah.

228
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,077
But if you're the one in the situation,
you can lose sight of that.

229
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,247
They put on some nicer clothes
so maybe they'll feel some sparks.

230
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,249
- <i>It's possible.</i>
<i>- It's such a great shot.</i>

231
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,834
<i>- It's downright terrifying.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

232
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,502
<i>I'd freak out if I saw them on the street.</i>

233
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>It's great. Very summery.</i>

234
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,339
I'd call the cops on them.

235
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,883
I'd be like, "Get here right away,
it's scary."

236
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,760
- Are they really?
- Yeah.

237
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,096
- Your first time?
- On a <i>yakatabune?</i>

238
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,224
- It's nice, huh?
- Oh!

239
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,600
You got a glass?

240
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,935
- I've got a glass.
- Me too.

241
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,186
Is this non-alcoholic?

242
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,189
- Nice, huh? Let's go to the roof later.
- Sure.

243
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,234
- Huh?
- When the boat stops.

244
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,153
Oh, right. They said we'd stop.

245
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,822
Lead us in a toast, Milk.

246
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,824
- Okay, I'll do the honors.
- Yay!

247
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,243
- Go for it, Milk Boy.
- How many days left?

248
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,912
- Getting close to the climax.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

249
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,623
"Getting to the climax", I love it.

250
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,667
Tsu's so much fun.

251
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,669
Cheers!

252
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,212
Cheers!

253
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,089
- Okay, nice.
- Why do we say "cheers"?

254
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,008
- I don't know.
- Clink my glass.

255
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,137
- So good.
- This is awesome.

256
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,680
So good.

257
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,557
- Nice, I love it.
- They look good?

258
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,435
- Really? They look good?
- They look great on you, man.

259
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,479
Pass me that, please.

260
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,522
- I love shrimp.
- Have some squid too.

261
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,857
- Yeah.
- You kidding?

262
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,193
I'm super strong. I was a champ.

263
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,986
Wait. The champ of what?

264
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,447
- My entire prefect.
- There's no such thing.

265
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,865
This is low on calories too.

266
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,787
- <i>Wow, it's beautiful.</i>
<i>- Amazing.</i>

267
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,538
<i>Tokyo Bay is so nice.</i>

268
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,334
What's this?

269
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,503
- It's a wet towel.
- Oh, right.

270
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,422
- You didn't know?
- Right, it's a wet towel.

271
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,426
- What one of these should I start with?
- What?

272
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,054
- Pass me one of that.
- Maybe a salad or something.

273
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,680
- Finally.
- I know.

274
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,974
Oto, pass me the soy sauce, girl.

275
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,146
He keeps trying to talk to her.
He just won't give up.

276
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,066
Yeah, but their conversation
doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

277
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,567
It isn't. You're right.

278
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,693
That much?

279
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,029
- You look like a snow woman.
- An old woman?

280
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,949
- Come on. You're joking.
- She made me do that.

281
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,617
- Wow.
- Down I go.

282
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,371
- He got up!
- Does he feel weak

283
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,373
- when he sits down?
- No, it's okay.

284
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,250
- I'm serious.
- No way.

285
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
- Wait, why?
- It's totally fine.

286
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,925
This is nice.

287
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,385
It's so relaxing.

288
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,719
Do you like the ocean?

289
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,471
I really like the ocean at night.

290
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,974
I'd go with my dog.

291
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,308
Whenever I felt tired.

292
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,019
You walk your dog at night?

293
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,272
Yeah.

294
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,860
I wonder if there are any sharks.

295
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,945
Sure there are. Little ones.

296
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,780
Just the little ones? Yeah, I guess so.

297
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
- Like sturgeons.
- Hmm.

298
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,825
You know?

299
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,875
My conversations are fun
with the other girls,

300
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,794
but when I'm talking with Yuria…

301
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,007
it's like, not all that fun.

302
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm not dissing her.

303
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,969
We're just incompatible.

304
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,807
I've been thinking about her a lot,
and that's why it's so tough.

305
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,060
When she said, "Are there any sharks,"

306
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,520
I was like, "I dunno."

307
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,356
I was at a loss.

308
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,817
I feel so pathetic.

309
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,112
I wish someone would just
beat some sense into me.

310
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,363
<i>I don't understand what that means.</i>

311
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,698
<i>That's a bit extreme.</i>

312
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,908
I'm tired.

313
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,037
Wow.

314
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,663
Milk is so down.

315
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,290
He's probably feeling a little desperate.

316
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,250
Yeah, his language got more formal.

317
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
- He even said, "We're incompatible."
- Yeah.

318
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
Isn't that something you'd say
about someone you don't like?

319
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,130
Yeah, it is.

320
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,758
- It's a bit of "love-dodging".
- Ah! It's love-dodging.

321
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,009
Is that what it is?

322
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,179
He's like,
"If Baby's not interested in me, then…"

323
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,514
Maybe that's why he's feeling so cynical.

324
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,767
- That's what it is.
- Yeah, but he likes her, right?

325
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
He probably does.
All he talks about is Baby.

326
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,145
Right, right, right…

327
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,314
- Yeah, that was funny.
- Excuse me.

328
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,191
- What's up?
- Yeah.

329
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,317
Too strong.

330
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,320
- <i>Ah! Look!</i>
- <i>He gave her a pat on the head.</i>

331
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,404
<i>She's happy now.</i>

332
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>Stuff like that</i>
<i>makes him seem a little sleezy.</i>

333
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>- Seriously.</i>
- You wanted to get Nisei drunk, right?

334
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,996
- No, I just poured the beers. Wasn't me.
- I don't get drunk.

335
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,998
'Cause you always throw up.

336
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,250
- So you can't get drunk.
- Yeah, that's why.

337
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,211
- I'm getting drunk. Rooftop!
- He's doing it.

338
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,715
- That's crazy.
- Hilarious.

339
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,217
That's so good.

340
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,220
- He's going to rehab right now.
- Rehab?

341
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,680
- He going to a rehab center.
- A rehab program?

342
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,181
- I'm good.
- You are?

343
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,642
Oh! It's beautiful.

344
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,310
What's it like?

345
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,983
- This is great.
- Yeah, it's crazy beautiful.

346
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,901
- We can't sit here?
- It's gorgeous.

347
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,236
Feels good, huh?

348
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,990
This is great.

349
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,283
Do I look beautiful?

350
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,910
- You always do.
- I know.

351
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,498
Sorry. My bad.

352
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,127
- That'll be good.
- Think so?

353
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,753
Everything except my hair.

354
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,714
That's true.

355
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,465
Everything except my hair
is gonna look great.

356
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,634
The location's great, vibe is great.

357
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,178
- Did you see the face she made?
- I saw it.

358
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>When she squinted her eyes</i>
<i>to take the photo,</i>

359
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,641
I thought she looked
just like you, Nagano.

360
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,144
- We do have similar features.
- Very similar.

361
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,437
- It was self-loathing.
- Right!

362
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,440
- Self-loathing?
- We use the same tricks.

363
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,984
- We win people over with a smile.
- Exactly.

364
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,403
And we both have that lifeless look
in our eyes.

365
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,031
- That's what bugged you about her.
- That's why I didn't like her.

366
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,158
I saw me. I can see myself in Amo.

367
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,035
- That makes total sense.
- No kidding.

368
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,996
It's not Amo.
It's that you don't like yourself.

369
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,622
- This is being recorded, right?
- That part of you.

370
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm on a mic right now
saying how much I hate myself.

371
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,462
- You've been doing that this whole time.
- So nice of you to listen to me.

372
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,590
- It's me I don't like. Sorry, Amo.
- That's right.

373
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,841
- Poor guy.
- Yeah.

374
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,760
Say cheese!

375
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,680
- Nice.
- That'll definitely be great.

376
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,016
- It'll be so so good.
- Yeah. We look cool.

377
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,854
Nisei and Amo kind of look like a couple.

378
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,942
Cut it out. I'll start crying.

379
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,861
You should crash their party.

380
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,238
- No, it's fine.
- You should go.

381
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,865
Raid their conversation.

382
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>"Raid their conversation."</i>

383
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,494
- I don't wanna let them have it.
- Why not?

384
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,121
- Smash that convo to pieces!
- You wanna do that?

385
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,414
I don't wanna get in their way.

386
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,249
But that's what this world is all about.

387
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,376
What does he mean? In what world?

388
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,671
- What world?
- "What this world is all about."

389
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,132
Ah!

390
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,725
- You're the only one I talked to today.
- That's good.

391
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,019
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

392
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,729
That's way better.

393
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,232
- I like that.
- And what about you?

394
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm gonna go talk.

395
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,027
- What other girls?!
- Of course. I mean,

396
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,279
there's some things I still need to say.

397
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,365
I've gotta say things like, "I'm sorry."

398
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,076
"I'm sorry"?

399
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,995
What do you mean, I'm sorry?
Sorry about what?

400
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,498
I'm just still gonna talk to people.

401
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,795
Oh, well, if that's what you're doing,
then I can do the same, right?

402
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,339
Sure, totally fine.
Talk to other guys if you want.

403
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,718
It's fine. I can't get mad if you do that.

404
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,721
- Mmm.
- Go ahead and talk to them.

405
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,766
- What's with that face?
- Playing it cool.

406
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,393
- Playing cool?
- Yeah.

407
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,271
Okay.

408
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,108
<i>I think he's still trying</i>
<i>to figure out who likes him.</i>

409
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,235
I feel like, "You still don't know?"

410
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,280
I mean, we only have three days left.

411
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,158
But somehow, he still can't figure it out.

412
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,952
If he's gonna keep that up
all the way to the end, I mean,

413
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,371
I don't think I need him anymore.

414
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,998
It's like, "What do I mean to him?"

415
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,960
Kind of like, "That's the extent
of your feelings for me?"

416
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,588
<i>Wow, interesting.</i>

417
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,677
- Wanna go, up top?
- I want another drink.

418
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,637
- We can go have a smoke up there.
- Let's go up top.

419
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,973
- I have some cigarettes. I'll bring them.
- Let's go for a smoke.

420
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,017
Baby, let's go to the roof.

421
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,310
<i>This guy!</i>

422
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,312
<i>He asked her to go up right away.</i>

423
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,313
<i>He's aggressive.</i>

424
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,190
No, I wanna talk to Taku first.

425
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,525
<i>She's got the heart sunglasses on now.</i>

426
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,611
<i>Those glasses are all she's got.</i>

427
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,533
How are you feeling?

428
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,620
Is Milk good for you?

429
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,372
No.

430
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,045
What is it?

431
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,174
You're the one I've been wanting
to talk to the most.

432
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,802
And, I've been waiting for a moment
to ask you what was on your mind.

433
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,431
But I just never found the right time.

434
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,433
We went on our date,

435
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,186
and when we got back,
you talked to Milk, right?

436
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,230
- Right.
- I thought you liked me more,

437
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,856
and that you just saw him as

438
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,275
sort of a young kid
that you might have known at school.

439
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,486
And I thought you were
gonna tell him that.

440
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,364
But I did tell him that
when I talked to him.

441
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,493
You know, to be honest,
when it comes to that kind of stuff,

442
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,329
Milk has always been straight with me.

443
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,999
So, I thought I'd be straight with him
and share my true feelings.

444
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,794
- Mmm.
- So, I was completely honest with him.

445
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,504
- Oh, you were?
- Mmm-hmm.

446
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,590
It's complicated, huh?

447
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,803
Is now a bad time?

448
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,972
Kind of. We were having
a deep conversation.

449
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,350
- About what?
- About all this back and forth.

450
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,269
- That's not deep.
- Like what the boat is doing.

451
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,312
- Is that deep?
- You feel it?

452
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,939
- The boat?
- The boat, of course.

453
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,440
- I'm gonna go talk to Oto.
- I'll be right here.

454
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,610
Hmm.

455
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,323
That fan, you've been holding it
this whole time.

456
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,034
- But you never use it.
- I guess I don't need it then.

457
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,413
- Your core's weak.
- The wind's not even blowing.

458
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,832
- No, it's not weak.
- Oh, you want a sumo match?

459
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,126
Yeah, perhaps I would.

460
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,962
Would you be kind enough to not laugh?
I could do it.

461
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,964
Let's just do sumo with hands.

462
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,301
We're doing hand push sumo
on the roof of a <i>yakatabune?</i>

463
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,720
Just asking.

464
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,139
There's that laugh. We'd be the first.

465
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,017
- Hell yeah!
- Let's go.

466
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,896
- <i>She's smiling a lot more now.</i>
- <i>Looks like she's having fun.</i>

467
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,024
Oh!

468
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,235
- Ha!
- I win.

469
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,029
You win what?

470
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,989
- You're playing dumb?
- <i>Tsu looks happy.</i>

471
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,491
- You're playing dumb. Yeah.
- What do you mean?

472
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,410
This is the kind of stuff I wanted to do.

473
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

474
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,371
That's why you're called Baby.
You're just a kid.

475
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,248
- No, I'm not.
- You can't hide it anymore.

476
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,375
You can't hide it.

477
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,794
That's the one thing you can't hide.

478
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,133
- It's like, if there's not forever,
- Yeah?

479
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,386
then why do people feel the need
to make a choice?

480
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,389
Plenty of people I know
get married and stuff, but

481
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,186
they're constantly around each other,
so they end up cheating with other people.

482
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,312
Right, right.

483
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,858
If that's the case, then maybe it's better
not to make a lifelong commitment.

484
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,486
Right. That makes sense, given your past.

485
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,488
- Right.
- If you start to overthink things

486
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,448
or it's too serious, there's no momentum.

487
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,077
Exactly. If relationships
can stay fun like this, then

488
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,620
there's no need to be like,

489
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,622
- "We're boyfriend and girlfriend."
- Why go through all that trouble?

490
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,874
- Why not stop at the fun part, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

491
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,794
That way, there'd be no dramatic endings.

492
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,922
And there'd be no weird expectations.
No one gets hurt.

493
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,966
But sometimes you don't truly know someone
till you date them.

494
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,427
- Mmm.
- There are deeper things to uncover.

495
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,346
- That's true.
- I mean, then

496
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,306
you see the good and the bad.

497
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,558
- Mmm.
- Of course you'll see all the good stuff,

498
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,936
but, you'll get to know their flaws too.

499
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,107
It'd be hard,
and you'll have a lot to think about.

500
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,442
Yeah!

501
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,735
He was great.

502
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,029
When we're all together as a group,

503
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,365
he's kind of like the life of the party,

504
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,449
upbeat.

505
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,453
But then, when we talk one-on-one
it seems like

506
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,123
he is a lot more perceptive.

507
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,959
He suddenly becomes this great listener.

508
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,754
And he's great
at keeping the conversation going.

509
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,298
Deep down, he's actually got a big heart.

510
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,052
And he has what it takes
to be the man in a relationship.

511
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,221
I think he's pretty great, honestly.

512
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,057
- <i>That was another turn of events.</i>
- <i>Oh, my!</i>

513
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,184
She's got such a cute side to her.

514
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,896
I guess what I mean is,
she knows what she thinks, and wants.

515
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,773
That's my type.

516
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,026
Our pasts aren't quite the same,
but they're close.

517
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,362
<i>And her face is cute, too, of course.</i>

518
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,448
I think it's amazing

519
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,616
how she always finds a way
to speak her mind.

520
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,410
I respect that about her.

521
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,162
If we were to, I mean…

522
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,665
date, I imagine that, in the future,

523
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,544
I could be devoted to just her,

524
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,670
I think.

525
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,369
Yeah, I wasn't expecting this at all.

526
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,288
I thought I was done here,

527
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,207
that there was no one here for me.

528
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,541
<i>Oh, that's where he was at.</i>

529
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,670
- But are you more the type to go all in?
- Yeah, I am.

530
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,671
That's great to know.

531
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,591
- Full throttle, you know?
- I think that's awesome.

532
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,510
What do you mean by "full throttle"?

533
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,013
- It means being loyal.
- Of course.

534
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,265
"Full throttle" has to mean 'loyalty'.

535
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,392
That's the only way.

536
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,727
You're a great girl.

537
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,022
- Clap, clap, clap, clap.
- That deserves applause.

538
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:24,981
Of course.

539
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,948
- That was…
- So that's where we're at now.

540
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,824
- A new romance.
- I did not see that coming, at all.

541
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,201
Love is in the air.

542
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,412
Whether or not we think of Tsu
as a legitimate romantic interest,

543
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,082
I think he's got
great communication skills.

544
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,543
- He does. And listens well.
- You're right.

545
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,420
<i>And the song that played during</i>
<i>that montage of their sweet moment</i>

546
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,465
<i>was performed by our very own AK-69.</i>

547
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,926
The song is titled, "And I Love You So."

548
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,554
This will surprise you,
but when Baby was growing up

549
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,305
in the children's home,

550
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,849
she would sit in her room,
with no natural light,

551
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,269
- and listen to AK's music.
- No way!

552
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,020
- She loves your music.
- Really?

553
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,190
- It's true. She loves it… Yeah!
- I knew there was a reason I liked her.

554
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,149
Right?

555
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,653
For sure. She would turn to AK-69's music
for emotional support.

556
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,530
- That's exactly right, yeah.
- That's nice.

557
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,950
<i>When Baby was talking to Tsu,</i>
<i>we've never seen her smile like that</i>

558
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,702
<i>- Yeah! Cackling!</i>
<i>- You know?</i>

559
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,412
<i>- She almost cried, she laughed so hard.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

560
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,414
At this point, it feels like

561
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,959
if Baby were to choose
to go with someone else,

562
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,379
Tsu seems like the one best suited
to accept her for who she is.

563
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,382
- Oh! Right. That's what it feels like.
- Don't you think it seems that way?

564
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,926
It seems like
there's not much Tsu could do

565
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,928
- Mmm.
- to upset Baby.

566
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,307
I don't know if she'd never be upset, but…

567
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,436
So now, that means that Baby
has three guys that are interested in her.

568
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,396
She's super popular…

569
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,732
What's going to happen, I wonder.

570
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,901
Just when we thought it was only
going to be Milk vs Nisei,

571
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,903
- And now there's Tsu, right?
- Tsu's in there.

572
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,989
But, Tsu has been supporting Milk.

573
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,451
So Milk may be totally fine
with Baby ending up with Tsu.

574
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,995
Geez. How cool would that be
if she ends up with Tsu?

575
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,580
- Right?
- Yeah.

576
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,249
- He's a hit with both guys and girls.
- That's so true.

577
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,796
He's cool with everyone, so ultimately
he wins in the end. That's awesome.

578
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,382
- It's amazing to realize that.
- Didn't he go?

579
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,719
- Oh, Tenten is back!
- It's Tenten. It's him.

580
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,888
- Welcome back, Tenten!
- Tenten's here.

581
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,890
He wants to go for a smoke,
with you, right?

582
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,517
What, me? The boys always pick me last.

583
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,811
- Time to go! I think he did.
- He meant me?

584
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,105
- He's got his sights on you!
- Do all the boys love me now?

585
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,523
Tell him you're reluctant to go.

586
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,735
I didn't wanna go, but I thought,
"Guess I've got no choice."

587
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,320
I want to ask you something.

588
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,738
- Ask me?
- Yeah.

589
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,116
So, Milk, why are you in here? What's up?

590
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,160
I lost my drive.

591
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,870
Because you talked with Baby?

592
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,622
- I won't go into detail.
- It's a secret?

593
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,706
- Can I share where I'm at?
- It's a secret.

594
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,291
- I want to stay devoted.
- Ah, I see.

595
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,086
You want to stay devoted?
So, you two are similar.

596
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,879
- Isn't that where you're at?
- Yeah, for sure.

597
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,130
- I thought so.
- I get it.

598
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,424
We're both probably too devoted.

599
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,134
That's why you can both talk about it.

600
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,679
- Yeah, of course. That's exactly why.
- Yeah, she totally gets it.

601
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,516
Do you feel like you came here
to find love or,

602
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,725
get married?

603
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,687
- And maybe have kids? Which one?
- Mmm-hmm.

604
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,940
I wouldn't date someone who
doesn't want to get married someday.

605
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,067
But I'm not looking
to get married right away.

606
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,027
- So you're here for romance?
- Yeah, that's what I'm here for.

607
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,028
You're here for love.

608
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,613
- Hmm…
- That's cool, right?

609
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,281
- That's great.
- I feel like it's fine.

610
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,076
- It's great.
- You're here to find that spark, yeah?

611
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,494
I feel them already.

612
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,083
- Yeah, I'm the exact opposite of you.
- It's been a great week.

613
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,377
- Well, yeah.
- You're more serious?

614
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,379
- I think I'm way too serious. Maybe.
- Really?

615
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,297
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
- I get that.

616
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,258
- Love is hard, know what I mean?
- Definitely.

617
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,052
Hmm. But isn't it more fun when it's hard?

618
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,264
- I get that.
- If it was like, "That was easy, got him."

619
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,099
That'd be boring, you know?

620
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,563
It's better when you have
little uphill battles

621
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,940
you have to overcome,
to get what you want.

622
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,025
- Yeah, it sounds great.
- "Earning it" isn't quite the right word,

623
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,110
but…

624
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,737
- You know what I mean? Yeah.
- I get it.

625
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,989
- You gotta look at the long term.
- Mmm-hmm.

626
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,534
What's up? Did I upset you yesterday?

627
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,871
Huh? I mean, not a lot, but sort of.

628
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,166
- What is it?
- We've been hanging out a lot.

629
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,876
- Mmm.
- But…

630
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,587
- and this is just something I heard…
- Hmm?

631
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,464
that you were trying to fill the void

632
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,132
- Mmm.
- left by the last guy.

633
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,801
- "Fill the void" is a bad way to put it.
- And you're using me, is what I heard.

634
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,470
- I don't like the way you said that.
- Really?

635
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,512
"Fill the void" isn't good.

636
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,722
What?

637
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,765
What's happening?

638
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,808
All of a sudden.
Who did he hear that from?

639
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,227
- Who would say that?
- What?

640
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,397
I wanna go to the roof.

641
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,986
- Were you shocked?
- I wouldn't say shocked, but

642
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,113
- you know, the way they said it,
- Hmm?

643
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,990
that I was filling a void for you…

644
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,658
They took it back, of course.

645
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,453
- But in the end, that's all I heard.
- Right.

646
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,621
Like, "What?!"

647
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,498
- It made you a jerk.
- That would make me the worst.

648
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,458
Yeah, I thought, "well that sucks."

649
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,876
But if that was the case,

650
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,086
- I want you to be direct with me.
- Right.

651
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,839
- So, I'm not mad about it or anything,
- Mmm.

652
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,965
just a little sad.

653
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,345
Honestly, I was trying really hard
to forget about him.

654
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,684
Part of me feels
I shouldn't force myself to forget.

655
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,394
But now I feel like I have to.

656
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,438
The more you try to forget,
the harder it is.

657
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,899
<i>Yeah, honestly, that's how I feel.</i>

658
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,736
I do think you're great.

659
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,279
That is the absolute truth.

660
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,616
- I'm not trying to fill a void at all.
- You're not?

661
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,992
That's really good to hear.

662
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,582
- You're so kind.
- I'm kind?

663
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,001
Like, I don't know. When I'm with you,

664
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,629
I honestly feel like
I've never met anyone as kind as you.

665
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:40,880
- You think that?
- Mmm.

666
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,967
If you decided to stay on the show,
I'd be the

667
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,885
- reason you would stay?
- Mmm.

668
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,264
- Well then, I'd want to hang out more.
- Okay.

669
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,314
- You're such a hottie.
- Outta nowhere.

670
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,024
- What a hottie.
- That's nice of you.

671
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,150
You know,

672
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,947
I told them that I'm staying on the show
because I want to fall in love with you.

673
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,824
- Really?
- There's no one else but you.

674
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,826
- Really?
- I told you that in the sauna, didn't I?

675
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,995
I said "I like you a lot."

676
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,415
I wasn't sure
what you meant by, "I like you a lot."

677
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,583
Really?

678
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,669
So I should've said, "I love you, Tenten!"
Would that have been better?

679
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,796
Yeah, that would have been super clear.

680
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,047
- That's embarrassing.
- That would be better.

681
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,757
I'd probably jump overboard
if I said that.

682
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,260
- Yeah? Into the water?
- Like, "Ahhh!"

683
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,555
It's like, I could be my authentic self.

684
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,390
And even when something happens,

685
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,977
he's the kind of person
I can talk to about anything.

686
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,605
It reminded me that
we can go deep with our talks.

687
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,149
And I thought that was so great.

688
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,110
It seems like
they got closer all of a sudden

689
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,904
after they told each other
what was on their minds.

690
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,363
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

691
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,823
- Yeah, looks like it.
- That's great.

692
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,410
Tenten was a little jealous, right?
He was like, "So, I'm just a fill in?

693
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,912
- He was jealous?
- Right?

694
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,705
He's changed a lot since the beginning.

695
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,206
Showing his human side.

696
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,210
So, do you think Tekarin
is finally over Yanbo now?

697
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,963
- It seems that way, after watching that.
- She's over him?

698
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,466
<i>Well, she told Tenten,</i>
<i>"I'd like to date you.</i>

699
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,260
<i>I'm staying for you.</i>
<i>I want to fall in love."</i>

700
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,304
- That's good. She's moved on.
- I mean, I don't

701
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,932
think she's completely over Yanboh, but,

702
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,893
- she's ready to move on.
- I think so.

703
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,103
Oh? Don't make me laugh.

704
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,940
- Okay, let's go.
- You look like a Ginza club owner.

705
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,735
Let's talk, when you're done with that.

706
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,111
- Chaos, you know?
- For sure.

707
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,905
I don't know if I should have another one.

708
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,949
- Okay?
- This is delicious.

709
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,075
Where were you?

710
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,040
How's it going?

711
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,667
Nothing's going.

712
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,669
Nothing at all.

713
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,170
Nothing?

714
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,507
- Well, I've got something.
- Oh, yeah?

715
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
I mean…

716
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,015
you know,

717
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,520
right now, the only person
who's said they love me is you.

718
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,273
But if I'm unable
to love you back, by the end of this,

719
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,818
I think that would be terrible.

720
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,868
I agree.

721
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,997
- Hmm?
- I understand. Your feelings are clear.

722
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,958
I understand it's impossible.

723
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,589
I already know that at this point,

724
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,091
I don't have a chance.

725
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:40,601
Do you want me to try to leave you alone?

726
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,312
Or not get in the way?
Is that what you want?

727
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,480
- Hmm.
- Or maybe

728
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,315
you haven't thought about that yet.

729
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,193
I like you, so,

730
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,405
just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

731
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,450
Hmm. I don't think I'd ask you
to stay away from me.

732
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,535
It's impossible to avoid each other.

733
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,453
Mmm-hmm.

734
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,830
There's no one else
I want to hang out with.

735
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,999
There's no one I want to go on dates with.

736
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,959
But if you asked someone else on a date,

737
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,961
you might find
something you like about them.

738
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,296
- Mmm.
- You never know.

739
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,924
And then after that,

740
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,344
if you still think you like me,

741
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,555
then I'd want you to ask me out.
I'd like that.

742
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,395
I won't give up on you.

743
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,154
I understand.

744
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,910
Even after all of this is over,
and we all go our separate ways in life,

745
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,203
I feel like…

746
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,749
one day, you might have a change of heart,

747
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,127
and develop feelings for me.
I still have hope.

748
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,755
So, I think I'll want to keep

749
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,799
fighting for you and not give up.

750
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,636
Maybe that will motivate me

751
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,971
to work even harder at my job.

752
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,515
To be honest, I don't know.

753
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm glad that

754
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,271
I was

755
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,107
able to fall in love

756
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,274
with someone.

757
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,151
I don't want to give up on that.

758
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:15,905
So, yeah.

759
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,077
I said I wouldn't cry, but I did anyway.

760
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,662
It's okay to cry.

761
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,705
You can't avoid it.

762
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,878
I get it. Thank you.

763
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,296
I'm not gonna give up.

764
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,722
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

765
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,321
You're being kinda sweet right now.

766
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,407
- <i>What?!</i>
- <i>Whoa!</i>

767
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,200
I just can't give up.

768
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,084
I really like you.

769
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,671
What's going on?

770
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,007
- Oto!
- She's gone wild.

771
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,676
- She's getting so wild.
- Seriously?!
