KIICHAN - BABY - OTO-SAN - TEKARIN - AMO

NISEI - YANG BOSS - TSU-CHAN

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,682
<i>Huh?</i>

5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>Wait, what's wrong?</i>

6
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,978
<i>Maybe she just got overwhelmed</i>
<i>writing that.</i>

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>Oh, okay, I see.</i>

8
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>She's probably going</i>
<i>through a lot of emotions.</i>

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,487
<i>The Boss has a special place in my heart.</i>

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,696
<i>He's still on my mind.</i>

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:18,369
Like, sometimes other people here
will invite me to do something with them.

12
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,413
And I'll think to myself,

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,917
"I wish Boss was the one who was asking me
to do something with him."

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,377
That's when I realized,
I'm still not over him.

15
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,129
- <i>Wow, really?</i>
- <i>So loyal.</i>

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,548
I liked your personality a lot, seriously.

17
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,176
Well…

18
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,345
- me neither.
- Mmm.

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,138
You're the cheer squad leader now.

20
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,015
You're kidding, right?

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,935
- Really?
- Here.

22
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,394
It's a good luck charm.

23
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,312
Mmm.

24
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,564
That's truly all I can do.

25
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,441
Goodbye.

26
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,111
- I'll miss you.
- Mmm.

27
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,403
I'll miss you.

28
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,364
I'm so sad.

29
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>They were torn apart</i>

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,912
<i>right as things were starting</i>
<i>to get going between them.</i>

31
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,498
- <i>That's true.</i>
- <i>That's gotta sting for her.</i>

32
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,917
1-3-6

33
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,680
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

34
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,723
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

35
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,059
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,563
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

37
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,898
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,151
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

39
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,486
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,572
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

41
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,574
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

42
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,909
I WON'T WASTE THE LIFE
MY PARENTS GAVE ME

43
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,587
<i>Are you actually here</i>
<i>to fall in love, Nisei?</i>

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,504
<i>Hmm?</i>

45
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,047
Are you really here to fall in love?

46
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,674
I have a lotta reasons for being here.

47
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,801
- Mmm, of course, I understand that.
- But…

48
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,760
NISEI (27)

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,304
…when I'm in a relationship…

50
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,263
Mmm.

51
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,932
- …I like distance between us.
- Mmm. Mmm.

52
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,058
You know? You?

53
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,811
It depends on how far that distance is.

54
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,814
But if I confess here,
and get a girlfriend,

55
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,692
we're definitely gonna be long-distance.

56
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,651
Mmm.

57
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,196
You all live in Kanto.

58
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,072
- I'm in Kansai.
- Mmm.

59
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,325
- And I work in Kansai as well, right?
- Mmm.

60
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,285
We'd definitely be far away.

61
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,661
- Mmm.
- Right?

62
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,080
But you'd come to Yokohama,
you said you'll go there.

63
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,123
I'll go every week.

64
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,460
- Well, you know that's--
- Well, then that's okay.

65
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,296
So let's just say that the two of us
started dating after the show.

66
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,589
- <i>Oh, my!</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

67
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,216
- It'd be long-distance.
- Yeah.

68
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,052
Even if you came
and saw me three times a week,

69
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,888
I would still be worried
because you would be so far away.

70
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,264
There's nothing to worry about.

71
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,309
But aren't you the type of guy
that would make a girl worry?

72
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,021
All girls look like gravel
to me except for the one that I'm with.

73
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,773
Gravel?

74
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,941
CREATOR & PRODUCER - MEGUMI

75
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,860
I don't really think
that's a good thing either.

76
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,279
- Yeah, that's not exactly right either.
- Mmm-hmm.

77
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,614
I'm exaggerating.

78
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,116
But I'm only ever attracted
to the girl I'm into.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,078
- When I fall, I fall hard.
- That's unexpected.

80
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,915
Mmm, do you want me to just go all in?

81
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,750
<i>Look at the way he's looking at her.</i>

82
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,586
- <i>He's gazing at her.</i>
- I'll be straightforward then.

83
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,297
Yeah, but only
if you actually feel that way.

84
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,008
After you're done talking
to the other girls here.

85
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,637
- Tekarin.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
- Let's chat.
- Sure thing.

87
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,099
Let's go.

88
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,352
I think you might've gotten
the wrong impression of me.

89
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,354
- Why's that?
- Well, I'm a host, right?

90
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,272
TENTEN (25)

91
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:38,569
So I think it's possible that you view me
through the lens of being a host.

92
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,947
So maybe you're wondering

93
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,700
if I'm really here
to actually find love with someone.

94
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,784
- Oh.
- You know?

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,745
- I don't think that. Mmm-mmm.
- No? That's good.

96
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,540
- I thought that maybe I wasn't your type.
- Really?

97
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,251
I think you have the prettiest face
of all the girls here.

98
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,836
- Don't lie to me.
- I mean it.

99
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,546
- Don't, seriously.
- I'd be crazy to lie!

100
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,840
- No, you've definitely gotta be lying.
- I'd be crazy!

101
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,842
- Scary.
- I'm serious!

102
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
I've already said that.

103
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,887
- When?
- With the other guys.

104
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,180
- About my face?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,432
- Oh, my God.
- It's true.

106
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,891
- You're kinda off.
- Somehow…

107
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,892
Why my face?

108
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,770
Because I think
that I'm the ugliest girl here

109
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,980
by a long shot.

110
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,774
Well, your faces
are all different, firstly.

111
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,276
Yeah, that's true.

112
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,737
But I like your kind of face
better than theirs.

113
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>Well, I'd be happy</i>
<i>if someone said that to me.</i>

114
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,991
Legit.

115
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,908
<i>"Legit."</i>

116
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,369
<i>She sounds like a commanding lord.</i>
<i>"I'll allow it."</i>

117
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,788
<i>I was happy when he said</i>
<i>my face was pretty.</i>

118
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,457
It's making me think about him.

119
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,919
To be honest with you, I feel like
I'm a brand new student right now.

120
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,962
Honestly.

121
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,174
But he said it so assertively that,
even if it was a lie,

122
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,761
who wouldn't be happy
to hear something like that? You know?

123
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,305
<i>I wish she'd show</i>
<i>her real feelings more often.</i>

124
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,309
<i>The children's</i>
<i>cafeteria event is coming up soon.</i>

125
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>Please continue with your preparations</i>
<i>to make the children happy.</i>

126
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:03,905
So, today, some of us will try making
the recipe in the Home Economics room.

127
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,282
And then the others
will go to the cafeteria.

128
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,325
AMO (27)

129
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,534
We'll split up.

130
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,164
Baby will be the leader at the cafeteria,
since you'll be painting.

131
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,375
- So…
- Woo-hoo!

132
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,668
- Pick which boys are going.
- To the cafe?

133
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,878
- Really?
- Already done.

134
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,962
- It's been decided.
- Yeah.

135
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,047
- Already?
- Mmm.

136
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,215
- Milk and…
- Yeah.

137
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,800
- …Tackle.
- Attackle.

138
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,802
- Tackle?
- Attackle!

139
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,347
- I'm stuck here again?
- Yeah. That's okay?

140
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,183
If only those two are going? Good.

141
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,853
That charm he's got on it.

142
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,773
Don't try and infuse the spiritual energy
into your drink.

143
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,528
- Have a good trip, you three.
- Have a good one!

144
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,779
Have a good trip!

145
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,865
- About Tackle… Do we need him?
- Let's get to work.

146
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,534
- We don't need him.
- He left.

147
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,536
He's already dressed. Ready to head out.

148
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,913
- I'll leave things here in your hands.
- Good luck.

149
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,998
- Take care.
- I'll try my best.

150
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,375
- We're off.
- All right.

151
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,793
- Later, guys.
- See you guys later.

152
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
I'll try my best.

153
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,629
- Just go already.
- Do your best.

154
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,173
- <i>"Just go already."</i>
- <i>Yeah, "Just go already!"</i>

155
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,676
- Economics.
- So, what are we doing?

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,886
There's not much left
to do in the classroom, right?

157
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,555
- Right. So, what was it?
- No.

158
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,142
For gifts,
we were thinking of making T-shirts,

159
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,936
and also handing out cookies
to all the kids.

160
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,146
What flavor?

161
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,689
"What flavor?"

162
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,191
He brings the drama.
He should be an actor!

163
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,611
He said, "What flavor?"
Why is he so interested in which flavor?

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,113
I don't know what flavor yet but--

165
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,615
- I gotcha.
- Gotcha? All right then.

166
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,742
It doesn't matter
if they're round or anything else.

167
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,078
- Let's try and make some.
- But I can't.

168
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,290
Hey, Amo,
let's slack off in the classroom.

169
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,292
If you wanna go,
then you're gonna do those.

170
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,503
- Oh? In home economics?
- Because we'll be making them there.

171
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,214
- <i>Oh.</i>
- If you need something to do…

172
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,050
- <i>Poor Oto.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah, that's right.</i>

173
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
Oto, let's do the hoop toss.

174
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,474
- Let's do it.
- Let's get going.

175
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,101
Captain,
let's all make sure we all work hard.

176
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,187
- Okay!
- All right!

177
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,400
- What're we doing?
- Making cookies.

178
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,819
- Great, let's just do our best!
- Let's do it then.

179
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
I'll cut the shapes.

180
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,739
Let's use this.

181
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,326
Okay, I've seen this before. My mom…

182
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,703
- Your mom used these?
- She would use these, yeah.

183
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,538
- Full-time housewife.
- What would she cook?

184
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,040
- Wait, a full-time housewife?
- Mmm.

185
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,209
That's nice!

186
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,377
- I know, right?
- That's actually my dream.

187
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,713
- Really?
- It's not like I actually wanna work.

188
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,924
Being a full-time housewife
seems hard too.

189
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,300
Yeah, okay, that's true.

190
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,010
What music do you like?

191
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,762
What kinda music do I like?

192
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,973
- Not really songs that have vocals.
- Oh, really?

193
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,558
What I like to listen to is, like,

194
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,770
background music that makes you feel
like you're in the forest.

195
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,772
Oh! Ghibli music for sleeping.

196
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,941
Yeah, exactly! Do you listen to it too?

197
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,485
- Yeah, when I need to go to sleep.
- What? Same thing here!

198
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,528
- Me too.
- Yeah.

199
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,947
- I listen to Ghibli music while I sleep.
- So nice, right?

200
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,281
I always play the campfire one.

201
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,618
Yeah, and they even have the picture
of the campfire to go with the music.

202
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,162
- That one. I do.
- You know it? That one's so good.

203
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,957
That one that crackles, right?
I know what you mean.

204
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,833
This is so hilarious.

205
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,253
It's so funny that you get this too.

206
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,880
Nisei really knows
how to chat these girls up.

207
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,924
- I know.
- He really does.

208
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,218
So this is what a popular guy is like.

209
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,011
Yeah. Scary, right?

210
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,347
- Right? It does feel scary.
- It does.

211
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,474
That looks really hard.

212
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,059
Yeah, it's such a pain.

213
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,396
That looks fun.

214
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,107
- It's really not.
- I wanna do it.

215
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,858
Tenten, you can cut this part.

216
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,777
- Oh, wow. Hmm?
- Cut here.

217
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,239
- Hmm? Do you really need me to cut it?
- <i>These two.</i>

218
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,366
- <i>Looking good!</i>
- You don't want to?

219
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,659
- You do.
- <i>Oh.</i>

220
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,037
<i>- What was that?</i>
- <i>What a great expression!</i>

221
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,747
<i>That "aww" face she just made.</i>

222
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,917
<i>If you finish</i>
<i>your preparations for the event early,</i>

223
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>you will have sauna time as a reward.</i>

224
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
Okay!

225
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,797
Huh? Oh, wow.

226
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>When Tekarin last went, she fell in love.</i>

227
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,011
<i>- Tekarin, please pick a boy to go with.</i>
- Huh?

228
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,847
- That's how it works?
- Wait, what? That's so nice.

229
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,015
She's badmouthing me.

230
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,850
- My gosh!
- What's gonna happen?

231
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,352
Tekarin obviously has a soft spot
for the sauna for sure.

232
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,937
- It's gotta be Tenten.
- Yeah.

233
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,314
- Yeah.
- Please.

234
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,523
He's my favorite.

235
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,859
- Who's it gonna be?
- That was so mean.

236
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,737
- The guy gets reward time too.
- <i>Please ask Tenten.</i>

237
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,947
Who should I go with? Who should it be?

238
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,865
We're going.

239
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,285
So, who should I go with then?

240
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>He just said, "We're going."</i>

241
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:22,955
Please!

242
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,832
I'll go with Tenten.

243
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,542
Oh, yes!

244
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,419
She said it while taping the box.

245
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,337
Tenten!

246
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,756
- Tekarin is really shy.
- Well done, Tenten.

247
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,091
Shall we?

248
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,764
REFRESHED

249
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,849
It's so hot. Hot, hot, hot.

250
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,351
NATURAL HOT SPRINGS & SAUNA

251
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,561
- It's really hot out here.
- Really?

252
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
- Your hair will be okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

253
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,482
- <i>He's in good shape.</i>
- Let's go.

254
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,775
<i>He really is.</i>

255
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,280
Nice, nice.

256
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,533
- It's hot.
- I'm so happy you chose me.

257
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,535
Do you have a better impression of me?

258
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,621
I didn't have a bad
first impression of you.

259
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,247
- Really? You didn't?
- Not at all.

260
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,333
But you were nervous
at first though, right?

261
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,627
I was. But I do actually like you.

262
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,504
- I like you a lot.
- Mmm.

263
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,713
- Really?
- Yeah.

264
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,757
What is it about me?

265
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,720
- I don't get tired.
- When we're together? That's really nice.

266
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,098
- With everybody else that's here…
- That makes me happy.

267
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,351
I really make an effort to try and liven
things up and see how people are doing.

268
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,104
But when it's just the two of us,
I don't worry about that as much.

269
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,355
Yeah, I kinda feel that.

270
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,982
You definitely act tough.
But you can't hide your feelings.

271
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,734
Mmm.

272
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
I want you to be more confident.

273
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,615
- Mmm.
- You're already so vibrant.

274
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,701
You'll be amazing with confidence.

275
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,913
- <i>He's so good, as we expected.</i>
- <i>He's so good.</i>

276
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,874
Have you gotten to know everyone?

277
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,793
- Oh, you mean yesterday?
- Mmm.

278
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,711
Well…

279
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,131
I kinda got to know Baby better,
after we spent time together.

280
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,590
Okay. Hey…

281
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,342
So, the letter from this morning.

282
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,553
That was you, right? The one in my locker.

283
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,013
The one with nice handwriting?
That was me.

284
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,976
I knew it was you
'cause you said we were the same age.

285
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,519
- Okay, I see.
- Yeah.

286
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,478
You analyzed it.

287
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,021
- Yeah. I'm smart.
- Okay.

288
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,107
But it was obvious. There's no one else.

289
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,525
- It was easy.
- So…

290
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:18,070
Why'd you put a letter
in my locker yesterday?

291
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,072
Because I thought you're nice.

292
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,992
- <i>Look at the way he looks at her.</i>
- <i>That stare of his!</i>

293
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,702
<i>It's really penetrating.</i>

294
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,619
Okay, but…

295
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,540
Why didn't you choose me yesterday, then?

296
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:30,958
Hmm.

297
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,798
<i>Yesterday, I wanted Nisei</i>
<i>to choose me to go on the date with him.</i>

298
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,176
Instead, he picked somebody else to go.

299
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>There was a part of me that was shocked.</i>

300
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,848
<i>I was just, like, "Wait, what? Really?"</i>

301
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,976
I do think, though,
that I might still be interested in him.

302
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,147
<i>And I want to figure out</i>
<i>how he feels about me.</i>

303
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,566
<i>Mmm. How he actually feels.</i>

304
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,484
Mmm.

305
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,736
More…

306
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,654
- It's cold!
- More!

307
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,906
I won't get it in your face.

308
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,116
<i>These two seem to be having fun.</i>

309
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,951
Okay, so what are my views on love?

310
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,162
That could be a difficult one.

311
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,371
- A tough one?
- Mmm.

312
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,289
Stretch out.

313
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,583
- We're doing this?
- Yeah.

314
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:18,130
I don't really have any pet peeves of mine
with guys that I've dated.

315
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,300
- Mmm.
- I think I can accept anything.

316
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,052
- So, anything?
- Mmm.

317
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,057
- I tend to fall in love really hard.
- Mmm. You let them know?

318
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,058
Yeah, I do.

319
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,518
- You come out and tell them?
- I do.

320
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,685
- Mmm.
- I'll just be, like,

321
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,979
"Hey, I don't really like this thing
that you're doing."

322
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,897
Mmm.

323
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,440
So…

324
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
- What are your flaws? What are they?
- My flaws?

325
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,403
I have a big flaw when it comes to love.

326
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,738
- What?
- I'm a love-dodger.

327
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,823
- Hmm?
- A love-dodger.

328
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,699
A love-dodger, what's that?

329
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,163
So, whenever I like someone,
I tend to act coldly.

330
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,998
- Really? No way!
- Mmm.

331
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,000
So, you won't be
straightforward with them.

332
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,002
Mmm.

333
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,087
But it's also like,

334
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,800
if they know that I like them,
then I won't try and avoid them.

335
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,261
- Mmm.
- But I will avoid them if they don't know.

336
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,929
- You'd avoid them?
- Yeah, a lot.

337
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,847
Really?

338
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
I get shy just talking to them.

339
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,269
Oh, because you like them too much?

340
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,521
You're that type of girl.

341
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,983
- A love-dodger?
- Like the reclining Buddha.

342
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,151
- I guess so. A contrarian.
- A contrarian.

343
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,362
- That is cute though.
- Right?

344
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,824
Please tell me
if there is anything on your mind.

345
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,741
I will.

346
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,993
I don't hold back.

347
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,246
- Like, I keep looking at you.
- Anything you wanna tell me?

348
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,666
- <i>Oh? She's getting interested.</i>
- <i>Wait, what? Mmm?</i>

349
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,002
I don't think so.

350
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,754
Maybe you're a bit young.

351
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,132
- A bit young?
- Mmm.

352
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,759
Like, you're still a little young.

353
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,388
But who you are, as a person,
nothing concerns me.

354
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,682
- Mmm.
- Like, with your personality, I mean.

355
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,808
Oh, really?

356
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:05,029
With Tenten,
I wasn't really feeling a spark.

357
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,906
Not at all? Why not?

358
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,991
I asked him if he thought I had any flaws.

359
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,159
- Okay.
- Right.

360
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,577
And you know what he said?

361
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,536
- "None."
- No.

362
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:13,871
"You're young."

363
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,082
I thought that that was the worst thing
he could say to me.

364
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,000
Ah…

365
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,960
I hate when people tell me,
"You're too young."

366
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,837
- Right, your age.
- Like, "What?"

367
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,797
I also don't like it when people say,

368
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,508
"Oh, you're so young,
but you're working so hard."

369
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,053
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What's the best way to put it?

370
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,014
Despite my age, I've experienced a lot
by working at the bar.

371
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,849
- Right, right.
- So I'm just doing my best.

372
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,435
- Ah…
- So when he said I'm young--

373
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,271
But you're not that far apart.
It's a four-year age gap?

374
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,440
- We have the biggest gap. Isn't it?
- Oh, yeah, we do.

375
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,441
- A huge gap?
- Yeah.

376
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,026
- You're 31?
- This year.

377
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,736
- We're ten years apart.
- Yeah.

378
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,238
So, I wanna know
if you think I'm "too young."

379
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,324
I'm very curious to know what you think.

380
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,618
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

381
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,497
No, I don't think so.
I just think that you have a great vibe.

382
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,165
- Not at all.
- It's very nice.

383
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,710
But I know, right? I was actually shocked
when he said that to me.

384
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,172
- Okay, so she was really bothered by that.
- She didn't like that.

385
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,091
But Tenten is only 25, right?

386
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,217
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

387
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,511
So I wonder what he meant by "young."

388
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,222
Must've been more shocking
since you're self-conscious about it.

389
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,431
Definitely.

390
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,642
And he said it
right at the end of sauna time too.

391
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,769
He said it right at the end?

392
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,604
You don't have to worry about that.

393
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,106
Well…

394
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,486
He really hit the mark.

395
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,030
What did he mean by it?

396
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,369
It did make me think like,
"Oh, Boss did this thing for me."

397
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,286
<i>You know.</i>

398
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,830
<i>Like…</i>

399
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,917
<i>Maybe that's why I got even</i>
<i>more pissed off by the "young" comment.</i>

400
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,713
My time with Boss felt more impactful.

401
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,424
Tekarin is…

402
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,675
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

403
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,720
And remember, at the start
of this episode, she was crying.

404
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,930
- They never made love, did they?
- No.

405
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,640
- Right?
- They're not supposed to.

406
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,642
- I think maybe they did.
- They didn't do it.

407
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,811
The sauna experience really moved her.

408
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,396
I think Tekarin is the kind of person

409
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,983
who, when she likes someone,
will really stay devoted to them.

410
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,403
She's having such big emotions
over such a small amount of time.

411
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,697
It's such a shame
what happened with Yanboh.

412
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,742
- <i>Yang Boss?</i>
- <i>Young Boss.</i>

413
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>It was so cute of her to get it wrong.</i>

414
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,204
But Tenten is using his host moves.

415
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,582
- You know what I mean?
- You think that's what he's doing?

416
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:26,378
We just saw Tenten say to Tekarin,
"Hey, I'm interested in you." Right?

417
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,380
But then the way he acted in the sauna

418
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,050
made me think
that he wasn't actually that into her.

419
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,218
- You know what I mean?
- That's what he was doing?

420
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:38,307
Do you think that that's what made Tekarin
start to lose interest in Tenten?

421
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,643
Right. But she also invited Yanboh
because she was upset with him.

422
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,896
Then, when they actually got in the sauna,

423
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,648
she ended up falling in love
with Yanboh, right? So…

424
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,276
- That's just who Tekarin is.
- "I hate you. I love you."

425
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,320
- Yeah, okay, I see.
- "I hate you." Yeah.

426
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,114
If she hated him, she wouldn't have
cared about that "young" line.

427
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,200
- Love-dodging.
- Right. In other words.

428
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,869
- That's it. That's right.
- She's already love-dodging.

429
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,162
That's true. True.

430
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,830
True.

431
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,708
Cafe Chocolate. I might wanna go.

432
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,710
So, wanna go, Tenten?

433
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,712
- Okay.
- Let's work together.

434
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,549
<i>Tenten hasn't even seen</i>
<i>the children's cafeteria yet</i>

435
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,134
<i>since he's been here.</i>

436
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,889
So, while I might know what he's like here
when we're at school, in the classroom,

437
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,891
I also wanna see what he's like
outside of here,

438
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,684
in a different environment.

439
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,436
<i>Right, because she loves kids.</i>

440
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,146
- <i>Hello, everyone!</i>
- <i>Hello!</i>

441
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,397
Good morning, Mona.

442
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,066
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

443
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,485
I'm Tenten. She's so confident. Amazing!

444
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,654
- 'Cause she's a <i>gyaru.</i>
- Please call me Tenten.

445
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,197
- Sure.
- Mona, come look.

446
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,782
- Okay.
- Do you like anyone?

447
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,867
- No.
- Oh, you don't?

448
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
I guess not.

449
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,038
There really aren't
any worthy guys at my school.

450
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,873
Oh, no? Wait, hold on.

451
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,501
- Did you hear that? She's so mature.
- What're you looking for?

452
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,586
- Someone nice.
- A nice guy.

453
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,588
I'm sure you have that at your school.

454
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,508
- Well, in that case--
- Are you old enough to get married?

455
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,677
Yeah. Both of us are old enough.

456
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,179
Just stop it. Stop it.

457
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,347
Good luck.

458
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,932
- Thanks, are you rooting for me?
- Mmm.

459
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,850
- Really?
- Mmm.

460
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,145
- He's looking for love.
- I am. Looking for love.

461
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,230
This is pretty dark, right?

462
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,439
- Mmm.
- Yeah, it's dark.

463
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,359
- Open them.
- Okay, sure.

464
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,277
Close them.

465
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,612
You're turning into a <i>gyaru.</i>

466
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,406
You don't have to do this.

467
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,575
- What color do all of you want?
- Pink!

468
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,826
- Blue.
- Blue.

469
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,494
- Oh, wow.
- Blue.

470
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,663
Don't move, just hold it there.

471
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,165
It tickles, right?

472
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,375
- Two, three…
- Oh!

473
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,711
It looks nice, Tomo.

474
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,380
<i>You can tell that Tekarin</i>
<i>is a really good person.</i>

475
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,340
- <i>I know! Totally.</i>
- <i>Isn't she?</i>

476
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,384
Two, three…

477
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,552
That's legit!

478
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,888
- <i>That's nice!</i>
- <i>So nice!</i>

479
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,473
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>So great seeing this stuff.</i>

480
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,893
<i>It's like seeing the movie </i>Ghost,
<i>know what I mean?</i>

481
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,436
Where should I stamp it?

482
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,605
- This is such a nice yellow.
- Yeah.

483
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,273
- Mmm.
- It's fluorescent.

484
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,275
- It feels like me, right?
- Yeah. Mmm. It does.

485
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,235
- Nice.
- You okay?

486
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,321
This one. Nice.

487
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,407
- Two and three…
- And three.

488
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,035
We did it!

489
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,871
- Very nice!
- Looks great! All done!

490
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,832
- It's done! It looks great!
- Very nice.

491
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,919
- <i>Oh, wow, that looks so cute!</i>
- <i>Very nice. And it says,</i>

492
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,420
<i>"Tenten and Tekarin."</i>

493
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,464
I've always loved kids.

494
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,590
- I always have.
- Mmm.

495
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,927
And, I've always wanted
to be able to work with children.

496
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,263
- Mmm.
- But I went off the rails in high school.

497
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,265
- Mmm.
- And the reason for that was,

498
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,725
- I'd been doing kendo.
- Mmm.

499
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,227
My mom is a kendo teacher.

500
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,187
- Oh, okay.
- I got a kendo scholarship.

501
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,563
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

502
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,524
And the high school
that I got the scholarship from…

503
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,442
Mmm-hmm.

504
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,821
…put me in a class that trained you
to be a nursery school teacher.

505
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,698
- So kendo got you in there.
- And--

506
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
And I thought I was gonna be
a kindergarten teacher.

507
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,285
Mmm.

508
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,954
But then, I got…

509
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,455
injured.

510
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,498
I hurt my Achilles.

511
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,041
- Doing kendo?
- Mmm.

512
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,876
Not while I was doing kendo,
something else.

513
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,835
- Oh, okay.
- So…

514
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,341
I thought, "If I can't do kendo,
why should I bother going to school?"

515
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,052
- And that's how I ended up like this.
- Ah. 'Cause you got injured?

516
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,513
- My life changed after I got injured.
- I get it.

517
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,975
But I really like doing jobs,
or something like this,

518
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,811
that involves interacting with kids,
because I really love them.

519
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,853
Yeah.

520
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,815
I thought you might be the type of girl
who doesn't like kids.

521
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,566
I seem like the type who'd yell at them.

522
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,527
"That's enough, brat!"

523
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,322
But I like people
who are good at taking care of kids.

524
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,866
- And animals. Yeah.
- Right.

525
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,370
So I really enjoyed
spending time with you.

526
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,788
Oh, yeah? Okay.

527
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,957
<i>I think today, with Tekarin,</i>

528
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>I saw a different</i>
<i>and unexpected side of her.</i>

529
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,131
I had heard that Tekarin
really loves spending time with kids.

530
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,550
<i>She really impressed me.</i>

531
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,721
She's really got a great personality.

532
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,890
So I'm happy I was able to talk to her.

533
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,310
- <i>It's good they went together.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

534
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,479
I got a different impression of him
at the children's cafe.

535
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,565
He definitely talked to the kids a lot.

536
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,650
He was really considerate.

537
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>He would just offer</i>
<i>to carry things for me.</i>

538
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,781
<i>He was so considerate</i>
<i>about the little things like that.</i>

539
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>The other thing he did</i>
<i>that I really liked was…</i>

540
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,661
There were all these kids
running around, right?

541
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,998
So, he said, "I'm not going to smoke
with all these kids in here."

542
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,208
And that was so thoughtful of him.

543
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,045
I was just, like,
"Wow, he's such a nice guy."

544
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,757
But he's also someone I can joke with.

545
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,135
<i>One thing I said to him was,</i>
<i>"What if we decided to get together,</i>

546
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,721
<i>and we came back to this place</i>
<i>as a real couple?"</i>

547
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,432
<i>I can say things like that to him.</i>

548
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,353
<i>Even when we linked arms, that wasn't</i>
<i>something that I felt shy about doing.</i>

549
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,564
He gives me butterflies,
but I'm not love-dodging.

550
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,193
I don't know what to do because
I've never experienced that before.

551
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,487
Am I actually falling in love
all over again?

552
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,906
<i>She says while playing with her eyelashes.</i>

553
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,284
- She falls in love easily. So easily.
- I know, right? I think so too.

554
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,954
"I like him but I'm not love-dodging him.
I don't know what to do."

555
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,748
- Right?
- She did do it at first.

556
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,378
- Give me the whole pile.
- Really?

557
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,879
Really.

558
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,383
I thought you'd be, like,
"I don't have a choice."

559
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,467
That's fair. Yeah.

560
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,594
- You're nice.
- I know.

561
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,388
'Cause I have two younger sisters.

562
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,765
- You do?
- Yeah.

563
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,184
- You have a little brother?
- An older one too.

564
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,227
Do you really?

565
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,354
But I really hate my older brother.

566
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,730
- Hate?
- I used to.

567
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:23,819
My older brother is afraid of people,
so he was a shut-in for a long time.

568
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,571
- Was he really?
- Yeah. I just couldn't accept it.

569
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,658
Or more like that
I just couldn't understand it at all.

570
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,494
So I think I was just embarrassed
to have an older brother like that.

571
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,954
Ah, right, gotcha.

572
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,038
I really hated that.

573
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,916
So I would pretend
that I didn't have an older brother.

574
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay, I gotcha.

575
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,461
I've definitely learned a lot of things
since coming here.

576
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,921
- Here. Yeah.
- Thank you.

577
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,590
But I've never apologized to him
for treating him that way.

578
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,925
Oh, yeah.

579
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,719
<i>There's my older brother, me,</i>
<i>and my younger brother.</i>

580
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,721
My older brother
never even tried to find a job,

581
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,516
so we just used to fight
so many times back then.

582
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,061
I was working way more than him
even though I'm four years younger.

583
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,647
I was mad at him for being a shut-in

584
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,233
and for never doing anything
around the house.

585
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,569
Even though
he was four years older than me.

586
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,196
Part of me didn't like calling him
my older brother

587
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,282
since I was more mature than he was.

588
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,161
I was also embarrassed that
my older brother was someone like him.

589
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,621
<i>But ever since I've gotten here,</i>

590
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>I've started to realize, little by little,</i>
<i>that there's all kinds of people.</i>

591
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,126
<i>So, like,</i>

592
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,377
when I finally realized

593
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,797
that my older brother was working hard
in his own way, I felt like…

594
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,717
I wanted to apologize to him but…

595
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,386
- <i>Whoa! Apologize to him.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

596
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,930
I've never apologized to him before.

597
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,725
<i>She opened up.</i>

598
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,488
I'll talk to him.

599
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,921
Hello?

600
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,797
Oh, oh. She's calling him.

601
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,299
And from a payphone?

602
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,511
- Big bro?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

603
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,555
- So, you know, right now…
- <i>Yeah.</i>

604
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,601
…I'm at this place, and there are a lot
of former <i>Yankiis </i>here.

605
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,646
And we've been able to talk
about a lot of different things.

606
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,148
- <i>Mmm.</i>
- As we've been talking…

607
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,695
you know, I remembered how I used to not
wanna think of you as being my brother.

608
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,492
And about how we used to get
in a lot of fights because of that.

609
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,409
<i>Yeah.</i>

610
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,453
Mmm…

611
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,414
So, like…

612
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,378
I've always wanted everyone in our family
to get along.

613
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,047
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- But I haven't always felt

614
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,758
like I've been able
to express my feelings honestly.

615
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,676
<i>Yeah.</i>

616
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,224
And, because you're my older brother…

617
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,184
like…

618
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:06,231
I always really wanted you
to be a stronger older brother for me.

619
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,190
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

620
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,778
Like, I knew that about you,
but I couldn't understand it.

621
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,407
<i>Yeah, well, we did have a lot going on.</i>

622
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,616
Yeah.

623
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,244
So I wanted to apologize.

624
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,621
<i>Right.</i>

625
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm really sorry.

626
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,125
<i>It's totally fine.</i>

627
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,003
<i>I know you had a lot of other things</i>
<i>you were focusing on too.</i>

628
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,838
<i>We both did what we could do.</i>

629
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,755
Yeah.

630
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,969
But you know, like,
there's so many different people here.

631
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
<i>Mmm.</i>

632
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,265
And I realized,
I'm really blessed to have my family.

633
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,059
Even if we are really different
from others.

634
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,394
<i>Right.</i>

635
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,731
There are some girls
who have worked really hard.

636
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,359
When I heard that,
I thought I'm still not mature enough…

637
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,739
and yet I've also never cared enough
about my family.

638
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,330
So, I really felt bad
when I finally realized that.

639
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,002
And so, I'm just…
really happy that all of us are a family.

640
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,887
And I want us to stay together
and to get along.

641
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,388
<i>Mmm.</i>

642
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,102
<i>Yeah. All that matters now</i>
<i>is you're doing your best.</i>

643
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,772
Yeah. You sound like Dad right now.

644
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,690
"Do your best, that's what matters."

645
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,986
<i>My family is not typical.</i>

646
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,239
But other people here
have had to go to Juvenile Training School

647
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,949
or be sent to children's homes.

648
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,913
That never happened to me, so in a way,
I feel blessed to have the family I have.

649
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,582
Coming here
and hearing everyone's stories,

650
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,212
being in this kind of environment,
I think that made me realize

651
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:56,549
how I was being really foolish
and really small-minded.

652
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,302
That's what made me
finally talk to my brother.

653
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,514
It was a really great phone call,
and I feel very grateful.

654
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,646
- Did you hear that?
- Hold on a second.

655
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,774
I was moved by that,
but I just kept thinking,

656
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,983
is this a dating show?

657
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,903
- For sure.
- I know, right?

658
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:21,491
Of course. And yes, this show is primarily
about romance and finding love.

659
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,536
But these participants
do have things from their pasts,

660
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,830
- and have mistakes that they've made.
- Human drama.

661
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,457
Yes, and many of them
have regrets about those things.

662
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:33,169
So I'm hoping their experiences here will
provide them with opportunities to grow.

663
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,796
- Mmm.
- And to face their pasts.

664
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,631
That's what we want them
to get out of this.

665
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,341
- That's the message.
- Right. Thank you.

666
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,387
Do you know what? I think because
siblings are very close with each other…

667
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,931
- Mmm.
- …they might be a little more shy

668
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,684
about being direct,
and saying "sorry" or "thank you."

669
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,227
- That's true.
- Ah, yeah, very true.

670
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,396
So, when I think about my older sister,

671
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,481
- we're close with each other.
- Mmm-hmm.

672
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,445
But anytime I have to say something like
"thank you," or like "I'm sorry," to her,

673
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,697
- it makes me feel awkward.
- Uh-huh.

674
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,116
I tell her "thank you" a lot,
but I feel awkward saying it.

675
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,285
So you feel awkward
saying that to your family?

676
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,786
Something like that.

677
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,914
Tekarin said her brother
was a shut-in for a while.

678
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,752
So she really must have had
a lot of thoughts and a lot of feelings

679
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,670
to be able to talk to him like that.

680
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,172
Right? After meeting everyone here.

681
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,340
It's a good thing
that she's able to say "I'm sorry."

682
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,719
It is, isn't it?
Stuff like that doesn't come out easily.

683
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,638
Especially when you have to say
something like that to your family.

684
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,932
- We get shy.
- Yeah, definitely.

685
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,351
- But you have to actually say it.
- That's right.

686
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,729
Amongst all these other things
going on with Tekarin,

687
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,314
what else has she been up to?

688
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:38,568
Well, she invited Tenten
to go to the children's cafeteria with her

689
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,070
- just to see how it would go.
- Mmm.

690
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,781
- And she thinks that he's great.
- Yeah.

691
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,201
It kind of feels
like love is in the air, right?

692
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,454
And I think, despite how he may appear,
I think Tenten's a devoted kinda guy.

693
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,790
- He does seem that way.
- That's good of him too.

694
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,249
- Of Tenten, right?
- Yeah.

695
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,127
- Right. Yeah.
- And they're cute together. Very.

696
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,463
- <i>They're so cute.</i>
- <i>Yeah. For sure.</i>

697
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,466
<i>And that's not something</i>
<i>we've really seen so far on this show.</i>

698
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,343
They're very heartwarming together.

699
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,805
- Yeah. They're good together.
- They have a nice thing going on.

700
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,976
<i>You have free time until dinner.</i>

701
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,188
<i>So feel free to talk</i>
<i>to whoever you're interested in.</i>

702
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,481
<i>It's really free time.</i>

703
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,690
Thanks for coming.

704
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,943
I was worried nobody was gonna invite me.

705
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,903
- Surprised? Really?
- Yeah.

706
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,323
I have talked to you the least.
But I'm interested in you the most.

707
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,908
- Even though we haven't talked?
- Yeah.

708
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,202
- I am surprised, though. Mmm.
- Yeah. Right?

709
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,412
- What?
- Oh. It's Kii.

710
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,372
I knew it.

711
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,707
What kind of girls do you like?

712
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,252
- What kind?
- You seem like you've got a type.

713
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,670
- Me?
- Yeah.

714
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,214
I like girls
who are strong-minded and principled.

715
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,341
- Yeah.
- And a girl who can say thank you.

716
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,635
- I have pretty normal standards.
- Right. Mmm.

717
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,554
But it's just surprising because…

718
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,139
most people aren't doing
what we should be doing.

719
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,016
- What does that mean?
- <i>Who? Tekarin?</i>

720
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,894
So, I just think it would be great
if you and me went on a date

721
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,438
- and got to really talk. Yeah.
- Yeah. Thank you.

722
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,649
- What?
- Wait, what? Hold on.

723
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,567
Hmm?

724
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,779
So, out of all of the girls,
who are you interested in now?

725
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,072
Who do I like?

726
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,782
Because I hear a lot from them.

727
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,118
We talk about everything,
between all of us.

728
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,536
It's tough, though.

729
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,997
You know, Tekarin said
that she really hated it

730
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,707
when you told her that she was young.

731
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,292
- She didn't like that.
- Really?

732
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,209
Yeah.

733
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,882
So after Yanboh left,
she was able to stay pretty positive.

734
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,426
She was, like, "I'm already here,
so I'm gonna try my best."

735
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,553
And she did say
that she might be interested in you.

736
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,889
- Mmm.
- So, she was interested.

737
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,390
But it seems like she took that jab

738
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,684
that you made about her age
really personally.

739
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,936
- Mmm. So now, she's feeling down.
- Too strong of a jab?

740
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,688
- Like, wham!
- Okay.

741
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,899
And now she has a concussion.

742
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,858
That's so funny.

743
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,526
She has a concussion.

744
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,778
So the thing about her…

745
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,698
Even if we dated,

746
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,410
she tells me to keep doing my best
at my current job.

747
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,120
- Right.
- But even so…

748
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,707
she seems like the type
who always wants to be around her partner.

749
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,791
- Oh.
- Yeah.

750
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,127
I feel like it wouldn't work out.

751
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,630
- You don't think?
- I wanna prioritize my work now.

752
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,424
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Even if I got a different job.

753
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,928
- Oh, come on now!
- Huh?

754
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,722
So he was just throwing out jabs
and checking things out, wasn't he?

755
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,641
So that's what it was?

756
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,644
WOMEN'S BEDROOM

757
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,895
You're not going?

758
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,607
No.

759
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,776
I might go check on them.

760
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,695
OTO-SAN (22)

761
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,281
My makeup is coming off really badly.

762
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,996
Maybe I'll go to the boys' bedroom.

763
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,206
I've never been there.

764
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,248
<i>Oh!</i>

765
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,292
<i>- Huh?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

766
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,795
<i>Who is she going to see?</i>

767
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,635
I'm so sleepy.

768
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,428
I'm jealous.

769
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,973
Who is it?

770
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,224
This room is crazy.

771
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,142
Now I get what you meant by "small."

772
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,602
- Right?
- This is crazy.

773
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,520
Mmm.

774
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,981
- It's right over here.
- Oh, thanks.

775
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,941
Hey.

776
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,317
Let's talk a bit more.

777
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:08,945
Gotcha.

778
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,738
All right.

779
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,157
- Have a good time.
- Thank you. I'm outta here.

780
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,009
- <i>Huh?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

781
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,221
<i>Huh? Oh, wow, she saw them.</i>

782
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,935
<i>And we can't even see her face.</i>
<i>That makes it even more--</i>

783
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,478
- <i>Kinda scary.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

784
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,943
- What?
- What is going on?

785
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,947
- What is she thinking right now?
- Wow. Wait, where is Amo going?

786
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,908
Why do you have so much ink?

787
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,203
I didn't like that my mom thought
I was just like this good girl.

788
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,121
Mmm.

789
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,957
So I wanted to look
like I was bad instead.

790
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,792
- So, I'm not very strong.
- Oh, okay.

791
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,253
So I thought I should at least
look like I was tough.

792
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,172
- So that's why you did it.
- Mmm-hmm.

793
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,798
- But I mean…
- Mmm.

794
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:15,511
…if you took a girl home
with this many tattoos,

795
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,680
your parents would freak out, right?

796
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,057
- My parents?
- Mmm-hmm.

797
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,601
- They'd be startled. Just looking at you.
- I thought so.

798
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,518
Yeah.

799
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,147
- I'm sure.
- But my parents don't judge other people

800
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,483
- based off of their appearance.
- Mmm.

801
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,902
- They'd be surprised. For sure.
- Mmm-hmm.

802
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,653
Even if I told them before.

803
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,239
- <i>Whoa, this is scary!</i>
- <i>What's she gonna do?</i>

804
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,491
We have two homes.

805
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,993
Isn't it hard to have
to move all your clothes?

806
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,289
- Yo.
- Hi.

807
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,415
You still chatting?

808
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,211
- It's fine.
- When you're done…

809
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,962
- Yeah?
- …come to home economics.

810
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,880
Sure.

811
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,259
- You going now?
- No. I'm gonna smoke a bit more.

812
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,177
Mmm-hmm.

813
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,638
- Oh, wow!
- Wow, Amo is so assertive.

814
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,890
Amo's starting to make moves too,
isn't she?

815
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,226
That was… a little…

816
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,983
Where were we?

817
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,736
It's nice that you visit your parents.

818
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah, I really love them.

819
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,614
- Mmm.
- A lot.

820
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,381
- Give me a hug first.
- Hmm?

821
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,008
- <i>Oh, my, oh, my.</i>
- Sure. I'm sweaty.

822
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,051
That's fine.

823
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,602
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

824
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,688
- To home economics.
- Together?

825
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,356
- No, probably not.
- Ugh.

826
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,609
She's coming on a bit too strong.

827
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,862
- When you like someone too much!
- Mmm.

828
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,864
What're you doing?

829
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,867
- <i>Ah!</i>
- <i>Ah!</i>

830
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,994
You were doing this to the wall earlier.

831
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,329
What was that?

832
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,540
What? Just felt like it.

833
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:09,917
I don't like it.

834
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,253
- What? Me going?
- I don't like it.

835
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,298
- That's cute. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

836
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,971
What should I do?

837
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:25,933
Hey.

838
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,311
Hello there.

839
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,687
It's chilly over here.

840
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,106
How are you?

841
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,900
- Hang out with me.
- What?

842
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,443
Sure. Let's do it.

843
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,819
Let's hang out then.

844
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,988
- You came to get me.
- Hmm?

845
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,031
You came to get me.

846
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:41,991
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

847
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:42,909
No problem.

848
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,912
But I saw you with Oto.

849
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,372
She's the one who came to get me.

850
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,416
At my bedroom.

851
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,417
Oh.

852
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,587
Somehow…

853
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,423
I feel awkward asking you to hang out.

854
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,509
- Really? Well, I'm glad you did.
- It's awkward.

855
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,638
I'm pumped, this thing's racing.
This thing inside me.

856
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,181
You didn't notice?

857
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,683
- Are you able to stop it?
- I don't show it on my face.

858
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,769
Dangerous. You don't show it on your face.

859
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,562
- It was really going.
- Really?

860
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
I heard your heels clacking,
I was, like, "She's coming."

861
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,608
I figured it out.

862
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,901
'Cause I'm smart.

863
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,694
- You're a smart one?
- Yeah.

864
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,156
- <i>Ah.</i>
- <i>Ah.</i>

865
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,577
<i>She's just lying around</i>
<i>and moping. Oh, no.</i>

866
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,335
- Are you unsure?
- Hmm?

867
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,962
- Who to pick?
- I'm totally sure.

868
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,463
- Oh, you are?
- Absolutely.

869
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,381
Really?

870
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,800
I haven't totally committed to it yet,
but I am sure.

871
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,801
- I see.
- Mmm.

872
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,932
So as far as Nisei goes,
I'm definitely interested in him.

873
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,100
For sure.

874
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,143
I'm always watching him.

875
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,061
Yeah.

876
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,771
I wanna know more about him.

877
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,233
And I think I'll be really bummed
if he doesn't end up picking me.

878
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,901
Yeah.

879
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,987
That was a first for me.

880
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,948
When I walked over to get him,
like, I'm serious,

881
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,826
<i>that was the first time in my life</i>
<i>I've done something like that.</i>

882
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,538
<i>When I did that, it made me so nervous.</i>

883
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,958
<i>There's been times I haven't talked to him</i>
<i>'cause I felt embarrassed.</i>

884
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,836
So I was just, like,
"Am I self-conscious around him?"

885
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,879
Like, "What is going on here?"

886
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,591
It was amazing
that she was able to do that.

887
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,385
<i>Can you make this face?</i>

888
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,512
<i>And a love triangle</i>
<i>is starting to develop.</i>

889
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,514
Maybe there's gonna be a fight.

890
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,475
<i>There's fireworks and drinks</i>
<i>in the courtyard?</i>

891
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,353
Oh, look, it's all lit up tonight.

892
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,354
<i>Lit up?</i>

893
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,565
- What? Wow!
- It looks cute!

894
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,234
This will push our relationship forward.

895
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,819
This isn't lighting.

896
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,158
- Now, now, now…
- Now, now, now… Okay.

897
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,952
- Whoa, it's green? Why'd it turn green?
- Here it comes.

898
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,287
KIICHAN (23)

899
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,538
Look at this!

900
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,582
- <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>
- <i>Very cool.</i>

901
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,334
Why are you holding it like that?

902
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,086
- <i>Look how close they are.</i>
- <i>They look very close.</i>

903
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,005
- You didn't know? It's true.
- Really?

904
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,381
<i>Oh, no, look at her.</i>

905
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,966
- <i>Wait.</i>
- <i>This is sad.</i>

906
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,886
- <i>An air of despair.</i>
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

907
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,139
- Wanna go smoke, Tekarin?
- Oh, that's too much.

908
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,099
- Let's.
- What's wrong, Tsu?

909
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,394
- I inhaled too much smoke.
- Oh, wait, really? Are you okay?

910
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,896
I'm in my sexy mode.

911
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,105
- Your sexy mode?
- Yeah.

912
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,067
- You like what I'm wearing?
- I do.

913
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,985
Mind if I confiscate these?

914
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,447
Keep 'em for me,
actually, you can have 'em.

915
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,991
<i>Nisei's so good at this stuff, isn't he?</i>

916
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,243
<i>That look of despair.</i>

917
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,661
<i>Ah, poor thing.</i>

918
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,579
<i>Ah!</i>

919
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>Baby too.</i>

920
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,083
<i>- Oh!</i>
- <i>Ahh!</i>

921
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,127
- <i>It's like the water splash.</i>
- <i>She's making the same face.</i>

922
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,546
<i>Ah, and look at Milk over here too.</i>

923
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,507
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

924
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,009
Huh? You didn't like
that I called you "young."

925
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,178
No, no. I just wanna know what you meant.

926
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,263
- Is that it?
- I just really don't like it

927
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,599
whenever people tell me that I'm young.

928
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,518
I didn't like that people saw me as young.

929
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,769
- Oh, okay.
- To put it simply.

930
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,062
Just ignore that.

931
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,065
I meant that you're full of life.

932
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,650
- That's what you meant?
- Yeah.

933
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,652
You're full of energy
because you're young.

934
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,028
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

935
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,782
- Did you think I meant you were immature?
- Mmm-hmm.

936
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,992
- I didn't--
- I didn't mean it like that.

937
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,079
I didn't think so, but I was also,
like, "Oh, so he thinks I'm young."

938
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:15,996
Really?

939
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,374
Wanna go smoke?

940
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,418
- You wanna go?
- Yeah. Let's go.

941
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,047
- Hey. I'm borrowing her. See ya.
- You're smoking?

942
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,340
- We'll be back.
- Really?

943
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,342
- Sorry. Bye-bye!
- Go ahead.

944
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,385
Huh?

945
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,845
Whoa!

946
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,971
Tsu.

947
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,181
He asked her because he said

948
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,809
he hasn't been able
to talk to her much today.

949
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,768
It's fine.

950
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,228
It's just Tsukahara.

951
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,729
- I got you.
- Cheers!

952
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,315
You seem quiet today.

953
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,775
- Yeah, I was.
- You okay?

954
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,818
I'm sad.

955
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,194
- Hmm?
- I'm sad.

956
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,112
You're sad?

957
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,488
Why?

958
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,324
I don't really know why I feel like this.

959
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,910
I'm not sure
who I should be into right now.

960
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,704
Who… Hmm…

961
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,206
Who here would make me
the happiest to be with?

962
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,792
Like, in my head,
I know who's the best option.

963
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,253
- Mmm.
- Like, I'm the happiest with them.

964
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,547
- Mmm.
- And we're definitely compatible.

965
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,882
But I don't…

966
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,302
think things are gonna work out.

967
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,682
I've always wanted to talk to you,

968
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,726
but I think I've probably
talked to you the least.

969
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,977
- You're right.
- Right.

970
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,854
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah.

971
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,772
Do you know who you're gonna pick?

972
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,690
I don't.

973
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,235
Honestly, I can't make a decision yet.

974
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,904
I thought you already had.

975
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,572
What about you, Tsu?

976
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,574
I haven't made a decision either.

977
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
- Because I haven't talked to you.
- Right.

978
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,620
So, you haven't made a decision yet?

979
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,830
Honestly, I don't know who I'm gonna pick.

980
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,582
- Gotcha.
- The thing is,

981
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,584
I don't know
whether I have feelings for them,

982
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,421
or it's just that I like them
because of who they are as a person.

983
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,757
So, right now,
I can't really tell the difference.

984
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,010
Mmm-mmm.
What kinda guys have you dated before?

985
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,929
- Oh, hey!
- Where's my IQOS?

986
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,223
- I have it.
- You have it? That's fine, then.

987
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,558
- Where did I put the case?
- Sorry to interrupt.

988
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,645
When someone actually starts
to become meaningful to me…

989
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,231
- Right.
- …I really don't want them to get hurt

990
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,982
- in any kind of way.
- Mmm-mmm.

991
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,444
But when I think about the future,
then I tend to tell these guys

992
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,197
I don't love them
and end up breaking up with them.

993
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,241
- 'Cause they mean too much to me.
- Mmm.

994
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,868
And, honestly, I've done that many times.

995
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,203
Right!

996
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,290
You break up with them
even though you like them?

997
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,417
- Yeah.
- And you still have feelings for them?

998
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,585
- That's right.
- I see.

999
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,045
But I'm the one that says,

1000
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,923
"I'm not in love with you anymore,
I think that we should break up."

1001
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,132
So then, it wouldn't be cool

1002
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,510
if I turned around
and started pursuing them again, right?

1003
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,803
We're similar, right?

1004
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,221
Yeah, you're cool.

1005
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,389
Very cool.

1006
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,308
- But we really are the same, right?
- Yeah.

1007
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,477
I never heard this before
'cause we never talked.

1008
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,272
Well, now, I kinda feel bad
because I interrupted you guys.

1009
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,566
- You were having a deep talk.
- No, stay.

1010
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,944
I'm not really sure
how Tsu actually feels about Baby.

1011
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:56,365
It didn't seem like Tsu was really trying
to pursue her that hard, I don't think.

1012
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,033
But it seemed like Baby thought

1013
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,995
it was a good opportunity
to talk about this stuff.

1014
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,290
She was talking to Tsu, but it felt
like she wanted Milk to hear it.

1015
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,418
Do you think if Milk and Oto
keep trying to rush things,

1016
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,420
it's only gonna get bad for them quicker?

1017
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,088
- Yeah.
- You know?

1018
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,675
Sometimes people will just start saying
what's on their minds.

1019
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,885
That happens a lot in relationships, like,

1020
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,389
"Where are you? Who are you with?
When are you coming home? FaceTime me."

1021
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,516
- Right.
- Everyone can get insecure.

1022
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,520
You don't want the person that you like
to start hanging out with someone else,

1023
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,731
- the same way they do with you.
- Yeah. I'd hate that.

1024
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,276
But nothing good is gonna come out
of saying things like that.

1025
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,861
- Mmm, nothing does.
- Right?

1026
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,613
Let's take cheating, for example.

1027
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,574
If you keep accusing someone
who isn't actually cheating,

1028
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,910
they'll start to be, like,
"Wow, this person's a pain in the ass."

1029
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,455
Then they might start cheating on you
because of that.

1030
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,998
- Right.
- There's a chance

1031
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,916
that they'll just end up
getting sick of you.

1032
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,336
But if you're able
to suppress those feelings

1033
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,880
and if you can resist
the urge to act on them,

1034
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,176
your partner will probably be, like,
"Oh, wow. They really understand me."

1035
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,055
It'll give them a good impression of you.
Like, "They're confident in themselves."

1036
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,973
- Right.
- So if you're just constantly

1037
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,684
expressing your feelings
with your words and actions,

1038
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,562
that doesn't tend to lead
to anything good, does it?

1039
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,730
- I get that.
- True.

1040
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,107
If you never say anything,
won't they feel they can cheat?

1041
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,652
You shouldn't fall in love
with someone like that.

1042
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,903
Good point! Right!

1043
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,823
If you have to keep them on a leash
to make sure that they behave themselves…

1044
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,450
- Right.
- …it's not worth it.

1045
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,453
You would literally have
to put a lock on your partner

1046
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,747
- if you live your life that way.
- Wow!

1047
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,208
So it's, like,
if you live your life that way,

1048
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,709
put their hearts on a leash.

1049
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,461
- Oh, I get it!
- Wow.

1050
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,964
Wow, I think we just got yet another
great quote from you today, AK.

1051
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,716
- It's true.
- Was that a good one?

1052
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,219
- It was, thank you.
- Really good line. Liked it.

1053
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,138
- That's my opinion on stuff like that.
- Mmm-hmm.

1054
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,557
- I think I'm gonna go smoke.
- Go ahead.

1055
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,768
- Are you gonna cry?
- Mmm?

1056
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,811
I will!

1057
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,271
- You will? Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1058
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,272
Cry a little then.

1059
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,025
Oh, okay. You're that kinda guy.

1060
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,695
Okay, I'm gonna go and smoke.

1061
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,537
<i>Oh, no, she's crying and she's drunk.</i>

1062
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,330
<i>The worst kind of situation.</i>

1063
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,707
<i>Oh, the poor thing.</i>

1064
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,626
<i>Oh, this is so sad!</i>

1065
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,216
- All right, I'm gonna go over here now.
- Hey, let's go.

1066
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,511
Don't cry, it's okay. Come on.

1067
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,472
- <i>Oh, he's so kind.</i>
- <i>Just what I thought. So kind.</i>

1068
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,099
Wait, is she okay?

1069
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,434
It's that bad?

1070
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,936
- Nisei.
- What?

1071
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,523
Oto wants to talk.

1072
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,900
- Oh, sorry.
- She wants to talk to you alone.

1073
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,571
- Thank you, Tenten.
- Please come talk to her.

1074
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,965
You're crying?

1075
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,676
How about I start crying too?

1076
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,345
I feel really lonely.

1077
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,473
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1078
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,151
- This is just…
- If she's gonna cry every time…

1079
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,571
- This is only gonna backfire.
- Yeah, if she keeps acting like this,

1080
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,908
then I think it's probably
gonna just backfire on her.

1081
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,410
- Yeah.
- It might feel overwhelming.

1082
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,537
Why do you feel that way?

1083
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,084
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1084
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,507
Well, with Amo,
you know how she first got here?

1085
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,133
- Do you remember that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1086
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,302
- Well, I just felt so mad at her…
- Mmm-hmm.

1087
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,220
…because…

1088
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,848
- when it comes to work…
- Work? Okay.

1089
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,477
…I feel like I have
a different philosophy than her.

1090
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,438
<i>- So I judged her from that point of view.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

1091
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,482
<i>And that entire situation was something</i>

1092
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,150
<i>that I really felt strongly about.</i>

1093
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,986
<i>So my head was messed up</i>
<i>until I actually talked to her.</i>

1094
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,198
So, like, that entire thing
has been bothering me.

1095
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,366
And I…

1096
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,244
I thought
that you wouldn't like any of this.

1097
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,413
And then I kept thinking that
you wouldn't wanna be with a girl like me.

1098
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,416
So I felt like I couldn't come
and talk to you about this alone.

1099
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,334
Mmm.

1100
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:21,255
You say you like me, but I don't know
how you can when I treat you this way.

1101
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,216
It's like…

1102
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,845
I don't think
I can even really do anything.

1103
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:32,349
Like, I don't know how to clean,
and I don't know how to cook…

1104
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,143
- Yeah.
- …and I don't know how to do laundry.

1105
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:40,148
But, like, I could do those things
if I liked someone.

1106
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,608
I remember you saying that.

1107
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,028
- And with you, I always…
- Mmm.

1108
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,698
You always tell me straight up
when you don't wanna do something.

1109
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,450
- Yeah.
- And that makes me wanna do things.

1110
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,161
- Oh. Mmm.
- I feel like I have to do it for you.

1111
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,622
And doing stuff like that
really helps me grow, you know?

1112
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,708
- I get it.
- When there's only one person

1113
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,460
who I feel like
I wanna do these things for.

1114
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,378
Oh.

1115
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:06,717
And so I think I was just, like,
"Why is he going for a pretty girl again?"

1116
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,135
Oh.

1117
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,095
It's always about the face after all.

1118
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,763
No, it's not about that though.

1119
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,641
Well, I'm sure you care
about what's on the inside.

1120
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,601
But it's like…

1121
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,353
- Like… It's like with Kii.
- Mmm.

1122
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,397
- And, like, with Baby and Tekarin.
- Mmm.

1123
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,941
All of them were very open
about sharing their pasts

1124
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,152
and the difficult things
they had to go through.

1125
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,112
- Mmm.
- But then, when it comes to Amo,

1126
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,573
she won't even talk
about any of that stuff.

1127
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,577
Also, I just figured that you'd end up
going for a beautiful woman like her.

1128
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,494
Mmm.

1129
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,998
- <i>Wait, why?</i>
- <i>She's starting to push it.</i>

1130
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,836
At the end of the day,
you don't wanna be with someone

1131
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,172
who has all this baggage
weighing them down.

1132
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,549
- That's how I think about it.
- Mmm.

1133
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,344
Okay, I'm not gonna cry anymore.

1134
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,721
- Mmm.
- So please just let me hold your hand.

1135
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,389
Okay.

1136
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,474
<i>Uh, uh, uh.</i>

1137
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,893
<i>And doing that</i>
<i>right in front of her too. Wow.</i>

1138
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,519
<i>Well, this is quite the scene.</i>
