00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,132
SATO AKA MILK (22)

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,176
Are you in a bad mood?
The sauna was great.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,178
NISHIZAWA ISAMU AKA YANBOH (30) - RAPPER

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,638
Are you jealous?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,557
- Well…
- Go that way.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,643
If you're gonna talk to Yanboh,
go over there.

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,812
- Stop, your feet are dirty.
- I don't care.

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,064
- Go around the table, that way.
- Okay, well…

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,235
Don't mess with me. I'll kill you.

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,738
I'm serious. Don't.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,406
I'll kick your ass.

12
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,326
I mean it. Don't mess with me.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,790
We talked about a lot of things.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,628
I said I'd prove myself to her.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,713
Okay.

16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,551
Anything else?

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,344
The sauna was awesome.

18
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,180
- Ah…
- It's pretty small, though.

19
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,141
I don't think all of us
could fit inside at the same time.

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,354
It's very small. I guess
you'll find out when you're invited.

21
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,569
PLANNER & PRODUCER
MEGUMI

22
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,112
NAGANO

23
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,325
Yanboh was definitely very upset.

24
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,577
That's what I was thinking the whole time.

25
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,954
Yanboh was really angry.

26
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,331
He was drinking a lot too.

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,373
KIREI AKA KIICHAN (23)

28
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,541
He was so pissed.

29
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,459
YURIA AKA BABY (25)

30
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,585
Was he mad at me?

31
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,921
- No, he was mad at all of us.
- Wait. Why?

32
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,006
Because he kept going around to everyone,

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,051
and was like,
"Why didn't anyone circle me?"

34
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,095
I feel like if you got an X,
you were being told

35
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,180
that the other guys are better than you.

36
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,642
I got all X's, so I was basically
being told "you're not good enough."

37
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,685
And that really,

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,938
really pissed me off.

39
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,273
I haven't been this pissed off
in a long time.

40
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,026
My name is Isamu, and I'm 30 years old.

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,903
I'm from Kyoto.

42
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,154
I did go to college.

43
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,448
I went to a well-known
university in Kansai.

44
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,410
But ultimately, I became
an intellectual <i>yakuza.</i>

45
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,581
Eventually, I got busted for violating
the Cannabis Control Act,

46
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,917
and it was very embarrassing for me.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,585
I remember my parents' faces.

48
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,503
Hmm.

49
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,005
I caused a lot of trouble
for a lot of people.

50
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,968
I decided I needed to turn my life around.

51
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,350
I had a lot of fun yesterday.
Thank you for that.

52
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,977
Absolutely. Thank you.

53
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,436
You like the sauna?

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,772
It was amazing.
You should really try it out.

55
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,649
You all should.

56
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,152
- You keep saying that.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,737
- It was that good?
- It really was.

58
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,751
<i>Today, one of the boys</i>
<i>will ask one of the girls on a date.</i>

59
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>Whichever boy wins the upcoming duel</i>

60
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,798
<i>will be able to ask out</i>
<i>whichever girl he wants.</i>

61
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,010
- That's how it works?
- What kind of duel?

62
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,344
Hold on a second.

63
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,680
- That's right, because…
- What does that mean?

64
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,017
Well, we wanted them to go
head-to-head, to keep it simple.

65
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>For the couple, we've prepared</i>

66
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,813
<i>a Japanese cuisine dinner date.</i>

67
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,732
- What kind of date?
- Japanese food.

68
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,359
- That sounds really good.
- Japanese food?

69
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,988
<i>And the duel for today</i>
<i>is hand-pushing sumo.</i>

70
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,615
- Yes!
- That's cute.

71
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
Hand-pushing sumo.

72
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,328
<i>The first person</i>
<i>to step off their line is the loser.</i>

73
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,412
<i>Does what first?</i>

74
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,625
Hey, the tournament bracket is
over here, guys. Here on the blackboard.

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,543
Let them pick the matchups.

76
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,503
- That's looking good.
- Okay.

77
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,089
Yes, that is perfect. Perfect matchups.

78
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,925
These two have beef. Had to do it.

79
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,509
Here it is.

80
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,428
Yeah. Tsukahara, of course.

81
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,138
Go, Nisei!

82
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,057
Ready, set… go!

83
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,642
ROUND ONE - TSU-CHAN VS. NISEI

84
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,101
Come on, let's go!

85
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,062
Oh, come on, come on, come on! Loser!

86
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,647
- Not good.
- Funny.

87
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,315
Come on, man up!

88
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,025
Hey, hey, hey!

89
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,943
NISEI WINS

90
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,236
- He sucks.
- Come on!

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,529
- Were you even trying?
- You're kidding me.

92
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,281
I give up.

93
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,034
- Nisei wins.
- You got nothing.

94
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,494
How'd you lose so badly?

95
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,995
Okay, we'll go.

96
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,623
- We'll go next.
- This should be most exciting.

97
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,333
She's watching.

98
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,251
MILK VS. YANBOH

99
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,794
There's no way I'm losing this.

100
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,838
I'm a man. It doesn't matter if I lose,
'cause I'll win the next one.

101
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,674
- Yeah, yeah.
- I really hate losing.

102
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,593
Ready… go!

103
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,096
Whoa.

104
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,430
He's strong.

105
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,474
- Yeah.
- Every time.

106
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,437
- I don't know who's gonna win.
- He's knocking him over.

107
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,022
Let's go, let's go!

108
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,276
- What a weak-ass fight. Come on!
- They're doing it for Baby.

109
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,443
Come on. Come on.

110
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,778
There it is! Finally!

111
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,737
MILK WINS

112
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,072
Milk's really strong.

113
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, wow!

114
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,659
How is everything going
to play out after that?

115
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,495
- Yanboh just lost again. He keeps losing.
- That was crazy.

116
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,163
That's what I'm talking about.

117
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,790
- All talk, no action!
- Yeah.

118
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,293
Wait, I haven't heard "I give up" yet.

119
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,461
- I give up.
- He took it like a man.

120
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,214
- Very good. Very good.
- You're a good sport.

121
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,633
All right, let's go.

122
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,801
<i>Damn it!</i>

123
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,594
<i>I'm so frustrated.</i>

124
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,097
The timing was going
to be absolutely perfect.

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,558
When I was talking to Baby yesterday,

126
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,061
<i>I asked her what she wanted to eat,</i>
<i>and she said Japanese food.</i>

127
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>So if I had won this,</i>

128
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>I would have asked her out</i>
<i>and we would've had it together.</i>

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,363
- Show him what you got.
- I'll show him.

130
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,614
Here we go.

131
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,116
ROUND THREE - TACKLE VS. NISEI

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,784
All right, let's go.

133
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,662
Ready? Go!

134
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,457
Oh, my God!

135
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,751
Tackle's so strong. Wow, he's so strong.

136
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,710
TACKLE WINS

137
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,671
Nisei going down like that
makes me look like a wimp.

138
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
You better go win this whole thing now.

139
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,091
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

140
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,886
It's gotta look like
I lost to the strongest guy.

141
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,305
I'm rooting for you now.
Make sure you win.

142
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,556
FINAL - TACKLE VS. MILK

143
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,891
Okay, then. Final round.

144
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,934
Ready, set, go!

145
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,270
Oh, there it is. Okay.

146
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,817
- Nice core strength, Tackle.
- He's really good at dodging.

147
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
Yeah. He's definitely strong.
I can see that.

148
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,321
What are you doing?

149
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,031
- Oh!
- He's strong!

150
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,991
- Okay, very nice.
- Nice.

151
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,618
You got that one. I give up.

152
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,787
- Yo.
- He just went, "Yo."

153
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,955
Congratulations, Tackle.

154
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,166
Well, that was a quick one.

155
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,584
Man, you're strong.

156
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,461
<i>And the winner is Tackle.</i>

157
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,798
<i>He may now choose one of the girls</i>
<i>to go on a date with him.</i>

158
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,550
- Tackle is going to choose…
- Hurry up and choose, man.

159
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,636
Kii!

160
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,929
Kii!

161
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,431
- Of course it is.
- I knew he'd pick her.

162
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,809
- He's been looking at her a lot.
- You wanna have a match?

163
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,060
You guys go head-to-head.

164
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,687
- Tackle, you against Kii.
- Just do it.

165
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,814
- Here.
- Oh, no!

166
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,815
That was so cute.

167
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,402
- There we go. Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, do your thing.

168
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,196
- Would you like to go on this date?
- I would love to.

169
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,032
- You guys have fun.
- We're heading off.

170
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,707
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

171
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,751
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

172
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,087
I'LL WALK MY OWN PATH.
NOBODY CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE

173
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,590
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

174
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,926
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

175
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,178
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

176
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,514
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

177
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,599
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

178
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,601
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

179
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,322
MOUNT TAKAO - GONSUKE

180
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,783
It's hot.

181
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,368
Sorry to keep you waiting.

182
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,620
- There you are.
- Oh, what'd you bring?

183
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,331
I brought this because
there's fish and ducks here.

184
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,833
Oh? You serious?

185
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,502
- You can feed them too.
- Yeah, I'd love to.

186
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,004
Do you know where they are?

187
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,213
They're over there.

188
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,507
- Here. Watch your step.
- Yeah.

189
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,550
Oh!

190
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,261
- Koi!
- Want to try?

191
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,512
Yeah, I do.

192
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,139
Oh! Oh, look at the ducks.

193
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,891
Quack.

194
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,100
Quack.

195
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,060
- Oh!
- Very cute.

196
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,521
Hold on, guys. I have food.

197
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,231
I used to have a pet duck.

198
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,025
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

199
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,068
- At your parents'?
- Yeah.

200
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,196
And I would give him dried corn.

201
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,198
<i>These two look good together.</i>

202
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,616
Want to wipe your hands?

203
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,825
- I do.
- I have wipes.

204
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
<i>Look at that. Nice.</i>

205
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,454
- Brought some for us.
- You're thoughtful.

206
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:20,208
You know, I've always felt like
you're very considerate.

207
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,294
- After you.
- Oh, wow!

208
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,837
- This looks amazing.
- Awesome.

209
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,089
- It's so well-prepared.
- Are you kidding me?

210
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,842
- This is incredible.
- And we're side by side.

211
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,887
Yeah, this is great.
And it's really private.

212
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,430
Amazing.

213
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,058
I've been craving this.
This is such a great date.

214
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,269
- Thank you for the meal.
- Let's eat!

215
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,439
- Wow.
- Mmm.

216
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,193
This is gonna be the best food
I have the entire time I'm here.

217
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,110
TACKLE (24)

218
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,529
- It's so tender.
- I'm so happy.

219
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,280
- I want to get this to go.
- Mmm-hmm.

220
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,282
What kind of girls are you into?

221
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,494
The ones who are outspoken
and know what they want.

222
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,870
A <i>gyaru.</i>

223
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,457
Your contacts are different.

224
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,167
I wear different colored ones every day.

225
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,127
- I noticed.
- Nice. Then say that.

226
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,838
I should start saying that stuff out loud.

227
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,007
You definitely should. You're very shy.

228
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,718
I'm different once I get to know someone.

229
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,596
I still don't think
you've really opened up yet, though.

230
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,847
Ah!

231
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,309
I'd love to see how you act
when you're head over heels for someone.

232
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,564
Well, you're definitely my number one.

233
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,941
- <i>Oh, wow!</i>
- <i>Ah!</i>

234
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,154
You've got good taste…

235
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
Mmm, because you picked me.

236
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,326
- I have good taste.
- Yeah, I knew you had good taste.

237
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,247
I really like it when you get that look
on your face. Your eyes are so powerful.

238
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,165
Everyone always talks about my eyes.

239
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,917
Your eyes are really attractive.

240
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,378
- It's always the eyes.
- I could stare at them forever.

241
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,880
And I think your glasses
fit you perfectly too.

242
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,508
Oh, my God, those eyes.

243
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,218
They're perfect.

244
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,261
Amazing.

245
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,684
You're obsessed. You're fangirling.

246
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,730
You're so cute.

247
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,023
<i>She looks happy.</i>

248
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,441
You're fangirling for me.

249
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,776
You're thinking out loud.

250
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,236
- I am?
- Mmm-hmm.

251
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,363
You're acting like a little puppy.

252
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,700
I can always feel
his pretty eyes staring at me.

253
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
<i>He can't take his eyes off me.</i>

254
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,786
FIRST DATE

255
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,830
<i>I started thinking he was gonna eat me.</i>

256
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,041
<i>She thought he was gonna eat her.</i>

257
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,793
I thought he was actually really cute.

258
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,129
She was worried she was gonna get eaten.

259
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,381
By your romantic partner.

260
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,134
Hey, speaking of Tackle, those matches?

261
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,719
<i>Yeah, the tournament.</i>

262
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,137
<i>He looked really strong.</i>

263
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,139
What do you expect
from a bonsai culturist?

264
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,182
He's deeply rooted.

265
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,059
- Rooted…
- This guy can't help it,

266
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,727
having all these jokes come out of him.

267
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,520
You're so quick. Very smart.

268
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,606
- You say something clever every time.
- Very smart.

269
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,149
It is really amazing, though.

270
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,234
Tackle was always so shy and quiet.

271
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,029
But when it was just the two
of them together? Completely different.

272
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,240
He's not that shy though, the way
he could just lock his eyes on her.

273
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,118
<i>When I'm with someone I like,</i>
<i>I feel like I can talk to them.</i>

274
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>But keeping eye contact with them</i>
<i>is a different story.</i>

275
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,624
- Totally.
- Looking around everywhere instead.

276
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,043
But Tackle was able
to look at her so directly.

277
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
It's like he's in his own world.

278
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,672
Maybe he's had his sights
set on her the whole time.

279
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,632
Everyone's been really direct so far.

280
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,218
They've all been direct
when they're interested in someone.

281
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,598
BADLY IN LOVE ACADEMY

282
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,225
<i>Attention, everyone.</i>

283
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,312
<i>The day before your graduation,</i>
<i>you will all participate in a team event</i>

284
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>- that'll take place at a unique location.</i>
- What?

285
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,566
We're confessing already?

286
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,819
No, but I think it's some kind of task.

287
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,698
<i>All right, everybody,</i>
<i>let's go check this place out.</i>

288
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,617
So where is this place?

289
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,411
- Where is it?
- That blue shop.

290
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,996
They're all blue, though.

291
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,873
I think probably Cafe Chocolate?

292
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, everyone.

293
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,128
Welcome. I was waiting for you guys.

294
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,796
- Hi, everyone.
- Thank you.

295
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,923
- Thanks.
- I have a letter for you.

296
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,299
Oh, awesome.

297
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,637
Okay, I'll read it. It says, "To everyone
who has been rejected by society."

298
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,055
That's a bit too much.

299
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,890
- I wouldn't say that.
- That's harsh.

300
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,435
"To everyone rejected by society,

301
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,396
there was something that
we'd like you all to organize."

302
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,897
We're organizing?

303
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,568
"Children are able to come
to our cafe and eat and feel safe."

304
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,197
<i>We would like you all</i>
<i>to organize and to host an event</i>

305
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,950
<i>for kids at this cafe,</i>
<i>one day before your graduation.</i>

306
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>That's very wholesome.</i>

307
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,371
<i>We believe that there are some things</i>

308
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,498
<i>that only you guys can do,</i>

309
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,209
<i>because your life experiences</i>
<i>have made you feel pain</i>

310
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,211
<i>and empathize with the pain of others.</i>

311
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,840
- That was really nice.
- Thank you.

312
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,799
SYOKO - OWNER

313
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,136
The place next door is where
the kids hang out. Right over here.

314
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,095
Oh, look.

315
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,099
You guys are welcome to use
this space to discuss and get organized.

316
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,184
Very cool.

317
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,935
- It's big.
- Nice space.

318
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,896
- This should work well.
- Hello.

319
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,897
Hello!

320
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,023
Hi, there.

321
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,567
So, Mona, tell me,
what's your favorite food?

322
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,694
I would say watermelon or strawberry.

323
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,945
Watermelon and strawberry.

324
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,572
- You have good taste.
- Amazing.

325
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,907
What's your favorite color?

326
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,075
- I like pink.
- Pink? Makes sense.

327
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>I like kids a lot. I've always</i>
<i>enjoyed spending time with them,</i>

328
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,957
and I used to want to work in childcare…

329
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,000
TEKARIN (21)

330
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,669
…but I just don't think
it really suited me.

331
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,589
Not necessarily the job itself,
but more so the studying.

332
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,385
So today, when I was there at the cafe
with the kids, I said to myself,

333
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,638
"I could learn a lot
from this experience."

334
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,224
There's three of you. Wanna play?

335
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,684
- Let's fight!
- That sounds good to me!

336
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,896
That's my specialty!
I can show you my big finisher.

337
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,022
Let's see it.

338
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,149
This big guy is saying
he's gonna beat me up!

339
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,944
Oh, you're done for,
saying stuff like that!

340
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,739
This generation of kids, man.
He said that I was gonna beat him up.

341
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,450
You guys are idiots.
You gotta figure yourselves out.

342
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,702
<i>Look at how sweet he's being.</i>

343
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,746
Really? You're able to eat that much?

344
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,248
Come on, guys.

345
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,542
How does "red light, green light"
work again?

346
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,126
- I want to be "it"!
- You wanna be it?

347
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,461
If you move, you lose, right?

348
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,423
I really didn't expect to see
Yanboh playing with the kids. It was nice.

349
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,260
<i>I just… thought it was great.</i>

350
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,887
<i>And I was just like, "That's awesome."</i>

351
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,973
I really liked seeing him like that.

352
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,267
I had a good time.

353
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,311
And I think the kids were all
having a good time as well.

354
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,897
I'm not sure why
these kids come to the cafe,

355
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,900
but I guess it's because
they're lonely to some extent,

356
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,487
and they're probably looking to connect
and interact with other people.

357
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,282
So I thought I could do that.
I can play with them.

358
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,910
I think the kids are
pretty happy having decorations,

359
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,996
food, gifts and games here.

360
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,039
What if we did festival booths?

361
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,752
We could have it be summer-themed,
and the kids can eat whatever they want.

362
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,088
Yeah, that would solve
how we should decorate.

363
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,841
- Maybe the scoop game?
- Good idea.

364
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,218
Don't kids like those yo-yo balloons?

365
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,887
Oh, yeah, they might like that.

366
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,599
We could do a raffle or something,
and we can all make little badges.

367
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,685
- You can put things on the walls.
- We wanna do a summer festival.

368
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,438
It's so hot outside. Feel free
to use the walls for decorations.

369
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,689
Can I paint this wall?

370
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,816
Sure. What do you want to paint on there?

371
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,026
- I can?
- Yeah.

372
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,611
- That's great!
- Your time to shine.

373
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,987
That's right. Thank you.

374
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,281
- Over here too.
- Here comes the painter.

375
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,991
I think go with the white first.

376
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,868
Sure. Let's do another coat of white.

377
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,621
Because it will help
the fireworks stand out more.

378
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,583
<i>I really wanted to make the space</i>
<i>become memorable for all of the kids.</i>

379
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,918
KIDS' ROOM
BY VARIETY CLUB

380
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,419
<i>That's what I wanted to do.</i>

381
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,256
I grew up in a children's home,
with a rough childhood before that.

382
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,594
Like, I didn't have any food to eat
at my house, and I had no money either,

383
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,387
so I had to figure something out.

384
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,890
So I would find these little river snails.

385
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,893
I would grab some of these snails

386
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,021
and some wakame-like seaweed
that was just lying around,

387
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,148
that looked just edible enough.

388
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,152
So I threw them in a pot
of boiling water, and then I ate them.

389
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,987
I was in middle school.

390
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,990
That was before I ended up
going to the children's home.

391
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>I wanted our little room to become a place</i>

392
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,995
<i>these kids could look back</i>
<i>on one day and just go,</i>

393
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,207
<i>"Wow. Being at that place</i>
<i>really saved me."</i>

394
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,750
<i>That's what I was hoping for.</i>

395
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,585
You guys have some good ideas.

396
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,128
- We do.
- Great then.

397
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,091
I guess you could start preparing.
I look forward to seeing what you do.

398
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,050
Thank you!

399
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
- No problem!
- Goodbye!

400
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,011
- Take care.
- Good luck with the studying.

401
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,972
Good luck with your preparations.

402
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,974
- Thank you.
- Let's get started.

403
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,768
It seemed to me
like they all started working

404
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,895
really well together there at the cafe.

405
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,439
I think that people will show
who they really are

406
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,525
when they're interacting with children.

407
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,069
But also, remember
that some of them grew up

408
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,155
in really difficult circumstances
when they were kids.

409
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,700
So they can understand
how it feels to be in their shoes.

410
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,742
Right, like Baby.

411
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,079
She said she used to eat
boiled seaweed and river snails.

412
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,081
- Unbelievable.
- I just want her to end up

413
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,709
happy more than anything,
and for her to find a good man,

414
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,378
whether that be Milk
or somebody else, right?

415
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,880
- For sure.
- So, in reality dating shows,

416
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,258
have any couples ended up together
and gotten married?

417
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,260
- Yeah. Of course they've been.
- Yeah?

418
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,804
So it happens. She could end up with Milk,

419
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,973
and if he makes Baby cry after everything

420
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,143
that she's been through in her life,
I'll beat him up myself.

421
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,437
Oh, my. Please do.

422
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,439
We can also do those hoop games.

423
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,440
Good idea.

424
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,358
Everybody, look up at the board.

425
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,153
Does anybody want to claim
one of these and make a sign?

426
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,156
- I'll do the shaved ice.
- Okay, you'll be Mr. Shaved Ice.

427
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,117
- I want to do the popcorn.
- Okay, you'll be Miss Popcorn.

428
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,494
- Cotton candy.
- Mr. Cotton Candy.

429
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,704
I want to do cotton candy.

430
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,623
- Cotton candy for Baby.
- <i>With Milk again?</i>

431
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,753
- You two working together, huh?
- I'll make the cotton candy sign.

432
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,171
Do it with Baby.

433
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,465
- <i>He does not like it.</i>
- <i>He does not.</i>

434
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,383
<i>That really pissed me off.</i>

435
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,262
But if I'm being honest with myself,
I knew she'd go for somebody else.

436
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,390
And it's not because I got
all those X's, but the girls…

437
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,518
I just didn't feel like
talking to them today.

438
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,103
You know? I just…

439
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,066
I mean, I'm just trying my best.

440
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,986
And if they don't get that, then I'm just
gonna be, like, whatever, you know?

441
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,448
I mean, I'm not sulking
or anything like that.

442
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,659
It's pretty hard, isn't it?

443
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,036
SUPER BALL - YO-YO FISHING

444
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,872
- That's so cute!
- Someone who looks like you can make that?

445
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,290
<i>Look what he drew!</i>

446
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>- That is really cute.</i>
- <i>Look at that sign.</i>

447
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,253
- Look!
- That's genius.

448
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,380
- Look at this!
- That one stands out.

449
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,591
Oh, that looks so adorable.

450
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,927
- I found the violet.
- Violet is still purple, right?

451
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,553
- It's violet.
- I just used the violet.

452
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,264
- You just used this one? The violet?
- Violet.

453
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,058
Same one again.

454
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,985
Hey, do you think I should
paint this area over here too?

455
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,320
<i>Oh!</i>

456
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,323
- The border?
- Yeah, it doesn't look the same.

457
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,451
- This right here is a little…
- You want that to stand out?

458
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,452
I don't know.

459
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,747
This looks like calligraphy.
So maybe this should be cute.

460
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,083
What color should I use
for this, blue maybe?

461
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,503
<i>I was pretty annoyed</i>
<i>with Yanboh today, honestly,</i>

462
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,755
After the way he flipped out yesterday,

463
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,883
<i>and then, today, he hasn't</i>
<i>even talked to Baby once.</i>

464
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,927
<i>It's like, "Come on, just be cool."</i>

465
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,638
That's what I thought.

466
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,557
<i>He doesn't want to show he's upset.</i>

467
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,058
This is getting better.

468
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
But even like this, it's still beautiful.

469
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,146
- No.
- Oh, okay.

470
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,480
No, you don't think that.

471
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,482
I'm making good progress on this.

472
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,942
<i>Look at all these.</i>

473
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,528
- <i>Did these guys draw these?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

474
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,029
<i>They're all good at drawing.</i>

475
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,574
<i>And all these signs look so heartwarming.</i>

476
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,993
- <i>They do.</i>
- <i>They're all a bit melancholy.</i>

477
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,412
- <i>Definitely.</i>
- Shaved ice is the best one.

478
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,872
Hoop toss looks lazy.

479
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,000
- There's just nothing to the hoop toss.
- Okay, okay.

480
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,919
The way they wrote "yakisoba"
has a lot of character.

481
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
I kind of had feelings
for him at some point,

482
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,215
but I'm just like,
"Why is he such a loser?"

483
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,853
Just look at the yakisoba sign.

484
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,479
- It looks so pitiful.
- It looks sad!

485
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,523
- Just radiating sadness.
- Looks really miserable.

486
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,774
Look at the yakisoba.

487
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,359
I think Yanboh did that one.

488
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,320
- It was Yanboh.
- I knew it was Yanboh.

489
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,448
- It had to be, didn't it?
- I really want to hear him rap about this.

490
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,658
- Right? For sure!
- I'd be very curious to hear that.

491
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,411
- We're all a bit curious to hear him.
- We certainly are.

492
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,710
<i>It's time for the sauna.</i>

493
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,879
- <i>It's sauna time.</i>
- Sauna time?

494
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,840
<i>The girls will discuss</i>
<i>and decide which two people</i>

495
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,967
<i>will be going into the sauna today.</i>

496
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,470
I like that the girls get to choose.

497
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,555
Next time, we'll get to choose, right?

498
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,557
Guys have decided already.

499
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,060
I got to go yesterday, so…

500
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,145
I'm fine either way.

501
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,438
Go for it.

502
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,612
- Hey, guys, want to play some darts?
- While they're talking?

503
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,615
How about you guys
go over there while we talk?

504
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,117
All right, let's do it, guys. Let's play.

505
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,827
- Okay.
- What are you gonna do?

506
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,498
Remember earlier today when we were
all doing that thing with the wall?

507
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,669
Right, so at that point, I was
actually feeling pretty good about,

508
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,714
and honestly, having feelings
for Yanboh, the Boss.

509
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,675
Well, that changed.

510
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,886
I'm just not gonna keep having feelings
for a guy if he's lame.

511
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,139
Like yesterday,
he got so angry about Baby.

512
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,141
<i>Then today, he hasn't</i>
<i>even talked to her once.</i>

513
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>I don't know if it's his pride or what.</i>

514
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>That honestly gave me the ick,</i>
<i>and I felt disgusted.</i>

515
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,523
- <i>That's why?</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

516
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,401
Why not just try and settle it
one-on-one, naked in the sauna?

517
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,279
- So you think I should--
- Be like, "You really pissed me off, man."

518
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,114
Be like, "Well, I kind of like you."

519
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,573
Sure. Yeah.

520
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,700
We have a decision.

521
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,702
- Great.
- All right!

522
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
Great.

523
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,541
So, today, Tekarin has decided
she wants to go to the sauna with…

524
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,795
Boss!

525
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,047
- You mean me?
- Yes.

526
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,340
- Cool.
- Have fun.

527
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,758
This is gonna be fire.

528
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,178
You'll probably want a drink,
but hang out with me, just for a bit.

529
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,888
Afterwards, we can have a drink.

530
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,558
REFRESHED

531
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,767
SAUNA

532
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,602
Whoa! This is amazing.

533
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,396
What?!

534
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,357
This is awesome.

535
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,442
Oh, wow.

536
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,319
This is so cool!

537
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,123
- This is crazy.
- This is so funny.

538
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,959
- <i>This is like a hot spring.</i>
- This is cool.

539
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,253
A traditional loincloth.

540
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,048
This is what everybody
around the world really wants to see.

541
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,342
Here on Netflix.

542
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,259
Japanese <i>Yankii.</i>

543
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,096
I have heard that apparently, this
Japanese <i>Yankii </i>wears this all the time.

544
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,390
- You've got to be kidding?
- He wears this every day.

545
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,391
Wait, actually?

546
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,268
Excuse me.

547
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,520
Whoa. It's actually really hot in here.

548
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,482
- Like, it's really hot.
- Awesome.

549
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,859
Thanks for picking me.

550
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,111
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you for giving me this chance.

551
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,780
I don't mean this in a bad way,

552
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,449
but if I'm being honest,
I'm not that into anyone.

553
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,494
There's nobody
that I'm really romantically attracted to.

554
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,995
- There's nobody?
- No. No one.

555
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,330
Not anyone?

556
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,749
But actually, if we're just talking

557
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,294
about physical attractiveness,
you're definitely my type.

558
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,546
Right, but you gave me a big X.

559
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,008
Okay, well, that's true,
but I thought that you liked Baby, so…

560
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,594
- I mean, yeah, I did say that I liked her.
- Hmm.

561
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,263
I was definitely telling
the truth about that.

562
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,475
I was wondering why you didn't go up
and talk to her at all today.

563
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,977
Ever since this morning,
I haven't been in a good mood.

564
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,104
Were you tired?

565
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,231
No, it's just because
I'm really competitive.

566
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,108
I got stressed from losing all the time.

567
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>First, I got all X's yesterday,</i>
<i>and then I lost in the hand-pushing sumo,</i>

568
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,697
<i>and I was already</i>
<i>pissed off at that point.</i>

569
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,908
<i>- But it's my fault, like…</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

570
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,577
It's not fair
to take that out on everyone.

571
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,538
I knew that wasn't fair of me,

572
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,498
- but I was holding it all in.
- Right.

573
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,876
<i>So I decided to just shut up,</i>
<i>for everyone else's sake.</i>

574
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,421
<i>So even if I had decided</i>
<i>to talk to her today,</i>

575
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,423
I think I would have
just been so negative,

576
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,258
and I would've probably ruined the mood.

577
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,718
So I decided I was just gonna keep quiet.

578
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,429
- Yeah.
- So, yeah.

579
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,014
- Now you're able to reset in here.
- This has been great.

580
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,100
You really helped me out. So thank you.

581
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,519
- <i>He was being honest with her.</i>
- <i>Wasn't he?</i>

582
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,857
It's crazy.

583
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,568
All of the other girls here
look like they're models.

584
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,944
- It's so insane.
- Hmm.

585
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,362
All of them are so pretty.

586
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,740
And then, off to the side, there's
just this one ordinary-looking girl.

587
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,034
Honestly, I'd put you
right there up with them.

588
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,578
- <i>Oh! Okay.</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

589
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,246
I'm just staying positive.

590
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,498
- Really?
- I'm still kind of pissed.

591
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,417
But I'm not gonna let that get me down.

592
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,711
- You'll use it as fuel, right?
- Yes, exactly.

593
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,630
Just 'cause nobody picked me
doesn't mean I don't have what it takes.

594
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,090
They just don't get me yet.

595
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,884
So it's up to me
to make sure that they do.

596
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,845
- <i>Okay, I see.</i>
- Wait, what? It's so cold!

597
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,597
- Go ahead.
- It's so cold!

598
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,561
It feels good, but I want to die.

599
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,231
I am glad that I got picked.

600
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,942
Kii and all of the other girls

601
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,361
were just, like,
"You should be the one to go."

602
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,449
If you're ever feeling down,
just let me know…

603
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,783
I don't get down a lot.

604
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,868
…I'll cheer you up.

605
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,453
I'm kind of getting used to it.

606
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,497
Everybody's like that with me at first.

607
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,917
But hang out with me long enough
and your confidence will skyrocket.

608
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,044
People even start getting cocky.

609
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,962
I noticed this would
happen with my juniors.

610
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,507
- Overconfident?
- So I'd have to smack them out of it.

611
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,259
But they were so cocky, they'd
never back down, even if I hit them.

612
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,720
- So cocky.
- They'd be like, "I'm still gonna do it."

613
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,015
They were so cocky, they'd be like,
"I don't even care if Isamu hits me."

614
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,016
"I'm doing it."

615
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,102
That's the level they'd be at.
I thought it was awesome.

616
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,813
- It's all about your mindset.
- Mmm.

617
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,274
Oh, man!

618
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,944
- Wow.
- Feels good?

619
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
Hell, yeah. I feel way more relaxed.

620
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,700
- Worked out perfectly, didn't it?
- Yeah. Thank you again.

621
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,785
Sure.

622
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,996
<i>He kept thanking me.</i>
<i>He was completely different.</i>

623
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,374
It was such a turn on. I don't know.

624
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,417
I just thought he was so cute.

625
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,004
I was like, "Wow." I didn't think
he was the "thanking" type.

626
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,591
So do I like him or what?
I don't know! Do I really like him?

627
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,134
Am I actually in love?

628
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,304
Oh, no! This is crazy. Am I being creepy?

629
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,432
The second we got to the sauna,
I was madly in love with him.

630
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,476
Hey, you gotta shake me out of this!

631
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,687
Well, that happened quickly.

632
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,605
- That was fast.
- That was quick.

633
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:10,443
It's not like I was holding
stuff in, but… I'm only human.

634
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,321
<i>It's not always easy for me</i>
<i>to keep my emotions in check.</i>

635
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,782
So, tonight, it was perfect timing for me.

636
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,784
She asked me at the perfect time.

637
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,995
<i>I'm feeling very thankful.</i>

638
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,415
<i>I think that Hikaru is really nice.</i>

639
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>She's adorable.</i>

640
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,338
Hey, Kii! The sauna is insane!

641
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,881
- Isn't it?
- Was it really?

642
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,341
I just, like…

643
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,385
I just got this really strange feeling.

644
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,637
- What?
- So cool.

645
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,057
Wait, I know exactly what you mean.
It's like magic, a magical sauna.

646
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,643
I don't know if it was magic,
but the first thing…

647
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,813
the very first thing he said
was, "I'm so glad you invited me."

648
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,897
"Thank you so much."

649
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,860
Right when he walked in, and so I was
just like, I can't be mad at him anymore.

650
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,987
Really? You didn't bring it up to him?

651
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,864
I was just like, "Wow,
he says 'thank you.'"

652
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,908
You thought that?
That's what you were really thinking?

653
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,078
Him saying "thank you" was so cute.
You know what I mean?

654
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,289
But you get it, right?
The sauna sets the mood.

655
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,876
And if he acts differently than
how you'd expect, it just hits you.

656
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,210
I felt that too.

657
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,755
Well, I'm really happy.

658
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,007
Things are really starting to get going.

659
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,052
It seems like Tekarin is really
getting things started here, for sure.

660
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,596
<i>Oh, man, this is a great shot right here!</i>

661
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,682
- Look at their faces.
- They look in love, don't they?

662
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,893
I do jump a bit every time I see his body.

663
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,728
His face is in love.

664
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,980
But below his neck, it's scary.

665
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,440
- True.
- I get chills looking at it.

666
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,901
- Yanboh's awesome, don't you think?
- That's true.

667
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,987
He's really wearing his heart on his
sleeve. He's putting it all out there.

668
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,115
Really incredible to see.
I'm jealous of how he does this.

669
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,742
And Tekarin is great too.

670
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,286
- She's really great.
- She's straightforward too, for sure.

671
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,003
<i>The girls are going on a field trip.</i>

672
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,547
<i>You'll be going someplace</i>
<i>that you can unwind.</i>

673
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,965
<i>What's that mean?</i>

674
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,301
<i>Get dressed and let's get going.</i>

675
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,804
This sounds exciting.

676
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,307
OTO-SAN (22)

677
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,939
TEKARIN (21)

678
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,942
KIICHAN (23)

679
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,323
It's Kabukicho. We're here.

680
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,616
There's a Donki!

681
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,910
Oh, wait, it's a host bar.

682
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,080
So our field trip is
that we get to go to a host bar?

683
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,040
Wait, you really think so?

684
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,751
- Oh, wow, can you smell that?
- I love it.

685
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,837
So, which of these guys should I choose?

686
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,255
Which one?

687
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,424
There's no way.

688
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,050
No way. No way.

689
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,303
Oh, my gosh, you're right.
This is so crazy. Wow.

690
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,055
This is like a job interview.

691
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,391
This is so funny. A job interview, huh?

692
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,101
We have guests. Welcome!

693
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,396
<i>Look at them. They're so excited.</i>

694
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,356
Yeah, this is definitely a host bar.

695
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,483
- Let's do the usual.
- Let's do it.

696
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,235
Okay, let's start.

697
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,403
- Everyone…
- Everybody!

698
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,529
Raise up your glasses.

699
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,072
Cheers!

700
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,908
Cheers, everyone! Let's drink!

701
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,869
You got to drink it. Drink.

702
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,079
I get a feeling that
you're a dangerous type of girl

703
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,873
to get hooked on, for real.

704
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,292
No, I'm serious. I don't have any friends.

705
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,294
- Not one.
- Come on. Yes, you do.

706
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,964
I'll go out around here
sometimes. I have before, sometimes.

707
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,383
- This is so crazy.
- This is great.

708
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,594
- Thanks, you guys.
- Thank you.

709
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,848
Doesn't it kind of feel like
we're cheating while we're here?

710
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,350
- Those guys are amazing. And handsome.
- Yeah.

711
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,686
She likes them. She's got a crush already.

712
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,689
- She goes, "So amazing. So handsome."
- They really are handsome.

713
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,066
- Yeah, I wonder.
- Are they too different?

714
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,152
Probably not allowed.

715
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,119
I'm Tensei. I'm a transfer student.

716
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,454
Nice to meet you all.

717
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,080
- You're a…
- Yep, a transfer student.

718
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,540
- Transfer student?
- Yeah.

719
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,125
Wait, here? You transferred here?

720
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,545
Yes… Well, what I meant was
I'll be living with all of you.

721
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,339
What?!

722
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,507
Seriously?!

723
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,383
- Oh! No way!
- I know it.

724
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,469
- Wait. What does this mean?
- So funny!

725
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,555
I look forward to living
with all of you. Okay. May I sit down?

726
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,432
<i>I'm Tensei. I'm 25.</i>

727
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,310
Most people who know me call me Tenten.

728
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,063
I spent two years in juvenile correction.

729
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,442
I've done all the things
that you'd expect from a typical <i>Yankii.</i>

730
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,443
TENTEN (25)

731
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,529
Wait. Tenten?

732
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,447
Hold on.

733
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,074
- Wait.
- You recognize me?

734
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,993
- I thought so. Thank you.
- He said he thought so.

735
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,120
- I recognize you.
- We've never talked before.

736
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,705
We see each other at the bar, though.

737
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,124
That's right.
We see each other at the bar after work.

738
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,253
Wait, does a transfer student
mean that there'll be more guys?

739
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,963
- Really?
- There will be.

740
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,756
- So you're coming with us?
- I am.

741
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,633
- What?
- Don't say it like that!

742
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,094
Makes it sound like we're taking him home.

743
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,013
- I wonder if you'll fit in.
- Yeah. I'll fit in.

744
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,723
He's so different from everyone.

745
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,686
I wonder how the guys will react.
I wonder if they'll accept him.

746
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,145
- This is crazy.
- Is it?

747
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,399
- Everyone there is the opposite of you.
- Oh, I'll be just fine.

748
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,900
This means that you're a <i>Yankii?</i>

749
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,902
Yeah, I was in juvenile correction.

750
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,279
Okay, I see.

751
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,030
Wait. What will your patrons think?

752
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,740
They're supportive of my love life.

753
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,242
They're good customers, then.

754
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,618
Yeah.

755
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,079
<i>A lot of people are like,</i>
<i>"Oh, he works at a host bar."</i>

756
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,248
But I came here for a real relationship.

757
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,542
I feel confident.

758
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,504
If I can't find love as a host bar worker,
that'd be embarrassing.

759
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,799
I'm always the first one
to confess my feelings,

760
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,760
and I have a 100% success rate.

761
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,513
- <i>I can't say that.</i>
- I am definitely popular.

762
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,848
<i>"Definitely popular."</i>

763
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,225
I didn't want to say it myself, but yeah…

764
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,562
When I like someone,
I don't let them get away.

765
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,646
Yeah.

766
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,190
- So you actually work at a host bar?
- That's right.

767
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,818
But I'm just a regular guy.
A good-looking one, so…

768
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,737
- A good-looking one?
- That's right.

769
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,031
That helps. That helps.

770
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,408
What are you thinking about, Baby?

771
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,910
Me?

772
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,662
I'm just thinking about
how this is all gonna go down.

773
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,373
- I'll be totally fine.
- Maybe Milk will freak out.

774
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,001
- What if he disappears?
- He'll freak out.

775
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,502
He'll be like, "Baby, Baby, Baby…"

776
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,962
Let's play Pop-Up Pirate.

777
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>They're getting excited</i>
<i>over Pop-Up Pirate.</i>

778
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,216
My money's probably on Tsuu.

779
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,927
I'm gonna put these all in.

780
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,931
- Red, pop, pop, pop, pop!
- Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

781
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,933
Red's definitely gonna finish this.

782
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,143
- Weak! Weak!
- Oh, come on!

783
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,062
There were only two swords left.

784
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,647
I want to give him a hug.

785
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,273
He's so cute.

786
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,734
It's about to get tougher, guys.

787
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,278
- What if I wear a face mask?
- Oh, they'll hit you.

788
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,072
You'd get smacked.

789
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,660
Okay, listen up, everyone!

790
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:38,539
Tensei here is joining
Netflix's <i>Badly in Love!</i>

791
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,125
All right, now, everybody,
without further ado,

792
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:46,005
we present Tensei
with this final tower of champagne!

793
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,801
Everyone, give him a proper sendoff
with a big round of applause!

794
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,971
Let's go, let's go!

795
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,140
Go-go, let's go! Let's go, let's go!

796
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,644
Go-go, let's go! Let's go, let's go!

797
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,188
Thanks for this amazing champagne tower!

798
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,523
Thank you to everybody.

799
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,526
Let's go!

800
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,779
So, it turns out that this show
features quite a lot of delinquents.

801
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,532
But I'll show them I'm no joke, either.
Bring on <i>Badly in Love!</i>

802
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,574
Yay!

803
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,827
Thank you so much for that, Tensei!

804
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,286
Are we excited for him?

805
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,747
- Crazy.
- I can't hear you!

806
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,749
This was so fun, guys.

807
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,584
I was pouring the champagne out like this.

808
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,337
- This was my first time.
- This was insane.

809
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,049
Tensei seemed like he was very masculine,

810
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,385
and he seemed like
a very positive kind of guy.

811
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,804
So I have high hopes for him.

812
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,515
He really seemed like a true gentleman.

813
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,600
I think he's a fantastic guy.

814
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,563
I think probably
the other girls like Tensei.

815
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,940
But for me, he's just not my type at all.

816
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,193
Not at all.

817
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,862
I'm serious.

818
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,071
Not even a little.

819
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,783
Right now,
I'm the most interested in Yanboh.

820
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,870
<i>I guess I like older guys,</i>
<i>like 30-year-olds…</i>

821
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,580
<i>Wow, she's super focused on him.</i>

822
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,999
- <i>He's so lovable.</i>
- <i>She's really cute.</i>

823
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,668
<i>Yanboh's charming</i>
<i>in a different kind of way.</i>

824
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,670
Hey, guys, we're back!

825
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,380
- We're back, guys!
- Welcome back.

826
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,716
- Hello, ladies.
- Welcome, guys.

827
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,177
Welcome back.

828
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,054
- We're back.
- Hey, guys.

829
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,513
You guys have a good time?

830
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,015
Did you have a hat on?

831
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,141
Where did you guys go?

832
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,309
- We went…
- To Tokyo?

833
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,227
- Central Tokyo?
- Kabuki.

834
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,730
- Kabuki?
- You should've brought us along.

835
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,149
- Totally Shinjuku
- Deep in Kabuki.

836
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,568
So, what did you end up doing there?

837
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,363
- We went to a host bar.
- Seriously?

838
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,701
One of them working there
is gonna be a transfer student.

839
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,161
- Whoa!
- Wow.

840
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,580
- It's a guy?
- A new guy is coming.

841
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,166
- Yeah, it's a guy,
- Excuse me, guys. Sorry.

842
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,751
- Excuse me.
- Now?

843
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,669
- So, this is very sudden…
- Right now?

844
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,090
…but I do have an announcement
that I need to make to everybody.

845
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,885
So here it is.

846
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,304
The original plan was
for the transfer student,

847
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,390
the one you just met,
to join us right now.

848
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,226
Okay, go on.

849
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,103
However,

850
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,314
a very serious problem

851
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,275
has been brought to our attention.

852
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,820
So he will not be joining us today.

853
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,072
A serious problem?

854
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,866
All right, so now,

855
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,035
regarding that problem,

856
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,539
we do need to have
a very serious discussion.

857
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,586
Yanboh…

858
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,632
come to the classroom.

859
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,467
- Okay?
- Yeah.

860
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,719
- And please come alone.
- Okay, sure.

861
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,607
<i>Wait, what?</i>

862
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,733
<i>What?</i>

863
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,737
Ladies, hear anything about this?

864
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,323
- No, we haven't.
- We didn't hear anything. Nothing.

865
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,119
<i>We didn't hear anything</i>
<i>either. Nothing at all.</i>

866
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,620
<i>It sounded really serious.</i>

867
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,581
<i>We wanna know what's going on.</i>

868
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,915
<i>What is happening?</i>

869
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,209
- What?
- What happened?
