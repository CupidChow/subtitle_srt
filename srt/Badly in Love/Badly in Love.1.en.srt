- No!

BAD BITCH #3

167
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,390
<i>I never back down from a fight.</i>

168
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,517
<i>And I never lose.</i>

169
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,853
<i>Someone pissed me off in high school,</i>
<i>and I thought,</i>

170
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,522
<i>"I hate it here anyway,"</i>
<i>and shoved her down the stairs.</i>

171
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,609
<i>I want to experience something thrilling.</i>

172
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,986
HIKARU
AKA TEKARIN (21)

173
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,323
<i>I'm Tekarin, and I'm 21 years old.</i>

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>Guys without a mischievous side</i>
<i>aren't a whole lot of fun.</i>

175
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,331
Do I like him or what? I don't know.
Wait a second, am I actually in love?

176
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,838
- Here I come!
- Makes you nervous, right?

177
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,465
Hey there.

178
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,674
Hello.

179
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,343
Hello.

180
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,803
- Wow, this is embarrassing.
- I know.

181
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,640
- So embarrassing. I'm so nervous.
- It totally is.

182
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,683
Wait, is this all the guys?

183
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,228
- Don't know how many there are.
- Then I'll win this, I guess.

184
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,938
I have no idea.

185
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,449
BAD BITCH #4

186
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,868
<i>I used to bring a wooden sword to school.</i>

187
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,120
<i>I saw everyone as the enemy.</i>

188
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,873
<i>Like, "Is she glaring at me? I hate her."</i>

189
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,084
<i>I'd keep fighting</i>
<i>till one of us went down.</i>

190
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>Stuff like that happened all the time.</i>

191

KIREI
AKA KIICHAN (23)

192

<i>I'm Kii. I've got so much heart.</i>

193
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,759
<i>In life, I do what I feel.</i>

194
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,678
<i>I've got high hopes.</i>

195
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,597
I come with baggage, and to be honest,

196
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,476
I'd never choose a man who doesn't seem
like he can overcome that to be with me.

197
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,062
Whoa, nice to meet you all.

198
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,314
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

199
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,941
- I'm a <i>gyaru.</i>
- You totally are.

200
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,651
- That's cool.
- You are!

201
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,654
I feel like I fit right in here,
with this outfit.

202
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,572
Hey, it's the bell.

203
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,575
Haven't heard that in a long time.

204
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,037
<i>In this school,</i>

205
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,624
<i>you will learn the most</i>
<i>important thing in life, and that is love.</i>

206
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,838
<i>On the final day,</i>
<i>you must confess your love.</i>

207
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,591
<i>But remember, this is a school.</i>

208
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,886
<i>If you break the code of conduct,</i>
<i>you will be immediately expelled.</i>

209
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,221
NO VIOLENCE OR EARLY CONFESSION

210
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,472
Says, "Introduce yourselves."

211
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,474
Going for it.

212
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,310
I have a nickname.

213
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,812
Milkboy.

214
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,647
- Milkboy?
- That's cute.

215
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,735
- You know why I'm called that?
- I know, I know! Because you like milk?

216
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,945
- Correct!
- Seriously?

217
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,823
- For real?
- That's literally it. Milk.

218
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,908
- Nice handwriting.
- M…

219
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,162
He's in trouble.
He forgot how to write it.

220
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,788
What about those <i>kanji </i>characters?

221
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,958
- I like milk, so people call me "Milkboy".
- Oh!

222
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,793
Yeah, and I work as a carpenter.

223
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,795
- Wow.
- Wow, that's awesome.

224
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,132
- You're a craftsman.
- I'm a 30 series, with a good engine.

225
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,426
<i>"30 series"?! Is that how old he is?</i>

226
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,511
- You say it like a motorcycle.
- He's 30.

227
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
I like the elegant type, with long hair.

228
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,558
I'm Nisei Sakurai.

229
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,519
I run three different bars
in Kyoto and Osaka.

230
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,937
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

231
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,731
Call me Tackle, that's my nickname.

232
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,608
- Tackle.
- I'm a bonsai culturist.

233
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,651
- <i>That's amazing!</i>
- <i>Bon what?</i>

234
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,236
- <i>Bonsai.</i>
- <i>Cool.</i>

235
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,241
My hobby is martial arts,
which I just recently started.

236
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,203
- <i>What kind of martial arts?</i>
<i>- </i>U<i>nderground kickboxing.</i>

237
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,247
I want to start a lingerie brand
with traditional Japanese patterns.

238
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,124
- T<i>hat's cool.</i>
<i>- So right now,</i>

239
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>I'm studying at a lingerie design school.</i>

240
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,506
I also work at a nightclub
to pay off my student loans.

241
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,758
- <i>Yeah. She is.</i>
<i>- I admire her.</i>

242
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,218
I work as a painter.

243
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,928
- That's amazing.
- Wow.

244
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,387
<i>I've been through so much.</i>

245
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,934
I mostly grew up in a children's home,
and because of that experience,

246
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,811
I want someone with a big heart.

247
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,563
And I've always wanted someone
who would pamper me.

248
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,149
- So cute.
- Great to be here.

249
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,109
- Great to have you here.
- Thank you!

250
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,569
I'm a makeup instructor.

251
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,155
So I stand at a podium,
and teach classes for real.

252
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,825
- Wow. So cool.
- That's amazing.

253
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,743
I like a man who never gives up.

254
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,039
When I'm not feeling that love energy,
if it's not there for me,

255
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,251
I feel I can really trust a guy
who pushes forward,

256
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,212
- and doesn't give up on us.
- Mmm.

257
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,047
Let's all get along.

258
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,216
- Yes, let's.
- Thank you.

259
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,099
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

260
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,435
<i>What is this?</i>

261
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
BADASS #5 (LATE ARRIVAL)

262
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,523
<i>He was a little late showing up.</i>

263
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,569
<i>I chose a life of crime,</i>
<i>and became an intellectual </i>yakuza.

264
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>With turf wars breaking out,</i>
<i>I was constantly in a bulletproof vest.</i>

265
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,284
<i>It caused a lot of trouble for my family,</i>

266
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,452
<i>so I decided to leave that life behind.</i>

267
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>Now, I'm a rapper. My name's Isamu.</i>

268
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,040
<i>I'm 30 years old.</i>

269
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,500
ISAMU NISHIZAWA
AKA YANBOH (30)

270
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,794
<i>Once I find the one I'm meant to be with,</i>

271
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,963
I'd love to surprise her with something.

272
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,133
To be honest,
I'm already thinking about it.

273
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,010
I am so pissed.

274
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,469
Got a katana?

275
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,222
Hey, hold up. Seriously?

276
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,354
Sorry to barge in!

277
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,899
- You scared me.
- Whoa, hey, who's this?

278
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,402
Hey, everyone. Sorry, I'm late.
This was so far away.

279
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,947
- Okay, so, how we doing?
- The star makes his entrance.

280
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,617
Can't wait to get to know you.
Can I introduce myself?

281
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,912
- Sure.
- Normally, I'm a rapper.

282
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
<i>My rapper name is…</i>

283
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,918
<i>I'm smooth with the microphone</i>
<i>Call me 1-3-6 Young Boss</i>

284
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,545
Boom!

285
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,630
Thank you.

286
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,008
- "Yanboh."
- Call me Yanboh.

287
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,676
Come on, give it up!

288
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,803
Yanboh!

289
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,263
- Thank you.
- It's Yanboh.

290
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,806
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

291
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,683
- Nice to meet you.
- Only the girls?

292
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,852
- <i>They greet properly.</i>
- So powerful.

293
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,104
- Thank you.
- Man, you're a gentleman.

294
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,276
He's got a lot of tats.
He's so tatted up, you know?

295
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,363
Right, yeah, you just gotta get used it.
It takes a second, don't worry.

296
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,698
- I'm not used to it. Must be it.
- Yeah, he is.

297
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,744
So, this show was entirely my idea,
and I produced it.

298
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,704
You've got quite the imagination.

299
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,998
- But I like it.
- Yeah, you're right.

300
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,126
You know, these days,
day to day feels so tough already,

301
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,922
so it's hard to put yourself out there
and introduce yourself to new people.

302
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,132
It's like people overthink the approach,

303
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,219
and they start to worry
how the other person will react,

304
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,722
and then they end up
keeping their thoughts to themselves.

305
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
- True.
- I thought it'd be good

306
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,811
to build a show around people
that are already authentic.

307
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,397
Plus, young people
don't seem to fall in love as often.

308
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,982
They might meet on the apps.

309
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,275
But, in general,
they're scared of getting hurt.

310
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,986
- You know?
- Right.

311
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,781
A lot of them think romance is a hassle,
so they don't even bother trying.

312
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:35,285
I built this show hoping viewers would see
people exposing their true selves,

313
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,163
saying what they mean,
and going all in on love,

314
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,708
and hopefully,
think love really is worth it.

315
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,751
This is how it turned out,
it got a little wild.

316
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,421
- Thought it's a teaser for martial arts.
- That's what I thought!

317
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,131
That's what I was thinking too.

318
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,757
So, what do you think so far?

319
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,051
You may not have been a <i>Yankii,</i>
but I'd say,

320
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,221
AK, you must've been mischievous
at some point in your life, right?

321
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,724
- Not really.
- You definitely were.

322
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,893
To be honest, it did remind me
of my younger days.

323
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,187
- Oh, really?
- It did, yeah, you know?

324
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,107
- We'd start with a fight. At the start.
- Is that right?

325
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,985
Maybe we liked each other
and wanted to be friends.

326
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,362
But it started with,
"What are you looking at?"

327
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,364
- At the start?
- That's the way it goes.

328
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,658
Then you become friends
with the person you fought with.

329
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,371
- So it's a strange way of showing love.
- It's another way of showing love.

330
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,917
So, when the one with the dark sunglasses,
Tsuu, sat all the way in the back,

331
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,129
Big Bro immediately said,
<i>"Yankiis </i>always sit in the back."

332
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,423
- That surprised me.
- Why?

333
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,633
'Cause they don't want anyone
to be behind them.

334
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,011
- I just don't get that mindset, do you?
- Okay.

335
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,514
Tsuu was doing the reclining Buddha
in his chair, like this.

336
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,309
- He was.
- The what?

337
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,020
Sorry, I didn't understand
the slang you just used.

338
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,522
What do you mean by
"doing the reclining Buddha"?

339
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,650
- I've never heard that before.
- No one knew. I faked a smile.

340
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,027
Me too!

341
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,907
In this show, five men and four women
will be living together for two weeks,

342
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,910
and then, at the end,
the men will confess their feelings

343
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,369
at the graduation ceremony.

344
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,122
- I get it.
- That's the basic premise of this show.

345
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,084
Nagano, you don't like
reality dating shows, right?

346
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,170
Well, I have to admit,
this one seems watchable.

347
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,297
Really? Great news. Good to hear.

348
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,883
- It's full of passion, you know?
- It definitely is.

349
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,803
But remember,
this is a reality dating show.

350
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,805
- Okay.
- It's not some kind of brawl.

351
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,682
What's about to happen here
is all about romance.

352
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,019
I hope you'll stick around and see
what ends up happening with them all.

353
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,270
Yes, I can't wait.

354
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,983
<i>For the 14 days</i>
<i>that you will live together,</i>

355
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,444
<i>everyone will need</i>
<i>to work together to make dinner.</i>

356
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,530
Look, "Love Kitchen." Crazy.

357
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,992
Wow, it's cute.
Seriously, super cute. Wow!

358
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,286
- This is incredible.
- It's so cute!

359
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,705
Wow, look at this!
I like the high-tech vibe.

360
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,749
- It's super cute.
- I love it.

361
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,085
- It's like a café.
- It's so nice.

362
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,129
"Love Kitchen" is super cute. I love it!

363
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,213
Just like that?

364
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,132
We've got ground beef and chicken.

365
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,176
So, what if each of us get one hamburger
and a piece of chicken?

366
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,429
If we're making stir fry, maybe two people
could chop the ingredients.

367
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,681
I'll cook the rice.

368
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,850
- Okay, you're on rice duty.
- And who else?

369
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,476
- Choose someone.
- Anyone's fine.

370
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,646
Okay, I'll do it. Me, let me do it.
I'll help with rice.

371
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,606
<i>Now it feels like a dating show.</i>

372
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,984
That's how it's done.
She just got snatched up.

373
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,027
Hey, I can do that. Let me help.

374
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,946
- That's for mixing, yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,447
OTO-SAN (AGE 22)

376
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,490
TSU-CHAN (AGE 30)

377
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,159
I can't cook. What should I do?

378
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,911
Tsuu, you can float around
and lend an extra hand to everyone.

379
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,372
- An assistant?
- I got it. Leave it to me.

380
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>What's happening?</i>
<i>This guy's actually nice.</i>

381
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,544
- Let's do the rice.
- Let's do it.

382
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,046
- We're both skilled at a craft.
- Oh, that's right.

383
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,216
- You're a painter?
- Yep, a painter.

384
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,469
That's so rare,
to meet a woman working in that field.

385
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,388
How long have you been painting?

386
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,224
I've been doing it since I was 18.

387
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,351
- For 7 years.
- I've been a carpenter since I was 18.

388
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,686
Oh, really?

389
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,564
She's been a painter
since she was 18 years old.

390
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,773
MILK (AGE 22)

391
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,860
She wanted to prove to people
that she could handle it,

392
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,320
<i>and she's done that.</i>

393
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,030
<i>She has such a great attitude.</i>

394
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,908
She was so cool.
I was drawn to her immediately.

395
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,285
YANBOH (AGE 30)

396
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,164
Baby is cute.
It's just that simple, to be honest, yeah.

397
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>She's got such a pretty face.</i>
<i>Definitely my type.</i>

398
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,045
I think she's the prettiest.

399
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,964
This one looks easy,
"My Teriyaki Chicken."

400
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,466
- Looks easy.
- Right?

401
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,967
Who picked the red one?

402
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,969
- Me!
- Okay, what'll you have?

403
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,389
- Anything's fine.
- Milk, tea, or coffee?

404
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,433
- Tea.
- I can make a latte too.

405
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,227
- Tea.
- Tea? Okay.

406
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,104
He's got a great vibe.

407
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,859
So, my dad wasn't around at all.

408
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,738
From what I heard,
he disappeared when I was a year old.

409
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,783
So yeah, I feel like
I put my mom through a lot.

410
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,034
I know I did.

411
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,285
TSU-CHAN (AGE 30)

412
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,289
When I was around 29,
I did the best thing a son could do…

413
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,126
I built her a house for herself.

414
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,632
I thought she'd require to die
in a house her son built.

415
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,928
See? That's exactly the kind of stuff
a <i>Yankii </i>would do.

416
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,556
He meant "desire," not "require."

417
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,184
- For sure. Exactly.
- That's right.

418
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
That's part of his charm.

419
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,021
Ready, go!

420
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,815
Whoa!

421
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,984
- Is that okay?
- And we're done.

422
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,236
TEKARIN (AGE 21) - TACKLE (AGE 24)

423
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,697
- That's it.
- Should we get the plates ready?

424
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,533
Yeah. We can put the chopsticks
on the tray, don't you think?

425
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,743
But this probably
isn't enough for nine, right?

426
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,161
There's only seven.

427
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,914
We don't have enough trays
for everyone here.

428
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,960
Maybe there's some in the living room,
so let's go check?

429
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,379
- <i>He's giving off "nice guy" vibes.</i>
<i>- </i>Mmm.

430
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,758
- We're going to find some trays.
- Okay, let's go.

431
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,850
We're missing one tray.

432
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,645
Wait. Is this it? Whoa, awesome!

433
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,939
- Is this the living room?
- So cool!

434
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,193
There's a dartboard. Do you play darts?

435
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,446
I used to, but I haven't played in years.

436
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,365
- Oh, yeah?
- Why did we come in here again?

437
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,993
- Uh, trays?
- Yeah, trays. Look at all the…

438
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,203
- Oh. Is that it?
- Yeah, they're they are.

439
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,456
Let's bring them all. Wait.

440
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,874
An instant camera?

441
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,754
- Wow, so cute.
- Cool!

442
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,089
- Let me take one.
- What?

443
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,175
All right, say cheese!

444
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,053
Oh. Look, it comes out the top.

445
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,471
- Where's the top?
- Give it a sec.

446
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,350
Where did the rice team go?

447
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,019
- Anyone?
- Did they sneak out?

448
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,355
Yeah, they took off
to find the living room.

449
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,939
He took Baby to find trays.

450
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,108
- Ready?
- Yeah.

451
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,861
Say cheese!

452
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,488
Not bad, huh?

453
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,572
Let's see.

454
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,699
- How'd it turn out?
- A Milkboy photo.

455
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,868
Is it ready?

456
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,454
- It looks like ice cream!
- Let me try.

457
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,375
<i>Oh, they're already hitting it off.</i>

458
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,251
- <i>That happened quickly.</i>
- <i>That was fast.</i>

459
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,712
- It burned your mouth!
- It's good.

460
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,714
- No way, seriously? It's good?
- For real.

461
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,093
When's the rice team coming back?
Where did they go?

462
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,095
Hey, uh, Tsuu.

463
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,805
Can you go look for them?

464
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,016
I'll take care of it,
as soon as I get done with these dishes.

465
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,060
You're such a good guy.

466
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,020
I love capsule toys like this.

467
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,564
Oh, you do? Then let's get one.

468
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,151
Okay, but let's decide
what we hope will come out.

469
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,862
But we don't know what's in there.
Wait, you can see.

470
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,117
- They got poo. For sure.
- Yeah, poo would be fun.

471
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,954
- So we should add a little wager to it?
- Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

472
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,914
- If poo comes out…
- Yeah.

473
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,001
How about you have to say
who gave the best first impression?

474
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,170
Right now?

475
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,632
Yeah.

476
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,175
All right, then.

477
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,971
Whoever gets poo has to say
who they liked at first sight.

478
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,390
You're already laughing, what's up?

479
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,851
"Poo." Come on, that's hilarious.

480
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,186
- It's such a funny word.
- Fine, "poop."

481
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,897
Should I call it poop instead?

482
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,483
Hey! What are you doing in here?

483
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,027
- You ditched us!
- Come on. Cut it out, man.

484
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,904
- What are you two doing?
- What do you want?

485
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,199
- Come on. This, like, a date?
- Hey, come here, try this.

486
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,160
- Okay, what is it?
- This, this.

487
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,829
- So good.
- Right? The flavor's mild.

488
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,707
Hey, what if Tsuu ends up joining them?

489
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,251
- They're both wearing biker uniforms.
- Mmm.

490
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,503
Maybe it'll turn into a duel.

491
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,467
- <i>They're having fun.</i>
- Don't get cocky. I'm good.

492
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,386
Look how focused they are.

493
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,722
Not even thinking about the cooking

494
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,933
- and the friends they left behind.
- They're in the now. They're so present.

495
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,561
- Okay, I see that.
- They're always living in the present.

496
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,855
So, listen, if you lose,

497
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,441
you have to share
your first impression of the girls.

498
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,401
My first impression of the girls?

499
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,361
Let's just start with number one.

500
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,531
What?! You lost? That's just sad!

501
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,950
- He lost.
- That is so sad, he just lost.

502
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,161
- Wait, how did I lose?
- You just did a single finish.

503
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,537
What do I have to do?

504
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,957
Tell us which girl gave the best
first impression, we won't tell anyone.

505
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,710
- So, the best first impression?
- It's just between us.

506
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,963
I mean, if it's about first impressions…

507
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,467
I can't think of anyone.

508
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,262
As soon as you're interested in someone,
you gotta tell us.

509
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,181
- Sure.
- Our secret. It's a deal.

510
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,183
As soon as it happens, I'll tell you.

511
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,560
- Okay, let's pinky swear, all of us.
- Sure.

512
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,062
All right, here we go.

513
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,855
<i>Weren't these guys just fighting?</i>

514
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,024
- <i>Yeah, they were.</i>
- <i>Exactly.</i>

515
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,444
I'm committed to that pinky promise.

516
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,866
<i>They're getting along so well.</i>

517
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,535
- What's happening?
- See? I told you!

518
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,246
That's exactly what he said.
Scary how spot on he was.

519
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,581
- You're right.
- It's like you read their minds.

520
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,793
I'll count it out.

521
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,838
- Seriously, what are they doing?
- They're never coming back.

522
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,549
I'm actually getting frustrated.

523
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,843
- <i>He's getting frustrated.</i>
- You get in there.

524
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,721
- You screwed up!
- Hard to handle.

525
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,723
- I screwed up?
- Yep, big time!

526
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,017
Here he is.

527
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,019
- You ditched us.
- Slacking off.

528
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
- What were you even doing?
- What?

529
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,773
- What was it? Tell us.
- Why?

530
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,150
- Where were you?
- We were looking for these trays.

531
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,569
What else were you doing?

532
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,821
- We brought the trays.
- See?

533
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,864
Come on, they don't mean the trays.

534
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,867
Then some loser came,
that's why it took so long.

535
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,829
Hey, look, I'm really sorry.
I know you were working hard.

536
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,331
It was your idea. You made me play.

537
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,584
- That was you.
- Here, mix this. You took photos?

538
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,168
Okay, let me wash my hands first.

539
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,964
- They were taking pictures.
- That's messed up. We're pissed.

540
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,466
You're pissed about that? For real?

541
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,927
- Of course. You took too long.
- Keep making them.

542
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,179
Hey.

543
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,724
You want to do this, punk?
With all these knives here?

544
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,100
You're the punk, asshole.

545
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,520
- Don't touch me with those hands.
- I thought about it, but I won't.

546
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,523
- Then shut it and keep working.
- Look, don't push me.

547
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,525
- Guys, stop it.
- I'll beat your ass.

548
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,361
Yeah? Then what? You still a <i>Yankii?</i>

549
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,488
- <i>This is crazy.</i>
- Please stop.

550
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,908
You took forever. You were an asshole.

551
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,244
- Hey, guys, stop it, for real.
- You're persistent.

552
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,706
- Stop trying to pick a fight.
- Hey, look everyone, I'm sorry.

553
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,374
- I'm sorry.
- It's no big deal.

554
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,127
- All right.
- <i>Don't fight over cooking.</i>

555
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,048
- I'm so sorry we were late.
- What were you doing?

556
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,092
We went looking for trays,
found the camera,

557
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,969
and got carried away. Sorry!

558
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,889
All right, fine.
You can all do the dishes later.

559
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,141
- Yes, ma'am.
- I did some of the dishes.

560
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,559
- You're doing dishes too?
- No.

561
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,562
- We'll get it done.
- I was doing dishes while you were gone.

562
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,648
- We'll do the dishes together.
- I did them earlier.

563
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,983
- I'll do it. My bad. Sorry.
- I'll help too.

564
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,194
- It's okay.
- Your nail tips will be wasted.

565
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,487
No, I can do it.

566
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,990
- His hands are dirty anyway.
- I'm washing my hands right now.

567
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,786
- All good. My fault. It's okay.
- It was, right?

568
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,287
<i>Okay, this is good.</i>

569
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,497
I'm glad they didn't fight.

570
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,918
For sure, my whole body tightened up.
This never happens on dating shows.

571
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,462
This seriously never happens.

572
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,675
Looks great. So good.

573
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,802
- Just a little bit.
- Seriously.

574
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,637
Turned out great.

575
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,057
The hamburg steak looks good.

576
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,309
Wow, looks yummy!

577
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,395
- Cheers, everyone!
- Cheers!

578
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,105
Let's eat.

579
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,524
- It's good.
- <i>I can't believe they let it go.</i>

580
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,068
- Yum.
- The dressing is so good.

581
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,277
Yeah?

582
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,988
- Oh, no, tomatoes?
- You can't eat it?

583
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,533
- Even at 30?
- Stop it.

584
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,369
- Challenge accepted.
- You're gonna go for it?

585
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,162
- Gross!
- Wow!

586
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,374
- I can't eat tomatoes either.
- Yeah, same.

587
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,168
I love how they just let go
of what happened.

588
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,004
- I know, right?
- Like a one-shot manga.

589
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,467
- On to the next one!
- That's exactly what it's like.

590
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,886
- It's amazing.
- It's good, huh?

591
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,847
What kind of woman do you like?

592
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,142
My ex-girlfriends,
they were all pretty mentally unstable.

593
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,310
- Girls with issues?
- Maybe you mess them up.

594
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,564
- That's surprising.
- They were mental or you made them mental?

595
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,443
I'm not sure.
At least two already were, for sure.

596
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,822
So it means you've got the capacity
to accept even girls with some issues.

597
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,116
I'm not saying I'll take anyone,
but yeah, I guess so.

598
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,826
That's pretty impressive.

599
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,912
To be honest,
I think I've got some issues.

600
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,584
- How many exes do you have?
- I think maybe five or six.

601
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,960
Five or six?

602
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:17,839
I feel like
all of my ex-boyfriends had issues.

603
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,759
- Lying and abuse, stuff like that.
- Oh, that's terrible.

604
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,136
Those are the worst two.

605
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,597
I forgot to mention,
I learned martial arts.

606
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,391
- So I could kill people if I wanted.
- What do you mean?

607
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,894
- What? Kill people?
- Whoa, wait. Out of nowhere.

608
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,147
Yeah, so my family life
was pretty complicated.

609
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,067
Debt collectors kept showing up
at our house, non-stop.

610
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,237
I started to feel like
I wanted to kill them.

611
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,782
Not all of them, but a lot of them.

612
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,534
That's them. That's on them.

613
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,496
I honestly thought it would make me
feel better about it all.

614
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,331
- If you killed them?
- Yeah.

615
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,960
But now that I'm older, had more
experiences, and met a lot of people,

616
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,755
I've come to realize
that hatred doesn't save anyone.

617
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,381
- So true.
- That's it.

618
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,842
How old were you
when you thought about that?

619
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,970
I hadn't even been to grade school yet,

620
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,724
so even back in kindergarten maybe,
or grade school, latest.

621
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,437
Even as a little girl, I was already
learning what hatred was, you know?

622
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,022
- I see.
- I knew how it felt.

623
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,609
- But I've matured a lot since then.
- No doubt.

624
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,695
- And learned manners and common sense.
- It's about balance.

625
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,907
I was the opposite.
My parents were super strict.

626
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,950
Total opposite.

627
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,744
- Picked up and dropped off, curfews.
- Classic helicopter parent?

628
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,663
Student council president, straight A's.

629
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,872
- What?
- Wow!

630
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,875
I entered high school
on a scholarship too.

631
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,461
- I even studied abroad.
- Super smart. What happened?

632
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,754
I got hurt.

633
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,173
Now I'm curious
how she ended up like this.

634
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,968
- Was that just high school?
- Are there two of you?

635
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,011
Do you have an alter ego or something?

636
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,222
So, you were a good girl
until you were 18?

637
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,849
- Until I was 16.
- Mmm.

638
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,268
So you were all good till high school.

639
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,602
Then what happened?

640
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,020
I was raped.

641
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,528
While I was being held at knife-point.

642
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,989
They raped me.

643
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,907
That's when my brain flipped,

644
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,786
"I don't care what happens to me,
as long as I don't get killed."

645
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,122
So your whole
personality changed, like that.

646
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,040
The girls I've dated were all, like…

647
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,041
NISEI (AGE 27)

648
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:22,213
…hostesses in Roppongi or Shinchi.
That's all I've dated.

649
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,882
Did they want me, or my money?

650
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,509
Ah, so you never really knew
what love felt like.

651
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,637
I lost sight of it, so here,
I'd like to meet someone genuine.

652
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,600
- Someone you can connect with?
- Yeah. I want to date someone for love.

653
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,684
You know?

654
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,102
<i>I go all in.</i>

655
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,731
Like with clothes, I'd be like,
"I'll buy them for you."

656
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:46,529
But in the end, all they wanted from me
was my money, pretty much.

657
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,281
Just the cash.

658
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,911
I always spent it on them,
but I still got dumped in the end.

659
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,995
OTO-SAN (AGE 22)

660
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,416
<i>I've also been used a lot,</i>
<i>by men, in the past.</i>

661
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,045
So I felt like that's something
we both have in common.

662
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,590
- Are you okay with these?
- You can just leave them there.

663
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,134
- Sorry, more plates.
- Keep 'em coming.

664
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,724
- See, it's so cute.
- Let's use them right away.

665
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,187
Those pictures earlier were weird.
Let's take a good one of us.

666
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,898
- Yeah, yeah. Sounds good.
- Let's do it, just us two.

667
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,442
- Just us two?
- Hold it like this.

668
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,861
Oh, me? Yeah, like how you did
with that rice dude.

669
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,405
- Rice dude…
- You took one with him. I want one too.

670
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,573
I got jealous, you know?

671
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,076
Wait, how do I use this thing?

672
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,121
<i>He said Baby's face was so cute.</i>
<i>Wait, he said that before, right?</i>

673
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,666
Okay.

674
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,502
<i>I thought he was good</i>
<i>at getting close to people,</i>

675
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,254
but I'm not convinced that's who he is.

676
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,798
It's not his true self.

677
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,842
<i>I mean, if it is, then that's admirable.</i>

678
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,096
<i>I'd respect him as a person. Mmm.</i>

679
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,599
That doesn't seem like much,
but it's enough to get my attention.

680
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,060
<i>Oh!</i>

681
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,436
<i>That's good.</i>

682
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,771
LOVE KITCHEN

683
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,607
- So, what do you think?
- What do I think? Are you for real?

684
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,860
- What are we even watching?
- What's wrong?

685
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,447
- It's fun, but I feel like they…
- Moving fast, I know.

686
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,616
- Yeah.
- It's a rollercoaster love story.

687
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,495
So, let's recap. We have Yanboh and Milk,

688
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,331
and they both feel like
Baby is kind of cute.

689
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,208
- Right.
- And they're both into her.

690
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,837
And Baby also seems
kind of interested in Yanboh.

691
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,257
Oto feels like she shares
something in common with Nisei,

692
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,719
like their past scars are similar,
or their past relationships.

693
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,512
- Her feeling.
- She feels that way.

694
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,139
Not sure if he does.

695
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,643
But really, everyone here carries
deep scars from very difficult pasts.

696
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,313
So, I think they'll resonate
with each other more and more

697
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,816
as they continue to live
and spend time together.

698
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,026
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

699
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,737
Oto's got some pretty…

700
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,156
- Yeah.
- Pretty tough…

701
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,825
- Exactly. True that.
- Pretty tough past.

702
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,326
- Right.
- Yeah.

703
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,080
I haven't really watched other
reality dating shows, so I wouldn't know,

704
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,834
but it doesn't seem like they're just
trying to show off their good sides.

705
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,046
- Yeah.
- They're showing their true selves.

706
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,839
- Exactly.
- They're authentic.

707
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,842
You don't always get to do that
when you're in love.

708
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,595
- You don't always open up.
- Yeah, it's hard sometimes.

709
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,348
Normally, you can't just express
exactly what you feel all the time.

710
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,684
But let's not forget,
this is only day one.

711
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,978
- That's right. That's wild.
- For sure.

712
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,772
- This is intense.
- Totally.

713
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,442
- Kii hasn't really shown herself yet.
- Yeah, not yet.

714
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,360
What about Tackle? He's so quiet.

715
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,489
- Tackle…
- You know, he seems like a closet perv.

716
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,533
- Ah, I see.
- Always grinning to himself.

717
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,495
He's got all these thoughts,
but never says them out loud,

718
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,205
so yeah, a closet perv.

719
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,875
Tsuu has surprised me a little,
compared to our first impression of him.

720
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,836
He made a strong first
impression, picking that fight early.

721
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,423
But that's exactly the kind of thing
where girls go,

722
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,300
"Oh, he looks intimidating, but…"

723
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,511
And then he casually shows
his gentle side.

724
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,598
I mean, for example,
look at the way he treats people

725
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,185
that are really close to him,
like building his mother a house.

726
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,146
Exactly. But isn't that
how <i>Yankiis </i>are in general?

727
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,816
That's one thing
that I found so great about them,

728
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,401
- as I was talking to them for this show.
- I agree.

729
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,654
I want them to fall
for someone's true self.

730
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,322
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

731
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,199
If you're only interested in their mug,

732
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,785
- it usually doesn't work out that well.
- "Mug…"

733
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,288
Oh, by mug, you mean their face.

734
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,375
Yeah, sorry, that was my bad.
Yankii slang.

735
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,002
- I meant their face.
- No, this is a mug. I got it.

736
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,755
My brain heard AK and thought,
"Mug means that thing."

737
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,091
"Mug means that thing."

738
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,136
<i>It's time to go to bed.</i>

739
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,222
<i>Boys and girls, proceed to your bedrooms.</i>

740
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,684
- Open!
- What?!

741
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,769
- Oh, wow!
- It's <i>gyaru.</i>

742
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,187
Look at this!

743
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,399
- Cute! I love it.
- Oh, my gosh!

744
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,985
- This is super cool.
- What?!

745
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,987
Oh, my gosh, I love it so much!

746
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,905
- Wild.
- Isn't this amazing?

747
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,159
- This is awesome.
- So <i>gyaru!</i>

748
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,869
They have a huge budget.

749
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,413
- I'm shook.
- I wonder what the boys' room looks like.

750
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,624
I'm curious. Maybe it's the opposite
and it's got a biker vibe?

751
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,794
- Biker vibe, like super nostalgic.
- With a <i>Yankii </i>design.

752
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,379
- That's my style.
- Maybe you're right.

753
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,755
- It's time.
- Ready?

754
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,673
Let's go.

755
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,801
Yep. They've gone too far.

756
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,553
- Whoa, cool!
- This is fire.

757
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,055
- Look at this. Crows!
- They gave us that <i>Yankii </i>vibe.

758
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,183
- Love this.
- This is amazing.

759
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,726
- Wow!
- Nice, huh?

760
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,186
- Wow.
- Cool.

761
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,938
- It's fire.
- It's the room of our dreams.

762
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,025
- I want a room like this.
- Yeah, totally packed.

763
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,943
Be careful. It's gonna break!

764
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,114
- Watch the chandelier!
- Damn, even the pipes are shaking.

765
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,578
That's what happens when Nisei goes wild.

766
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,662
NISEI (AGE 27)

767
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,247
I'm definitely the strongest.

768
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,211
<i>I was ranked second</i>
<i>in the All-Japan boxing rankings.</i>

769
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:58,132
<i>I coach kids at the boxing gym</i>
<i>where I used to train, for many years.</i>

770
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,969
- Mostly as a volunteer.
- <i>He's such a good guy!</i>

771
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,596
This place feels so good.

772
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,973
I feel like I'd do something bad
in this room.

773
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,393
- <i>You guys are close!</i>
- <i>He's got such great energy.</i>

774
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,854
<i>I think Yanboh</i>
<i>is gonna be the most popular.</i>

775
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,441
He's more than cool. It's his aura.
I felt it when he walked in.

776
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,484
MILK (AGE 22)

777
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,611
- I'm a total fan already.
- <i>He's a fan.</i>

778
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,862
I love his music.

779
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,530
Milk, yeah.

780
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,033
I think he looks at me
like a big brother, you know?

781
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:24,951
YANBOH (AGE 30)

782
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,535
There it is.

783
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,662
Here we go. What's that?

784
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,332
<i>Now tell the group</i>
<i>which person you're interested in.</i>

785
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,959
- What?
- Wait, what?

786
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,752
Say who we're interested in?

787
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,796
- No, it's too soon.
- No, no, no, wait.

788
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,131
Look, it's fine.
It's just a first impression.

789
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,633
From the first day.

790
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,135
<i>Evaluate the boys anonymously.</i>

791
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,056
<i>Draw a circle or an X for each of them,</i>
<i>and place the cards in their lockers.</i>

792
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,059
- It's anonymous.
- Isn't that harsh for the guys?

793
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,813
- All we need's a circle or an X.
- One, two, open!

794
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,023
- So sweet.
- Everything here is cute.

<i>It's the first time</i>

Wow.

- For real?

<i>If you dated someone like</i>
<i>Yanboh, he'd be devoted for life, right?</i>

805

- Yeah.
- I'm naturally like that too.

806
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,656
- Devoted?
- Totally devoted.

807
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,286
<i>So, Milk's going after Baby, right?</i>

808
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,331
Nah. Actually, I don't think so.

809
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,458
- You don't?
- Mmm.

810
00:38:55,541 --> 00:39:00,212
To be honest, I'll be
embarrassed if I'm wrong about Tackle.

811
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,423
- But he's giving me looks.
- He is.

812
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,175
- He is.
- She's onto him.

813
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,301
You did. You're right.

814
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,429
- You told us he was a perv.
- AK's right. He's right.

815
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,805
He's a closet perv.

816
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,517
Look, I wasn't even sure
if I should say it,

817
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,521
because if I'm completely wrong,
it's gonna be super embarrassing.

818
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,192
But when I catch his eyes, I'm like,
"He's looking at me dirty."

819
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,403
- He's totally turned on.
- He was staring at you the whole time.

820
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,655
<i>Like he's imagining having sex with me.</i>

821
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,576
- <i>With you, Kii, yeah.</i>
- <i>I mean, at least once, right?</i>

822
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,453
I swear he tried to see
through my clothes.

823
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>He would do that.</i>
<i>He seems that type. For sure.</i>

824
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,751
<i>He might have been</i>
<i>staring at you the whole time.</i>

825
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,835
KIICHAN, WANNA TALK

826
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,797
- Girls can always tell these things.
- That's right.

827
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,548
You can tell when guys
check out your boobs?

828
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,592
I can tell, 5,000%.

829
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,387
- 5,000%.
- And I can tell when they look away.

830
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,971
Yeah.

831
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,934
This is actually kind of fun. For real.

832
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,895
I never experienced what youth felt like.

833
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:00,689
- But, you know, I think this is it.
- Yeah.

834
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>Yeah, she's had a tough past.</i>

835
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,527
MILK (AGE 22)

836
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,741
<i>Yeah, I find Baby super attractive.</i>

837
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,245
Like, she comes straight from the heart.
I can tell, she's so solid.

838
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,498
<i>I admire the way she lives her life,</i>

839
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,042
and I was struck by her energy.

840
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,628
I hope I fall in love with her.

841
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,047
YANBOH (AGE 30)

842
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,221
- <i>So it's Baby, huh?</i>
- <i>You know, for me…</i>

843
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,806
I know I'm falling for someone

844
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,559
when I start feeling like
I have to protect her.

845
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,103
<i>So when I heard her story</i>
<i>that she shared at dinner,</i>

846
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,647
<i>I definitely started to feel like</i>

847
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,775
<i>Baby was the kind of person</i>
<i>I'd want to protect.</i>

848
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,946
I feel like her story struck a chord.

849
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,198
TACKLE (AGE 24)

850
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:57,121
Well, Kii is such a <i>gyaru. </i>She's the best.

851
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,166
TSU-CHAN (AGE 30)

852
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,502
<i>I chose to write my love letter to Baby.</i>

853
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,630
You know, it's all about the face for me.

854
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,841
NISEI (AGE 27)

855
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,261
<i>I wrote my love letter to was Kii.</i>

856
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,013
I liked her outfit.

857
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,224
<i>You know, tight clothes</i>
<i>that show her figure. I like that.</i>

858
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,810
I like girls who dress like that.

859
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,354
People don't usually say that on camera.

860
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,940
- "I like her, I can see her figure."
- "Tight clothes."

861
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,525
You don't usually hear that.

862
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,402
Yanboh was saying that, for him,

863
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,780
love begins with the feeling of
wanting to protect someone.

864
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,617
- He feels like making the girl happy.
- Yeah.

865
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,536
- That's at the core.
- That makes sense.

866
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,290
And, in the end,
Tsuu was actually interested in Baby.

867
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,710
His top priority is looks.
And it seems her face is his type.

868
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,589
Do you think Tsuu actually showed that?
I mean, his interest in Baby?

869
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,549
- He's a little shy.
- Yeah, he's shy.

870
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,135
With guys, he can be pretty forward,

871
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,013
but with girls,
he might be a bit more reserved.

872
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,433
They're very different types.
Even though they're both "30 series."

873
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,976
- I think so.
- Yeah.

874
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,813
Yanboh's an open book.
Happy, sad, frustrated.

875
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,024
But surprisingly, Tsuu doesn't do that.

876
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,318
He might be a little too nice,
believe it or not.

877
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,403
Yeah, I think that's what it is.

878
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,949
BADLY IN LOVE ACADEMY

879
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,826
<i>Look at that.</i>

880
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,704
<i>- Tackle is a bonsai culturist.</i>
- <i>That's a cool bonsai.</i>

881
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,998
<i>Good morning.</i>

882
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,292
<i>Each of you will now go to your lockers,</i>

883
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,878
<i>and, one by one, check for a letter.</i>

884
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,261
The letters from the girls
will have either a circle or an X.

885
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,346
- Right.
- The girls gave the boys a circle

886
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,098
if they have feelings for them,

887
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,601
or they give them an X
if they don't have feelings for them.

888
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,689
I got one. I gotta have a circle.

889
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,899
<i>We even took a picture together.</i>

890
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,193
And we talked a bit.

891
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,154
I still have the Cheki photo,
of the two of us.

892
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,906
I'm hiding it in my pocket.

893
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,619
<i>This is the first photo</i>
<i>the two of us took together.</i>

894
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,581
<i>I'll give it to her if I fall in love</i>
<i>with her at the end of this.</i>

895
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,750
I want to make sure
I don't overlook those small moments.

896
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,210
I want to cherish them.

897
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,422
<i>I'd be shocked if I got all X's.</i>

898
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,881
<i>It's only the first day.</i>

899
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,883
<i>You can't let them</i>
<i>get under your skin early.</i>

900
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,051
<i>You're right, yeah.</i>

901
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,729
- Honestly,
- It's first impressions.

902
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,064
I don't care about
the first day's results.

903
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,108
Seriously, I don't.

904
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,194
<i>I bet they're all circles.</i>

905
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,701
I'm gonna break some hearts.

906
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,586
- Okay, time for me to go.
- Yeah!

907
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,505
There goes Mr. All Circles.
Come on, Yanboh.

908
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,549
You probably got a bunch of gold stars.

909
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,033
What the hell?

910
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,370
I think I might lose it.

911
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,705
- <i>What's happening?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

912
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,874
I just don't understand. I don't get it.

913
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,961
It's an X.

914
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,549
- He's Yan-No, now.
- Nah, he could be faking it.

915
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,220
No, this is bad.

916
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,596
You get all X's, yeah?

917
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,765
Shut up. You probably just got all blanks.

918
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,101
You look pretty content.
Did you get a circle?

919
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,978
- I did, yeah. I got one.
- You did?

920
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,230
- Just one.
- You get one?

921
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,899
<i>Tsuu got one circle, and Milk got none.</i>

922
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,442
- You got one?
- You're lying.

923
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,861
- No way, man. For real.
- How many?

924
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,030
- You got two? It's fine.
- Two!

925
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
More than me.

926
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,367
- I got zero.
- One?

927
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,827
- Four?
- One.

928
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,122
- I got zero.
- We both got zero? How?!

929
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,873
These girls are so young.

930
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,711
21, 22. I've only ever dated
someone older than me.

931
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,796
They're just kids!

932
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,133
- <i>He's getting mad.</i>
- It's just so frustrating.

933
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,260
- <i>He is lashing out.</i>
- What did I tell you?

934
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,388
You didn't even get a circle
from the girl you took a photo with.

935
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,682
- The hardest part.
- You're so lame.

936
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,809
- Come on, man!
- You're so lame!

937
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,645
Take off your sunglasses.
Come on. Take them off.

938
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,273
You are crying.

939
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,899
I told you!

940
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,985
You're in tears.

941
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,363
Whatever, it's fine.
It's because I was interrupted.

942
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,241
Tackle got two X's from the girls.

943
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,161
- That's something.
- They're from Tekarin and Baby, actually.

944
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,329
- What?!
- Yeah.

945
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,833
Baby was kinda sending
mixed signals, don't you think?

946
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,001
- For sure.
- Right!

947
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,838
Maybe, but did she really?
I mean, they wrote them anonymously.

948
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,673
- Oh, right, right.
- They don't need to worry

949
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,341
about what the others think.

950
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,635
They're truly living moment to moment.

951
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,596
- Oh!
- Living in the now.

952
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,682
- Or second to second, you know?
- Right, not just moment to moment.

953
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,767
Second to second.

954
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,727
- Their feelings change fast.
- That makes sense.

955
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,938
So, Nisei's circle ended up
being from Oto.

956
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,651
I imagine it's probably because
they have similar past relationships.

957
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,447
And Oto also gave a circle
to Tsuu, as well.

958
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,074
So Oto gave two circles.

959
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,451
Tsuu…

960
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,497
- I wonder if he picked up on it.
- Yeah, I don't think he noticed anything.

961
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,915
What a waste.

962
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,835
OTO-SAN (AGE 22)

963
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,755
<i>She didn't get any.</i>

964
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:50,349
TEKARIN (AGE 21)

965
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,433
KIICHAN (AGE 23)

966
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,228
- <i>Looks like Kii got some.</i>
- <i>Kii is popular.</i>

967
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,903
- So, you get a letter?
- No.

968
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,030
- What?
- Neither of us.

969
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,782
- Neither of you got one?
- Right.

970
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,117
Basically, the first few days,

971
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,411
it's just about looks for them,
to be honest.

972
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,040
For real. She may be cute,
but her flaws are gonna come out.

973
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,501
- <i>Taking a "so what" attitude.</i>
- Is this from Tackle?

974
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,211
TO KIICHAN

975
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,298
I didn't expect this at all,
to get one from Tackle.

976
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,175
- <i>She didn't pick up.</i>
- From Nisei?

977
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,677
This one says…

978
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,973
Doesn't Nisei's letter sound
like he's just saying, "Let's be friends"?

979
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,724
To me, this seemed like Milk.

980
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:36,812
Especially how he wrote stuff like "Yuria"
and "That was crazy funny."

981
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,106
- <i>Vamos. </i>He wrote <i>vamos?</i>
- That's creepy.

982
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,149
I was like,
<i>"Vamos? </i>What even is that?"

983
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,026
I think this one is from Tsuu.

984
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,903
- Oh.
- Could be.

985
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,240
True, Tsuu would say something
like "Sorry my handwriting's messy."

986
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,241
I LIKE YOUR LOOKS!

987
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,244
- But I kind of like the way he said it.
- Yeah, I agree.

988
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,663
Okay, so, the rapper…

989
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,832
- So long!
- He is a rapper.

990
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,417
Did he write lyrics?

991
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,461
The way they're all lined up
definitely feels like lyrics.

992
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,047
- <i>Oh, that's sweet.</i>
- <i>My heart fluttered.</i>

993
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,300
<i>I have a better impression</i>
<i>of the guys now.</i>

994
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,718
Yeah, same here.

995
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,263
You know, when I think about
how much thought

996
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:15,601
he put into writing that first letter,
it makes me tear up a little.

997
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,396
- Letters feel so nice.
- I know, right? They feel great.

998
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,858
Their behavior makes their hearts flutter.

999
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,110
- Yeah, that's true.
- More than their mug.

1000
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,280
What's inside matters more.

1001
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,573
Not reclining Buddha.

1002
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,783
More than the reclining Buddha,
it's their actions.

1003
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,577
Happy to hear you using those words.

1004
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:45,047
<i>This school has</i>
<i>a wonderful sauna, and jacuzzi, as well.</i>

1005
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,131
What?

1006
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,633
So fancy!

1007
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,800
- Jacuzzi?
- Really?

1008
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,719
<i>The first one allowed to use them</i>

1009
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,472
<i>is the one who got the most love letters.</i>

1010
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,390
<i>It's Baby.</i>

1011
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,560
Yay.

1012
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,649
<i>Please choose</i>
<i>whoever you would like to join you.</i>

1013
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,151
- I don't know who to choose.
- Nice.

1014
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,986
Come on. I want a drink.

1015
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,656
- I need one too.
- <i>This is gonna be so good.</i>

1016
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:11,698
<i>For sure.</i>

1017
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
- Get it yourself.
- Come on.

1018
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,576
I want one too.

1019
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,498
- What do you want?
- Give me some ice.

1020
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,170
You guys get along too well.

1021
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,090
- What?!
- They got the sauna.

1022
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,675
Oh, what should I do?

1023
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,885
How many?

1024
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,222
- Two choices.
- Two choices, huh?

1025
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,519
We should put ourselves up for it.

1026
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,984
- Okay, that's it. I've decided.
- Okay. Great.

1027
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,495
For several reasons, I'd like to ask Milk.

1028
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,747
- <i>Look at that face.</i>
- Yay!

1029
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,917
- Look at his eyebrows.
- Okay. Where are we gonna go?

1030
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,127
The sauna.

1031
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,504
- That's cool.
- Show me what you're feeling.

1032
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,423
- To the roof?
- He's happy.

1033
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,135
- You good?
- Oh, totally, yeah.

1034
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
- Thank you.
- I want to go in the sauna.

1035
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,639
Who was the other choice?

1036
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,309
<i>It was Yanboh, wasn't it?</i>

1037
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,021
<i>Badly in Love </i>is about to get
its first erotic scene.

1038
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,772
- So erotic!
- Good for you.

1039
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,774
- We'll be here.
- I want too.

1040
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,568
Well, you're not getting in with us.

1041
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,865
- I'm seriously so pissed off.
- <i>Wow, look at him.</i>

1042
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,867
I think I should snatch Milk.

1043
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,288
There were a few things
I still wanted to ask.

1044
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,998
- That's what this is for.
- Right.

1045
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,751
So I was hoping to get a chance
to talk to you alone.

1046
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,837
Acting all cocky. He's a prick.

1047
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,632
- No, no, no.
- How is he so blunt? That's crazy.

1048
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,384
They don't hold back.

1049
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,514
Wow.

1050
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,058
NATURAL HOT SPRINGS
SAUNA

1051
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,894
<i>And they don't mind showing their bodies.</i>

1052
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,147
<i>Look at that body.</i>

1053
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,899
Your vibe right now…

1054
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,651
- Good morning.
- …is so manly, seriously.

1055
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,279
- I'm manly, right?
- You definitely are.

1056
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,656
She looks irresistible. Don't you think?

1057
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,910
Wow, he must be so excited about this.
Yeah, he looks excited.

1058
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,871
He's not excited, he's worried.
They're about to get intimate.

1059
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,915
We did tell them not to.

1060
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,168
- So cute, for real.
- This is cute, right?

1061
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,253
- Want to come in the sauna?
- Sure.

1062
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,756
Grab a seat.
So, tell me, why did you choose me?

1063
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,840
REFRESHED

1064
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,802
Well, we talked about a lot yesterday.

1065
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,471
- When we were in the living room?
- I remember.

1066
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,724
I've never dated someone
younger than me before.

1067
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,519
- Ah.
- I've mostly dated older guys.

1068
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,356
But you're so mature.

1069
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,858
Really? Does that mean
I look older than I am?

1070
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,611
No, no. I mean, your way of thinking.

1071
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,781
You have a big heart.
I noticed in the kitchen.

1072
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,991
- My bad. Sorry.
- It's okay.

1073
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,035
All good. My fault.

1074
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,204
They were all pretty mentally unstable.

1075
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,582
So it means you've got the capacity
to accept them.

1076
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,000
That's pretty impressive.

1077
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,088
I'm glad I got this opportunity too.

1078
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,925
But, you know, I thought
you were super attractive, I felt like,

1079
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,637
if I came on too strong,
that might be a turn off for you.

1080
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,974
Actually, I'm the opposite.
I like someone who's faithful to me.

1081
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,976
Oh, then I'll be more direct,
starting now.

1082
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,436
- Really?
- Because I don't feel this way

1083
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,814
- about anyone else yet.
- Seriously?

1084
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,399
Yeah.

1085
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:36,027
Actually, when I first saw you,
had this strong feeling that

1086
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,529
it had to be Baby.

1087
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,656
Yuria. You were the only one for me.

1088
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,951
So hot.

1089
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,620
- <i>They're doing good.</i>
- <i>They're doing so well.</i>

1090
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,207
I'm really glad
I got to hear your feelings.

1091
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,251
What are you looking at?

1092
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,879
- I'm just happy.
- <i>He's actually kinda cute.</i>

1093
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,965
Honestly, I don't know.
My heart felt heavy for so long.

1094
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,009
- I had regrets.
- Your heart? That's sad.

1095
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,386
But it's like that weight lifted,

1096
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,722
and I can move forward now,
straight ahead.

1097
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,350
Which is great.

1098
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,019
You totally crack me up.

1099
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,479
You're making me laugh
even more than yesterday.

1100
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,607
I'll be the only guy
who can make you laugh.

1101
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,403
Starting tomorrow, I'm all in.

1102
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,072
I'll fight Isamu for you.

1103
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,452
<i>I haven't been this pissed off</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

1104
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,330
I'm imagining this is Milk.

1105
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,960
<i>I swear, I'm never gonna forget this.</i>

1106
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,630
I'll never forgive him for this.

1107
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,090
<i>When's Milk coming back?</i>

1108
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,675
I wonder what he'll say.

1109
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,137
If he tries to provoke me,
I'll beat his ass. I won't hesitate.

1110
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:48,308
I don't even care if he's joking,
I'll knock him out. Straight up.

1111
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,937
- Yanboh's a little rough around the edges.
- He is.

1112
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,231
Honestly, that was pretty shocking.

1113
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,775
- I thought he would just play it cool.
- Right.

1114
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,569
And say something like,
"Hey, it's no big deal."

1115
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,155
- Adults say, "It's nothing."
- He's too serious.

1116
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,782
- Yeah, he is.
- Right?

1117
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,452
So, that was good.

1118
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,995
- Really?
- It was?

1119
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,667
I feel like I've cleansed
both my mind and body.

1120
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,127
- That's good.
- You sound like you just had sex.

1121
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,295
I know.

1122
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,799
Like, "I'd been holding it in,
then I let it out, and now I feel better."

1123
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,926
- Did you two have sex?
- No, no, we didn't.

1124
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,387
- Your skin's so clear.
- That would be so crazy.

1125
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,223
- That place is unbelievable.
- It changed you?

1126
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,518
Yeah, it did,
and brought us closer together.

1127
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,686
Really?

1128
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,896
- <i>Shirt off?</i>
- <i>He took his shirt off.</i>

1129
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,564
<i>- He was beefy.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1130
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,859
I definitely like that.

1131
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,028
- You felt a spark?
- Mmm-hmm.

1132
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,738
- You thought, maybe Milk?
- I did.

1133
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,739
Oh…

1134
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,325
Right now, he's in the lead for me.

1135
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,577
- You like him? Really?!
- Yeah.

1136
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,913
I'm glad we talked!

1137
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:58,378
I realized that when someone's
been through a lot, age doesn't matter.

1138
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,925
He just seems so mature for his age,
especially the way he thinks.

1139
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,137
That'll make you feel Badly in Love.

1140
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,972
Bring it on.

1141
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,766
Whoa…

1142
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,435
Great use of the title, for real.

1143
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,354
That was such a great cut.

1144
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,440
- "That'll make you badly in love."
- That is it.

1145
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,734
- Excellent word play.
- For sure.

1146
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,778
She was probably like,
"You'll use this moment, for sure."

1147
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,697
Milk's a great communicator.

1148
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,366
Yeah, he definitely is.
I'm surprised, to be honest.

1149
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,534
That was unexpected.

1150
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,661
I thought he'd be too shy
to talk like that.

1151
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,204
- He looks so tough.
- I know.

1152
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:37,375
Baby said what she likes about Milk
is that he's surprisingly mature,

1153
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,085
for someone younger than her.

1154
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,172
She said what she liked was that
he's young yet surprisingly mature, right?

1155
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,298
She did.

1156
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:47,677
I've watched a few reality dating shows,
but I've never heard anyone so young say,

1157
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,179
"They're mature for their age."

1158
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,889
She's young too!

1159
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,974
- It's a weird thing to say.
- This show is the best.

1160
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,018
- It's good, right?
- It's the best.

1161
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,687
From the very first episode,
I'm kinda getting hooked now.

1162
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,772
See what I mean?

1163
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,815
- You gotta turn that one.
- You serious, Tsuu?

1164
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,692
Wait, I can do this.

1165
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,530
<i>Oh, he's back.</i>

1166
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,367
<i>What's gonna happen?</i>
<i>This is making me nervous!</i>

1167
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,745
I'm back.

1168
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,539
What's going on?

1169
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,958
You seem angry.

1170
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,086
The sauna was great.

1171
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,756
Jealous?

1172
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,386
- Who's the jealous one here?
- What?

1173
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,846
- Who's the jealous one, for real?
- Everyone.

1174
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,056
No way, man.

1175
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,808
You should chill out.

1176
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,269
- So Yanboh is.
- I'll beat your ass, for real.

1177
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,106
Don't mess with me, or I'll deck you.

1178
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,153
You know, history is written
by the winners.

1179
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,322
<i>That's pretty intense.</i>

1180
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,991
<i>And he's a fan of Yanboh.</i>

1181
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,415
- Yanboh.
- What?

1182
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,001
Don't mess with me, I'll kill you.

1183
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,087
I'm serious. Don't. I'll kick your ass.

1184
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,506
<i>Whoa! Is he okay?</i>

1185
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,425
<i>I'm not playing. Back off.</i>
