00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,475
ISAMU NISHIZAWA AKA YANBOH (30) - RAPPER

2
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,700
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

3
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,744
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

4
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,079
I'LL WALK MY OWN PATH.
NOBODY CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,583
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

6
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,918
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

7
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,171
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

8
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,506
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,592
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

10
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,594
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

11
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,408
Yanboh.

12
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:20,538
Unfortunately, you made a statement that
constitutes a serious breach of contract.

13
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,044
- It's something you said
- Okay.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,214
- two days ago, in the home economics room.
- Okay.

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,051
It is unfortunate, but,

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,888
as of today, you will be expelled,

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,557
and you'll have to leave the facility.

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,687
What did I say?

19
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,318
You made a statement
that suggested drug use.

20
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,903
Huh?

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,572
Huh?

22
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,701
No, I didn't.

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,453
I didn't talk about drugs.

24
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,416
I freaked out when I saw
the damage clause in the contract.

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,377
It sobered me right up, for sure.

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,004
I'm gonna stop doing illegal stuff.

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,381
- All of it.
- Uh-huh.

28
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,384
That's why I'm gonna stop lighting up
after the 17th.

29
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,143
Wait, hold on.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,604
As you know,
it clearly states in the contract

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,606
that if you do something
that raises suspicion…

32
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,861
I know I said I smoked on the 17th,
but I didn't. That's the truth.

33
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,447
But you said something
that raised suspicion that you did.

34
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:42,537
And, of course, we have a responsibility
to protect the other people on this show.

35
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,005
I swear I didn't do it.
It was a poor choice of words.

36
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,841
I was just saying that I want to be
a better man from now on.

37
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,552
Maybe I said it differently
because I was drunk.

38
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,636
I don't know.

39
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,600
It was just me kind of bragging about
the things that I'd done in the past.

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,561
Those past stories got mixed up
with what I was gonna do,

41
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,229
and it just came out like that.

42
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,866
Oh, man, this can't be happening.

43
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,164
Yanboh, you're expelled
from the school, as of today.

44
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,597
I understand.

45
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,274
Mmm, I'd like to apologize,
if you don't mind.

46
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,570
I know you gave me
a great opportunity on this show,

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,825
and I'm responsible
for how this all turned out.

48
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,955
And like you said, I'm an adult.

49
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,917
But I was weak and I allowed alcohol
to cloud my judgment.

50
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,128
I probably just wanted
to make myself look cool.

51
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,925
Honestly, the fact that you had high hopes
for me, but now I have to leave…

52
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,678
I'm totally ashamed.

53
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,557
Yeah.

54
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,520
Once again, I realize
it's ultimately my fault.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,565
I feel like I haven't grown at all,

56
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,777
making stuff up while I was drunk.

57
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,322
It's the lamest thing ever.

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,033
I'm sorry for causing trouble for you.

59
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,503
Excuse me. May I have a word?

60
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,923
Yanboh would like
to speak with you, individually.

61
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,758
I'm sorry. Could we have a moment?

62
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,011
HIKARU - AKA TEKARIN (21)

63
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,971
This is making me super nervous.

64
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,099
Can you stop filming for a second?

65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,643
Why do we have to go one by one?

66
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,936
Stop filming for a sec.

67
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>this is happening. It's crazy.</i>

68
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,400
<i>Mmm.</i>

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,488
Are you okay?

70
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,784
I want to talk for a bit.
Can you take a seat?

71
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,869
Mmm-hmm.

72
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,954
YURIA AKA BABY (25) - PAINTER AND TALENT

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,209
I got myself into some trouble.

74
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,339
Something I said while I was drunk,

75
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,133
violated the contract
we signed for the show.

76
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:46,471
Because of that, the plan to be here
for the next two weeks until the end…

77
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,265
I can't.

78
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,727
I feel terrible about it. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,608
Come on. Don't feel bad.
Hold your head high.

80
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,614
I can say, honestly,
I've been interested in you.

81
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,117
I think you're so pretty.

82
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,078
And I…

83
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,539
When you told all of us about your past,

84
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,420
I felt like I wanted to protect you,
to help you move past it.

85
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:25,510
And for me, when I have those feelings
for a woman, it usually turns into love.

86
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,846
I wish I'd had more opportunities
to talk to you.

87
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,848
I wanted to protect you.

88
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,933
Yeah.

89
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,644
But I ended up making you cry.

90
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,232
Can you promise that you're making sure

91
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,401
- to always protect yourself, also?
- Hmm.

92
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,154
Thank you.

93
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,118
I guess I'll go.

94
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,702
I'll be back.

95
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,593
May I sit?

96
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,600
Why so far away?

97
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,602
Let's sit closer.

98
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,564
I don't want to talk from that far away.

99
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,070
Wait a sec.
I need to calm down a little first.

100
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,078
Well,

101
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,581
so I'll get straight to the point.

102
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm leaving this place today.

103
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,295
I got expelled.

104
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,426
So, I'm not going to be here
for as long as we all expected.

105
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,221
And honestly, I just want to, you know,

106
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,099
hit myself.

107
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,771
I was ready to turn things around today.

108
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,316
Everyone could tell that you were trying.

109
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,026
And also…

110
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,110
I mean,

111
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,947
I knew what was happening.
I saw how others reacted.

112
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,033
I could have guessed
this was happening, but…

113
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,078
Honestly, on the first day,

114
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,458
I looked at everyone and thought,
"I'm here to find love,

115
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,336
but I might not have
the confidence to do it."

116
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,090
But then, I don't know,
when we were in the sauna yesterday,

117
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,052
and I got to talk with you one-on-one,

118
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,264
and that's when I realized
that, deep down,

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,308
you're such a thoughtful person.

120
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
I don't know.

121
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,689
I'm sad, but,

122
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,983
I'm feeling a lot.

123
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,573
Like, I feel sad, but there's also
nothing I can do.

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,665
This is just so tough.

125
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,377
I liked your personality a lot, seriously.

126
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,838
And so, I hope you keep doing your best.

127
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,343
I don't think I can move on
from this right away.

128
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,597
But…

129
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,063
I don't want you to be expelled.

130
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,484
Well, me neither.

131
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,903
You're the cheer squad leader now.

132
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,863
You're kidding, right?

133
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,118
- Really?
- Here. It's a good luck charm.

134
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,246
- Hmm.
- That's truly all I can do.

135
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,582
- Look at it when things get hard.
- Hmm.

136
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,542
I hope it reminds you of me.

137
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,503
- Well… I'm sure.
- Are you sure about this?

138
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,923
- It's a symbol of our friendship.
- Mmm.

139
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,553
Please, look after everyone for me.

140
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,180
I'll do my best, squad leader.

141
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,934
I'll do my best.

142
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,894
I'm happy to have met you.

143
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,772
Goodbye.

144
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,357
I'll miss you.

145
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,736
This sucks.

146
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,865
- So much. I'll miss you.
- I know.

147
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,992
I'm so sad.

148
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,578
Bye-bye.

149
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,300
This is painful.

150
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,832
<i>I trust that you won't</i>
<i>make the same mistake I made.</i>

151
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,878
No one else has a problem
running their mouth like I do.

153
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,006
But, just in case,
you should maybe keep it in mind.

154
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,133
Even the small stuff
might get you kicked out.

155
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,718
So, you know,

156
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,514
I just hope you can learn from my mistakes
and do your best.

157
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,432
You've got this.

158
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,101
That's straight up.

159
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,728
I'm in this to win this, bro.

160
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,021
You better.

161
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,439
I mean it, for real.

162
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,778
- Count on me.
- Nice.

163
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,869
- I'll be in touch. Yeah.
- Okay. Can't wait, man.

164
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,499
We'll miss you.

165
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,337
- We're brothers. So close in age.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,006
Hit me up. Visit me in Kansai anytime.

167
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,426
- Dude, of course.
- I'll do the same.

168
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,346
- I'll do my best for you.
- Yeah, you better.

169
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,600
You got this. Don't get all sad.

170
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,728
Too late.

171
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,272
- Pissed off, actually.
- All good, man.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,567
Do Kyoto proud for me. All right?

173
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,945
Well, I'm out.

174
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,072
See ya.

175
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,796
I thought maybe I would finally
fall in love, you know?

176
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,632
It's like,

177
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,595
so shocking, but it's also super sad.

178
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm just gonna miss him.

179
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,320
Sorry to barge in!

180
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,613
Wow.

181
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,908
Here, look at this.

182
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,118
- You wanna be "it"?
- If you move, you lose, right?

183
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,871
You're done for, saying stuff like that!

184
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,790
This generation of kids, man.

185
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,958
They don't get me yet.

186
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,835
So it's up to me
to make sure that they do.

187
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,670
I know, it sounds crazy, right?

188
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,756
- It's wild.
- Not so crazy for you maybe.

189
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,842
But they were so cocky,
they'd never back down.

190
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,302
- Even if I hit them.
- So cocky.

191
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,722
So cocky, they'd be like,
"I don't even care if Isamu hits me."

192
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,058
"I'm doing it."
That's the level they'd be at.

193
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,392
I thought it was awesome.

194
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,657
What is happening?
I don't know myself anymore.

195
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,827
I tried so hard not to cry.

196
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,663
I mean, I just don't even know
what to do anymore.

197
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,672
Can I be alone for a bit?

198
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
NAGANO

199
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,151
- Oh, gosh.
- What was that?

200
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,028
- Right away.
- That was so intense.

201
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,364
- How long have they known each other?
- I know!

202
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,741
- How many days has it been?
- Three years?

203
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,909
Three years.

204
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,911
You'd think they've known
each other forever.

205
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,372
- Three days.
- I felt like sobbing too.

206
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,583
Honestly, I think it's only been
three or four days.

207
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,792
Time is irrelevant.

208
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,670
I think people, you know,
find a strong connection

209
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,047
when they're
in these heightened situations.

210
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,883
- That's what it is.
- Very intense.

211
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,095
When I first got the call about it,
I thought the show would totally be over.

212
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,264
- Ah.
- Let me explain.

213
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,308
In order to protect the cast members,

214
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,185
we can't tolerate
the use of any type of drug.

215
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,441
As soon as we saw suspicious behavior,
we had to expel him, of course.

216
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,610
- Yeah.
- Especially since he has a record.

217
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,737
- Right. Yeah.
- That's how society works.

218
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,739
- Just the way it is.
- That's how it is.

219
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,449
If you choose to break the law,

220
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,285
you'll lose your chance
at possibly finding love.

221
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,787
- That's right.
- Coming from the world of the <i>yakuza,</i>

222
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,333
he's got to know,
he has to take responsibility for that.

223
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,335
- That's true.
- It's a shame though.

224
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,338
- A real shame. I wanted him to keep going.
- Such a good guy.

225
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,507
And his romance with Tekarin
was just getting started.

226
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,135
It sure looked like it was about to start.

227
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,305
Tekarin was probably already
head over heels in love with him.

228
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,598
For sure.

229
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,478
Maybe when he said he stopped lighting up,
he meant lighting up her bed.

230
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,564
He was probably just talking dirty.
He's going abstinent till it's over.

231
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,942
I didn't hear anything about marijuana.

232
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,234
Enough of that.

233
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,321
- We can't forget about Tenten.
- Oh, right, Tenten. I forgot.

234
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,698
- Yanboh was such a shock. Seriously.
- Oh, man.

235
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,284
Tenten will bounce back.

236
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,912
- Yeah, think so.
- It's gonna be hard for her now.

237
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,872
Everyone was hugging each other.

238
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,624
It got deep right away.

239
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,210
But I've got high hopes.
Let's see what happens.

240
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,171
I wonder where all
their romantic journeys will go from here.

241
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,635
- It's quiet without Yanboh.
- Mmm.

242
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,680
- He didn't talk much, though.
- True.

243
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,516
MILK (22)

244
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,394
TSU-CHAN (30)

245
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,689
TACKLE (24)

246
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,898
Morning.

247
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,441
- Good morning.
- Hey.

248
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,901
- Morning.
- Good morning.

249
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,152
That's not milk, is it?

250
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,612
Is there milk in this?

251
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,864
Wow, Yanboh's stuff is still here.

252
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,158
- You're using Yanboh's cup?
- Mmm.

253
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,201
YANBOH

254
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,619
And you're in his spot.

255
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,038
- I've got to.
- Mmm.

256
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,456
We're from the same town.

257
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,291
What about the necklace?

258
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,794
- I put it on.
- Not on your neck?

259
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,462
Thought it'd be too visible.

260
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,215
I told her that it'd be
too much of a reminder.

261
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,175
I thought about it,
but they told me not to.

262
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,846
It's better to wear it here
than not at all.

263
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

264
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,518
<i>I bet the transfer student</i>
<i>is gonna show up soon.</i>

265
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
- For sure.
- Oh, he's coming.

266
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,690
- That's why we've all got sunglasses on.
- Hmm. We're ready.

267
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,443
- He's here!
- Oh!

268
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,111
- Tenten!
- Nice to meet you.

269
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,696
Hello. My name's Tenten.

270
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,032
I'm the transfer student.
Nice to meet you.

271
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,536
- Nice to meet you.
- Been a minute.

272
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
Feels awkward all of a sudden.

273
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,084
- Of course.
- Of course, it would be awkward.

274
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,085
Come on.

275
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,504
What were they expecting?

276
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,715
The guys are all pretty tense.

277
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,883
Oh. Got it.

278
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,927
Should we introduce ourselves?

279
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,472
- Sure.
- I mean, the girls already have.

280
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,348
So let's have the guys do it.

281
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,185
- I'm Tackle. Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

282
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,604
- You too.
- Be good or I'll tackle you.

283
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,688
Okay. Got it.

284
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,649
- Next is Nisei.
- I'm Tackle.

285
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,109
- Tackle?
- <i>Scary.</i>

286
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,778
- Another one.
- Next.

287
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,863
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>That's harsh.</i>

288
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,822
That's it?

289
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,699
- Your age?
- What do you wanna know?

290
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,326
- Well--
- I'm 27.

291
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,787
- 27? All right.
- <i>So scary.</i>

292
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,873
- You're giving bad vibes. My opinion.
- Bad vibes?

293
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,876
You know, in my experience,

294
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,670
guys like you are cocky.

295
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,508
- That's tough to hear, right out the gate.
- Yeah. Tough.

296
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,345
I don't get why a host from a nightclub
would come on this show.

297
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,264
- I'm a host, but--
- If you get a girlfriend here,

298
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,432
would you give up your job?

299
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,934
Yeah, of course, I'd quit.

300
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,728
Yeah, that has to be the plan, right?
I get a girlfriend and quit.

301
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,522
<i>What's with that?</i>

302
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,690
<i>Tsuu's back to bullying.</i>

303
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,569
<i>Tenten, the transfer student,</i>
<i>is a little behind the others.</i>

304
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,905
<i>He'll need to catch up.</i>

305
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>So we've prepared a date for him.</i>

306
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,121
Hold up. Bad play, bad play.
That's going too far.

307
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,581
I haven't gone yet either!

308
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,083
<i>Please choose one girl</i>

309
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,794
<i>you would like to talk to.</i>

310
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,462
He's got it good.

311
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,714
Wait, that totally changes the game.

312
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
But he got here later.

313
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,302
- I'd like to talk to…
- This is special treatment.

314
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,097
- …Oto. I choose Oto.
- Yeah?

315
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,183
- I'd appreciate it.
- Let's go then.

316
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
But seriously, that's great.
She hasn't gone on a date yet.

317
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,856
- Yeah? Great. Let's go.
- Have fun.

318
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,274
This is crazy.

319
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,442
- Take care, you guys.
- Off we go!

320
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,572
- Watch your step on the stairs.
- Okay.

321
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,907
You can't climb
these stairs without sneakers.

322
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,451
- Wait, that's a real horse.
- There's a horse?

323
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
They're kind of cute.

324
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,666
Sorry I scared you.

325
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,668
There's more over there.

326
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,088
- Wow, there are so many horses.
- I know.

327
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,756
I've ridden horses for a long time.

328
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,508
Wait. You can ride horses?

329
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,177
- Yeah, I can ride.
- That's cool.

330
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,512
My dad races horses.

331
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,390
He works as a jockey,
so I've been riding for a while.

332
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,225
He thought I'd be a jockey too,

333
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,562
so he made me ride horses
for years and years.

334
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,191
I've ridden horses more formally
for horse shows.

335
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,151
And I've raced them, as well.

336
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,904
- He went to juvie?
- He went to juvie.

337
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,989
- I wonder why.
- Yeah, I honestly have no idea.

338
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,909
Like a member of the royal family.
He can ride horses.

339
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,995
- He's got a bourgeoisie vibe about him.
- He does.

340
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,873
I wonder what turned him
into a delinquent.

341
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,292
Take a ride?

342
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,044
- That okay?
- If you want.

343
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,670
- I want to.
- Sure.

344
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,130
What's this horse's name?

345
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,966
- Juju.
- Oh, Juju. I like that.

346
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,469
- Juju is a cute name.
- I know, I love it.

347
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,054
- She's a girl, yeah?
- She is.

348
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,764
I'll get on. Okay.

349
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,433
She had a fall three years ago.
She's a mom.

350
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,353
- Ah, I see.
- Oh, wow! Amazing.

351
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,063
Crazy. How do I look?

352
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,481
- You look good.
- Thank you.

353
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,274
- You look like a prince.
- Yeah?

354
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,112
- You're going so fast!
- She's such a fast girl.

355
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,990
- Look at you! You're a natural!
- Yeah!

356
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,035
- The girls were talking…
- What?

357
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,453
How it'd be nice

358
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,164
if you showed up like a prince
on a white horse.

359
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,168
- It looks like you're the real deal.
- That's right, I am.

360
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,129
- So fast!
- This horse likes to show off.

361
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,256
That's amazing!

362
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,052
- This is easy. Don't worry, I got this.
- That's so cool!

363
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,637
Let's ride.

364
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,555
- I don't know if I can.
- Let's ride.

365
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,766
- I got it.
- It's like getting on a bicycle.

366
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,142
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>

367
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,645
- <i>Nice, she's getting on.</i>
- <i>She's doing it!</i>

368
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,438
- There you go.
- <i>Prince Charming.</i>

369
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,731
- Are you on?
- I'm on.

370
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,696
<i>This is so special.</i>
<i>There's a new romance in the air.</i>

371
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,740
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

372
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:29,621
When I first talked to you, I thought
you seemed a bit wild, but pure-hearted.

373
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,831
- Yeah?
- In a good way.

374
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,207
You could sense that right away?

375
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,209
- That's the impression I got.
- Wow.

376
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,544
Just from talking to you.

377
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,671
- That makes me happy.
- So, that's why

378
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,632
- I wanted to talk more. Yeah.
- Mmm.

379
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,093
- When was your first love?
- High school.

380
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,971
- First or second year.
- Seriously? Pretty late.

381
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,723
- Strict parents.
- Oh.

382
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,559
My parents were strict too.
That makes kids act up.

383
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,935
- I went wild at one point.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,186
- Super strict?
- Yeah.

385
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,521
Same here. Yeah.

386
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,149
- Have you ever been arrested?
- Overseas.

387
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,234
- Abroad? You're wild!
- Yeah.

388
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,696
Quite the conversation.
"You've been arrested? Wild!"

389
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,490
- Right?
- That's not a normal question to ask.

390
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,326
"You've been arrested?"

391
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,245
It's a great icebreaker, I think.
"Ever been locked up?"

392
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,873
No, no. Never been arrested.

393
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,626
I was raped in my first
or second year of high school,

394
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,046
and so, that's the reason
I started acting out.

395
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,464
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:24,009
When I was 16,
I went to a Juvenile Assessment Center.

397
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,054
- Really?
- Then Juvenile Training School.

398
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,848
<i>The reason I ended up</i>
<i>in Juvenile Training School</i>

399
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,684
was because my girlfriend at the time

400
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,228
was assaulted by some bad kids,

401
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,981
and I went too far in my revenge.

402
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,361
How did it feel
going to the Assessment Center?

403
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,363
Were you mad at your parents?

404
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,573
I felt a lot of things towards my parents.

405
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,158
After the Assessment Center,

406
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,244
as soon as I was assigned to juvie,
they started crying.

407
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,121
- Both of them. Yeah.
- Ah, yeah.

408
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,708
I thought, "Why was this bad?
It was for my girlfriend."

409
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,877
But, in the end, I realized that

410
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,089
making my family sad
was not good for anyone, you know?

411
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,633
So I thought I'd get my act together.

412
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,345
- It's crazy when I got arrested.
- I bet.

413
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,557
Like, I felt so relieved
when I got caught.

414
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,602
- Relieved? Oh, why is that?
- I had been acting out.

415
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,398
I'd been bad for a while,
but my parents never found out.

416
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,441
- I was good at hiding that from them.
- Right.

417
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,194
Part of me felt like I was never

418
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,739
going to fit into normal society
because of the way I was.

419
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,617
Then the arrest…
I felt super relieved after that.

420
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,244
- Got you.
- I felt liberated.

421
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,328
Right.

422
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,206
I thought,
"Now I don't have to hide anymore."

423
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,918
I decided not to hide anything
from my mom, you know?

424
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,754
- So it was a good thing.
- Yeah, that's why it was great.

425
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,966
I don't think many people feel relieved
after getting arrested,

426
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,136
- but that's why I'm a special case.
- Yeah, that's unique.

427
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,555
I was a little scared, at first.

428
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,016
- Just because you're a host, you know?
- I get that. Understandable.

429
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,311
So if we can both get past that,

430
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,522
I think we could get along great together.

431
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,815
- Know what I mean?
- Uh-huh.

432
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,900
- But our pasts are so similar.
- True.

433
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,819
So I feel like, "What should I do?"

434
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,531
- I get it. Confused?
- I'm confused, you know?

435
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,867
Tenten's a great guy, right?

436
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,453
He seemed like kind of a jerk
when he first showed up.

437
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,579
Mmm.

438
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,956
- He protected the person he loved.
- To protect her.

439
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,541
That's why he got in trouble.

440
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,212
He hurt the people around him
and ended up in Juvenile Training School.

441
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,798
- You know?
- But Oto, she's super honest.

442
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:27,966
Yeah.

443
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,595
<i>Most people would find it hard</i>
<i>to say what she said,</i>

444
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,430
but she came right out and said it.

445
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,307
- Mmm.
- Yeah, I like that.

446
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,643
- That's a great quality, right?
- It's pretty wonderful, I think.

447
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,606
Let's work on the children's cafeteria.

448
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,693
We're gonna use this
to paint the hoop toss game.

449
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,071
And then, after that,
we'll get to workover there,

450
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,032
do what needs to be done.

451
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,825
The cooking team should start cooking.

452
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,911
- What are you doing, Tackle?
- I cook.

453
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,496
- Can you help?
- I'll do it.

454
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,873
<i>Tackle asked Kii to help with the cooking.</i>

455
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,500
- You know we got this. Yeah.
- For real?

456
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,876
Baby, you want to cook?

457
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,169
- No way.
- Me neither.

458
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,962
- No way.
- I'll work with Baby then.

459
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,797
We'll make the cotton candy sign.

460
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,175
Are you guys fighting over her?

461
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,594
Don't you think
it'd be better if he cooks?

462
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,138
Rock, paper, scissors!
Show her what you're made of.

463
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,433
- She knows what I'm made of.
- Let's go! Rock, paper, scissors.

464
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,394
Give it everything you've got.

465
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,063
You got this.

466
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,023
- "You got this."
- Here we go.

467
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,191
- Let's do it.
- Bring it on.

468
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,859
- Tsuu, start us off.
- Ready?

469
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,737
One, two, three, and shoot!
You're a loser!

470
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,239
That's how the world works.

471
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,034
- It is what it is.
- Nisei's good at winning.

472
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,120
Okay, so, Tsuu,
you're in charge of sign making.

473
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,997
- Sure.
- The chief.

474
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,416
- Are you changing?
- Yeah, for sure.

475
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,960
Let's meet up after.

476
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,504
I don't need to change.
These are work clothes.

477
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,547
BADLY IN LOVE

478
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,637
Is it just you and me, man?

479
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,681
Get that desk out of the way.

480
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,933
- Better keep an eye out.
- For what?

481
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,102
- You better watch out.
- I might fall for her too.

482
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,731
I'm watching you. You got it?
Better do a good job.

483
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,900
Shut up, loser. You're a wuss.

484
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,695
Can he give him the finger?

485
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,613
- "You're a wuss."
- "You're a wuss."

486
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,740
- "You're a wuss."
- Right to the camera.

487
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,160
He talks too much.

488
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,290
Okay, okay, I got this.

489
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,709
Is this the paint?

490
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,462
I sanded it,
and I think I'll use purple, for sure.

491
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,298
- You like purple?
- My favorite.

492
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,134
My university school color is purple.

493
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,053
- Oh, really?
- I wear purple when I box too.

494
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,806
Oh, yeah? I bet purple looks great on you.

495
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,433
- You think so?
- Yeah.

496
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,061
- Then I'll wear purple every day now.
- Purple from head to toe.

497
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,813
They'd arrest me, or expel me.

498
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,399
- Do you girls talk about love?
- Sure we do.

499
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,443
Oh! Wish I could hear it.

500
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,321
But the guys share stuff too, right?

501
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,239
We do.

502
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,741
About love?

503
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,660
- Yeah. About lots of stuff. Love included.
- Oh, yeah?

504
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,163
Like what? We can't figure out
who you like, Tsuu.

505
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,041
- Me?
- We think you don't like anyone.

506
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,792
Do you think you know mine?

507
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,086
- Who's mine? Mmm.
- Your crush?

508
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,636
It's always been you.

509
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,514
- <i>Oh! Look at that.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

510
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,183
<i>He just went ahead and said it.</i>

511
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,810
<i>Straightforward is nice, right?</i>

512
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,479
- <i>Definitely.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

513
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,149
Look at me. I'm serious.
You can see it in my eyes. I'm for real.

514
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,361
- Your eyes always look like that.
- Come on. No way.

515
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,238
I think you're the cutest.

516
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,948
But I don't quite know you yet.

517
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,575
- Oh.
- You know?

518
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,662
But you don't quite know me either.

519
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,248
Yeah, since we've only talked a little
while we smoked.

520
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,335
Which guy made
the best impression on the girls?

521
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,382
I think the new guy
made a big impression on everyone.

522
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
- Today?
- Yeah.

523
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,553
The new guy, huh?

524
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,722
FOLK CAFE HARENOYA

525
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,974
Back in the day, I wasn't as…

526
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,604
I have had some work done on my face.

527
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:16,361
I wanted to look as good
as any handsome guy I might be with,

528
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,154
so I got some plastic surgery.

529
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,031
- I wasn't confident in my looks.
- Got it.

530
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,037
- That's not weird for you?
- That you got plastic surgery?

531
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,914
- Yeah.
- That doesn't matter at all.

532
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,457
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

533
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,627
Honestly, I'm self-conscious about it.

534
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,963
Because I got plastic surgery,

535
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,591
I, like, worry
whether it's okay with the guy.

536
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,304
I'm still not confident.

537
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,682
When it comes to plastic surgery,

538
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,893
- I don't judge it.
- Mmm.

539
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,146
I like people
who want to better themselves.

540
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,065
Plastic surgery is just one way
to improve yourself

541
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,653
and make yourself more beautiful,
so I don't mind at all.

542
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,488
- Honestly, no.
- Really?

543
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,157
It doesn't bother me.

544
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,244
- I feel a little better now.
- Do some people judge you?

545
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,037
- I want kids, you know?
- Mmm.

546
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,456
So, sometimes, I worry

547
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,125
- that my kids won't look the same as me.
- Oh, right.

548
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,671
Oto is super open about this stuff.
I think it's wonderful.

549
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,717
If the guy you're with
is super handsome, it'll be fine.

550
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,094
I've got strong genes, no doubt about it.

551
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,555
Worry not, they'll look like me.

552
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,348
- All good.
- For sure.

553
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,476
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
they'd have my face.

554
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,103
<i>You know, it's rare to find someone</i>

555
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,314
<i>whose background is a lot like mine.</i>

556
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,984
We were able to have
a super deep conversation.

557
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,111
He's such a good listener.

558
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,324
He was open to what I had to say,
and he's super kind and such a gentleman.

559
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,576
My impression of him has changed a little.

560
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,079
<i>He's so cool.</i>

561
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,166
Looks great.

562
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,667
- Good?
- Nice.

563
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,631
Yo, Kii. Let's make <i>takoyaki.</i>

564
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,926
- How do you make that?
- <i>Takoyaki?</i>

565
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,138
Five hundred grams of <i>takoyaki </i>mix,
that can feed five.

566
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,348
Oh, that's close.

567
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,767
- How much water, then?
- For the water…

568
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,645
Two thousand milliliters.

569
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,729
Really?

570
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,608
- Two thousand milliliters.
- Not 200?

571
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,151
Got to be 200.

572
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,574
Is it supposed to be this sticky?

573
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,703
- Should we make 'em chewy?
- We're going for doughy.

574
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,831
Too late. Just pour the batter in.

575
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,042
- <i>They're vibing right now.</i>
- <i>Cute couple.</i>

576
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,758
- Maybe we didn't add enough water.
- It's all gooey.

577
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,426
Why is that?

578
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,637
They're supposed to sink
when you add them.

579
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,556
I thought so. Maybe we push 'em in?

580
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,890
And turn them over?

581
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,851
They'll end up looking like pancakes.

582
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay, let's just keep
turning these over like that.

583
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,482
They're coming along. Looking good. Yeah.

584
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,693
- Looks great.
- You a master chef?

585
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,113
- Looks like cheese to me.
- Yeah, it totally does.

586
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,906
That doesn't look quite right.

587
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,201
Looks good. I'm getting hungry.

588
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,620
- All done.
- Okay, give one a try.

589
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,250
Not my fault if it's bad.

590
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,879
Isn't it hot?

591
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,757
It's hot?

592
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,346
<i>That's so cute.</i>

593
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,764
Pretty good, actually.

594
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,895
I mean, they look delicious to me, anyway.

595
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,813
Yeah, totally.

596
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,650
- We're home.
- Welcome back.

597
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,068
What are they holding?

598
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,737
- What? Flowers.
- We got flowers.

599
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,364
- Yeah. We arranged them.
- So cute!

600
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,616
- Real flowers?
- Yeah.

601
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,492
- They're real.
- They're pretty.

602
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,786
First, we went horseback riding.

603
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,913
- Horses?
- Horses?

604
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,956
- Rode horses?
- I've ridden horses.

605
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,083
He's like a prince, riding in on a horse.

606
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,085
You're even dressed in white.

607
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,378
No way.

608
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,213
He's hilarious.

609
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,133
A horse-riding prince?

610
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,677
Dressed in all white?

611
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,929
There's some leftovers.

612
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,805
- Help yourselves.
- I want some <i>takoyaki.</i>

613
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,641
- Go ahead.
- <i>Takoyaki's </i>good.

614
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,642
It was, right?

615
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,976
- I'll try.
- One bite.

616
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,982
<i>Okay, let's see how it tastes.</i>

617
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,654
- Tastes like <i>takoyaki?</i>
- It tastes like <i>takoyaki.</i>

618
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,031
- But?
- No octopus.

619
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,866
- No, there is.
- It's got octopus.

620
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,702
Mmm.

621
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,955
It's not that good.

622
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,123
- It's kind of bad.
- Come again?

623
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,250
- It's not very good.
- One more time?

624
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,836
It's kind of gross.

625
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,588
- Go for it!
- Get him!

626
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,257
- Get him, Tackle!
- Oh, my gosh!

627
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,176
- Whoa, crazy.
- Oh, my God!

628
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,137
That was a serious tackle.

629
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,806
- For her.
- He likes her, so…

630
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,183
Holy shit!

631
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,226
Amazing!

632
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,605
- Way to go!
- Incredible.

633
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,609
- First tackle.
- Why'd you tackle him like that?

634
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,112
Because he insulted the food we made.

635
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,446
- What?
- <i>So cute.</i>

636
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,865
That's sweet.
Of course, he'd get mad at that.

637
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,159
- <i>Kii looks so happy.</i>
- <i>Makes sense.</i>

638
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,079
That's the first tackle we've seen
since we got here.

639
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,915
He tackled him like, "What are you doing?"

640
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,418
"Are you disrespecting my girl, Kii?"

641
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,503
I love it when guys do stuff like that.

642
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,090
I appreciate that he's so loyal
to one person.

643
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,676
I could be happy with someone like that.

644
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,595
He should've just lied
and said it was good.

645
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,014
I mean, Kii made it.

646
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,807
Truth is, it was pretty bad.

647
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,018
It didn't taste like <i>takoyaki </i>at all.

648
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,104
<i>I want to confess my love to Kii soon.</i>

649
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,772
<i>I hope she feels the same.</i>

650
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,315
<i>Then I want to tackle her.</i>

651
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,692
A love tackle.

652
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:53,239
Getting tackled was, ultimately,
a good thing for Tenten as well,

653
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,908
<i>because, you know,</i>
<i>guys were annoyed with him.</i>

654
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,453
<i>- But with that tackle,</i>
- <i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

655
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,329
<i>he looked like a loser for a second.</i>

656
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,041
It helped them blow off some steam.

657
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,334
Yeah, they were thinking,
"This guy's a jerk."

658
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,670
It's a rite of passage
to give newcomers a beating.

659
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,047
Oh! Is that so? I see.

660
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,591
- That makes sense.
- They were initiating him.

661
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,551
- It could have been worse.
- Yeah.

662
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,304
- It wasn't that bad.
- I see how it is now.

663
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,975
- <i>Time for the sauna.</i>
- Sauna time.

664
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,352
<i>This sauna date</i>
<i>should be chosen by the boys</i>

665
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,146
<i>after discussing amongst themselves.</i>

666
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,523
- Nice! Hell, yeah!
- Me, me, me!

667
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,151
Tsuu, step up. This guy wants it.

668
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,111
No way I'm backing down on this one.

669
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,405
- I ain't backing down either.
- How do we choose?

670
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,490
Whatever you want.

671
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,784
Let's throw a dart.
Closest to a bull's-eye wins?

672
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,660
- Nice idea.
- That'll work. Yeah, yeah.

673
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,412
Good idea, pretty boy.

674
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,914
I'm totally going with Kii.

675
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,665
- Thought so.
- So much confidence.

676
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,293
- He's so sweet.
- I'll help you out, Tackle.

677
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,670
- He's adorable.
- I'm going with Kii, for sure.

678
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,423
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- It'll decide the order.

679
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,092
They're getting right to it.

680
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,302
- Tackle is asserting himself.
- He's making a move.

681
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,429
Here I go.

682
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,642
- Okay!
- Look!

683
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,143
- Good.
- Nice.

684
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,978
- Who's next?
- Me.

685
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,522
If you win, you'll go.

686
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,279
I'm out.

687
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,241
- No way I'm losing this.
- It's not over yet. Come on.

688
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,827
- Anything could happen, right?
- Both out.

689
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,248
- We're tied.
- So lame.

690
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,375
- Yeah, but…
- It's so close.

691
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,876
I'm so pumped for this!

692
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,212
- Give it all you've got!
- I'm gonna crush this!

693
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,717
- What?!
- No way!

694
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,594
- Such a wimp!
- My turn.

695
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,847
Ah!

696
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,308
Man, I've already won.
What the heck? Hold up!

697
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,393
This is my big chance.

698
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,895
- Can't believe it.
- Too funny.

699
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,189
You can do it.

700
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,692
- Wow, that was amazing.
- Yay!

701
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,943
- Amazing!
- Nice shot.

702
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,613
- Whoa! What a shot!
- He's finally getting some action.

703
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,532
Tsuu's feelings are still
a mystery, right?

704
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,742
- A total mystery.
- I wonder who he wants to go with.

705
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,785
I don't know.

706
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,453
You did it!

707
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,164
- Nice shot!
- Nice one.

708
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,833
- Happy for him.
- I'm happy.

709
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,960
- Tsukahara's got game.
- Congrats!

710
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,254
- That felt incredible.
- What a shot.

711
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,631
Sorry, guys. I'm headed to the sauna.

712
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,009
No one has any right
to complain after landing

713
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,803
- such an incredible winning shot.
- No way, it was the best.

714
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,431
- Let's go.
- Ah!

715
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,892
- Looks like we're going.
- Let's go.

716
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,185
Whoa!

717
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,936
- So it's Kii.
- That's who it is.

718
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,731
- Good luck, man.
- Sorry, guys. I'm out.

719
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,107
Go on, get out of here.

720
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,526
- I did win.
- Go on, you big winner.

721
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,195
From now on, I'm number one.

722
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,571
Oh, is that so?

723
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,365
- <i>Tackle does not look happy.</i>
- See you all soon.

724
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,286
REFRESHED

725
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,039
NATURAL HOT SPRINGS & SAUNA

726
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,920
<i>Hold up. This looks so wrong.</i>

727
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,297
- What's happening?
- Like a <i>yakuza </i>movie.

728
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,382
Is this normal for a dating show?

729
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,134
This is still a dating show. Don't worry.

730
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,638
- Damn! That's cool.
- What?

731
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,390
- Oh, so cool!
- Awesome, huh?

732
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,559
- Crazy, huh?
- Amazing!

733
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,603
No wonder they were all so impressed.

734
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,980
- This is my first time seeing it.
- Are these Jacuzzis?

735
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,107
- Jacuzzi, or a cold bath.
- Oh, separate tubs.

736
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,401
So cool! You want to jump right in?

737
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,363
- In we go.
- Finally got picked first.

738
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,323
That last throw was fun, right?

739
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,283
So crazy.
It was a good thing you went last.

740
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,160
- For the best.
- Yeah.

741
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,787
- Yay!
- "Yay" is right.

742
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,789
- "'Yay' is right"?
- That was some sick teamwork.

743
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,208
- I was shaking, for real.
- You were shaking?

744
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,584
The sauna is great.

745
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,712
We could pour water on stones
in here, no doubt.

746
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,714
Are you sad?

747
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,093
She's in a swimsuit, you're missing it.

748
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,011
I wanted to be the first to see it.

749
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,930
Totally. Of course.

750
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,976
- Swimsuits are sexy, right?
- Mmm.

751
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,563
- I'm getting marbled skin.
<i>- Amami?</i>

752
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,440
Is that, like, sweat that's sweet?

753
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,736
It's when your blood vessels
get super blotchy, like this, here.

754
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,697
You see it?

755
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,158
- And here. That's amami.
- I see it.

756
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,744
I thought your skin was turning sweet.

757
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,579
- That's not it.
- Like honey for bees.

758
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,748
No, no, that's what it's called, <i>amami.</i>

759
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,333
Really? <i>Amami?</i>

760
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,252
I still don't get it.

761
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,547
When your skin turns red like this,
it means the sauna is a good temp.

762
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,340
- That's what that means?
- Yeah.

763
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,302
- I've got it too. Look at that.
- Look, you've got it good.

764
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,761
That's good <i>amami </i>going on.

765
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,140
Damn, I'm gonna lose it.

766
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,520
<i>Tsukahara,</i>
<i>he's seeing Kii in her swimsuit.</i>

767
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,522
<i>We're already halfway through.</i>

768
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,316
Damn it.

769
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,735
That's crazy.

770
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,572
I think you should give love
a real chance. You know?

771
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,325
- Oh, yeah?
- Maybe it'll be wild, you'll feel younger.

772
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,492
I'm not made for it.

773
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,703
You said you broke up
with your last girlfriend,

774
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,331
but you still loved her,
because you didn't want her to move

775
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,666
- and put her kid in a new school.
- Exactly.

776
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,545
My ex had her own house,
and her kid was getting older.

777
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,341
Her family had settled down
and were happy where they were.

778
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,510
I decided to move back to my hometown
so I could open a bar.

779
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,846
When I told her,
she said she'd come with me,

780
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,975
but she had a house
and her kid wasn't little anymore.

781
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,228
They had friends in the neighborhood,
and at school.

782
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,191
I didn't want her to move with the kid,
so I said, "We got to break up."

783
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,359
I totally loved her.

784
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,694
Even though we loved each other,
we still broke up.

785
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,322
- That's hard.
- It was tough.

786
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,907
- I bet it was.
- Yeah, really tough.

787
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,827
A relationship after that sounds hard.
You haven't dated since then?

788
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,163
There was no one else?
Still hung up on her?

789
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,209
No, I mean, I decided not to date anyone
until she was happy.

790
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,835
What? What do you mean?

791
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,338
Well, it'd make her feel betrayed
if I pushed her away,

792
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,673
- and then I dated someone before she did.
- That's sad!

793
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,467
- She should be happy first.
- Seriously?

794
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,637
Yeah, that was why.
But I heard she's happy now.

795
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,390
- Oh, word got around.
- Kind of recently.

796
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,266
- Through mutual friends, right?
- Yeah. Right.

797
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,518
Then you came on the show?

798
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,646
You should have told us that sooner.
It's so cool.

799
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,564
- It's not that big.
- I got chills.

800
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,484
- Really? Chills?
- I've got even more <i>amami </i>now.

801
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,194
Are you sure that's not the sauna?

802
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,321
- It's both you and the sauna.
- Yeah.

803
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,032
But, seriously, that's the real story.

804
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,160
- Wow. So cool. That's so deep.
- Yeah, so…

805
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,371
It'd be messed up if I moved on first.

806
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,040
I've never met another guy like you.

807
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,292
- I mean, well…
- My heart skipped.

808
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,337
- One beat? That's great.
- <i>Oh, boy.</i>

809
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,714
Skipped one beat. Nice, nice.

810
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,466
Anyone would have done that.

811
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,302
Look at you.
You're feeling pretty good, aren't you?

812
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,347
You're gazing up to the sky.

813
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,516
It's nothing special at all. Seriously.

814
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,435
You gotta walk the talk, you know?

815
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,733
He said he wouldn't fall in love
until his ex-girlfriend was happy.

816
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,445
Not a lot of people
would do something like that.

817
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,155
That was a classy breakup.

818
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,532
- He had her best interests in mind.
- For sure.

819
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,617
He has such a good heart.

820
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,744
The question is,
what does Kii think about it?

821
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,912
- Right.
- Yeah.

822
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,582
I always wonder about
what women prioritize.

823
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,294
It's about more than just looks, right?
Depends on the person, I guess.

824
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,672
When I was younger,
I cared about looks a lot.

825
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,842
But as I got older, I started to care more
about what's inside.

826
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,343
You know, whether he's kind.

827
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,846
I think more women find kindness
attractive as they age.

828
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,848
He's got such a great personality.

829
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,893
He's so kind.
A straight-up good guy, for sure.

830
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,102
Definitely.

831
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,949
- There you are.
- Hey.

832
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,075
Welcome back.

833
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,744
- Hey, you.
- Welcome back.

834
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,831
- I think that belongs to Baby. For sure.
- Oh, it's Baby's?

835
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,042
- I'll give it to her. Thanks.
- Okay, and that…

836
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,084
Yeah?

837
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,212
How was it? You have fun?

838
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,088
Yeah, it was nice, you know?

839
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,715
- We talked about love.
- Hmm.

840
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,259
He's so incredibly nice.

841
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,889
- He told me about his ex.
- Yeah, I get it. Hmm.

842
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,806
He said,

843
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,103
"I decided to wait until my ex
found happiness before I dated anyone."

844
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,772
That's why he came on the show.

845
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,316
- That's deep.
- It was deep.

846
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,401
- I was like, "For real?"
- Whoa.

847
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,863
I was feeling a bit jealous,
but I can't after that.

848
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,031
He's great, right?

849
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,118
- Let's talk tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll bring my A-game. Battle's on.

850
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,871
- See ya. Good night. See ya.
- See ya. Good night.

851
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,506
- Ta-da!
- Oh!

852
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,841
- You're looking refreshed.
- Just like that.

853
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,051
So, how was it?

854
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,887
When I asked him
why he hadn't dated for so long,

855
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:42,351
he said, "I broke up with someone I loved
because I knew she'd be better off."

856
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:46,188
"I didn't date anyone because I thought
I shouldn't find new love until she did."

857
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,731
- What the heck?
- That's deep.

858
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,441
- That is so deep.
- Yeah.

859
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,652
- Your heart flutter?
- But, you know…

860
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,905
- I was like, "No way." Yeah, it hit me.
- You felt it?

861
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,907
- Who wouldn't?
- My whole body felt it.

862
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,410
<i>I wanted us to share more</i>
<i>about each other.</i>

863
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,954
I wanted to hear more about him.

864
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:05,040
So far, I'd say it's easiest
to be myself with Tsuu.

865
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,585
He's great. Tsuu is the best.

866
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,089
I couldn't see Tackle's reaction
when Tsuu asked me to join him.

867
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,091
I'll tell you, it was crazy.

868
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,136
- I thought a fight was gonna break out.
- Yeah, for real.

869
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,139
Tackle was there
at the bottom of the stairs.

870
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,100
- We were all hanging out, he disappeared.
- Really?

871
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,810
<i>He was like, "Kii's not here."</i>

872
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,730
<i>"I'm gonna go tell her</i>
<i>how painful it feels."</i>

873
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,025
<i>He said, "I'll wait for her."</i>
<i>So, that's why he was there.</i>

874
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,860
He never came back to the living room.

875
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,361
Really?

876
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,156
Yeah. I mean, you know Tackle.

877
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,867
It was so sad.
I kept telling him, "Don't hold back."

878
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,993
"Tell her how you feel."

879
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,538
When I told him, "If you want to go,
you should go, right now."

880
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,248
He was like, "Yeah, you're right."

881
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,417
- And then he left for the sauna.
- It was sweet.

882
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,127
Like he might barge in.

883
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,634
You know, I'm gonna tell him tomorrow.

884
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,887
What? Tell who?

885
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,890
- Tackle.
- Tell him what?

886
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,561
- What will you tell him?
- Yeah, what?

887
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,773
How I really feel.

888
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,483
Which is what?
