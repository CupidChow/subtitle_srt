1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,055
I wonder if I should find Baby.

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,808
But in terms of how I'm leaning,

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,059
I might go for Oto.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,811
I connect with her, and she's faithful.

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,648
Really? Wait, what did you say?

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,317
Well, this is certainly
a sudden turn of events.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,485
Mmm.

8
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,071
I'd also be confused.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,656
Wait, this is too crazy.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,324
I don't think the girls know.

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,326
I haven't even told the guys
about how I feel.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,244
Oh wow!

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,289
We should have a serious talk.

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,582
Milk, let's talk.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,168
Hey. Let's talk.

16
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,253
- What is it?
- Let's talk.

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,171
Okay.

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,884
- Did you drink a lot?
- No, I did not.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,055
- I feel the most comfortable in here.
- I know, right? Isn't it great?

20
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,974
I feel more comfortable in here
than in the girls' room.

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,352
Why so far?

22
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,771
No reason.

23
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,522
MILK (22) - CONSTRUCTION WORKER

24
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:10,653
YURIA AKA BABY (25) - PAINTER & TALENT

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,782
So, I was just wondering
how you're feeling right now.

26
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,534
I know I haven't asked you
how you've been doing in a little while.

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,369
Yeah. Mmm.

28
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,957
Right now, I'm feeling like…

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,087
maybe up until three days ago…

30
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,715
that you were my only choice.

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,428
Mmm.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,431
Hmm…

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,476
And then, things just got hard for me.

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,812
Um…

35
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,565
Even when we talk,

36
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,486
it never really goes anywhere.

37
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,239
And that's something
I feel kinda pathetic about.

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,660
But I was really interested in you.

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,375
And I don't know if this is just me
overthinking things or what,

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,838
but the one thing I wasn't looking for
was always having to chase after someone.

41
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,925
And maybe it's just that I wasn't
coming on strongly enough for you.

42
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,760
But from my perspective,

43
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,848
I liked hanging out
and wanted to get serious.

44
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,558
But I felt like I was…

45
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,687
chasing you too much.

46
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,608
Once I thought that,
it made me take a step back.

47
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,528
I thought I'd just end up getting hurt.

48
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,613
And Tsukahara, who I really respect,

49
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,491
he told me that he likes you.

50
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,493
And so,

51
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,455
I guess I'm feeling like
I should just quit

52
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,124
before it gets too hard for me.

53
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,130
So I guess I'll ask you.
How do you feel about Tsukahara?

54
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,593
Well…

55
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,183
right now,
it's just you and me who are talking.

56
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,977
So I don't think
I need to talk about that.

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,895
Mmm.

58
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,823
Hmm. Actually, when it comes to you, Milk…

59
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>You were the first one here</i>
<i>who came up and talked to me.</i>

60
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>Mmm.</i>

61
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,711
You were very open and honest with me,
and so I was open and honest with you.

62
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,504
And so,

63
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,883
I just did the best that I could
in my own way.

64
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,800
Mmm.

65
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,478
I'm torn.

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,396
It's hard for me to decide.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,107
Even though
we're running out of time here.

68
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,318
I mean, I guess it's just that…

69
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,782
I struggle with saying things like,

70
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,117
"I wanna talk to you again"
or "I miss you."

71
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,247
I have a hard time
sharing my feelings with people openly.

72
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,624
I wish I could, but…

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,211
I feel like what happened in my past

74
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,048
has prevented me from being able to
share my feelings with people

75
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,050
or to be open with them.

76
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,637
- I just can't.
- Mmm.

77
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,602
But despite all that, you've still
stuck around by my side this whole time.

78
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,903
And so, I really just…

79
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,116
wish that I was able to be…

80
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,161
just able to be more open with you.

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,542
I've tried to be as open as I can be,
harder than I've tried my entire life.

82
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,459
Mmm.

83
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,171
And so I really don't wanna
just end things with you this way.

84
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,384
But I also just wanna know
how you're feeling about things right now.

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,302
Mmm.

86
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,064
<i>This is difficult.</i>

87
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,942
<i>My feelings have kind of been wavering.</i>

88
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,362
I have lost my confidence.

89
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,655
I know that for sure.

90
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,326
Mmm, It's a difficult situation

91
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,621
because, at the end of the day,
I really do enjoy spending time with Oto.

92
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,958
<i>I like how faithful and caring she is.</i>

93
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
I can't decide.

94
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,259
I guess this is just what happens
when you're actually falling in love.

95
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,430
It's been hard on me.

96
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,894
<i>I thought it would be painful</i>
<i>if I kept falling for Baby.</i>

97
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,776
And on the last day,
I just wanna be true to myself.

98
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,863
I'm gonna have to keep thinking
about this until the last minute.

99
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,618
Be honest with yourself.

100
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,911
Mmm.

101
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,374
I need to keep thinking about it
up until the last moment.

102
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,793
Because there's someone who's…

103
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,881
very serious about me, and I don't wanna
make a poorly-thought-out decision.

104
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,258
I don't wanna just go with the flow.

105
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,260
I need time to respond properly.

106
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,346
So I think I'm just gonna take
all the time I have

107
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,931
to really think this through.

108
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,975
I talked with Baby.

109
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,353
Just with everything
that's happened in her past,

110
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,523
I wanna be able to take that all on
and move forward with her.

111
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,274
But those are just words.

112
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,945
I wanna show her that through my actions.

113
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,907
I wanna face things head-on,
no matter the result.

114
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,537
And as a man, you need to take action.

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,247
Yeah. I'll try.

116
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,540
TSU-CHAN (30)

117
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,624
It's ending, Nisei.

118
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,209
<i>These two again.</i>

119
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,127
You're right.

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,795
I'm not really sure.

121
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,463
I don't know anymore.

122
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,965
AMO (27)

123
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,092
- You said…
- I might be falling for her.

124
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,552
NISEI (27)

125
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,387
- I might be.
- What?

126
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,265
So your feelings have changed?

127
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,142
It's starting to get confusing.

128
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,936
<i>Oto told me too much.</i>
<i>My head's in a weird place.</i>

129
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>Mmm. What do you mean?</i>

130
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,357
You'd told her you weren't into her,
but your feelings changed?

131
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,484
Well, yeah, like…

132
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,487
It's difficult.

133
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,656
I'm having such a hard time

134
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,033
putting my feelings into words.

135
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,547
With Oto,
she was really coming on so strongly.

136
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,217
And it makes me unsure.

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,429
I basically told him everything.

138
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,724
I mean, pretty much
just short of a full-on confession.

139
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,267
It should be obvious by now.

140
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,354
If he's still not sure after that,
it's not happening. Mmm.

141
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,612
Well, my only real option left
is to get Nisei to confess to me.

142
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,989
I don't think I'd even know how to react

143
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,283
if somebody else
ended up confessing to me.

144
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,118
I feel like I'm committed.

145
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,077
OTO-SAN (22)

146
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,580
So I've made up my mind to stay faithful.

147
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,873
Well, honestly,

148
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,919
I just genuinely wanted
to get to know Tenten better.

149
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,629
So I guess, in that sense, I…

150
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,547
TEKARIN (21)

151
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,548
Hmm…

152
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,217
Let me think.

153
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,637
I guess I really just wanted
to spend more time with him.

154
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,597
I was really unsure.

155
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,807
But I've made up my mind.

156
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,725
TENTEN (25)

157
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,726
Yeah.

158
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,436
TACKLE (24) - BONSAI CRAFTSMAN

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
The confession!

160
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,651
I feel like if I think too much about it,
I'll end up driving myself crazy.

161
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,819
I'll just say whatever I'm feeling.

162
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,323
At first, I was like,
"None of these guys are really my type."

163
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,868
But the more I got to know them,
the more I found them endearing.

164
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,621
So now I'm kind of…

165
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:04,877
KIREI AKA KIICHAN (23)
MODEL & MAKEUP TEACHER

166
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,213
- It's been a pleasure.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,966
These past two weeks
were a lotta fun. Thank you.

168
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,883
Likewise.

169
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,510
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

170
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,096
All right. I have a present for you all.

171
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,891
Tsuu, my favorite person.

172
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,102
- Oh, no way!
- Everyone loves him.

173
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,646
- What?
- T-shirts!

174
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,606
With Tsuu on them!

175
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,734
"An undefeated life,
an unbreakable spirit!"

176
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,653
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Please…

177
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,530
- Wear it and remember us.
- Thanks.

178
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,490
<i>These guys got really close.</i>

179
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>I never thought this would happen.</i>

180
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,953
I was really touched.

181
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,708
And seeing everybody get so happy
made me get even more emotional.

182
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,625
Yeah.

183
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,086
We'll have each other's backs, always.

184
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,379
Yeah.

185
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,047
We should wear these tomorrow.

186
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,173
- Yeah.
- We should.

187
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,466
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

188
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,844
Tomorrow, friends are friends.

189
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,638
- But if not, rivals are rivals.
- Gotta switch gears.

190
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,723
We'll still be friends.

191
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,683
- Let's fight! All right!
- Yes.

192
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,020
- An undefeated life!
- Yeah!

193
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,988
- Amazing. Yeah.
- Yeah, it is, right?

194
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,241
The night before the confessions,
the night before graduation,

195
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,659
these were the conversations.

196
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,954
Milk shared how he was
honestly feeling with Baby.

197
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,042
I think that he needs to be
a little bit more grounded as a man.

198
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,461
- Mmm. Yeah.
- That's just what I think.

199
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,006
It's like if you're gonna pursue somebody,
of course it might hurt.

200
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,677
"If I pursue somebody,
then I might get hurt"

201
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,846
is not a phrase that's in my dictionary.

202
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,890
- Oh, that was a nice one.
- Nice. Cool.

203
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,476
If you like someone,
you're gonna wanna chase them, right?

204
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,560
Yeah.

205
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,438
If you're worried about getting hurt,
then you don't really like them.

206
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,649
- I see.
- It's impossible not to feel that way.

207
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,817
And then Baby started crying during this.

208
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,112
Right, so she likes Milk enough
to end up crying about him.

209
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,948
- Mmm.
- But the other thing about Milk is

210
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,243
he says he likes Baby but now Oto as well.

211
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,038
Right. He was starting
to talk about how he liked her.

212
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,206
- True.
- Yeah.

213
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,834
So what's Milk gonna end up doing?
It's time to confess.

214
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,128
Next up, we have Nisei and Amo.

215
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,339
So he's saying these things now?

216
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,965
I didn't think he'd be so indecisive.

217
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,092
Right.

218
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,220
I just thought he seemed like
he would be more of an assertive guy.

219
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,555
But now he seems like
he's really conflicted, doesn't he?

220
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,307
Mmm.

221
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,687
I guess Oto's very aggressive approach
must've had an effect on him.

222
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,815
- Yeah.
- I was kinda surprised that it did.

223
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,901
- Maybe he got affected by her underboobs.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

224
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,319
- The clothes.
- It's lust!

225
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,613
- Oh yeah.
- The clothes were very tempting.

226
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,365
He's really all over the place.

227
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,908
- Yeah.
- And now we're here.

228
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,744
And even if he does confess to Amo,
you've gotta just be like,

229
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,539
"I dunno. This guy has said
all these different things," you know?

230
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,041
- That's true.
- Right?

231
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,002
And so now, I think that
you really have to start questioning

232
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,131
if Amo would even accept
a confession from him.

233
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,800
It's a reminder
that they're all kind of just

234
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,802
- living in the moment right now.
- Right.

235
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,139
- One word could change everything.
- That's very true.

236
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,391
- Like they change course suddenly.
- That's it.

237
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,308
Yeah.

238
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,187
With that said, the graduation ceremony
is finally about to begin.

239
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,482
- So what is going to happen?
- Everyone's gonna make some decision.

240
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
FINAL DAY - GRADUATION CEREMONY

241
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,112
BADLY IN LOVE

242
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,280
GRADUATION CEREMONY

243
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,449
<i>Today is the last day.</i>

244
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,575
<i>Confession day.</i>

245
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,788
<i>Dress up and head to the gym</i>
<i>for the graduation ceremony.</i>

246
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>Or should I say, the confession ceremony.</i>

247
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,754
I LOVE YOU

248
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,591

<i>First up…</i>

274
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,780
<i>- Tsuu.</i>
- Okay.

275
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,991
BADASS

276
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,993
<i>We're gonna start with Tsuu right away?</i>

277
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,828
<i>Yeah, here he comes.</i>

278
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,331
- <i>This'll be a turbulent start.</i>
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

279
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,125
- <i>What's Milk gonna do?</i>
- <i>Right?</i>

280
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,585
<i>You should go, Milk.</i>

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,670
Uh…

282
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,923
It's Tsuu here.

283
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,925
Uh, these past two weeks…

284
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,929
Okay, so I really didn't like
communal living.

285
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,933
<i>And at the start,</i>
<i>I really wanted to kill all of you.</i>

286
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,850
<i>Wait, why?</i>

287
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,063
But as we talked,
you all turned out to be very nice.

288
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,191
<i>We got to know each other so well.</i>
<i>It's hard to believe it was only 2 weeks.</i>

289
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,487
I think we all got to know
one another so well.

290
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,615
And what was especially memorable for me

291
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,701
was that I'd never spent
much time with kids before.

292
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,828
And I mean,
with looking the way that I look,

293
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:59,124
<i>I really thought it was possible</i>
<i>that the kids wouldn't like me</i>

294
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,669
<i>or that they might even be scared of me.</i>

295
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,631
<i>But then I was actually</i>
<i>able to spend time with them.</i>

296
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,216
<i>I saw them smiling a lot,</i>

297
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,635
<i>and I saw them having a lot of fun</i>

298
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,929
and, in general, just being happy.

299
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,056
I experienced a lot of new things.

300
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,228
<i>And so, these past two weeks</i>
<i>really went by in a flash.</i>

301
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>That's how I really feel.</i>

302
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,776
And so I felt like I…
like I had a fresh start

303
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,947
and that I could grow as a person,
even with things I'm not good at.

304
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,369
I want to overcome those things
with an unbreakable spirit

305
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,454
and become a perfect person someday.

306
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,124
Ultimately, what I really want to become

307
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,459
is a man amongst men.

308
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,878
So,

309
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,715
If I'm being honest,
when we first started,

310
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,384
I didn't think I'd find a girl

311
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,303
that I liked in just two weeks.

312
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,222
I had my doubts.

313
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,141
Uh…

314
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:01,854
So we didn't have that much time here,
but I did find someone.

315
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:02,771
Uh…

316
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,149
Someone I fell in love with.

317
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
And that girl is…

318
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,277
Baby.

319
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,532
- Yes.
- Yo!

320
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,552
<i>What's he gonna do?</i>

321
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,137
Uh…

322
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,014
- Well…
- Tsuu.

323
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,724
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>He's doing it.</i>

324
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,770
Lemme talk too.

325
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,314
Oh. What?

326
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,111
Yes! Good!

327
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,988
So he made up his mind.

328
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,783
- Sorry.
- Say your piece.

329
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,827
Mmm…

330
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,996
I had fun too.

331
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,042
And, Baby, right from the beginning,
I've always been interested in you.

332
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,087
<i>And you were always on my mind.</i>

333
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,131
<i>And last night, when we talked,</i>

334
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,344
I realized just how serious
my feelings were for you.

335
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,348
So, yeah.

336
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,812
I really, really like you.

337
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,866
I look like a stink bug.

338
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,120
- I like you in purple.
- It's cute.

339
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,633
<i>And these two guys</i>
<i>fought on the first day.</i>

340
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,343
<i>- Mmm.</i>
- <i>Mmm. That's right.</i>

341
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,973
Hmm…

342
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,520
First off, to both of you,

343
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:09,940
to Tsuu and to Milk, thank you.

344
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,028
For sharing your feelings with me,
thank you again.

345
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,868
I'm gonna start with you, Milk.

346
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,663
So, with you…

347
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,170
I was also nervous about communal living.

348
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,130
<i>But with you,</i>

349
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
<i>you've always been with me from the start.</i>

350
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,385
<i>You were by my side.</i>

351
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,263
And you always made me feel reassured.

352
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,766
You allowed me to really be able to
share my true feelings with you.

353
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,437
But…

354
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,899
I don't know.

355
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,693
Yesterday, you told me
that you weren't sure

356
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,279
about your feelings for me anymore.

357
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,785
And that really shocked me.

358
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,166
And because you were able to be
so direct with your feelings towards me,

359
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,170
I knew that
I also had to be direct with you.

360
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,342
And I couldn't help but feel that
your feelings for me were shallow,

361
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,177
that you weren't committed.

362
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,223
Yeah.

363
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,477
But also, your…

364
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,273
I don't think you were being dishonest
with me when we would talk about things

365
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,858
or when you did things for me.

366
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,154
That's why I was really torn
right until the end.

367
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,033
And I also really do like you as a person.

368
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,535
Which made it even harder.

369
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,081
But I still really do
care about you a lot.

370
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,500
Even if it's not romantically.

371
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,003
Yeah.

372
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,214
So thank you so much for that.

373
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,799
No, thank you, Baby.

374
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,263
And now, Tsuu…

375
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,265
Well, with you…

376
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,476
You started asking me out

377
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,728
halfway through all of this.

378
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,524
And I was honestly very happy about that.

379
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,112
<i>When all of us were together in a group,</i>
<i>you were the life of the party.</i>

380
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,281
<i>But when it was just the two of us,</i>

381
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,742
<i>I could tell that</i>
<i>you were being serious with me.</i>

382
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,660
Yeah.

383
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,204
That's what I thought.

384
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,000
That you were serious about
trying to get to know me. Yeah.

385
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,127
I could tell.

386
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,504
And I could really feel it.

387
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,048
I could.

388
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,428
When I thought about
why I came here or about…

389
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,099
finding someone to fall for,
I thought of someone like you.

390
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:54,271
Someone who would be there for me
and who would make me happy

391
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,481
That's what I thought.

392
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,449
And so, I wanna thank you for showing me

393
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,951
what that world might look like.

394
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,703
Thank you.

395
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,916
I would like
to get to know you more and more

396
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,336
and to continue to get closer with you.

397
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,758
So I'd like to ask
if you wanna go out with me.

398
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,134
I do.

399
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,138
I'd be honored.

400
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,515
Thank you.

401
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,478
Wow!

402
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,729
That's what's up!

403
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,773
That was amazing, Tsuu!

404
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,192
- That's what's up!
- Good job!

405
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,486
Really. Thank you.

406
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,487
Wait, what?

407
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,406
- Congrats!
- Thank you.

408
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,367
- You're very cool.
- Thank you.

409
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,077
All right, I'm ready.

410
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,800
<i>Next up…</i>

411
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
<i>Tackle.</i>

412
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,472
- Yeah.
- <i>All right!</i>

413
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,516
- <i>Go for it, Tackle.</i>
- <i>Go for it!</i>

414
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,351
<i>You've been loyal the whole time.</i>

415
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,317
Hey, it's Tackle.

416
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,611
I was outta my comfort zone here.

417
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,490
And at first,
I didn't know if I was gonna fit in.

418
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,492
But I really believe that

419
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,579
I've built relationships with everyone
that I can be grateful for.

420
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,959
<i>Each one of you is your own person,</i>

421
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,586
<i>and you each have</i>
<i>your own set of principles.</i>

422
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,715
<i>These things</i>
<i>aren't obvious on the outside,</i>

423
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,008
<i>but I learned them.</i>

424
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,512
That's what I've done since being here.

425
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,933
And I also wanted
to show the girl that I liked

426
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,145
what kind of man I really was.

427
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,399
It took me a while to be able to do that.

428
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,901
But I…

429
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,529
Uh…

430
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,240
The girl that I like is…

431
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,158
Kii.

432
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,715
May I?

433
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,383
So, Kii,

434
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,052
you are your own person.

435
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,558
You have such a strong conviction,
you're even able to lecture the guys.

436
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,768
I feel like you're capable of doing things

437
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,812
that I couldn't do myself.

438
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:46,776
<i>And that… made me</i>
<i>want to get to know you even more.</i>

439
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,698
I hope that we can start as friends.

440
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,368
Actually, not as friends.

441
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,788
I hope we can start a relationship.

442
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,706
Thank you.

443
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,465
I'll go.

444
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,066
Well, Kii,

445
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,028
we started as acquaintances.

446
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,366
I never thought
I'd end up falling in love with you.

447
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,745
But it also felt like it was fate.

448
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,830
You're very ambitious too.

449
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,125
And so,

450
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,545
I suddenly

451
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,131
realized that I had feelings for you.

452
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,850
I'll definitely make you happy.

453
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,604
So please, Kii, will you be mine?

454
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,135
Tackle, from day one,
you've been all in on me.

455
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,013
It was like love at first sight.

456
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,307
You were always trying
to make a move on me.

457
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,478
But I think that you're definitely
a bit more of a shy type of guy.

458
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,188
And because of that, I don't think

459
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,610
you were very used to the things
that I look for in a romantic partner.

460
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,113
You were probably trying a bunch
of different things to figure that out,

461
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,407
and you've always been loyal to me.

462
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,952
You were definitely a big presence
during my time here.

463
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:05,707
<i>You were always telling me</i>
<i>that you liked everything about me,</i>

464
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,001
<i>and that honestly made me</i>
<i>feel very reassured.</i>

465
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,628
Thank you.

466
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,713
And now, Tenten.

467
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,424
You showed up
about midway through all of this.

468
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,052
And I was just like, "I know him!"

469
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,138
Honestly, I was just
so surprised to see you.

470
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:25,060
And so, like, the first time
that you asked me to hang out,

471
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,480
<i>I was thinking that</i>
<i>you probably just did that</i>

472
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,273
<i>because we already knew each other.</i>

473
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,985
<i>But it wasn't until later</i>
<i>after we talked that I realized</i>

474
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,073
that you actually were interested in me
and liked me in that way.

475
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:44,245
And so, once I finally realized
that was the way that you actually saw me,

476
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:49,334
I was torn between Tackle's kind eyes
watching over me and your direct approach.

477
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:54,005
I just kept saying to myself,
"What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?"

478
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,425
I thought that standing here
would help me make a decision.

479
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,762
Because to tell you the truth,
by the end of last night,

480
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,681
I still didn't know
who I was going to pick.

481
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,229
And now that I'm really standing here,

482
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,564
I realize that…

483
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,243
I can't.

484
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,166
- Neither one?
- What?

485
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,585
- Mmm.
- Neither of them?

486
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,963
I mean…

487
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,383
I just really wasn't able
to get to that place.

488
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,010
That's just honestly the way I felt.

489
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,179
And if I'm being completely honest,

490
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,058
it felt like all of us
were more like friends.

491
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,185
I had a lot of fun with you guys,

492
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,355
and I felt very comfortable
just being able to laugh together.

493
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,733
And I was worried that
if we became boyfriend-girlfriend,

494
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,651
that might end someday.

495
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,654
And so instead of having
a romantic relationship,

496
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:06,578
I would like us to all still be friends
or even be like a family.

497
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,371
Sorry.

498
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,789
Thank you.

499
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

500
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,585
You were cool.

501
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,471
Thank you.

502
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,806
<i>Hmm…</i>

503
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,892
- <i>They tried.</i>
- <i>Did their best.</i>

504
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,269
<i>Lastly…</i>

505
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,939
<i>- Nisei.</i>
- All right!

506
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,275
<i>What're you gonna do? You couldn't decide.</i>

507
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,486
<i>Okay, so what's gonna happen now?</i>

508
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,712
Well, first, I wanna thank
the male and female cast members

509
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,255
for the past two weeks.

510
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,091
Uh…

511
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,262
Most of the people I've met
in my twenties so far,

512
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,057
I've met through my work.

513
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,642
That's what it seems like.

514
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,435
There are other people, obviously.

515
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,940
But honestly, I couldn't make
any other kinds of connections.

516
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,900
<i>But here,</i>

517
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,238
<i>we all became friends and family.</i>

518
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,406
<i>And for the first time,</i>

519
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,870
<i>I felt like I could open up to others.</i>

520
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,999
I hope we can stay friends.

521
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,504
Throughout these past two weeks,

522
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,466
the girl I fell in love with is…

523
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,101
Amo.

524
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,603
Yes.

525
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,400
- <i>Mmm.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah, I know.</i>

526
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,319
- <i>Ah, right?</i>
- <i>You gave it your all, Oto.</i>

527
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
Okay. Uh…

528
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,034
The first time I saw you dance,

529
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,872
I just thought that you looked
incredibly cute and beautiful.

530
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,959
Day by day, or actually, little by little,

531
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,378
my feelings started to grow for you.

532
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,548
When you talked to other guys,
I felt jealous.

533
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,925
So I knew I really liked you.

534
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,094
Amo.

535
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,723
Be my girlfriend, please.

536
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,783
Thank you.

537
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,998
Mmm… Well, I…

538
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,125
Lemme think.

539
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,378
I usually am a bit more passive.

540
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,256
Mmm… But then when I got here,

541
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,178
I thought that I should probably
try and do something different.

542
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,515
All the other people here
really helped me realize that.

543
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,435
And so, well…

544
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,563
At least in my head,

545
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,274
I felt like I'd already

546
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,861
done everything that I possibly could.

547
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,364
I felt like
I did all of that two days ago.

548
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,952
And so, I guess I was really just…

549
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,248
waiting to see
what you'd end up doing next,

550
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,459
if I'm being completely honest with you.

551
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,129
And I had no idea what you would do.

552
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,091
And like…

553
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,513
us girls are all very close.

554
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,016
And we talk about things. Mmm.

555
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,477
<i>So I heard all kinds of things.</i>

556
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,813
- <i>Things did happen.</i>
- <i>They did.</i>

557
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,690
<i>- All these things happened.</i>
<i>- It's all true.</i>

558
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,650
<i>Watching them again makes my jaw drop.</i>

559
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:06,734
<i>It's shocking.</i>

560
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,196
And so, I mean,
at least for me, personally…

561
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,116
Mmm… I won't lie to you.

562
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,577
There were definitely things
that bugged me and annoyed me.

563
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,169
Mmm.

564
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,257
But also, I… Mmm.

565
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,803
I'm very happy that I met you. I am.

566
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,809
Mmm… So…

567
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,271
Let's leave here together.

568
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,272
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

569
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>Wow!</i>

570
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,655
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

571
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,535
- Cute! You look so happy!
- Congrats.

572
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,204
Congratulations!

573
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,048
<i>And now, the ceremony is over.</i>

574
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,385
Actually, would it be okay
if I was able to say a few words?

575
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,096
Sorry, everyone.

576
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,681
But because I wasn't called,

577
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,308
- I wanna say something.
- She's angry.

578
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,435
Please let me.

579
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,686
Huh?

580
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,146
Hmm?

581
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,147
Tekarin?

582
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,192
'Scuse me.

583
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:35,490
I just wanted to properly express
my gratitude to somebody

584
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,118
who made a very big impact on me
while I was here.

585
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,661
- Tenten.
- <i>Huh?</i>

586
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,121
Do you mind?

587
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,831
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

588
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,632
Well, before you came here, there was…

589
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,968
<i>somebody that I was pretty interested in.</i>

590
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,348
<i>He got expelled,</i>
<i>and I wasn't able to move on.</i>

591
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,265
<i>I still felt like</i>

592
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>I had all of these unresolved feelings</i>
<i>that were inside of me.</i>

593
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,940
That person had to leave the school.

594
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,859
But I decided that
I was going to stay here anyways.

595
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,446
And you were the person
who helped me make that decision.

596
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,370
And I was able to stay
and watch everyone graduate.

597
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,789
I was able to see that.

598
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,334
It was you who allowed me to stay.

599
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,462
You were the reason
I convinced myself to stay.

600
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,424
And that made me really, truly happy.

601
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,846
<i>And I learned a lot just from watching you</i>

602
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,682
go after what you wanted.

603
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,519
And you told me
that I should be more confident.

604
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:51,065
That resonated with me
more than anything else while I was here.

605
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
It made me wanna live more honestly.

606
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,697
I'm glad I was able to meet

607
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,408
somebody who's nice like you.

608
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,702
I'm really proud of that.

609
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,997
And also, I was able to just see

610
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,792
how faithful Milk and Tackle were
to their two girls.

611
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,960
I saw that too.

612
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,922
That made me feel glad
that I didn't drop out.

613
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,842
Finding love
isn't the only thing that matters.

614
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,427
I was definitely encouraged

615
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,264
by seeing everyone
just trying their best to do so.

616
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,477
And because of that, I'm really glad
I was able to meet everyone.

617
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,229
Thank you.

618
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,065
Thank you.

619
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,323
Shall we go up there and yell?

620
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,164
<i>Badly in Love </i>is the best!

621
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,918
- All right!
- Off to finding a new love.

622
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,294
- Right?
- Right.

623
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,214
Let's be sure to cheer each other on.

624
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,882
I've got no regrets.

625
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,010
- <i>Oh, that's good. You did good.</i>
- <i>Oto, you did so great.</i>

626
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,929
'Kay. Let's head out.

627
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,972
- <i>Let's get outta here.</i>
- <i>Let's go.</i>

628
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,152
THANK YOU - MILK

629
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,071
I'LL MISS YOU! - BABY

630
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,906
NEVER LOSE HEART!

631
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,699
SEE YOU AGAIN - NISEI

632
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,826
I'M GLAD I MET YOU ALL - AMO

633
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,787
THANK YOU! - OTO-SAN

634
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,789
CHEERS - TACKLE

635
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,666
ONCE IN A LIFETIME

636
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,542
LOVE YOU ALL - TENSEI

637
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,628
FRIENDS FOREVER - TEKARIN

638
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,798
BADLY IN LOVE
GRADUATION CEREMONY

639
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,941
They had the dark blue one.

640
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,859
That dark blue one
had the thing in the back.

641
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,444
<i>This is the two of them now.</i>

642
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,238
- <i>Tsuu.</i>
- <i>Carrying her bag.</i>

643
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,864
- In black too.
- In black too.

644
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,283
All right then.

645
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,332
Any memories from the school?

646
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,377
I have a lot of memories
from when we were there.

647
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,840
But I learned what it meant
to have a "Spring of a Lifetime."

648
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,260
I think I was laughing the entire time.

649
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,762
- Always laughing?
- Mmm-hmm.

650
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,930
Well, that's a good thing.

651
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,600
I have one regret.

652
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,856
- One.
- What's that?

653
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,360
So, when I confessed to you,

654
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,655
I don't feel like I did a very good job.

655
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,949
- Milk.
- Okay, yeah.

656
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,535
- That guy is just kind of a dummy.
- <i>Milk?</i>

657
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,245
He jumped in too quick.

658
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,289
- He's an idiot.
- His "Hold on!"

659
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,335
And because of that,
I wasn't able to tell you properly.

660
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,132
<i>We're friends. They mean a lot to me.</i>

661
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,551
<i>How I interact with people has changed.</i>

662
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,179
<i>Whether it's with work,</i>
<i>friends, relationships.</i>

663
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,430
<i>How do I put this?</i>

664
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,892
<i>It's love. I feel love.</i>

665
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,271
<i>It's been two months,</i>
<i>and I still miss everyone who was there.</i>

666
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,566
<i>They were so nice, and I just miss them.</i>

667
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,402
<i>There were so many times</i>
<i>throughout this process</i>

668
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,072
<i>where I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"I've grown so much."</i>

669
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,575
<i>I think there's just gonna be more</i>
<i>and more things I wanna try in my life.</i>

670
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,911
<i>So I'm just gonna keep working hard.</i>

671
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,955
<i>I think I grew a lot emotionally.</i>

672
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,958
<i>I do feel like a lot of us</i>
<i>are still connected in some way,</i>

673
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,379
<i>even though a couple of months have passed</i>
<i>since we left the academy.</i>

674
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:45,174
<i>The first thing I wanna be able to do</i>
<i>is to just love myself.</i>

675
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,426
<i>I just wanna keep working on myself.</i>

676
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,720
<i>That's my mindset for the time being.</i>

677
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,350
<i>I've found myself</i>
<i>wanting to contribute more</i>

678
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,810
<i>to society</i>

679
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,563
<i>ever since we volunteered</i>
<i>at the children's cafeteria.</i>

680
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,234
<i>And I started that off by picking up trash</i>

681
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,277
<i>in Kabukicho.</i>

682
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,571
<i>Oh, okay, that's good, that's good.</i>

683
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,785
Hey!

684
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,161
Oh, Tekarin!

685
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,580
Long time no see. I missed you.

686
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,040
<i>I really do love kids,</i>

687
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,461
<i>but I'm not able to work</i>
<i>at a nursery school because of my tattoos.</i>

688
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,047
<i>And I thought volunteering</i>
<i>at the children's cafeteria</i>

689
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,091
<i>was a really great experience.</i>

690
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,676
<i>And I wanna open my own.</i>

691
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,304
Our first time in Kyoto.

692
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,598
I know everything
there is to know about Kyoto.

693
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,601
- You grew up in this town, right?
- That's right.

694
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,647
My parents live close by.

695
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,316
Let's go to their house.

696
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,651
And you can meet my mom.

697
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,778
I love her.

698
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,322
She's into the ukulele now.

699
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,700
- We can sing.
- Let's do that.

700
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,743
We'll be happy together.

701
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,370
I got you.

702
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,538
I'm so happy.

703
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,419
So you had
a really difficult past, you know?

704
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,755
But you were able to… How do I say it?

705
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,843
You were still able to share your story
even though it made you cry.

706
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,931
That's when I knew
I wanted to help you carry that burden.

707
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,225
And I'm not just saying that lightly.

708
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,021
I'll carry your past with you, together.

709
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,939
I feel really strongly about that.

710
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,402
I want you to know
that I'm serious about that

711
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
and that I really love you.

712
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,910
I just wanted to tell you that.

713
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,080
How should I put this?

714
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,667
I want us to live together.

715
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,379
At some point. Do you know what I mean?

716
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,297
One day.

717
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,257
Of course.

718
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,347
And I want the two of us
to get married one day too.

719
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,436
I wanna show you that

720
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,648
through my actions.

721
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,816
I reckon.

722
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,318
- You "reckon"?
- Uh-huh.

723
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,820
You sound like a samurai warlord.

724
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,990
- But you've really thought things through.
- I am thinking things through.

725
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,659
I am.

726
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,285
That's what I do.

727
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,498
But we've only just begun.

728
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,676
That's what's so cool
about you. It's actually annoying.

729
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,679
Say that once I've actually done it.

730
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,180
They're just words so far.

731
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,026
- And so that's that.
- Okay, wow!

732
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,361
There you have it. There it is.

733
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,655
And that's how everything was wrapped up.

734
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,740
- Wonderful.
- Mmm-hmm. Wonderful.

735
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,077
<i>Badly in Love!</i>
<i>Badly in Love! Badly in Love!</i>

736
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,165
I feel like what we saw on <i>Badly in Love</i>
was like a microcosm of life and society.

737
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,166
You think so?

738
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,043
Look at the different types
of people there.

739
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,588
All of them were so different
from one another.

740
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,383
And when you put all of them together,
their hearts really collided.

741
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,802
Sometimes they got scared
and lost themselves

742
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,054
- even though things were going well.
- Yeah.

743
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,266
They just had to keep doing
the good work they'd been doing

744
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,684
and keep going down that path.

745
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,603
But this can also happen in normal life.

746
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,979
- Don't you think so?
- Absolutely.

747
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,482
- And I just thought that was really…
- They would make just one small mistake.

748
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,901
- Right, when they'd make one mistake.
- Yeah, you're right.

749
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,862
- We saw a lot of that.
- We saw that happen.

750
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,365
Coming into this,
my idea of what reality dating shows were

751
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,452
was men and women,
who I couldn't care less about,

752
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,870
being shy and fidgety.

753
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,789
But the people on this show
all had some kind of baggage.

754
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,002
I found the human drama aspect
of this show to be really intriguing.

755
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,005
Every person on this show
gave it their all,

756
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,590
which made me tense just watching it.

757
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,383
- Mmm-hmm.
- This was very exciting.

758
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,552
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I wanted it to keep going.

759
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,804
Yeah, it was fun.
I wanna see a second season.

760
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,223
- Yeah, me too. <i>Badly in Love.</i>
<i>- Badly in Love.</i>

761
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,517
- I'll even help out with the casting.
- Oh yeah?

762
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,019
- Someone intense.
- Someone in mind?

763
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,271
We need someone really intense.
I'll help with that.

764
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,149
Okay, so then,
if there's a second season, AK's in.

765
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,443
- That'd really be quite the group.
- Yeah, I know.

766
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,487
- They wouldn't wanna mess with us.
- They wouldn't.
