1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,090
KIICHAN (23)

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,092
You know, I'm gonna tell him tomorrow.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,969
What? Tell who?

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,763
- Tackle.
- Tell him what?

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,975
- What will you tell him?
- Yeah, what?

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,729
How I really feel.

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,439
Which is what?

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,281
UNBENT UNBOWED

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,575
What is this, a prison?

10
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,784
A prison in the morning?

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,702
NAGANO

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,619
PRODUCER

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,662
That's just Tsu-Tsu.

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,664
His tattoo says "Unbent Unbowed."

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,751
Ah. Oh, so that's what it says.

16
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,128
<i>I know I'm gonna win.</i>

17
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>I won yesterday.</i>

18
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>And I'm gonna keep</i>
<i>winning from here on out.</i>

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,177
It's showtime now.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,219
TSU-CHAN (30)

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,263
Curtains up. Like this.

22
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,891
It's the Tsukahara Show now.
It's my stage.

23
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,601
I'll win.

24
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,394
I'll win.

25
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,231
<i>I could tell that Kii really</i>
<i>puts her heart into everything.</i>

26
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>She's just like me.</i>

27
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,111
And she's also very easy to talk to.

28
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,739
By far, she's the easiest to talk to.

29
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,950
<i>The Tsukahara Show begins.</i>

30
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,626
BLOOM OR WITHER,
I LIVE LIFE ON MY TERMS

31
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,669
EVER SINCE WE MET,
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN LOVE

32
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,005
THE HEAVENS GAVE ME THIS LIFE,
I'LL MAKE IT BLOOM

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,509
FOR MY BELOVED,
I'LL MAKE THE FLOWER OF LOVE BLOSSOM

34
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,844
IF I'M FATED TO FALL,
IT'LL BE IN A BLAZE OF GLORY

35
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
THE PURE LOVE
IN MY HEART WILL BLOSSOM

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,432
LIFE IS SHORT,
BUT I'LL STAND TALL TILL THE VERY END

37
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
IF I MUST FALL TO RISE,
MY LIFE WILL PROVE IT

38
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,520
MY LOVE WILL GO ON
EVEN AFTER I'M GONE

39
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,372
- Hey there.
- Let's go!

40
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,665
All right!

41
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,791
TACKLE (24)

42
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,835
Finally.

43
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,711
Can I sit next to you?

44
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,755
Are you wearing cologne?

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,717
- I think I just caught a whiff of it.
- That's the bonsai.

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,264
- Is that a "yes" I see?
- Yes, yes, yes.

47
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,765
- That's good.
- Barely yes.

48
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,016
- "Barely"?
- That's good.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,227
The girls told me
to keep going for it harder.

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,562
- They said go for it?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
- No way.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,857
Baby said we crack up at the same stuff.

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,401
- Tsuu's the one who cracks me up.
- Oh, damn.

54
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,945
But it's Tsuu. He cracks everyone up.

55
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,739
Yes, he does.
I hate to admit it, but he does.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,575
You hate to admit it?

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,535
I'm like, "Damn, he's funny."

58
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,037
So then you still think
that he's funny? You do, right?

59
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,956
Yeah, he makes me laugh.

60
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,711
But with you, mmm…

61
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,548
you're only focused on me.

62
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,757
Why is that?

63
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,634
I can't imagine being with anyone else.

64
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,220
That shows you have good taste
in women. Really good taste.

65
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,598
- I really like you.
- That makes me wanna commit to you.

66
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,683
- Just do it.
- But I just can't.

67
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,435
- Really?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,645
Obviously, you're telling me
that you really like me,

69
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,898
and I hate that
I can't return those feelings.

70
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,317
You shouldn't have
to feel guilty just because of that.

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,069
I just thought it was important
I tell you this today.

72
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,530
Mmm.

73
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
You know,

74
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,658
at first,

75
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,827
we obviously took pictures together.

76
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>And we went on our date,</i>

77
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,290
<i>and talked even when we're hanging out</i>
<i>with the rest of the group too.</i>

78
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,500
But we really haven't made
much progress since then.

79
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,835
That's true.

80
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,253
If I'm being honest with you,

81
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,380
- I really don't see potential.
- Okay.

82
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,593
- I don't think I have romantic feelings.
- Oh…

83
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,261
Or maybe I should say…

84
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,181
- I'm just not feeling it.
- I can't help wondering, what is it?

85
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,515
Is it still a yes?

86
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,267
- Oh, this? It's a no.
- No?

87
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,518
Yeah, it's a no.

88
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,187
This is getting exciting.

89
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,900
So I just wanted to let you know gently

90
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,236
that as of right now,
I'm not in love with you.

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,321
That's really what
I was trying to get across.

92
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,990
- Oh, yeah? Of course.
- I meant I'm not in "love mode" yet.

93
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,409
I just haven't been able
to get into that headspace.

94
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,621
But I was afraid you'd be like,
"Oh, no way" and be shocked.

95
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,666
- I was just nervous about bringing it up.
- No, don't be.

96
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,918
I think that made me just
start tripping over my words.

97
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,128
- Now I'm fired up.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

98
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,589
I'm not sure this is heading
in the direction I thought.

99
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,216
Feels like it might be though.

100
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>I'm really glad we got to talk today.</i>

101
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,264
But then, when I told him
I wasn't feeling it yet,

102
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,432
he was like, "Oh, I'm fired up now."

103
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,978
And I'm over there thinking,
"That's not what I was going for."

104
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,729
I just have to give it my all.

105
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,565
If she changes her mind about me,
that'd be exciting.

106
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,944
I'm not discouraged.

107
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,489
I'm like, "Let's go, let's go!"

108
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,825
- Ahhh!
- Mmm…

109
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,411
- They're definitely not in sync.
- Mmm.

110
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,830
So, that's how he took that conversation.

111
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,207
BADLY IN LOVE

112
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,835
- Tsuu's a popular guy.
- He's hilarious.

113
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,962
He's very popular with all the ladies.

114
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,131
You should sit in the middle.

115
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,466
TENTEN (25)

116
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,469
Having him sit
right up front? That's funny.

117
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,556
- Good morning.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,599
- Good morning.
- Morning, guys.

119
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,393
Morning.

120
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,520
I just took a bath,
but I showered last night.

121
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,732
And next door,
that's where the men's shower is, right?

122
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,568
So, I'm able to hear you guys
whenever you're in there.

123
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,403
I was like,
"Someone's in there right now."

124
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,904
I'm pretty sure it was Tsuu.

125
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,156
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

126
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,116
- And then he goes…
- So what did you hear?

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,826
…"kinda hot in here."

128
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,202
"Muka-chakka Fire!"

129
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,580
- Really?
- I did.

130
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,374
- That's so crazy. Tsuu!
- Yeah, I said that. I did.

131
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,459
I was by myself.

132
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,503
- You said that? To yourself?
- I did. I remember.

133
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,297
- You were alone?
- I was.

134
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,631
That's funny.

135
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:42,925
You're the best.

136
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,261
- You said that to yourself.
- He's funny.

137
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,388
All Tsuu does is be funny.

138
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,766
<i>A new classmate will be joining us.</i>

139
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,100
What?

140
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,853
<i>Let's go pick up the new transfer student.</i>

141
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,814
Here we go!
Is it gonna be a girl or another guy?

142
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,404
- Should I take my Century?
- Why are you excited?

143
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,989
What if it's another guy?

144
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,200
Tsuu seems really worked up about this.

145
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,577
But him being this excited
makes me sad though.

146
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,037
That's what I was thinking.

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,122
- He wants to give up on us.
- Yeah.

148
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,041
The weather's looking pretty bad.

149
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,085
It's raining because Yanboh isn't here.

150
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,878
It's been bad since yesterday.

151
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,046
Yeah.

152
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,428
- Where are we?
- Japan.

153
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,721
It's Roppongi.

154
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,723
How would you know? You're from Tochigi.

155
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,559
What's your deal, man?
You're a wannabe city-boy.

156
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,062
I'm getting nervous.

157
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,193
They're already dancing.

158
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,904
This place is lit.

159
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,241
This is awesome!

160
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,244
What do you think?

161
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,162
I could see their boobs.

162
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,331
Look at Milk. He looks so flustered.

163
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,125
MILK (22)

164
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,501
He's adorable.

165
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,003
I seriously have no idea.

166
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,467
The third girl from the left is cute.

167
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,764
- That one there?
- You look used to this, Nisei.

168
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,891
I was there last week.

169
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,644
- I really wanna try that on.
- Definitely, me too.

170
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,896
Wow! That ain't cute.

171
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,190
- We wanna do it too.
- Not into that.

172
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,943
- Isn't she pretty?
- Yuria's way prettier.

173
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,028
I wanna try this. I really want to.

174
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,951
- That was great!
- Very, very nice!

175
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,208
Let's do a toast, guys.

176
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,210
Everybody got one? All right, guys.

177
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,503
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

178
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,046
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

179
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,964
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

180
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,716
Cheers, everyone.

181
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,509
<i>Iyasaka, iyasaka!</i>

182
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,558
- Here it comes.
- This is for Tekarin.

183
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,060
- Look.
- Tekarin's supposed to go in it.

184
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,520
- It's for her.
- For Tekarin!

185
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,564
Get in your swimsuit and get in there!

186
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,024
- What is it?
- For swimming.

187
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,650
- What?
- In that thing?

188
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,943
Yeah.

189
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,031
Here we go.

190
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,165
This is scary.

191
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,583
They're so cute.

192
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,335
It's scary. Wow.

193
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,170
She looks so skinny.

194
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,381
It's like a haunted house.

195
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,552
One that has hands sticking out of it.

196
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,930
I'm getting chills.

197
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,858
- She has wings!
- Oh, my gosh!

198
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,783
<i>Oh. The boys</i>
<i>can't take their eyes off of her.</i>

199
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,910
- Pretty.
- She's so pretty.

200
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>Let the show begin</i>

201
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,928
<i>Yeah</i>

202
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,267
<i>Let the show begin</i>

203
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,686
That's pretty cool.

204
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,401
That's so gross.

205
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,444
- Tackle! Tackle her!
- This sucks.

206
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
This really sucks.

207
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,498
Crazy, crazy, crazy!

208
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

209
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,295
Oh, wow.

210
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,589
I wanna do that!

211
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,716
Her core strength is crazy.

212
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,261
Scary.

213
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,980
She did it again, she went for it!

214
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,232
She was aiming, wasn't she?

215
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,111
- Towel, towel. Someone bring over a towel!
- I need a towel first.

216
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,572
This is hilarious. So funny.

217
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,115
We need a towel.

218
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,409
- Staff, please!
- Get us a towel.

219
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,162
Baby looks so pissed off.

220
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,914
- She looks really mad.
- That was part of the show, right?

221
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,001
- Her fighting instincts were kicking in.
- Yeah, looked like it.

222
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,631
Okay, I've got a towel.
Here you go. Excuse me.

223
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,841
Baby's
<i>Yankii </i>side is coming out.

224
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,594
Big Sis just got really wet.
Here, I'll dry you off.

225
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,970
She looks intense.

226
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,222
- Baby, Big Sis…
- Yeah, no kidding.

227
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,683
- Let me help you dry off.
- She glared at her.

228
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
Are you okay?

229
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,479
- Thank you.
- Better?

230
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,648
- She's cute.
- Cute?

231
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,232
- Yeah.
- <i>He called her cute.</i>

232
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,442
You like the way she looks?

233
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,777
- Hmm?
- How she looks?

234
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,820
I like her face. She's beautiful.

235
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,280
- Right?
- Yeah.

236
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,782
How old is she?

237
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,826
- Maybe 27 or 28?
- I think 20… maybe.

238
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,953
Twenty-eight? That's how old I am.

239
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,123
- Here she is.
- Wow!

240
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,416
Whoa!

241
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,508
I'm Amo.
And I'm the transfer student.

242
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,343
Nice to meet you.

243
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,096
Thanks so much.

244
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,305
SHOW DANCER

245
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,809
<i>My name is Amo, I'm 27 years old,</i>
<i>and I'm a show dancer.</i>

246
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,479
Back when I was in school,
I had my own girl-squad.

247
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,398
We were the coolest girls in school.

248
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
<i>I never got into fights at school,</i>

249
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,779
<i>but I would be</i>
<i>in the audience, just watching.</i>

250
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,449
In my life, I think around 50 people
have confessed to having feelings for me.

251
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,202
- <i>She's quite popular.</i>
- I like former <i>Yankiis.</i>

252
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,956
Those kind of guys are
definitely my type, for sure.

253
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,627
So I am very curious to see
the kind of guys that we have here.

254
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,255
I'm gonna make them fall for me.

255
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,590
<i>That's impressive.</i>

256
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,343
I usually work here
as a dancer at this club.

257
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,221
So, thank you everyone,
for coming all the way out here.

258
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,764
- Of course.
- Thank you, guys.

259
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,642
- Let's have a good time.
- Good to meet you!

260
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,185
Nice to meet you.

261
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,482
So, is it all right if I can ask
everyone what their names are?

262
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm Tackle, I'm 24.

263
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,027
Tackle? It's good to meet you.

264
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,739
- I'm Tenten, I'm 25. Nice meeting you.
- It's nice to meet you.

265
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,075
- And your name?
- Tsukahara. Wait, no. Tsuu.

266
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,953
- Tsuu, it's good meeting you.
- Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

267
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,163
- Thank you.
- I'm Milk.

268
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,289
- Milk?
- Yeah, Milk.

269
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,832
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

270
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,167
Thank you. Your name?

271
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,501
- I'm Nisei.
- Ni…

272
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,627
- Nisei. Yeah.
- Nisei.

273
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,171
- Good to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

274
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,464
Can I ask you your name?

275
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,798
Don't talk to me.

276
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,011
What? Oh, my gosh!

277
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,512
Why?

278
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,805
What?

279
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,140
Oh…

280
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,393
Huh? What's going on?

281
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,479
What? I'm sorry, why?

282
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,106
Can I ask you what your name is?

283
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,361
- It's Baby.
- What's wrong with her?

284
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,238
- It's Baby. Baby.
- Her name's Baby?

285
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,823
Baby. Thank you.

286
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,284
Uh… Baby.

287
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,709
Are you okay? Don't be upset.

288
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,252
What's wrong?

289
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,297
- Are you mad about the water?
- What the hell is wrong with her?

290
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,217
Are you mad she got water on you?

291
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,344
Not the damn water, obviously.

292
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,595
Did you find a towel?

293
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,431
- You're upset she splashed you?
- Water's disgusting.

294
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,766
"Not the damn water"?

295
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,393
"Obviously." Is she some kind of gremlin?

296
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,773
"Not the damn water, obviously."
I've never heard that before!

297
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
Neither have I.

298
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,822
I hate people
who throw water on me, seriously.

299
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,786
Oh, wait, so you thought that
she was trying to splash you specifically,

300
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,788
not just as part of the act?

301
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,834
Well, the first time, I was like,
"Okay, this is just a part of the show."

302
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,836
- Just like, "I didn't like that."
- Yeah.

303
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,880
But then, the second and third time,
it was like right at me.

304
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,215
- Directly at you?
- Yeah.

305
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,342
It felt like she was targeting me.

306
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,596
Then she should've just
been like, "Sorry for doing that,"

307
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,391
- when she was introducing herself.
- Yeah. Right, right.

308
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,018
But I guess she does that
all the time, in every show.

309
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,770
- So, for her, it's probably…
- Probably.

310
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,856
- …the normal thing to do.
- I wouldn't know though.

311
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294
- Just you?
- What?

312
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
- Just you?
- Yeah.

313
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,965
- I'm pretty tired.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,968
- Stuff like that exhausts me.
- What do you mean?

315
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,761
It's mentally exhausting for me.

316
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,848
It's not the same as being drained
after thinking hard all day.

317
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,600
- It's from being annoyed.
- Yeah.

318
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,684
Who's this?

319
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,311
It's the new girl.

320
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,605
- Oh, she's doomed.
- She was so inconsiderate.

321
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,522
Hm?

322
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,233
Well, the both of us
are in the service industry.

323
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,151
Yeah.

324
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,154
For example, we all know
Tackle can't drink alcohol, right?

325
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,071
Mmm.

326
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,991
So when people give him
a glass of champagne,

327
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,992
he can't drink it.

328
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,035
Mmm.

329
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,747
So if I were sitting next to him
when somebody gives him a glass,

330
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,540
I'd just drink it for him.

331
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,959
So it'd be like he's the one who drank it.

332
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,961
To make his glass look empty.

333
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,963
Just to be considerate.

334
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,506
You learn that as a hostess.

335
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,758
Mmm.

336
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,802
So when you have someone in the
audience who keeps getting splashed,

337
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,471
and they clearly don't like it,

338
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,932
wouldn't you question
why the performer keeps doing it?

339
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:33,849
Oh…

340
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,560
She didn't have to keep
doing it in that direction.

341
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,313
- She could've aimed somewhere else.
- Mmm.

342
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,482
I don't think
she had that all planned out.

343
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,067
She was probably nervous too.

344
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,486
Okay.

345
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,862
You're taking her side.

346
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,114
- What?
- You're taking her side.

347
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,867
- I'm not taking sides.
- I mean, it's fine if you are.

348
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,869
What's with the attitude?

349
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,167
I don't think it was the new girl's fault.

350
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,836
She was probably just doing
what she always does,

351
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,047
and wasn't expecting
anybody to get mad at her.

352
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,757
She just got unlucky.

353
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,553
If she had done this to one of the guys,
I don't think this would've happened.

354
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,807
Baby was like, "If you mess
with me, I'm gonna mess with you."

355
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,600
There's been nothing but trouble.

356
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,019
Yeah, I've never seen
this side of Baby before.

357
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,313
And she did this right in front of Milk.

358
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,982
Mmm. That's true.

359
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,360
I guess she's joining us now, right?

360
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, I don't know if she's coming today.

361
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,823
- Oh, really?
- Seriously?

362
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,950
I'm not sure
if she's gonna join us tonight,

363
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,576
or in the morning tomorrow.

364
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,912
I have a feeling
she'll probably come tonight.

365
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,372
- I'm not sure.
- Mmm.

366
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,632
You said you'd let us have them.

367
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
I didn't say, "let you have them."

368
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
Back together again.

369
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,096
- Finally all here.
- Everyone's here now.

370
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,600
Excuse me.

371
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,853
I need to make
an announcement to you today.

372
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,312
Earlier, at the club,

373
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,566
all of you met the new transfer student.

374
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,027
She was going to be joining us today,

375
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,321
but that won't be happening anymore.

376
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,032
She has

377
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,242
<i>an injury on her face,</i>

378
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,704
<i>so instead, she will be</i>
<i>joining us tomorrow.</i>

379
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,248
Just giving you all an update.

380
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,625
That's all.

381
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,295
- An injury?
- On her face?

382
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,796
- Injured her face?
- What?

383
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,808
- You're not mad anymore, right?
- Mmm.

384
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,728
- You just snapped in the moment?
- Mmm.

385
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,355
It doesn't matter what we say,
unless she shows up.

386
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,398
Right.

387
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,650
I think you should apologize. Mmm.

388
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,319
At least for doing what you did.

389
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,113
At the end of the day,
we're not obligated to say something.

390
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,534
- "Obligation." "Our obligation."
- That was outta nowhere.

391
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,621
- Why's he being so business-like?
- Such a serious tone.

392
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,249
I think that it's something
the two of them

393
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,126
- need to work out themselves.
- Yeah.

394
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,880
She could've said something like,
"You're gonna get splashed in a sec."

395
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,548
She can't do that during the show.

396
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,175
Yeah, but before she got in it.

397
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,260
- Like, "You might get wet."
- She couldn't do that.

398
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,888
Definitely not during a show
like that. She's a professional.

399
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,890
She probably did it
the way she always does.

400
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,350
She didn't have bad intent.

401
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,685
But I would be super pissed off
too if I got splashed.

402
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,686
Yeah.

403
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,523
I understand the women
have their own feelings about it.

404
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,649
Right, for sure.

405
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,276
I understand everybody's feelings.

406
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,366
- Isn't this bad? I was completely shocked.
- Yeah, this isn't good.

407
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,409
And the one who got injured was…

408
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,620
It was Amo, the transfer student.

409
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,872
- She's the one who got injured?
- Correct.

410
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,833
- Ahh…
- And you know…

411
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,961
For Baby, she had to deal
with "not the damn water, obviously."

412
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,212
"Not the damn water."

413
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,840
- No one could know she hates water.
- That was way out of line.

414
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,800
Getting her wet is crossing the line.

415
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,593
It's no excuse for what she did.

416
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,929
And she did that
in front of all of the guys

417
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,014
she's supposed to be finding love with.

418
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,059
No offense to her,
but that's kind of a turn-off.

419
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,646
- I mean, it was just a show.
- Right?

420
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,024
If she gets angry over something
like that, you gotta be thinking,

421
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,818
"Seriously? For that?" I'd back off.

422
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,405
Also, "What if we have issues in the
future? Is she gonna act the same way?"

423
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,865
"Is this gonna keep happening?"

424
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,993
But when you're young,
it's all about trying to assert yourself.

425
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,204
It's like you can't help yourself,
you have to show your anger.

426
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,790
- Mmm-hmm.
- That happens a lot when you're young.

427
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,168
So, she probably
still needs to grow up a bit.

428
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,377
Mmm.

429
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,421
Is Baby gonna be okay after all this?

430
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,215
With what happened with Yanboh,
I have a bad feeling about this.

431
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,844
- Yeah. You are totally right.
- It's written in the code of conduct.

432
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,054
She violated the school's code of conduct.

433
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,849
I just don't have a good feeling
about any of this.

434
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,938
- <i>It says "No violence."</i>
- Rule is "no violence."

435
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,523
- Morning.
- It's cold.

436
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,233
- Morning.
- Wait, where's Nisei?

437
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,444
- He's coming.
- Gonna grab my jacket.

438
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,405
I start getting worried
anytime even one of us isn't here.

439
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,449
I'm wearing this. It's cold.

440
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,576
- Purple looks good on you.
- Thank you.

441
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,162
- You're such a <i>Yankii.</i>
- What'd you say?

442
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,331
- You look like an eggplant.
- An eggplant?

443
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,999
No way, come on.

444
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,292
Excuse me, excuse me.

445
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,127
- Is there a problem?
- Is it serious?

446
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,629
Oh, no.

447
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,797
Oh, no, I'm stressed now.

448
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,092
Baby, could you come to the classroom?

449
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,969
Please.

450
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,179
What?

451
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,140
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Huh?

452
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,516
Figures.

453
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,353
Right now?

454
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,396
Is it serious?

455
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,983
Oh, no.

456
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,490
She won't get expelled, right? Will she?

457
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,700
She wasn't violent.

458
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,370
But they said that the girl got injured.

459
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>It's a small injury on her face.</i>

460
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,251
It's a toss-up.

461
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,919
It's fifty-fifty.

462
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,463
I don't really know what's gonna happen.

463
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,185
Now that you're here,
I'd like to talk to you

464
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,688
<i>about what happened yesterday</i>
<i>at Super Spark Tokyo.</i>

465
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,066
<i>You threw a drink with ice</i>
<i>at the new transfer student, Amo.</i>

466
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,944
<i>And she got a cut on her face.</i>

467
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,154
<i>And according to your contract,</i>

468
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,825
if you are responsible for causing
an injury to another participant,

469
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:28,203
then that could be considered
a potential breach of your contract.

470
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,164
Well, I have something to say.

471
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,043
I have never been
to a place like that before,

472
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,754
and I've also never been
to a show like that either.

473
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,800
I made it very obvious the first time
that I didn't like getting splashed.

474
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,846
But, at that point, I understood that
it was just a part of the performance.

475
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,932
I believe that that's the normal way
an adult would react.

476
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,895
I stayed for the rest, but it was obvious
what was going on. Everyone thought so.

477
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,064
Like, her last… throw.

478
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,569
I was just reacting in the moment
because of how I felt.

479
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,698
Anyone would get upset if they kept
getting splashed when they didn't want to.

480
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,909
I think I reacted the same way
anybody would in that situation.

481
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,203
<i>Okay, but that doesn't make it right.</i>

482
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,581
It was a genuinely impulsive reaction.

483
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,458
And I was even holding back too.

484
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,128
Oh, look at Milk.
He looks so anxious right now.

485
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,796
He looks dead inside.

486
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,174
- His eyes aren't really open.
- Yeah, yeah.

487
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,800
- You okay, eggplant?
- Yeah.

488
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,385
They're not open.

489
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,309
I mean…

490
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,186
I mean, I don't really know.

491
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,273
Mmm…

492
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,818
When I left the children's home,

493
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,904
I was still only a minor.

494
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,323
And I had some trouble with the police.

495
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,744
I did a lot of things I shouldn't have.
I lost control of my emotions bit by bit.

496
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,834
And I just stopped being able
to understand other people's pain

497
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,961
and what they were going through.

498
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,924
So I would be thinking, "If I get hurt,

499
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,927
I might as well

500
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,388
be the person who lashes out first."

501
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,432
That's how I would think back then.

502
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,393
So, yesterday, that part of me just

503
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,354
came right back out of me.

504
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,941
Yeah, so honestly, I think that…

505
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,570
that yesterday was just me
not being mature enough

506
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,572
as an adult.

507
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,077
And, so yeah,
I did have my reasons for doing it,

508
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,745
that's for sure.

509
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,082
But it was still really immature of me.

510
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,212
Right.

511
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,966
However, as we agreed
when we signed the contract with you,

512
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,052
if any trouble occurs
between the participants,

513
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,264
you're supposed to first try
and work it out between you.

514
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,812
I had no idea that what I did was going
to cause someone to get injured.

515
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,315
And so, I wanna apologize for that.

516
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,996
AMO (27)

517
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,880
- Hello. Good morning.
- Good morning.

518
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,176
So, first of all,

519
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,303
about what happened yesterday…

520
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,514
Honestly, um…

521
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,186
I had never been to a place
or show like that before.

522
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,395
Yeah.

523
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,522
And, well…

524
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,649
it felt like,

525
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,819
when you kept hitting me with water
towards the end of the show,

526
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,197
that you were rubbing salt on the wound.

527
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,492
- She should apologize first.
- Mmm.

528
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,121
The truth is that, at my core, I…

529
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,334
have lived a rough kind of life.

530
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,710
That <i>Yankii </i>kind of life.

531
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,462
I've been treated that way before.

532
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,506
Sometimes, older people spit on me.

533
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,299
- And I'd snap back at them.
- Right.

534
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,303
So getting water thrown down at me
was a very normal thing for me back then.

535
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,387
Because of that, I…

536
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,140
So, yesterday brought those memories back?

537
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,893
Not that so much.
It's more like I just got irritated.

538
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,020
- Ah. Right.
- At that moment, you know?

539
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,188
- Yeah.
- Then…

540
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,400
yesterday, they told us that
you got an injury on your face

541
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,319
- because of what I did to you.
- Yeah.

542
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,279
I just wanted to have a chance to talk

543
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,864
- and to apologize.
- Right.

544
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:37,035
So, I'm really, really sorry
about… yesterday.

545
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,578
I'm really sorry.

546
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,208
Don't worry. It's all right.

547
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,001
How's it feeling?

548
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,212
Oh, it's fine.
Honestly, I barely noticed it.

549
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,673
- It's right here, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

550
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,716
But really, it's fine.

551
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,843
What I thought had happened was,

552
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,639
I was like an outsider
who was coming in halfway through.

553
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,183
You know what I mean?
That's what I was thinking.

554
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,813
But now that you
explained it to me, I get it.

555
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,566
If you've never been
to that kind of place,

556
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,900
you wouldn't know how to react.

557
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,318
<i>She is really so mature.</i>

558
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,653
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

559
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,946
- I'm sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

560
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,447
- Really, I am.
- I should apologize.

561
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,991
Thank you. Thank you so much.

562
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,702
- So skinny.
- No! You're the skinny one here!

563
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,871
No, no. So the thing is,
I'm a professional craftsman.

564
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,873
- A craftsman?
- Well, I'm a painter.

565
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,001
So I don't spend
that much time with women.

566
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,544
- I only work with guys.
- I get it.

567
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,170
So I don't know how to fit in.

568
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,965
No, no. I wasn't getting
that sense from you yesterday.

569
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,384
Well, maybe that's because yesterday…

570
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,136
- Right, yeah.
- …I was acting very boldly.

571
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,347
- So everybody's right inside?
- They're all in there right now.

572
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,473
Okay, okay.

573
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,518
They're all just genuinely nice people.

574
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,354
- Yeah.
- The guys are all very excited about you.

575
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,940
- What? My gosh.
- I'm serious.

576
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,695
<i>Look at Milk.</i>
<i>He's just gotta be so worried.</i>

577
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,742
- She's back.
- This is amazing.

578
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,744
- They're both here.
- Welcome.

579
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,370
- Welcome, guys.
- Excuse me.

580
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,247
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks.

581
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,583
Where do you wanna sit? Right here?

582
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,168
Wanna sit here?

583
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,128
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.

584
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,380
Nice seeing you all again.

585
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,257
- Thanks.
- Thank you for coming.

586
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,175
Welcome.

587
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,551
Thank you.

588
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,389
I'm very sorry for the trouble

589
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,308
- I caused yesterday.
- No worries.

590
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,060
- No problem.
- All good.

591
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,270
I'm glad that both of you could come back.

592
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,897
I'm glad you guys came back.

593
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,691
So you're good now?
You worked things out?

594
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,904
When they called me into the classroom,
I really thought I was gonna get expelled.

595
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,492
So before I came back, I wanted
to apologize to her for what I did.

596
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,494
And she kindly let me.

597
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,079
We talked and made up.

598
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,081
- And now we're both besties.
- Great!

599
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,333
- Amazing.
- That's great to hear.

600
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,417
That's good.

601
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,378
"After the rain, ground gets firmer."

602
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,129
Milk looked like the world was ending.

603
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,007
I felt like it was the end
of the world for me too.

604
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,968
Everyone kept saying stuff,
so I had to put on sunglasses.

605
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,305
- He was like, "I'm done."
- You know?

606
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,224
I'm not ready
for people to see my eyes yet.

607
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,436
Should we try again?
Should we introduce ourselves?

608
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,647
- Yes, please. I would love to.
- Yeah, yeah.

609
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,482
Let's do that. I'm Amo.

610
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,900
- Nice to meet you.
- Amo.

611
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,735
- Welcome, Amo.
- Thank you.

612
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,987
So, do you have a type?

613
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,364
Do I have a type?

614
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,658
I would say… I like guys who are hardcore.

615
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,618
- Who really stand out.
- Hardcore guys?

616
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,912
- Really?
- The hardcore type?

617
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,706
- No, I'm not hardcore.
- Yeah, that's Tsuu!

618
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,708
- I'm not, seriously.
- Yes, it is Tsuu.

619
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
- Sorry, but it's so true.
- I'm not that hardcore, am I?

620
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,297
<i>I'm definitely feeling anxious.</i>
<i>I mean, I am a transfer student.</i>

621
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,926
But I'm glad Baby and I
were able to talk things out.

622
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,428
Because if we hadn't,

623
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,181
<i>I think it would've been hard for me</i>
<i>to figure out how to fit in. Mm.</i>

624
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,060
<i>But actually, I don't think</i>
<i>that was my biggest hurdle.</i>

625
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,355
The biggest hurdle for me is that
I wasn't here from the beginning.

626
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,400
Time's already starting to run out for me.

627
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,777
I'm sure all of them
have already built relationships

628
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,738
with each other to some extent.

629
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,240
So I want to break through all of that,

630
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,745
and turn everyone's attention
towards myself. Yeah.

631
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,330
- <i>She's a very strong girl.</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

632
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,917
- Oh, and I'm Nisei.
- Nisei, good to meet you.

633
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,294
You and I are the same age.

634
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,129
- What's your type?
- Amo.

635
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,881
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

636
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,175
- That was like, boom!
- Hear that?

637
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,843
<i>That was bold of him.</i>

638
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,930
You know how they say
that fighting brings people together?

639
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,558
That applies to the girls too.
Don't you think?

640
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,352
- So fighting doesn't just work for guys?
- Yeah.

641
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,355
But like AK was saying, Baby
really should have apologized first.

642
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,316
Oh. Right. During that talk, yeah.

643
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,734
- Definitely.
- Mmm.

644
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,529
Something that I learned from
my elders was, say you're sorry first.

645
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,239
- You're right.
- Apologize first.

646
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,700
And then you can explain
why you did what you did,

647
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,243
and give your side of the story.

648
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,120
She started off with her excuses first.

649
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,998
Which makes it sound
like she's trying to justify what she did.

650
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,458
- True.
- When you do that,

651
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,586
people might not think that
your apology is actually genuine.

652
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,546
I'm just glad that Amo was understanding.

653
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,006
I was glad to see that.

654
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,801
- Basically, the show took the position…
- Oh, right.

655
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,303
…that it was not
Baby's intention to hurt Amo.

656
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,598
And that if the two of them could talk
things out and clear everything up,

657
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,184
then Baby would not have
to be expelled. That's what we did.

658
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,311
- That was a close one, huh?
- She was almost out.

659
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,063
Things were not looking good for her.

660
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,898
But this is also a dating show.

661
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,067
I almost forgot what this show was about.

662
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,693
Exactly what I was thinking.

663
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,195
Not the <i>yakuza </i>code of honor.

664
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,156
You've both forgotten what's going on
on the romantic side of the show.

665
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,825
Totally not in my head anymore.

666
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,077
Okay, so, Tackle likes Kii, right?

667
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,703
- Yeah, Tackle.
- He likes Kii, right?

668
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,913
Right, right, he likes Kii.

669
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,291
Kii said a lot, but nothing seemed
to be able to get through to Tackle.

670
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,669
- I don't want Tackle to give up yet.
- Yeah.

671
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,170
Yeah. I know.

672
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,798
Even after she told him,
"I'm not interested,"

673
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,426
his eyes were still sparkling,
and he says, "I'm gonna go all in."

674
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,098
You have to root for that persistent,
thick-skinned attitude to pay off.

675
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,475
I get it. It's important to be persistent.

676
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,186
But let's talk about Kii.
Do you guys think she might

677
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,021
- have a thing for Tsuu?
- That's right.

678
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,232
That really came
completely out of nowhere.

679
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,528
Totally. And don't forget, from earlier,
Tsuu said, "The Tsukahara Show has begun."

680
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,281
- Mmm.
- So things are really kicking off now.

681
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,867
- But their names don't flow together.
- You're right.

682
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,452
- I haven't heard a single…
- No, we really haven't.

683
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,079
…beautiful Japanese name on this show.

684
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,956
- You're exactly right.
- But that's okay.

685
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,208
- It's okay though.
- These names are beautiful too.

686
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,920
Milk stayed by Baby's side,
even after she caused all this fuss.

687
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,047
I'm very curious to know how Milk feels

688
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,216
about all of this,
and what happened yesterday.

689
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,718
And then, we have Amo.

690
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,887
She's like, "Forget all that,
I'm falling behind."

691
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,098
- Right.
- "I gotta start falling in love for real."

692
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,101
She basically said she wants
to destroy all the current relationships.

693
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,145
It was a strong statement from her.

694
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,022
- Call her Crusher Amo.
- Crusher Amo.

695
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,064
Crusher Amo.

696
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,233
Nisei was into Baby
before all this happened.

697
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,569
- Right.
- But now he's saying,

698
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,072
- "Amo's my type." That's what he said.
- He came right out and just said it.

699
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,034
He was very direct about it,
and it kinda seemed like

700
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,577
he was just about ready…

701
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,954
- Absolutely.
- …to make a move on her.

702
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,211
<i>It's time for one-on-one sessions.</i>

703
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,632
<i>Would the boys please visit the girl</i>
<i>you'd like to spend time with?</i>

704
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,383
CLASSROOM

705
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,930
- Mind if I come in?
- Go right ahead.

706
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,222
Thanks.

707
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,516
- Nisei.
- That's me.

708
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,018
You're here.

709
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,478
- Let's talk like this.
- Let's talk.

710
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,772
- It's like high school, right?
- Yeah, right.

711
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,440
Plus we're the same age.

712
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,525
- Amo has arrived.
- Oh, yeah.

713
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,985
That's great.

714
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,445
Thanks for coming.

715
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,572
You looked so pretty
when you came on stage.

716
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,823
- Oh, me?
- Mmm.

717
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,700
- I'm happy to hear that.
- You looked so cute.

718
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,911
- But it's not all about you being pretty.
- Mmm-hmm.

719
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,790
Like, once you get into your twenties,
your face shows your personality.

720
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:39,707
Mmm-hmm.

721
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,084
- Right?
- Yeah, I agree.

722
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:45,421
Like, no matter how attractive someone is,
it's obvious if they aren't on the inside.

723
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,716
I can handle rude people,
but I can't stand bad personalities.

724
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,635
- You get the difference, right?
- I do.

725
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:51,719
Right, right.

726
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,805
- What's your type?
- Hmm.

727
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,556
I'd say I like smart girls.

728
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,225
Oh. That's important.

729
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,643
- Definitely.
- Same here.

730
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,354
It's hard for me to be with someone
who's just flat out dumb.

731
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,315
I'm more so looking for somebody
that's able to read the room

732
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,109
and make everyone feel comfortable.

733
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,612
I'm looking for somebody that
knows how to set the right kind of vibe.

734
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,157
That's important. I don't want somebody
that needs to be loud to get attention.

735
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,410
- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
- Cool, cool.

736
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,370
- Someone who, like…
- Lifts up the mood?

737
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,872
- That's a good way to put it.
- Because that's not who I am.

738
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,125
You're not?
You seemed to me like you were.

739
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,167
No, that's not me.

740
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
- Really?
- Not at all.

741
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,671
- No!
- It's hard to explain what your type is.

742
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,674
Yeah, that's why I'm not into that.
I go by my intuition instead.

743
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,050
- Intuition?
- Mmm-hmm.

744
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,510
- Nothing wrong with that.
- I agree.

745
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,888
I don't think there's anything wrong
with that either. I trust my intuition.

746
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,390
It's usually been right.

747
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,391
- Mmm.
- Totally.

748
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,851
What's it say about me?

749
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,185
My intuition?

750
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,562
- About you?
- Yeah.

751
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,731
My intuition about you is saying…

752
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,360
- something like, "He looks cool."
- All right!

753
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,321
- <i>That was very smooth. Wow!</i>
- <i>That was so smooth.</i>

754
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,990
It feels like you're my kind of person.

755
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:54,907
- Seriously?
- Mmm-hmm.

756
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,285
- All right, all right, I see.
- You're my type.

757
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,911
Mmm. Same for me.

758
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:02,790
You're not just saying that
because I said it too, are you?

759
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,917
No, I meant it.

760
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,587
- Come on, stop lying to me.
- I'm not.

761
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,005
I wouldn't lie about that.

762
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,758
Good night.

763
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,593
- I'm hungry.
- Over there.

764
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,803
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

765
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,391
Well, I knew from
when I saw him earlier today

766
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,019
that we were the same age,
so I wanted to talk to him.

767
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,438
I think that he's a very
good-looking guy, for sure.

768
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,232
And when I think about it,
we have a lot in common.

769
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,235
And it's just very easy
being with him. Mmm.

770
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,863
He made my heart skip a beat.

771
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,950
She's obviously a very cute girl.

772
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,536
We're the same age,

773
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,330
or almost the same.

774
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,500
Since we're both from the same generation,
we have a lot in common.

775
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,294
I feel like we'd get along.

776
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,629
She's very strong.

777
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:53,716
And she's a lot more put together
than I was expecting. Mmm.

778
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,677
HOME ECONOMICS

779
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,680
LOVE KITCHEN

780
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,809
Sorry if I'm bothering you.

781
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,104
You're like,
"You're annoying me, get out."

782
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,730
- Exactly.
- Sorry, I'll leave then.

783
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,148
You're full of yourself.

784
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,691
- The door didn't close.
- Hm?

785
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,818
You're a slob.

786
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,862
You're so sloppy with everything.

787
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,031
Come on, I'm not sloppy.

788
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,367
You're the sloppiest person in the world.

789
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,827
I'm gonna sit.

790
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,245
Yo!

791
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,746
- You're such a flirt.
- Hm?

792
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,872
- A flirt.
- How so?

793
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,916
- You're way too flirty.
- What do you mean?

794
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,167
- Why do you say that?
- Mmm.

795
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,128
You would probably go after anybody.

796
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,879
- I would not.
- Definitely. You would.

797
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,297
After random girls?

798
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,176
I might look like that kinda guy,
but I have standards.

799
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,845
- No.
- So what?

800
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,888
Should I be more
like Tackle going "Kii! Kii!"

801
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,141
Or like Milk always following
Baby around everywhere?

802
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,475
I get what you're saying.

803
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,727
But you're flirty.

804
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,146
Okay, so…

805
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,022
So what should I do? Mmm?

806
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,818
You're so flirty, I'm wondering if you're
here looking for friends with benefits.

807
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,778
In Tokyo? That's sick.

808
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,823
- Totally sick.
- No, no.

809
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,659
I meant, like, why do you
even want a girlfriend?

810
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,620
- Why do I want a girlfriend?
- Mmm.

811
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,914
'Cause I want one… someone I like.

812
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,833
I think it's really important
to like somebody

813
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,418
and to have them like you back.

814
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,128
Doesn't it make you feel better knowing

815
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,755
there's somebody out there
who likes you the most?

816
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,424
- Mmm, mmm-hmm.
- Right?

817
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,593
- Yeah.
- So that's how I feel about it.

818
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,262
- Mmm.
- And I'm getting old, you know?

819
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,848
- I'm 28.
- Okay, so then, what's your goal here?

820
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,349
Marriage.

821
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,853
- Oh…
- Ultimately.

822
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,605
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

823
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,190
You think about that.

824
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,485
When he said to me, "I'm 28 already.
I'm ready to get married,"

825
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,240
I was just like, "Wow, okay.
He's a very realistic kind of person."

826
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,826
<i>And hearing that finally made me realize</i>

827
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,995
<i>that he isn't actually a player.</i>

828
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,164
I think that's what

829
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,999
makes me wanna be with him.

830
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,044
<i>There are a lot of things</i>
<i>about him that do annoy me.</i>

831
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,131
<i>But I don't have</i>
<i>to force myself to be nice to him.</i>

832
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,592
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>it's the same way for him too.</i>

833
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,344
<i>He makes me feel comfortable.</i>

834
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,554
<i>And I think I'm falling for him.</i>

835
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,892
But because I can't actually
be honest with myself about this,

836
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,895
I hate him.

837
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,106
You know how people say
they hate the person they like?

838
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,483
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah.

839
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,818
- Brings back memories.
- Brought back memories for me too.

840
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,780
- Exactly, me too.
- I want somebody to say that to me.

841
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:24,825
I know, right? I just love
this kind of stuff. It's so good.

842
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:33,042
<i>It's nice outside today.</i>
<i>So it's time for a daytime sauna.</i>

843
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,086
- Oh, awesome!
- Wow.

844
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,965
<i>Oto has not had a chance</i>
<i>to experience the sauna.</i>

845
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,843
<i>So, Oto, you may now choose the boy</i>
<i>that you would like to go with.</i>

846
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,303
- Nice.
- Ah, I get it.

847
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,722
- Who is Oto going to choose?
- Let's go, let's go!

848
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,517
<i>Oto and Tenten</i>
<i>went on a date together before.</i>

849
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,855
Nisei. I'm gonna go with you.

850
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,941
- Great! Let's go!
- All right!

851
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,859
- First time?
- Yes! First time!

852
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,615
REFRESHED

853
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,201
NATURAL HOT SPRING & SAUNA

854
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,204
Wow, this is beautiful. Nice!

855
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,581
<i>As expected, he's looking very fit.</i>

856
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,584
This is beautiful.

857
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,461
Ah, this is so nice.

858
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,172
Ah, it feels good.

859
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,054
- Whoa, whoa.
- Let's go. Thank you for waiting!

860
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,764
Thanks for inviting me.

861
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,851
She's gonna get him by showing her boobs.

862
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,394
Come on, that's a dirty move.

863
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,438
That'll make a guy think she likes him.

864
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,940
- We can be stupid like that.
- You're pretty easy.

865
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm so easy. I'd fall for it, for sure.

866
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,571
- Can I get splash myself first?
- Mmm.

867
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,826
Nisei isn't the type of guy
who would decide to only just focus

868
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,370
on one girl at a time while he's here.

869
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,957
<i>So I figured that</i>
<i>if I want to make him fall for me,</i>

870
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,919
<i>then I need to do something that makes him</i>
<i>unable to stop thinking about me.</i>

871
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,714
<i>Even when he's spending time</i>
<i>talking to other girls.</i>

872
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,509
And in order to do that, I decided
I needed to do something bold.

873
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,803
- Well, it's certainly bold.
- Whoa!

874
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,806
I'd say that's definitely bold.

875
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,601
- You're going no sandals?
- It's gonna be pretty hot in here.

876
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,102
Ahhh!

877
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,396
It's hot!

878
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,607
<i>I'm not mad about it though.</i>

879
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,651
I missed you.

880
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,945
I wanna have kids.

881
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,367
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't do that.

882
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,368
Don't mess with me.

883
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,536
Yeah, there's someone I like.

884
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,705
I'll tell you about it now.
