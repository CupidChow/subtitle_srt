Where's Lidong?

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,359
Tell him to come down.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,690
Who is it this early? I'm sleeping.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,170
Mom?

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,690
Why are you here?

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,370
What are you two doing?

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,239
Why aren't you at work?

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,170
You're that desperate for me
to make money?

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,959
Spending the money you got from
selling your son on designer brands...

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,199
Do you even have a conscience?

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,770
What kind of mother does that?

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,050
What are you saying?

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,090
You know exactly what I mean.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,570
I don't want to see you. Leave now.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,850
I...

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,730
Are you leaving or not?

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,170
If you won't, I will.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,130
What is going on?

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,410
(Spending money
from selling her own son...)

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,490
(What kind of mother does that?)

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,130
What are you two doing?

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,690
Why aren't you at work?

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,690
They're hiding something from me.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,490
(There's definitely something strange
about my amnesia.)

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,919
(If they wanted to tell me,)

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,530
(they would have already.)

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,130
What did you say?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,410
Mom.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,440
Ms. Lin. This is my fault.
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,120
But things have already come to this.
The doctor said he can't be agitated.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,530
We have to go along with it.
So I told a small lie and he believed it.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,319
This is serious.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,490
You should have told me immediately!

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,759
Not made the decision on your own!

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,730
Would I have dared to at the time?

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,370
Anyway...

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,530
Lidong can't stay like this forever.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,810
There's no point
in keeping secrets anymore.

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,410
Just get a divorce.

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,639
What?

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,010
Get a divorce!

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,079
Then I'll take him abroad

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,810
to find the best doctors for treatment.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,439
You think I care?

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,359
If the doctor hadn't said forcing
his memories back would harm him,

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,810
I would've divorced him ages ago.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,559
Sharp-tongued, aren't you?

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,210
This time, he got lucky.

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,519
He only lost his memory.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,650
What about next time?

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,279
As his wife, you've done nothing for him

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,050
but just caused him more trouble.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,999
The CEO of the company
disappeared for half a month.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,010
Have you thought about his career?

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,679
If you think he can go to work

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,439
in his current state, then fine by me.

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,410
All right.

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,090
Mu Chenxi.

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,599
Now I've seen

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,279
what kind of daughter-in-law you are.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,770
Don't come crying to me later.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,439
If anything happens to him...

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,410
He won't even lose a single hair.

77
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,530
Lidong.

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,759
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,730
I shouldn't have gone to see you.

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,759
I really want to get along with Chenxi.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,399
But she treats me like that every time.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,490
Sometimes, I'm even scared of her.

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,490
She's always been like this.

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,730
Maybe it's just her personality.

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,170
Lidong.

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,850
Can you stop being mad at Yuling?

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,650
You...

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,079
What are you doing?

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,559
Enjoying the act, huh?

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,359
Lidong, look at her!

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,530
Come with me.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,999
She's faking it, and you can't tell?
Are you doing this on purpose?

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,690
Do you have to talk like that?

94
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,639
You think I sound mean?

95
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,879
Isn't what you're doing worse?

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,079
There's nothing
between me and Su Yuling.

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,399
I really didn't know before
what went wrong between us.

98
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,210
Why do you always act like this?

99
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,170
I...

100
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,690
You're my assistant now,
so listen to me.

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,290
Mu Chenxi.

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,130
You've gone too far.

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,970
Once you leave, don't come back.

104
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,930
Not bad.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,610
Such a beauty.

106
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,159
Hey, little lady.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,319
Who are you?

108
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,559
Out alone at night?

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,799
Who are you?

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,639
What do you want?

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,810
Have a drink with us.

112
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,879
(SOS alert)

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,960
(I'm in danger. Please help.)
(Yan Lidong, save me.)

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,399
Where do you think you're going?

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,839
Who are you? What do you want?

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,970
Hey, pretty lady.

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,730
Running again?

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,479
Where to?

119
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,039
Where else can you go?

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,730
Shy, huh?

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,319
Come have some fun with us.

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,679
What are you doing? Don't touch me!

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,250
Sing us a song.

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,610
Yeah, sing.

125
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,650
Don't touch me!

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,079
Look at this hair...

127
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,879
Let go of her!

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,370
Don't touch me!

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,130
Mu Chenxi, right?

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,730
What are you doing out here alone?

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,439
Acting all high and mighty again?

132
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,930
Yeah, so what if you're pretty?

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,639
What? Cat got your tongue?

134
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,810
What are you doing?

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,399
Who the hell is this guy?

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,199
Looking for trouble?

137
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,399
What's your problem?

138
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,039
Get him!

139
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,370
He's got a death wish.

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,170
- Get him!
- Go!

141
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,250
You're hurt. How bad is it?

142
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,970
What?

143
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,730
Isn't this how it happens in the movies?

144
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,810
Why act tough?
Why didn't you call the police?

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,119
It was just a few thugs.

146
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,930
I could've taken on twenty more.

147
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,730
Easy to say when they're already gone.

148
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,039
You don't believe me?

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,130
I'll go back right now.

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,370
Stay put.

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,359
It still hurts this much?

152
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,200
Maybe we should go to the hospital.
You're already like this. Don't move.

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm not going.

154
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,839
Next time something like this happens,

155
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,690
don't be so reckless, all right?

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,890
I just wanted you to know,

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,690
