13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,819
Hello everyone.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,270
I am Chen Zhiqing,
the male supporting lead in this project.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,390
Did I read it wrong?

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,139
Is superstar Chen Zhiqing playing
a mere supporting role in our project?

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,419
Yes.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,470
I can't figure it out.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,179
Is he being blackmailed?

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,470
I don't know.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,150
Why did you join this show?

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,510
This drama is a big S+ project.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,419
But you have mostly

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,470
joined big productions from S+.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,030
I like this character
in this drama very much.

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,499
Are you actually blackmailed

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,070
by our company?

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,219
Now that everyone is here,

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,430
let's begin.

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,550
When did I become your assistant?

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,030
At that time.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,630
What's wrong with the photo?

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,190
Tell me.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,619
If I were your assistant,

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,750
I wouldn't have taken
such intimate photos with you.

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,779
Moreover,

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,590
I don't remember when it was taken.

38
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,030
Morning.

39
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,299
What happened last night?

40
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,750
Shouldn't you explain it?

41
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,710
Did anything happen last night?

42
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,659
I found a photo of us together
in the utility room.

43
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,739
A photo?

44
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,790
I didn't see it.

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,859
It's that photo.

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,230
The one you took away later.

47
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,190
I don't understand what you are saying.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,099
Okay.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,270
You're denying it, are you?

50
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,830
Tell me this,

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,830
last night, in the living room,

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,550
why did you kiss me?

53
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,350
Kiss you?

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,230
Me? Kissing you?

55
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,590
Dream on.

56
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,859
I didn't expect

57
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,819
a young actress like her
to play the leading role.

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,139
This is too surprising.

59
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,619
She hasn't appeared yet.

60
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,670
She probably won't attend
the press conference.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
It's unheard of. A drama without
the leading woman at the press conference.

62
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,390
Here she comes.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,670
So she's the female lead.

64
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,670
Incredible aura.

65
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,019
Sorry, everyone.

66
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,190
I'm late.

67
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,179
Hello everyone.

68
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,990
I am Mu Chenxi,
the female lead of "Misaligned Lover".

69
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,139
No matter what you say,

70
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,299
I can't comprehend it.

71
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,339
For the sake of Mu Chenxi,

72
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,579
you gave up on a leading role

73
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,950
and came here to suffer.

74
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,419
Okay.

75
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,270
I'll shut up and stop talking, okay?

76
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,990
Zhiqing.

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,550
I bet you are tired.

78
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,150
Here, drink some water.

79
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,550
I'm alright.

80
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,430
I have my own.

81
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,859
Zhiqing,

82
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,859
I just

83
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,990
overheard your conversation
with your agent.

84
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,670
I don't mean any harm.

85
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,299
I just think

86
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,939
your many sacrifices for Mu Chenxi

87
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,350
are not worth it at all.

88
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,859
That's my business.

89
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,390
Not yours.

90
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,990
I just think it's unfair for you.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,139
Zhiqing.

92
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,190
This is your upcoming schedule.

93
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,470
Okay.

94
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,779
Here, have a look.

95
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,219
Raise your arm a little higher.

96
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,059
Move back.

97
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,630
Put this foot to the back.

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,830
That's right.

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,670
Okay, turn around.

100
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,230
Turn around again.

101
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,550
Pay attention to your words and deeds.

102
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,059
Are you okay?

103
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,899
How are you?

104
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,550
I'm alright.

105
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,259
Yan Lidong.

106
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,390
Are you okay?

107
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,299
Slow down.

108
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,459
Are you okay?

109
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,670
Does it hurt?

110
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,240
- Not at all.
- How can you still laugh?

111
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,990
You should take a break.

112
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,470
Okay.

113
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,670
What's wrong?

114
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,499
What's wrong?

115
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,590
What's going on?

116
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,830
Are you okay?

117
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,710
Yes.

118
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,150
Didn't you see the wax oil on the floor?

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,219
We're lucky this wasn't serious.

120
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,099
If it were, we might've stopped filming.

121
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,219
Do we want that to happen?

122
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,019
Sorry.

123
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,899
We will pay attention in the future.

124
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,659
I just saw

125
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,630
somebody walking out with wax oil.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,139
Who?

127
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,990
Who is it?

128
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,750
Zhao Qian.

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,390
Where did she go?

130
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,350
She seemed to be going
to the locker room.

131
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:56,979
Chenxi.

132
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,670
Were you hurt?

133
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm okay, Ms. Peng.

134
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,470
It's just my arm.

135
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,150
Why did you do it?

136
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,059
What are you talking about?
I don't understand at all.

137
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,910
Stop pretending.

138
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,699
Someone saw you applying wax oil
on the floor of the dance studio.

139
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,870
Why did you do it?

140
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,470
Okay.

141
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,960
You're not telling, are you?

142
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,390
Wait for the news.

143
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,590
Mu Chenxi.

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,310
Okay,

145
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,830
I will spill the beans.

146
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,619
It's because you seduced Chen Zhiqing.

147
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,619
What did you say?

148
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,990
We're just friends.

149
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,750
Just friends?

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,230
If you're just friends,

151
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,659
how could he give up

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,219
a movie project just for you?

153
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,830
How could he accept a support role here?

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,710
What did you say?

155
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,670
Don't tell me you didn't know that.

156
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,070
Stop pretending.

157
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,670
I hate

158
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,590
women like you the most.

159
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,790
