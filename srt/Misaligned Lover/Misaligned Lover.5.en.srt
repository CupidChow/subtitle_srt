Why act tough?
Why didn't you call the police?

Next time something like this happens,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,690
don't be so reckless, okay?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,050
I just wanted you to know,

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,850
I can protect you.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,450
Go to sleep.

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,850
Lidong...

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,090
Thank you for tonight.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,450
Good night.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,130
See you tomorrow.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,730
Good night.

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,850
What am I thinking?

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,250
Could he be remembering something?

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,650
Why am I having such strange thoughts?

27
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,850
What if he really remembers?

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,450
Could it be...

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,850
I like her?

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,650
Impossible.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,570
There's no way
I'd fall for a woman like her.

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,690
As long as you cooperate with me,

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,450
I promise
you'll get everything you want.

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,970
Don't worry.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,130
The only thing I want is Yan Lidong.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,879
Who did you upset this time?

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,080
How did you suddenly get replaced
as the female lead?

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,839
Replaced?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,570
Who made that decision?
I'll go find them.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,490
Who's replacing me?

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,890
Su Yuling.

42
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,010
Su Yuling?

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,970
I quit.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,039
No, please, don't make this worse.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,559
Do you have the money
to quit just like that?

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,679
How am I supposed to act with Su Yuling?

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,610
Come on, don't make a fuss.
Just do your job.

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,650
Let's go.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,450
Xiao Xuanyi.

50
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,050
Your Highness.

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,490
Yan Lidong.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,730
What was that?

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,930
You can't even get the emotions right?

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,599
The script doesn't say to hug.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,490
How do I act it?

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,730
Chenxi.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,330
Control your people.

58
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,690
If he can't do it,
terminate the contract.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,170
I'm sorry, director.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,279
What's wrong with you?

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,279
Now's not the time for tantrums.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,239
Finish the scene, and we'll talk later.

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,730
I'll handle everything.

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,130
Let's do it, director.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,530
Three, two, one. Action!

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,970
(I don't even know what I did wrong.)

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,039
I found out.

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,839
Su Yuling pulled some strings
just to act with Mr. Yan.

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,639
Mu Chenxi.
I want to be a professional actor.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,610
No.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,650
Why not?

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
Because you're my assistant.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,279
I'm only your assistant
because I owe you money.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,839
If I become an actor and make money...

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,920
So you want to leave me
as soon as you can pay me back?

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,010
Hello, Guan Tai?

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,610
Have you seen Yan Lidong?

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,970
Mr. Yan?

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,170
Didn't he go home with you?

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,770
Oh, okay. Thanks.

81
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,050
Hey, Qi Ming.

82
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,970
I need you
to look into something for me.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,490
Oh, wow.

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,610
Yan Lidong.

85
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,010
You've been hiding
other properties from me?

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,050
Yan Lidong.

87
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,210
Open the door.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,130
I know you're in there.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,970
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,050
Not bad.

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,039
Tell me.

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,199
Why are you keeping a place

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,650
behind my back?

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,039
You won't let me go home,

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,890
so I can't even have my own place?

96
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,770
Who's stopping you?

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,890
Besides, you still owe me millions.

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,439
Until you pay off your debt,

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,610
you're still mine.

100
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,559
Looks like you don't really care

101
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,719
about that money after all.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,090
No way.

103
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,679
Do you know how many years

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,719
I have to act

105
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,130
to make that much?

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,610
So why won't you let me act
and pay you back?

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,530
I get it.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,930
You're jealous.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,410
You don't want me acting
with Su Yuling, do you?

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,210
Me? Jealous?

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,079
Impossible.

112
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,119
And besides, Su Yuling...

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,610
She's not even worthy.

114
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,239
Then why won't you let me act

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,010
and make money to pay you back?

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,610
You...

117
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,610
Do you like me?

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,039
I...

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,439
That's ridiculous.

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,479
No matter what,

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,839
I'm still a celebrity.

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,639
Why would I like someone

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,930
like you?

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,050
Your phone.

125
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,790
(Ms. Lin)

126
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,070
(Ms. Lin)

127
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,650
Hello?

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,919
There's an issue with the board.

129
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,439
Lidong needs to come to the company.

130
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,850
Are you out of your mind?

131
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,919
Wait, Ms. Lin.

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,399
You know
what condition Yan Lidong is in.

133
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,210
I need to see him by noon tomorrow!

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,970
I...

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,519
Chairman.

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,999
All the shareholders are here.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,479
They've been waiting outside for ages.

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,639
Let them in.

139
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,639
I only have ten minutes.

140
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,530
Yes.

141
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,210
Good day, Mr. Yan.
