Mu Chenxi and Zhao Qian...

23

They killed my sister.

I will avenge her.

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,270
I will make them pay!

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,499
Miss Yuling, where are you going?

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,459
Mr. Su, as per your instructions,

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,150
we've redirected public opinion
towards the production crew.

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,190
Oh, right.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,830
Inform Minister Cheng

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,739
to cancel
all of Yuling's upcoming schedules.

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,259
Yes.

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,030
Understood.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,579
Miss Yuling.

35
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,030
Let go of me!

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,819
I need to avenge my sister!

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,819
What's going on?

38
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,710
Aunty Zhang.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,790
Dad.

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,950
They killed my sister.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,899
They killed my sister.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,470
I will make them pay.

43
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,539
I will avenge her.

44
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,499
All right.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,619
Don't worry.

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,350
Yuling, I'm here.

47
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,419
I will avenge your sister.

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,550
Trust me.

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,710
Once we've settled everything,

50
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,830
let's bring
her favourite lilies, all right?

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,670
Okay.

52
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,790
Okay.

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,030
Good girl.

54
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,710
That's my girl.

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,859
I asked the florist
to add some sunflowers.

56
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,590
They'll brighten your mood a little.

57
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,539
You've been exhausted
from training lately.

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,310
Take this chance to get some rest.

59
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,310
The weather is great today.

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,750
Want to go for a walk?

61
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,299
Sure.

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,670
Let's go. I'll go with you.

63
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,510
Are you crazy?

64
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,659
Do you have any idea

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,859
how sensitive
the Mu Chenxi case is right now?

66
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,950
And you still spoke
to the reporters like that?

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,190
I only told the truth.

68
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,710
The truth?

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,590
You've been in this industry for years.
Haven't you realised yet?

70
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,019
No one cares

71
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,510
whether what you say is true or not.

72
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,419
Making a statement means taking a side.

73
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,739
I worked so hard to resolve that whole
"longing for your first love" mess.

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,910
And now
you're jumping into another scandal?

75
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,670
Chen Zhiqing.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,990
Where's your ambition?

77
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,099
What happened to the person
who stood outside the company doors,

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,630
swearing to become
the biggest star in Huanxi?

79
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,510
Is a woman really worth all this?

80
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,059
I know I can play that role well.

81
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,579
If you give me this chance,

82
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,459
I promise...

83
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,699
I will become

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,670
the top star in Huanxi.

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,110
I'm just tired of showing the same face.

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,750
Is that so wrong?

87
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,470
Chairman.

88
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,819
The initial investment was huge

89
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,270
for project "Misaligned Lovers".

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,550
If it doesn't proceed smoothly,

91
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,200
the company will suffer great losses.

92
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,299
With the scandal
surrounding Mu Chenxi and Zhao Qian,

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,990
the controversy online is escalating.

94
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,990
For the sake of the project,
we may have to replace her.

95
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,750
However...

96
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,670
Mr. Yan

97
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,590
doesn't agree.

98
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,630
Ms. Lin.

99
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,739
Yan Lidong isn't here.

100
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,950
Please come back another time.

101
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,550
I'm here to see you.

102
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,070
Mr. Fan came to see me.

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,750
He said the company wants to replace
the female lead in "Misaligned Lovers".

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,219
From the company's perspective,

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,270
I understand.

106
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,270
Is this still the Mu Chenxi
I used to know?

107
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,299
At a time like this,

108
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,430
Ms. Lin, you still
have the mood to mock me?

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,470
Do you really think
I'm here to mock you?

110
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,870
Mu Chenxi.

111
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,459
Things have come to this.

112
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,270
Even if you die now,

113
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,630
do you think
the rumors will just disappear?

114
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,190
Some things only hold power over you

115
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,470
if you let them get to you.

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,350
Compared to how you are now,

117
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,819
I preferred the sharp-tongued,
relentless fighter

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,550
you used to be.

119
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,350
Mr. Fan.

120
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,390
Regarding "Misaligned Lovers",
what did the chairman say?

121
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,990
Follow Mr. Yan's decision.

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,859
And if the other
board members question it?

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,030
I'll handle it.

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,819
So you're saying,

125
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,830
the chairman refuses
to replace the female lead?

126
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,750
The chairman is usually quite rigid.

127
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,699
I never expected her

128
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,390
to make an exception this time.

129
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,710
Guess Mu Chenxi got lucky.

130
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,270
