This thing is useless now.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,850
Keeping it will only bring more sorrow.
Might as well burn it.

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,570
Chenxi.

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,850
I brought this for you. Lightly sweetened.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,850
Thanks.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,050
Chenxi, you...

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,850
About that day...

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,450
I'm really sorry.

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,479
We have a lot of emotional scenes today.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,450
Let's go through the lines together.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,770
Sure.

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,250
Thanks, Zhiqing.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,930
Let's begin.

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,639
Does Mu Chenxi like Chen Zhiqing?

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,679
Of course.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
That's Chen Zhiqing
we're talking about. A top star.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,439
Buying her coffee,
offering to rehearse together...

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,839
What girl wouldn't fall for him?

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,279
Mutual attraction!

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,450
My favourite on-screen couple
will never break up!

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,890
What are you doing?

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,810
Do you like him?

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,850
Who?

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,490
Chen Zhiqing.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,130
Me?

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,970
Who wouldn't like him?

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,599
He's popular, famous...

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,890
And handsome.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,159
Superficial.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,130
Childish.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,650
Why are you jealous?

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,199
Mr. Fan.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,930
What am I supposed to do now?

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,119
If I sign with you...

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,250
Will you promote me?

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,370
Of course.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,690
Will I get famous?

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,450
No doubt.

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,410
As famous as Chen Zhiqing?

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,850
Ambitious.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,370
You'll definitely make it big.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,679
Listen...

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,079
At Xitu Entertainment,
we do more than films and TV.

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,679
We also manage luxury brands.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,959
If you sign with us,

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,159
I guarantee it won't take long.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,170
You'll be as big
as Chen Zhiqing in no time.

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,610
What do you think?

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,770
All right, I'll sign.

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,530
Really?

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,970
Great news, Mr. Fan.

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,719
I signed a promising newcomer.

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,159
Take a look for me.

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,519
You've always had a good eye.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,930
Decide for yourself.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,599
But the signee wants to talk to you.

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,439
Don't worry.

73
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,010
It's definitely worth it.

74
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,330
Yan Lidong, come here.

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,850
Who did you say?

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,250
Yan Lidong?

77
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,770
Yeah, what about it?

78
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,490
Must be a coincidence.

79
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,119
Hello, Mr. Fan.

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,850
I'm Yan Lidong, a new actor.

81
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,399
(What's going on?)

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,370
(Is the boss pretending not to know me?)

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,570
(Could he be trying
to experience life as a rookie?)

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,879
- I'll sit...
- No...

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,879
You sit. I don't need to.

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,759
I can stand.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,999
- That's not right.
- No, no.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,519
It's fine, just sit.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,050
Our boss appreciates talent.

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,650
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,679
I came today

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,810
to discuss my contract with you.

93
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,530
(He's tired of being the president?)

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
(Okay, I'll play along.)

95
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,319
I'm willing to sign,

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,770
but I have a few conditions to discuss.

97
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,919
No...

98
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,970
No need to think.

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,759
We'll fully cooperate.

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,679
Mr. Fan,

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,719
you should at least hear him out.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,810
All right.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,639
First of all,

104
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,850
I don't want to do
any intimate scenes or kiss scenes.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,719
Wait, Lidong,

106
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,239
our company mainly produces

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,039
romance dramas.

108
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,130
Not accepting
intimate scenes won't work.

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,919
I haven't finished.

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,479
Unless the person is Mu Chenxi.

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,890
Mu Chenxi?

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,930
Who?

113
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,730
An artist from our company.

114
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,010
Not very famous.

115
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,890
All right, that works.

116
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,559
My second condition is...

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,279
I don't want to be involved in
any fake dating scandals. Unless...

118
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,399
The person is Mu Chenxi.

119
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,330
Right.

120
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,879
Got it.

121
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,199
Other than that,
I don't have many demands.

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,039
I'm a new actor,

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,319
so I'd like the company

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,570
to provide an acting coach
to help me improve.

125
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,610
All right.

126
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,050
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

127
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,639
So we're signing the contract?

128
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,330
If there are no issues, let's do it.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,879
Take a seat.

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,010
It's fine, sit down.
I'll get the contract ready.

131
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,959
Your department's S+ project...

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
The male lead
isn't confirmed yet, right?

133
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,330
Not yet.

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,970
Give it to Yan Lidong.

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,690
It's decided.

136
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,319
Xitu Entertainment's S+ project...

137
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,240
They cast a rookie as the male lead?

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,480
(Xitu Entertainment's S+ blockbuster
lands on a rookie actor)

139
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
I heard they're even holding
a press conference for him this afternoon.

140
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,599
Who is this rookie?

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,359
No idea.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,319
Chenxi!

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,570
This is bad.

144
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,319
Do you know who our company picked

145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,759
as the S+ project's rising star?

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,730
No.

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,520
It's him.

148
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
(Xitu Entertainment's S+ project
Male Lead: Yan Lidong)

149
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,199
What?

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,199
We're doomed.

151
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,199
This is a disaster.

152
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,999
The press conference is about to start.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,759
If the chairman finds out, what do we do?

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,170
Get back to the office.

155
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,239
Pick up the phone.

156
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,010
Why isn't he answering?

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,530
Pick up.

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,010
Why isn't he picking up?

159
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:25,235
The number you are calling
is currently unavailable.

160
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,319
Now, let me introduce

161
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,799
our company's newest talent.

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,039
Yan Lidong.

163
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,050
Please welcome him.

164
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,279
There he is.

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,359
That's Yan Lidong?

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,810
That's him.

167
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,719
Since joining our company,

168
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,679
Lidong has gained a lot of attention.

169
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,610
- Everyone is looking forward to...
- This is bad.
