(Adapted from
a Himalaya Qiji Literature novel)

12
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,800
(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,719
(If this is true,)

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,050
(I'm screwed.)

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,370
What is it? Who was calling?

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,770
A client.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,930
A client?

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,239
You really want to act
and make money, right?

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,799
Of course.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,679
Perfect.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,970
There's a great opportunity right now.
Less work, more pay.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,290
What kind of job?

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,519
A client

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,159
needs someone to play

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,839
a domineering CEO.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,879
You fit the part perfectly.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,839
You have that heartless,

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,759
profit-driven,

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,850
cold-blooded businessman look.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,170
But this time, it's different.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,959
It's not for a drama.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,359
It's for a corporate event.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,330
How much?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,010
How much is the client offering?

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,290
Five...

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,170
Fifty grand?

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,370
Not enough, right?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,650
Are you serious? That much?

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,770
How much are you taking?

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,890
We'll split it 80/20.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,239
80/20?

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,690
- You get 80, I get 20.
- Deal.

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,570
Please, have a seat.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,610
Lidong can go
to the company tomorrow, right?

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,079
He can.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,919
But the price...

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,530
He's my son.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,879
Even brothers keep business clear.

49
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,570
Family still counts.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,210
How much do you want?

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,730
Five...

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,479
Five hundred grand?

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,490
Fine.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,159
That's an acceptable price.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,799
Consider it a family discount.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,559
Still, Lidong

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,999
is a public figure now.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,599
We can't cut corners.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,799
He needs a chauffeur,

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,519
a five-star hotel suite,

61
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,279
three meals a day plus supper.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,130
Each meal needs...

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,730
Of course, that's for others.

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,719
But there are some other matters

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,999
that require your cooperation.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,130
Go ahead.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,199
First of all,

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,759
you absolutely cannot show up.

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,239
I...

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,599
I worked hard to convince

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,639
Lidong to take on this role.

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,039
You know your situation.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,519
If you can't cooperate,

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,919
there's nothing I can do.

75
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,479
It's not my millions on the line.

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,079
Fine, fine.

77
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,250
I'll agree to that.

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,330
Go on.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,730
And these.

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,020
(Chauffeur service, five-star hotel,
three meals plus supper.)

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,130
Why do you have
so many men's clothes at home?

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,130
Collection.

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,810
This one looks good. Go change.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,810
What's wrong?

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,010
Tie my tie.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,130
Here, let me put it on for you.

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,730
