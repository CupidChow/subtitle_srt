a Himalaya Qiji Literature novel)

(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,290
Zhiqing.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,090
I heard you were looking for me.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,480
I've thought about it for a long time.
There's something I have to tell you.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,490
Chenxi.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,490
You said you don't even
understand your own feelings.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,130
I can wait.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,330
I'll wait for you to figure it out.

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,290
Zhiqing...

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,290
I...

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,919
In public like this?

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,730
A big star
like you isn't afraid of being seen?

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,639
If any misunderstandings arise,
that wouldn't be good, would it?

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,479
What's wrong?

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,570
You're hurt.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,450
No.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,239
This blood is Su Yuling's.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,199
Su Yuling?

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,050
What happened to her?

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,810
During our promo shoot,

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,450
a metal frame fell on her.

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,959
I took her to the hospital.

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,090
She'll be fine.

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,870
(Room 01)

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,919
I know you don't like Su Yuling,

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,130
but I couldn't just ignore her
when she was hurt.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,039
What do you take me for?

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,279
I do dislike her,

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,919
but she got hurt because of you.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,490
Of course I had to come see her.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,199
I thought...

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,119
Thought what?

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,890
That I came here to pick on a patient?

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,690
Lidong.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,999
Yucheng.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,090
Miss Mu.

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,970
You're here to visit Yuling too?

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,399
What's wrong?

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,690
Why do you look so weak?

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,719
Yucheng?

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,839
Are you okay?

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,890
Do you feel unwell?

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,370
I'm fine.

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,650
Maybe I just walked too fast.

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,490
Come on, let's see a doctor.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,730
Why did you come back without telling me?

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,650
Didn't want to interrupt you
and your unreachable love.

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,250
What my unreachable love.?

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,050
Doesn't this

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,970
say Su Yucheng?

62
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,399
"I've always regretted it.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,090
Not being able to keep her back then.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,290
If I had another chance to go back to
when I was nineteen...

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,039
No matter what,
I wouldn't have let go of her hand."

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,290
I didn't write this.

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,199
Men always forget the promises they make.

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,159
Forgetting what they wrote
in their own journals...

69
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,570
That's nothing new.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,690
I didn't write this.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,679
My unreachable love

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,130
can only be you.

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,170
(Why am I getting flustered?)

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,570
You and Mr. Yan...

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,290
There's nothing going on.

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,279
Then what's with him?

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,559
Enough, stop talking about it.

78
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,290
Fine, fine.

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,810
Not another word.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,850
Mr. Fan said this is your next project.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,850
Thanks.

82
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,550
("Mismatched Lovers")

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,330
I've read this script before.

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,490
It's from the company's S+ project.

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,559
After seven years in the shadows,

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,490
I finally get to be part
of a major project.

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,119
I've already read the script.

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,679
The third female lead...

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,959
She may be a villain,

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,559
but she fights for her ideals...

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,159
Sorry.

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,119
Ms. Chenxi.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,359
You might have misunderstood.

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,810
The third female lead isn't you.

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,290
Oh, my mistake.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,119
Actually, the fourth female lead...

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,199
I quite like her too.

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,290
No. You're the female lead.

99
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,850
The female lead?

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,090
- You mean Chenxi is the lead?
- The lead?

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,210
Yes.

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,090
It's all set.

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,839
This is the dress we reserved.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,850
Try it on.

105
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,159
That's CANDY's signature gown.

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,199
They never lend it out.

107
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,170
Let's go.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,810
Oh my god.

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,599
You look incredible.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,519
No wonder you're the company's top star.

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,679
The entire store

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,770
is shining because of you.

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,250
Are you trying on suits too?

114
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,310
(To: Miss Mu Chenxi)

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,850
You got this for me?

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,010
It's for you.

117
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,430
(To: Miss Mu Chenxi)

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,119
Isn't this

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,119
CANDY's signature gown?

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,679
They said they never lend it out.

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,959
How did you get it?

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,290
It wasn't hard.

123
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,650
I'm the top star
of Xitu Entertainment now.

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,130
Go try it on.

125
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,319
Are there any other good female roles

126
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,890
that haven't been cast yet?

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,639
They're all taken.

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,519
There weren't
many female roles to begin with,

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,250
and with a famous director on board,

130
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,410
everyone's been scrambling for a spot.

131
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,890
What's wrong?

132
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,770
Do you know if there's any project
considering Mu Chenxi?

133
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,890
Zhiqing.

134
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,370
Don't be reckless.

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,970
You're at a critical point
in your career transition.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,559
You need to focus on your work.

137
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,759
Don't ruin your career

138
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,410
over a woman.

139
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,239
(I already let Mu Chenxi go once.)

140
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,210
(This time,
I won't make the same mistake.)

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,199
That's Yan Lidong
from Xitu Entertainment.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,359
A rookie actor.

143
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,639
Yeah.

144
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,559
He's so handsome.

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,959
Seriously, he looks amazing.

146
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,079
That's the new actor
from Xitu Entertainment?

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,319
- He's really good-looking.
- Yeah. Who's that beside him?

148
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,690
She's quite pretty too.

149
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,290
Mr. Fan.

150
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,159
Mr. Liu.

151
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,959
This is Yan Lidong from our company.

152
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,439
The male lead of the S+ project.

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,930
I've heard a lot about you.

154
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,439
And this is

155
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,079
the female lead of our S+ project.

156
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,679
Hello.

157
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,279
An investor wants to meet you.

158
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,650
Right now?

159
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,970
Let's go.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,970
Chenxi.

161
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,890
Thank you
for visiting me at the hospital.

162
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,570
You're welcome.

163
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,479
I almost forgot to tell you.

164
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,039
While I was recovering,

165
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,999
Lidong came to see me every day.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,119
You don't mind, do you, Chenxi?

167
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,799
You got hurt saving him.

168
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,530
It's only right that he checked on you.

169
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,159
I never expected him
to be so considerate.

170
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,159
Visiting me was one thing,

171
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,370
but he even took care
of me in every detail.

172
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,879
I thought you'd be upset

173
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,490
when you found out.

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,450
Mu Chenxi!

175
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,050
Are you all right?

176
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,759
What happened?

177
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,410
Yeah, what's going on?

178
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,130
Why did she fall?

179
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,930
No idea.

180
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,690
What's happening?

181
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,159
Did someone push her?

182
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,370
I don't know.

183
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,239
What happened?

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,170
Did that girl push her?

185
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,039
She just suddenly collapsed.

186
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,759
Weird.

187
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,050
