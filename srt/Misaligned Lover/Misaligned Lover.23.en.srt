a Himalaya Qiji Literature novel)

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,140
(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
It's you.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,559
Why is it you?

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,290
Who else did you think it would be?

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,810
You killed her?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,130
Of course.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,490
She deserved to die.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,839
Su Yuling.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,170
Are you insane?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,890
Do you even realise what you...

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,290
Yes, I am insane.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,690
But when did I start losing my mind?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,279
Was it when I found out

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,250
that you and Yan Lidong were married?

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,839
Or was it the day
I got the call about my sister?

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,239
I'm sorry about your sister.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,450
Shut up!

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,999
I am Daddy's good girl.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,890
I can't make Daddy angry.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,130
Otherwise, he won't love me anymore.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,090
I can't.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,919
Su Yuling.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,359
Su Yuling, come back!

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,559
Come back!

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,719
Su Yuling!

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,570
Come back, Su Yuling!

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,170
Somebody!

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,170
Is anyone there? Help!

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,890
- Chenxi!
- Mu Chenxi!

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,970
Chenxi!

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,250
Over here!

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,970
Did you find anything?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,450
This is Mu Chenxi's phone.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,319
- Something must've happened to her.
- Another one missing.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,199
Another one? Who else is missing?

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,159
Zhao Qian.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,010
Call the police.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,119
Is there CCTV here?

50
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,080
- Yes.
- Take me there. I need to check the footage.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,850
I'll take you.

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,130
I'm calling for report.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,170
Someone has gone missing here.

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,050
Mu Chenxi!

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,690
Isn't this...

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,730
The next one.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,210
Stop.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,970
What is it?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,010
You recognise it?

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,770
That's the Su family's car.

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
- Who are you looking for?
- I'm here for Mr. Su.

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,239
Is he home?

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,879
You...

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,050
Mr. Su, come out.
I need to ask you something.

65
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,410
Who's looking for me?

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,210
Where are you hiding Mu Chenxi?

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,719
You came to my house

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,119
in the middle of the night

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,850
just to shout about some actress?

70
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,770
I don't even know her.

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
How would I know where she is?

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,330
Drop the act.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,639
When Mu Chenxi went missing,

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,770
your family's car
just happened to be at the set.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,279
Mr. Yan.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,639
Does my car's location

77
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,199
need to be reported to you now?

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,039
Aren't you overstepping your bounds?

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,410
Aunty Zhang, see him out.

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,410
Yucheng's case was already settled.

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,450
I suggest you
don't break the law, Mr. Su.

82
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,970
What do you mean by that?

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,399
A week ago, Zhao Qian disappeared.

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,519
When Mu Chenxi went missing,

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,970
your car was once again at the set.

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,519
Mr. Su.

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,730
You don't think
that's just a coincidence, do you?

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,730
Are you serious?

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
Do you think I would joke

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,290
about something like this?

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,559
I was in my office all day.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,959
Ask around if you don't believe me.

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,410
You can investigate.

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,450
Aunty Zhang.

95
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,239
Did Yuling go out today?

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,239
No.

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,650
She slept the entire day.

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,159
(A week ago, Zhao Qian disappeared.)

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,770
(When Mu Chenxi went missing,
the Su family's car was at the set again.)

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,999
(Could this be connected to Yuling?)

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,570
(Where did the dirt
on her shoes come from?)

102
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,800
Chenxi has only been
missing for a short time.

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,130
The police won't file a case yet.

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,959
How?

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,279
We checked. Su Quan was
at the company the whole time.

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,570
He never left.

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,010
There's no such thing as coincidence.

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,370
Chenxi's disappearance
must be connected to the Su family.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,170
Let's go to the Su residence.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,050
I'll go with you.

111
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,570
Let's not.

112
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,470
(Manager)

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,310
(Manager)

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
Aren't you going to pick up?

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,090
She might need something from you.

116
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,810
What could it be?

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,199
Probably just work-related matters.

118
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,210
Nothing urgent.

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,690
Aunty Zhang.

120
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,210
Sir.

121
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,119
What's with these flowers?

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,130
Miss Yuling ordered them just now

123
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,130
and had them delivered.

124
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,470
(Beloved daughter)

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,810
Where would Yuling go?

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,719
I'm seated. You can push now.

127
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,970
Daddy.

128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,759
I'm sorry, Daddy.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,770
I was the one who brought Yuling here.

130
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,079
It's not your fault, Yucheng.

131
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,239
I was the one who insisted on coming.

132
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,679
I'm sorry, Daddy.

133
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,199
You came to see the sunset, didn't you?
Look, over there.

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,159
I'll take you.

135
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,370
Come.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,119
It's beautiful.

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,290
So stunning.

138
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,490
The view here is nice, isn't it?

139
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,490
It's even better at night.

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,879
When I was little,

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,290
my sister used to bring me here
to watch the stars.

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,999
Su Yuling.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,119
You're completely insane.

144
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,930
Do you even know what you're doing?

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,599
Stop now before it's too late.

146
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,399
Otherwise, there's no turning back.

147
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,610
Turning back?

148
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,319
From the moment
my sister was killed by you,

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,959
there was no way back for me.

150
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,319
No one wanted that to happen.

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,610
You didn't?

152
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,970
Do you think just saying
that absolves you of responsibility?

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,050
You're all guilty.

154
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,079
I'll send you down now
to keep my sister company.

155
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,210
Yuling!

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,490
Yuling!

157
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,119
You can't do this!

158
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,970
Dad?

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,410
Why are you here?

160
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,450
It really is you...

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,319
I'm avenging my sister.

162
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,170
Yuling.

163
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,079
Yuling, listen to me.

164
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,210
You have to stop this now!

165
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,279
Do you realise this is a crime?

166
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,599
Chenxi!

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,970
Stay back!

168
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,170
- Take one more step, and I'll kill her!
- Yuling!

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,039
Calm down.

170
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,130
We won't come any closer.

171
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,770
Let's talk.

172
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,810
Whatever you want, we'll agree to it.

173
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,770
Just let her go, all right?

174
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,010
Anything?

175
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,879
Yes, anything.

176
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,839
I want my sister!

177
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,690
Yuling...

178
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,410
Listen to Dad.

179
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,810
Listen to Dad.

180
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,559
Your sister's death

181
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,159
had nothing to do with Mu Chenxi.

182
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,319
That's impossible.

183
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,170
She's the one who killed my sister!

184
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,199
Trust me.

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,370
No way!

186
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,279
If it weren't for her

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,839
offending Zhao Qian's fans,

188
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,559
how would my sister have died?

189
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,130
Yuling, listen to me!

190
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,559
Wang Bin...

191
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,330
He only tried to kill Mu Chenxi

192
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,770
because he was manipulated by you.

193
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,759
You were the one who told me all this.

194
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,639
Don't you trust your own father?

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,730
Impossible.

196
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,010
Impossible.

197
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,610
Impossible!

198
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,770
Impossible...

199
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,290
I've already lost your sister.

200
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,119
You're my only daughter.

201
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,850
You can't do something so reckless.

202
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,879
It can't be true.

203
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,570
I've already lost your sister,

204
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,319
I can't lose you too.

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,210
Impossible.

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,370
Impossible.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,159
Be good. Come down, all right?

208
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,050
No.

209
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,570
Let's go home, okay?

210
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,730
Come with me. Let's go home.

211
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,479
No... I can't.

212
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,490
I won't.

213
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,250
Chenxi!

214
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,530
Let go.

215
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,370
I won't.

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,639
Let go of me.

217
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,970
Let go right now!

218
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,519
Yan Lidong.

219
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,519
As your wife, I command you,

220
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,490
let go of me. Now!

221
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,890
When we got married, we vowed

222
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,930
never to let go of each other's hands.

223
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,890
Even if it means death today,

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,050
I'll die with you!

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,170
Hurry!

226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,439
Yuling!

227
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,290
- No, this isn't real!
- Yuling!

228
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,479
Su Yuling.

229
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,359
You are under arrest

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,119
for murder,

231
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,079
kidnapping, and

232
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,319
violating Article 232,

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Article 239, and other sections
of the criminal law.

234
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,690
Take her away.
