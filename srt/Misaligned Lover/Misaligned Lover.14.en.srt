(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,080
If we hadn't broken up back then,

14
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,920
would we still be together now?

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,520
Maybe.

16
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,640
Or maybe not.

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,789
Because, Chen Zhiqing...

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,400
You were always meant to be a superstar.

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,400
Your light

20
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,720
was never meant for just me.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,709
Zhiqing,

22
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,749
we have a theatrical film project

23
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,709
and would like to invite you
to play the lead role.

24
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,229
I'll send you the project details.

25
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,269
Take a look first.

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,360
All right.

27
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,680
Why are you leaving so soon?

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,640
If I say I walked into the wrong room,
would you believe me?

29
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,720
Is it really just a mistake?

30
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,789
It is.

31
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,280
Nothing happened between us.

32
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,080
Then what's with the mark on your neck?

33
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,909
We're adults.

34
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,520
Some things don't need
to be taken too seriously.

35
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,949
What? "Adults don't need
to take it seriously"?

36
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,360
What do you mean by that?

37
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,469
Why are you getting so worked up?

38
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,480
I never said you
had to take responsibility.

39
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,080
Where's Mr. Yan?

40
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,440
He took a cab.

41
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,120
What's going on with that couple now?

42
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,320
What's going on between you and Mr. Yan?

43
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,600
Nothing.

44
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,320
Then why has he been staring
at you the whole way?

45
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,920
Maybe his eyes have issues.

46
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,960
No way. Something is definitely
going on between you two.

47
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,469
(Artist Rest Area)
Our story

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,629
is mainly about responsibility.

49
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,560
Whether for one's country or for love,

50
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,149
as a man,

51
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,520
one should have the courage
to take responsibility.

52
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,720
So just because we're adults, does that mean
we don't have to take responsibility?

53
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,000
Well...

54
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,560
What is it?

55
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,669
Really?

56
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,709
Are you sure?

57
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,800
Of course. They already
called me from their side.

58
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,480
- They want you for the role.
- They called?

59
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
I also think you're the perfect fit.

60
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,269
Really?

61
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,069
Yeah.

62
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm a perfect fit?

63
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,280
Come here.

64
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,800
What?

65
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,360
Mu Chenxi, why are you
not taking responsibility for me?

66
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,880
No...

67
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,680
Let's talk about this later, all right?

68
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,789
Are you dissatisfied

69
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,200
with my performance last night?

70
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,709
Playing it this bold, huh?

71
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,789
From now on,

72
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,560
Mu Chenxi is our top star.

73
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

74
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,149
Minister Cheng,

75
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,480
has the male lead
for the new project been decided?

76
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,720
The company wants you
to work with Zhiqing again.

77
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,600
But a theatrical film
specifically requested him.

78
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,869
The director is well-known,

79
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,000
so it's hard to turn down.

80
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,909
But the company

81
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,029
is already arranging
a new co-star for you.

82
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,920
It should be settled soon.

83
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,560
I have a good candidate.

84
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,600
Who?

85
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,349
Yan Lidong.

86
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,280
A new actor under Xitu Entertainment.

87
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,029
That might not work.

88
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,189
Why?

89
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,560
He doesn't have the availability.

90
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,189
His company lined up

91
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,600
a major S+ project for him.

92
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,000
Has the female lead been confirmed?

93
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,840
Yes.

94
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,869
Apparently,

95
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,960
it's some little-known actress
from their company.

96
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,720
Something like... Xi?

97
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,189
Mu Chenxi.

98
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah.

99
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,669
Yes, that's her.

100
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,920
Her again.

101
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,909
Minister Cheng,

102
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,469
when are we shooting the promo video

103
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,229
for our drama?

104
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,680
There's no schedule for it yet.

105
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,669
But my upcoming schedule is packed.

106
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,880
If I'm going to film a duo promo,
it has to be today.

107
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,960
All right, Miss.

108
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,160
Well...

109
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,680
I'll arrange it.

110
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,080
It's just that...

111
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,280
Zhiqing has an event this afternoon.

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,200
That's fine.

113
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,240
I can film
with our drama's second male lead first.

114
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,640
Look at the camera.

115
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,480
Good.

116
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,000
Very good.

117
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,880
Great, move to the side.

118
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,560
Link arms with the male lead.

119
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,240
Yes.

120
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,680
That's perfect.

121
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,829
Good, very good.

122
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,800
All right, you two can go change now.

123
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,389
Thanks for the hard work, Lidong.

124
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,800
Shooting promos
right after filming the drama.

125
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,680
It's my job.

126
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,949
Lidong,

127
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,909
a new restaurant just opened nearby.

128
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,269
My sister and I tried it last time.

129
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,429
The food was really good.

130
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,669
If you're free after this,

131
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,280
do you want to go check it out?

132
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,749
No.

133
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,080
I have something else later.
Go ahead without me.

134
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,280
Su Yuling?

135
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,789
Lidong.

136
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,680
My ankle really hurts.

137
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,960
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

138
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,789
- What happened?
- Nurse.

139
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,429
She's hurt.

140
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,480
