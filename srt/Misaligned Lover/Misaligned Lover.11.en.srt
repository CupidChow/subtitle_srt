(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,490
She doesn't like you.

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,850
She wants you to suffer.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,090
A nobody like you

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,490
daring to seduce Zhiqing?

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,090
I'll make sure you pay for that.

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,530
What do you mean by "pay for that"?

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,370
Stay out of this.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,490
You have a death wish.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,850
Mu Chenxi!

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,759
Are you all right?

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,599
I'm fine.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,879
I just twisted my ankle.

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,130
Did he hurt you?

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,050
You're injured.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,490
It's just a scratch.

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,050
I'm calling the police.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,050
Forget it. Let's not pursue this.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,850
Let's go home.

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,890
Come on, let's go home.

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,250
Chenxi.

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,730
Mu Chenxi!

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,010
Mr. Zhiqing.

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,919
Chenxi is home.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,250
She's fine now.

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,439
I'll go check on her.

38
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,090
All right, let's go.

39
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,439
Where are you?

40
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,359
The reporters have been waiting forever.

41
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,639
They need to see you.

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,210
Get over here now.

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,799
Did you hear me? Hurry up.

44
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,319
Mr. Zhiqing,

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,119
if you're busy, go ahead.

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,359
I was about to see her anyway.

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,090
I'll have her call you later.

48
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,450
Thanks.

49
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,970
Let's go.

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,810
Got it.

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,810
Does it hurt?

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,690
You could have dodged it.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,090
You had time to move out of the way.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,130
And leave you behind?

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,319
From my angle,
I would've only gotten a scratch.

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,199
That's better than

57
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,530
you getting hurt like this.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,130
I didn't even think.

59
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,530
I just knew

60
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,610
I didn't want you to get hurt.

61
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,450
Chenxi!

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,210
Chen Zhiqing

63
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,330
was worried about you.

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,330
He wants you to give him a call.

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,850
I'll leave you two alone.

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,250
That outfit looks great on you.

67
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,050
Chenxi.

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,759
Chenxi.

69
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,599
I heard you got hurt.

70
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,117
- Are you all right? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

71
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:55,879
Thanks for your concern.
Chenxi is fine now.

72
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,650
Mr. Yan, someone's looking
for you outside.

73
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,650
Got it.

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,330
Chenxi.

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,679
You're not hurt, are you?

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,610
I'm fine.

77
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,730
I finished my interview late last night.

78
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,519
I didn't want to disturb your rest.

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,570
Sorry.

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,839
It's all right.

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,519
Lidong saved me.
Thanks to him, I'm fine.

82
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,490
I'm okay.

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,250
As long as you're okay.

84
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,890
You scared me.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,039
No way.

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,970
I can't let this happen again.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,530
I'll pick you up from now on.

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,319
That's unnecessary.

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,850
You don't have to go that far.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,050
Chenxi.

91
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,370
I mean it.

92
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,130
Lidong.

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,530
Are you all right?

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,370
I heard about Chenxi and Chen Zhiqing.

95
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,250
It's okay, Lidong.

96
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,610
I'll always be by your side.

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,090
Yuling.

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,210
There's something I need to make clear.

99
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,210
I've always seen you as a little sister.

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,810
But we're not siblings.

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,810
Let go.

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,319
No.

103
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,330
Let go.

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,690
Yan Lidong.

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,450
What are you doing here?

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,490
Let go.

107
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,890
Fine.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,919
Zhiqing,

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,730
can you run lines with me later?

110
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,490
Sure.

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,730
Let's go.

112
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,090
