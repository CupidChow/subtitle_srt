Have some water.

Thanks.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,850
Are you okay?

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,970
I'm fine.

(Could something
have happened to Mu Chenxi?)

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,090
Where are you going?

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,930
Where's Lidong?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,039
How could he let you
go out alone this late?

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,719
What's wrong?

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,370
Someone is trying to hurt you.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,130
Watch out!

Yucheng!

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,079
Yucheng, are you all right?

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,959
Yucheng!

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,850
Don't move!

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,999
Stay still!

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,690
Mu Chenxi deserves to die!

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,610
She's the one
who kicked Qianqian out of the crew!

Help!

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,399
Somebody help!

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,170
- Call 120!
- I'm calling 120!

37
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:15,719
Hello?

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,559
Someone's injured here!

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,559
Is this 110?

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,690
Stay calm.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,690
Lidong likes you so much.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,250
If he sees you cry...

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,970
It will break his heart.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,410
Yuling, she...

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,890
Yucheng...

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,999
Yucheng!

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,810
Yucheng, wake up!

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,410
Wake up!

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,250
Yucheng!

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,770
Yucheng!

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,330
Stop the bleeding first.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,639
Please, help her.

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,850
Get her on the ambulance.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,999
Dad, what's wrong?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,530
Your sister's in trouble.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,130
Her old illness has relapsed.

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,119
She might not make it this time.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,250
Yeah.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,690
What a pity.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,890
Chenxi.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,039
What's wrong?

62
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,090
What happened?

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,770
Are you hurt?

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,690
I was just walking down the street,

65
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,599
then I ran into Su Yucheng.

66
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,839
And then she said...

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,810
She said someone was trying to hurt me.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,450
Then...

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,530
Then...

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,730
She just...

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,890
I was so scared.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,770
It's all right now.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,170
Don't be afraid.

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,090
Doctor, how is she?

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,970
Yucheng...

76
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,410
Yucheng...

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,250
Yucheng...

78
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,239
Yucheng, don't leave me!

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,410
Yucheng!

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,090
You must be lying to me, right?

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,770
Yucheng...

82
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,050
Yucheng...

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,439
Can you tell us what happened?

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,610
Yucheng...

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,250
Let's talk outside.

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,610
Yucheng...

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,170
Yucheng...

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,730
How were you taking care of Yucheng?

89
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,720
Why did you let her go out alone
in the middle of the night?

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,210
You knew she had a heart condition!

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,090
And you still let her leave alone?

92
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,690
Miss Yucheng

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,250
was worried about Miss Yuling's safety.

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,850
So she followed her out.

95
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,170
I couldn't stop her.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,079
What did you say?

97
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,679
Miss.

98
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,159
Come on, Yuling...

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,759
You...

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,090
You need to stop this, all right?

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,850
What did you just say?

102
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,690
I...

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,330
I said...

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,810
Miss Yucheng

105
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,890
thought you were in danger.

106
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,250
She was worried about you.

107
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,410
So

108
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,330
she ran after you.

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,570
What?

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,210
It's all my fault.

111
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,930
It's all my fault...

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,930
Aunty Zhang.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,570
Leave.

114
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,290
I need to talk to Yuling.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,650
It's all my fault...

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,159
It's because of me.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,090
Su Yuling, what have you done this time?

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,250
It's my fault...

119
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,410
It's all your fault?

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,730
Did you mess with someone out there?

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,250
If it weren't for you...

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,650
Your sister wouldn't have run out
in the middle of the night!

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,530
Your sister has always been obedient.

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,890
She's never caused trouble.

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,130
But you...

126
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,810
Think about it.

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,090
What have you done all these years?

128
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,410
Why...

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,050
Why?

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,610
Why...

131
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,770
Why?

132
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,090
Why wasn't it me who died?

133
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,170
Right?

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,290
Why wasn't it me who died?

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,210
What are you saying?

136
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,610
Yuling...

137
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,210
You're my daughter too.

138
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,679
How could I ever let you die?

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,450
Have you never thought about that?

140
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,610
Crazy...

141
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,370
You're crazy.

142
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,610
I'm crazy?

143
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,810
I am crazy.

144
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,890
I've lost my mind.

145
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,970
I killed my sister.

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,690
It was my fault.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,250
Why?

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,250
Because Mu Chenxi deserved to die.

149
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,690
If I hadn't wanted Mu Chenxi dead,

150
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,730
none of this would've happened.

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,930
It's all my fault.

152
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,399
Why did you do this?

153
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,999
Because Mu Chenxi
was trying to steal Lidong from me!

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,490
Yan Lidong?

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,530
Yan Lidong again?

156
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,370
Do you realise

157
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,530
you killed your sister

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,330
for a man?

159
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,439
Tell me...

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,570
Have you ever seen me as your daughter?

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,519
If you did...

162
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,210
Why did you abandon me again and again?

163
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,010
When have you
ever treated me like your daughter?

164
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,439
In your heart,

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,490
am I worth even less than a stray?

166
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,290
Yuling...

167
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,050
Yuling!

168
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,250
Yuling!

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,319
Aunty Zhang!

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,039
Aunty Zhang, call an ambulance! Hurry!

171
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,199
Quick!

172
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,010
