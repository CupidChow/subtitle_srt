(chasing me relentlessly

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,200
(would I have been
blind enough to marry him?)

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,760
Impossible.

17
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,960
How could this be?

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,280
This can't be true.

19
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,800
Yuling, what's wrong?

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,080
Lidong is married.

21
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,480
Yuling. Yu...

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,960
She's burning up.

23
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,600
Aunty Zhang! Get fever medicine!

24
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,880
Sis.

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,960
It hurts so much.

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,960
One day, you'll find someone
you love even more.

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,160
I only want Lidong.

28
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,960
Yuling.

29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,760
Feelings can't be forced.

30
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,080
(No...)

31
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,480
(Lidong likes me.)

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
(He must have been
forced into marriage.)

33
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,949
Listen, a lot

34
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,349
of big directors will be here soon.

35
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,709
But don't be nervous.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,669
It'll be fine.

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,520
Okay.

38
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,080
Do your best.

39
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,829
Why aren't the leads here yet?

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,709
Chen Zhiqing is a top star.

41
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,760
Why would he come to a dinner like this?

42
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,480
That's true.

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,709
But why isn't Su Yuling here?

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,440
It's not like her.

45
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,080
Who knows?

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,040
Chenxi.

47
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,189
These past two months
have been tough on you. Here's to you.

48
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,880
Looking forward to working with you.

49
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,989
Mr. Sheng.

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,429
Chenxi can't drink tonight.

51
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,760
How about I have a drink
with you instead?

52
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,880
Sure. Let's go.

53
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,440
Ms. Chenxi.

54
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,840
Mr. Zhiqing wants to see you.

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,280
Where is he?

56
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,440
Here.

57
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,800
Guan Tai.

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,160
Where's Mu Chenxi?

59
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,120
Zhiqing, you were looking for me?

60
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,549
Aren't you cold?

61
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm fine.

62
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,720
Be careful not to catch a cold.

63
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,600
Thank you.

64
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,480
Guess why I was late today.

65
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,720
Traffic?

66
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,560
Work-related matters.

67
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,480
No way I could've guessed that.

68
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,840
I have a surprise for you.

69
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,680
Close your eyes for a moment, okay?

70
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,840
Just for a second.

71
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,080
Three.

72
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,360
Two.

73
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,960
One.

74
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,840
All right.

75
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,080
Open your eyes.

76
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,949
You set all this up?

77
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,269
Yeah. Do you like it?

78
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,760
It's beautiful.

79
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,280
Chenxi.

80
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,480
Actually, I...

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,760
I've always regretted

82
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,680
not holding on to you back then.

83
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,800
Can you give me another chance?

84
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,880
Let me stay by your side again.

85
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,680
Sorry, Zhiqing.

86
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,589
This necklace is lovely.

87
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,080
I really like it.

88
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,480
But...

89
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,480
I can't accept it right now.

90
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,109
Why?

91
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,040
You still can't forgive me?

92
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,640
It's not that.

93
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,709
I just don't understand

94
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,080
my own heart yet.

95
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,680
If...

96
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,360
If we hadn't broken up back then,

97
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,880
would we still be together now?

98
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,480
Maybe.

99
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,800
Or maybe not.

100
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,069
Because, Chen Zhiqing...

101
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,680
You were always meant to be a superstar.

102
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,640
Your light

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,920
was never meant for just me.

104
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,269
Yan Lidong, stop drinking.

106
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,709
Hey! You...

107
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,880
How much are you planning to drink?

108
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,160
Guan Tai.

109
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,549
Oh, thank goodness you're here!

110
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,549
He's completely wasted.

111
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,749
I... I'm not drunk.

112
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,600
Why did you drink so much, Lidong?

113
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,960
You finally came to take me home.

114
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,069
All right.

115
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,280
It's okay.

116
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,080
Slow down.

117
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,640
Careful.

118
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,600
Are you comfortable?

119
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,120
Why are you so close to Chen Zhiqing?

120
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,029
Why?

121
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,200
I don't like Chen Zhiqing.

122
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,720
I hate him.

123
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,040
I hate that ring he wears.

124
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,760
I hate how he keeps coming to see you.

125
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,680
And I hate...

126
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,280
Do you like him?

127
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,120
So what if he's your first love?

128
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,520
I had a first love too.

129
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,400
I know.

130
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,560
Your unreachable love.

131
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,720
My unreachable love

132
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,960
is you.

133
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,640
Mu Chenxi.

134
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,880
I like you.

135
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,680
I will never hurt you

136
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,560
like your dead husband did.

137
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,880
