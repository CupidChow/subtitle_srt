Chenxi.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,730
It's me.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,810
It's you.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,050
You scared me.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,599
I was calling over to you over there.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,170
You didn't hear me, that's why I came.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,050
It's alright.

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,399
They said

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,759
You declined the movie

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,850
for me.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,930
Yes.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,050
Did you really?

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,210
Actually, you didn't have to
do this for me. You know me.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,370
I'm just kidding.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,130
Don't believe those rumors.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,799
Don't forget.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,159
I abandoned you

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,610
for my debut.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,719
How could I give up a movie project

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,610
for you?

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,130
That's good.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,290
Let's go.

35
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,390
(Hope for a great start)

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,030
(Misaligned Lovers)

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,719
Look here.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,810
Three, two, one.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,290
Let's hope for a great start.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,540
Where are the clothes for "Misaligned Lovers"?
The male and female leads have arrived.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,839
This one.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,210
Here, give it to me.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,810
Mr. Lidong, and Ms. Chenxi, we still have
three more costumes after this.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,690
I will prepare the costumes
for you two first.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,610
Okay.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,730
Thanks.

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,370
Ms. Chenxi,

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,559
sorry about what happened at the banquet
last time.

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,050
I've been looking for an opportunity
to apologize to you.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,879
I know that you and Mr. Lidong

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,359
are here to take promotional photos.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,010
I bought you coffee.

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,279
Ms. Chenxi.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,370
This is for you.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,730
It's no big deal.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,450
Thank you for your coffee.

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,559
Mr. Lidong.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,450
No, thanks.

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,370
What's wrong?

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,970
What's wrong?

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,679
What happened?

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,410
I was scratched.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,970
Scratched?

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,290
What happened?

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,520
I don't know either.

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,330
This dress has been hanging
in the clothing room. No one has touched it.

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,599
How can you guys miss this?

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,930
- How could there be a needle in this dress?
- A needle?

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,930
Ms. Qianqian, your needle.

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,770
Who asked you to take the needle?

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,810
I...

72
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,239
I have no idea.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,410
Zhao Qian.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,930
It's you again.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,319
It's not me.

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,199
I asked her...

77
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,170
I asked her to get a needle
because my costume was spoiled.

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,559
If you don't believe it

79
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,770
you can take a look.

80
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,210
Look.

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,570
Isn't it

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,570
spoiled?

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,039
There was a hole here just now.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,119
- It really wasn't me.
- What a blatant lie.

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,530
It wasn't me.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,679
Leave this to me.

87
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,090
I will find out the truth.

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,290
- Come with me.
- I really didn't do it.

89
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,410
Are you okay?

90
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,410
Let me take a look.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,439
What's wrong?

92
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,810
Did something happy happen?

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,330
Of course.

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,039
I didn't expect Zhao Qian
to do such a thing.

95
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,490
I don't know what the crew
will do about her.

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,690
I think Zhao Qian might
get kicked out of the crew.

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,450
I don't think so.

98
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,879
Don't you know?

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,319
Mu Chenxi is not an easy target.

100
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,530
Isn't she just a starlet?
What's the big deal with her?

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,439
Didn't you know?

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,359
She was hand-picked by Situ's No. 1,
Mr. Lidong to play this role.

103
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,440
I heard that when Yan Lidong
signed the contract

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,370
he explicitly mentioned
that the female lead must be Mu Chenxi.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,959
What's wrong?

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,690
You've been scowling since just now.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,319
Someone in the crew said

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,810
I can play the lead in this drama
because of you.

109
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,770
That's true.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,359
So when you signed the contract,

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
was specifying me as the female lead
one of the conditions?

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,530
Certainly.

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,170
Are you looking down
on the acting industry?

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,359
Do you know

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,799
how much effort every actor

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,199
puts in for every role?

117
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,480
How can you casually
designate the female lead role?

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,890
But I just want to act with you.

119
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,810
Chen Zhiqing accepting
a small project for you

120
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,330
makes you so happy.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,959
I was just designating you
as the female lead,

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,290
yet you are so angry at me.

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,039
Then I just want to act with you

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,450
What did I do wrong?

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,330
Where are you going?

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,970
I'm going on a walk. Don't follow me.

127
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,290
Yuling, your phone.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,679
Qianqian was kicked out of the crew
because of Mu Chenxi.

129
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,079
I'm going to kill her.

130
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,439
I'm going to kill her.

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,970
Why did you answer my phone?

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,970
Qianqian is so sad.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,439
Where is Mu Chenxi's home?

134
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
Tell me now.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,119
Building 2, Sincere Garden.

136
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,930
What's wrong?

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,330
I'm going to kill her.

138
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,090
I can't let him hurt Mr. Lidong.

139
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,170
Aunty Zhang.

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm worried that Yu Ling
will be in danger out there at night.

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,679
I'll check on her.

142
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,039
Miss.

143
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,770
You can't go, Miss.

144
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,690
Yuling? What's wrong?

145
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,330
Where is Ms. Chenxi?
I'm here to see her.

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,330
She's gone out.

147
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,130
Do you want to wait for her inside?

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,319
