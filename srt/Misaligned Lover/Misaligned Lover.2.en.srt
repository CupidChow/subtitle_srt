Hurry, get inside!
Stay in there. Hide.

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,630
They're here?

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,110
How is my son?

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,069
Mom...

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,390
I'm not your mom!

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,590
Tell Lidong to come out.

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,990
Ms. Lin.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,709
Lidong just had a minor injury.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,269
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,350
He's already resting.

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,469
My son cut ties with me

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,230
because of you.

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,070
Is this how you take care of him?

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,469
I didn't mean for this to happen.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,149
It was just an accident.

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,429
If you starred
in fewer worthless dramas,

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,030
none of this would have happened.

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,949
You were the one
who refused to let me marry Lidong.

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,549
Now you're the one demanding to see him.

33
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,389
What am I to you?

34
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,470
Your family's maid?

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,829
If you had raised your son better,

36
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,549
things wouldn't have gotten
to the point where he cut ties with you.

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,829
You...

38
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,070
Chairman, bad news.

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,870
The company's shareholders
are arguing in the meeting.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,550
I'll let you off today.

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,110
Let's go.

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,670
This is your home?

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,510
Yeah.

44
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,910
You're just a small-time actress.

45
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,350
How do you afford such a big place?

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,910
I...

47
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,030
That's none of your business.

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,710
Your things are in the guest room.

49
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,269
You'll be staying there.

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,190
Don't mess with anything else.

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,589
The groceries were bought

52
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,110
by the housekeeper before.

53
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,630
Throw them out.

54
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,270
They're still good. Why throw them away?

55
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,350
(Didn't expect someone from his background
to actually know how to cook.)

56
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,789
(After things went wrong at home,)

57
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,920
(my mom spent all her time
managing the company.)

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,550
(I was the one who cooked.)

59
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,909
(But...)

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,310
(She was always too busy to eat.)

61
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,110
(I've never heard him
mention this before.)

62
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,150
(He actually looks
kind of cool while cooking.)

63
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Why are you just standing there?
Come eat.

64
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,230
Here.

65
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,790
Seven years of marriage,
and I've never seen you cook.

66
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,190
Eat. It's not poisoned.

67
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,990
So? It tastes pretty good, right?

68
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,790
You can actually...

69
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,070
Cook this well?

70
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,390
Of course.

71
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,589
Since I spent money on you,

72
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,790
I won't let it go to waste.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,709
From now on,

74
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,910
you'll be in charge of cooking.

75
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,470
Say something. I'm talking to you.

76
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,950
Got it, boss.

77
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,789
Eat.

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,590
Mm.

79
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,510
Lidong.

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,550
Lidong.

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,389
Lidong.

82
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,110
Lidong, don't do this.

83
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,630
Lidong.

84
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,709
What are you doing here?

85
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,349
I heard you got hurt, Lidong.

86
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,629
I came to check on you.

87
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,550
How are you feeling?

88
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,869
I'm fine.

89
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,270
Just a minor injury.

90
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,669
Say what you came to say.

91
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,870
Stop getting in the way.

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,550
Chenxi.

93
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,310
I came to talk about my sister.

94
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,509
I used to be neighbors
with Yuling's family.

95
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,150
Her sister, Yucheng, is my best friend.

96
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,670
Come on, let's talk outside.

97
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,990
What about Yucheng?

98
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,349
She hasn't been doing well mentally.

99
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,069
The doctor says she's at risk.

100
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,590
She really wants to see you.

101
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,429
Next week,
my dad will be away on business.

102
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,510
That's your chance to meet her.

103
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,430
Got it.

104
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,390
What happened to you?

105
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,350
Don't you

106
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,390
like me this way, Lidong?

107
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,470
How shameless.

108
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,389
She actually had the nerve to come here.

109
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,669
Who are you talking about?

110
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,710
Who else?

111
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,270
That delicate little Yuling of yours.

112
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,870
She came because of Yucheng.

113
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,389
There's nothing
between Su Yuling and me.

114
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,230
Oh, really?

115
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,389
Then why does she

116
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,950
call you so affectionately?

117
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,470
"Lidong."

118
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,429
Say whatever you want.

119
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,789
Think whatever you want.

120
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,110
I'll just leave, all right?

121
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,110
Hey...

122
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,990
It's snowing.

123
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,630
Didn't you tell me
to leave and never come back?

124
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,829
Why are you looking for me?

125
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,149
I don't want you dying outside

126
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,630
and ruining my reputation.

127
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,830
Let's go.

128
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,310
Go home, take a hot shower,
and don't catch a cold.

129
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,750
Acting like a gentleman.

130
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,470
Why are you in my bed?

131
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,270
I upset you earlier,
so I'm making it up to you.

132
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,429
Come here, beautiful.

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,350
Get down.

134
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,629
Don't say I never cared about you.

135
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,670
I don't need it.

136
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,310
Get out.

137
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,790
Since you bought me,

138
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,070
just call me whenever you need me.

139
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,390
Don't say I don't keep my word.

140
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,509
Get lost and go to sleep.

141
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,160
You're coming with me
to the set tomorrow.

142
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,669
Makeup artist.

143
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,109
Get over here.

144
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,190
Coming.

145
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
Get down!

146
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,589
Late again?

147
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,869
Just by a minute.

148
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,109
This is your first lead role.

149
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,229
Can you take it seriously?

150
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,790
The male lead is Chen Zhiqing!

151
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,910
Over here.

152
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,709
Even one minute late is still late.

153
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,429
Can you stop giving me headaches?

154
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,229
Do you know

155
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,989
how much I've been struggling
for this project?

156
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,829
If you keep this up,

157
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,310
I'll replace you as the lead actress.

158
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,390
Got it.

159
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,629
Chenxi.

160
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,589
Call me

161
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,709
when you're done.

162
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,990
I'll come pick you up.

163
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,350
I'll come pick you up.

164
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,869
Get me a coffee.

165
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,909
Oh, okay, I'll go.

166
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,110
Let him do it.

167
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,230
Got it.

168
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,349
Mr. Yan, this is...

169
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,430
My new assistant.

170
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,269
As expected from you, Chenxi.

171
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,509
Even a CEO like Mr. Yan
is under your spell.

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,910
He has amnesia.

173
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,389
Don't let anyone know.

174
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,390
If his mom finds out, we're done for.

175
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,230
This is bad.

176
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,030
Really bad.

177
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,710
Let's go.

178
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,790
Here.

179
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,550
Hold this for me.

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,990
I got it.

181
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,830
Let him hold it.

182
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,029
Thanks.

183
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,989
