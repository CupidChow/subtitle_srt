(Adapted from
a Himalaya Qiji Literature novel)

00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,140
(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,070
Have you seen the trending topics?

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,310
They say a celebrity
with the surname Zhao has gone missing.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,950
A lot of people
are saying it's Zhao Qian.

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,750
Zhao Qian?

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,099
Why does that name sound so familiar?

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,350
Zhao Qian...

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,830
I remember now.

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,619
Just a few days ago.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,110
That murder case
that caused such an uproar.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,419
That psycho killer...

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,670
Didn't he kill
because he was obsessed with her?

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,379
I read the script.

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,779
This role suits you well.

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,270
Prepare for it properly.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,270
The company
is really invested in this project.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,870
Hold this for me.

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,150
Auntie.

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,990
Thank you.

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,750
What are you thanking me for?

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,259
For the lead role in the project,

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,419
thank you for supporting me.

34
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,470
Do a good job.

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,750
Don't make me regret choosing you.

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,750
Miss Ji.

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,230
You dropped your handkerchief.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,630
Thank you.

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,870
Yan Lidong.

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,590
This is bad.

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,810

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,370
(Surgery in progress)

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,139
What is wrong with you?

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,590
You can't even handle a simple task.

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,670
What else can I trust you with?

46
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,190
What are we going to do
about Lidong now?

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,619
Chenxi.

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,350
Lidong, you're awake.

49
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,910
Does your head still hurt?

50
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't worry.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,640
The person who threw the vase
has been taken away by the police.

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,830
Is he okay?

53
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,299
If he's fine, then hurry to the set.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,259
The director is waiting.

55
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,379
Got it. You go first, I'll be right there.

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,870
Okay, I'll wait for you at the door.

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,910
The set...

58
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,270
I have to go to the set later.
You should rest first.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,630
What's wrong?

60
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,790
I want a divorce.

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,510
Right now.

62
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,979
I'm only nineteen.

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,360
Why would I go to the registry office
with you? To get married.

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,430
How old are you?

65
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,679
Nineteen.

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,410
(Marriage certificate)

67
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,830
What are you doing?

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,139
This thing is useless now.

69
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,470
Keeping it only brings more sorrow.
Might as well burn it.

70
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,710
Mu Chenxi.

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,790
I like you.

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,990
I will never hurt you like your

73
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,790
late husband did.

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,070
Do you understand?

75
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,910
(I lost my memory before.)

76
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,710
Lidong.

77
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,750
What's wrong?

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,590
Nothing.

79
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,750
Cut.

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,499
Lidong.

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,139
You're playing an affectionate
young gentleman in this drama.

82
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,619
Not a domineering CEO.

83
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,179
Put more expression on your face.

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,590
Got it.

85
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,590
All right, get ready.

86
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,339
Three, two, one.

87
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,470
Action.

88
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,070
Cut.

89
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,939
Lidong.

90
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,979
The person in front of you

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,339
is the childhood sweetheart
you grew up with.

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,419
Not some woman trying to seduce you.

93
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,190
You don't have to look so disgusted.

94
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,830
Let's take a thirty-minute break.
We'll continue later.

95
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,779
Good work, everyone.

96
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,659
Here, take this.

97
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,579
Lidong.

98
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,179
This project is very important for you.

99
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,510
You must do well.

100
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,230
What did you call me?

101
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,019
Li... Lidong, why?

102
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,139
(What kind of people
has Xitu Entertainment hired?)

103
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,430
(They have no awareness at all.)

104
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,310
Career downfall, huh?

105
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,539
Come on.

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,470
I'll teach you how to act in this scene.
Go get me a cup of coffee.

107
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,110
What did you say?

108
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,990
Get me a cup of coffee.

109
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,950
Don't tell me you're refusing now.

110
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,110
That's more like it.

111
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,510
Hand it over.

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,579
Even though you're a big star now,

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,139
you shouldn't forget your place.

114
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,030
You're still my assistant.

115
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,019
Now you're even throwing
a tantrum at me.

116
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,179
Have you noticed

117
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,510
that Yan Lidong
has been acting strange lately?

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,310
He's a nineteen-year-old boy, moody.

119
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,390
Drink up.

120
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,030
Thanks.

121
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,539
Zhiqing.

122
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,179
Let's go through the next scene.
I want to do better.

123
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,430
Your acting is already great.
Have confidence.

124
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,939
Don't worry.

125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,230
You'll do just fine.

126
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,390
You

127
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,230
stay away from my woman.

128
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,950
I...

129
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,470
Did you remember something?

130
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,590
No.

131
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,419
I just

132
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,590
got too into the role.

133
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,710
Chenxi.

134
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,179
Have you seen Chenxi?

135
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,419
No.

136
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,339
What do we do now?

137
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,899
No one in the crew can find her.

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,219
We've searched everywhere,
she's nowhere to be found.

139
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,859
- How long has she been missing?
- Three hours.

140
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,240
- Have you checked that side?
- Yes, we searched everywhere.

141
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,030
She's not answering her phone either.
What should we do?

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,670
You

143
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,899
go tell the director,

144
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,939
Mu Chenxi is missing
and need to stop filming. Hurry!

145
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,739
Got it!

146
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,739
Guan Tai. Take everyone
and search for Mu Chenxi.

147
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,670
Make sure to check every corner.
Don't miss a single spot. Hurry!

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,739
Wait...

149
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,350
Yan Lidong, what about you?

150
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,150
Yes, Mr. Yan, I'll start searching now.

151
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,110
Everyone, help search. Check over there.

152
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,990
Got it.

153
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,190
- Chenxi!
- Mu Chenxi!

154
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,139
Chenxi!

155
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,470
- Chenxi!
- Mu Chenxi!

156
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,939
Chenxi!

157
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,910
Any luck?

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,779
No.

159
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,950
- Check over there.
- Mu Chenxi! Where are you?

160
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,699
Mu Chenxi!

161
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,310
Chenxi!

162
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,070
- Chenxi!
- Mu Chenxi!

163
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,990
- Mu Chenxi!
- Chenxi!

164
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,979
Mu Chenxi!

165
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,819
Chenxi!

166
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,979
- Chenxi!
- Chenxi!

167
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,579
Mu Chenxi!

168
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,059
Wait. You go that way.

169
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,000
- I'll check this side. Split up.
- Mu Chenxi!

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,099
Chenxi!
