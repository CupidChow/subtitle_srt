Are the reports ready?

Where's the contract
with Company Lan Ling? Bring it over.

00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,010
Mr. Yan wants to see it.

16

Here, put it down.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,370
Mr. Yan.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,079
In recent years,

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,919
the rapid growth of the film
and television industry...

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,999
In recent years,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,039
as the film
and television market expands,

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,279
various high-quality productions

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,079
and innovative presentation styles

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,010
have captured public attention.

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,450
Yan Lidong! Yan Lidong!

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,279
Oh no.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,730
The Bluetooth earpiece is broken.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,770
What now?

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,879
We need a solution.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,170
Make him fake an illness.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,159
The combination of new technology
with traditional film making

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,810
has attracted a larger audience.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,119
At Western Path Group, our strength...

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,010
No need.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,290
Look.

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
Is our commitment

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,079
to nurturing

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,439
new talents, actors,
and producing content

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,919
that aligns with industry trends.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,090
That is our biggest advantage.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,090
Now, for the next phase, Minister Chen
will provide a detailed explanation.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,599
Where is Mu Chenxi?

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,010
Waiting for you downstairs.

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,010
Are you lying to me?

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,250
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,410
How do I know all those business terms?

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,250
That...

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,479
That must be because
you've watched too many CEO dramas.

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,930
It's stuck in your head.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,610
Really?

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,930
Of course.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,279
But you did great.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,530
The investors were pleased.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,159
Look.

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,330
It's all here.

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,050
Something's not right.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,290
What is it?

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,930
Lidong, what's wrong?

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,730
Are you feeling unwell?

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,690
Yan Lidong.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,130
Yan Lidong!

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,130
Yan Lidong, what's wrong?

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,530
Somebody help!

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,610
Call an ambulance!

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,050
You're awake.

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,810
Take it easy.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,330
How do you feel?
Does your head still hurt?

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,730
Why am I here?

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,119
You collapsed after the event.

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,250
Do you remember?

71
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,010
I fainted?

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,130
I think I saw...

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,759
A lot of people.

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,730
People...

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,130
All right.

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,810
If you can't remember, don't force it.

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,970
What about the client?

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,730
Everything went well.

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,410
That's good.

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,810
I'll call the doctor.

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,250
No need.

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,730
It's just a headache.

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,010
No need for a doctor.

84
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,730
Let's go home.

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,410
Yucheng?

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,730
Yucheng.

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,959
Long time no see.

88
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,530
How have you been? Feeling better?

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,290
It's been a while?

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,159
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,010
I promised to take you
to that art exhibition last time,

92
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,410
but something came up,
and I couldn't make it.

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,010
What exhibition?

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,919
The abstract art one.

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,090
Don't you remember?

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,879
(I've always regretted it.)

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,439
(Back then, I was too afraid)

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,159
(to express my feelings.)

99
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,479
(My nineteenth year
became extraordinary)

100
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,410
(because of her.)

101
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,970
I got it.

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,210
The discharge paperwork is done.

103
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,239
Yucheng.

104
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,970
Which ward are you in?
I'll take you back.

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,050
No need.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,170
I just came out for some fresh air.

107
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,210
I'll head back soon.

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,130
Miss Mu, you're really beautiful.

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,890
Thank you.

110
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,410
I've seen your work on TV.

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,250
Really?

112
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,170
I'll be heading back now.

113
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,730
Bye-bye.

114
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,330
Take care of yourself.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,770
Mu Chenxi.

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,930
What's wrong?

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,810
Why aren't you with Su Yucheng?

118
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,970
Why should I be with her?

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,690
You're

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,890
a great match.

121
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,119
Yucheng has always been in poor health.

122
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,010
I've only ever seen her
as a little sister.

123
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,359
Do you want steak? I can make some.

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,250
No need.

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,730
