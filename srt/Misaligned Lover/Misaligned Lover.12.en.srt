(Adapted from
a Himalaya Qiji Literature novel)

12
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,280
(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,290
Come take a look at these fans.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,330
Have a look.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,770
Third Prince.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,450
She's my father's woman.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,690
Holding her in public
like this is improper.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,770
Show some respect.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,690
Show some respect?

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,890
You're the one who
should be saying that to yourself.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,519
I've already asked
the Emperor for a marriage decree.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,559
Very soon,

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,890
Wan'er will rightfully be my consort.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,679
You've only just requested the decree.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,799
Nothing is final yet.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,890
Third Prince,

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,930
aren't you a little
too sure of yourself?

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,450
General Xiao,

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,970
shouldn't we ask for her opinion?

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,559
Back then, marrying your father

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,450
was just a means to avenge
the blood feud from ten years ago.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,290
But now, the one
I love is the Third Prince.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,330
Wan'er and I love each other.

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,010
Why must you stand in our way?

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,690
Love each other?

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,330
You were just her first love.

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,410
First love knows nothing about love.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,879
You're the one interfering here.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,799
No, Yan Lidong, what's wrong with you?

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,039
You're the one who's got issues.

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,279
We're filming, you know?
You're the one with issues.

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
- You're the one with issues.
- Your brain is broken.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,639
Say that again.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,839
I just did. So what?

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,159
Think I won't hit you right now?

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,330
Come down here.

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,879
Come here.

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,839
Come up here.

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,890
Come down here.

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,570
What are you two doing?

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,079
This is a film set!

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,079
Not the place to settle

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,490
your personal grudges.

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,999
Calm down, Director.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,480
One is Huanxi Entertainment's top star,
the other is Xitu Entertainment's hottest rookie.

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,079
Let's go.

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,559
Come on, everyone, back to positions.
Get ready for the next take.

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,519
- We have to do it all over again.
- Enough already.

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,730
I'm not shooting anymore!

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,730
Cool down, Lidong.

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,170
That's a wrap for today.

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,890
Chenxi.

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,210
Thank you.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,570
I'll practice lines with you again.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,119
Lidong,

66
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,730
can you help me with something?

67
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,450
Do you think this is right for us?

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,930
Mu Chenxi,
are you doing this on purpose?

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,410
And if I am?

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,250
Does it hurt?

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,290
Lidong, I'm fine.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,999
Chenxi. Let's go watch a movie tonight.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,450
Lidong, let's go out for dinner tonight.

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,919
Sure.

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,010
What should we eat?

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,079
Sure.

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,290
What movie are we watching?

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,370
Anything's fine.

79
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,290
Let's go.

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,290
Yeah.

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,570
Wait, what?

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,730
You're not taking the car?

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,010
Go ahead. I'll ride alone.

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,290
Chenxi.

85
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,690
Let's get off.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,730
The movie's about to start.

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,810
Chenxi.

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,770
What did you just say?

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,519
I said the movie is about to start.

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,010
Let's go pick up our tickets.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,570
Can we go another day?

92
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,330
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,730
No, I'm just a little tired.

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,730
Sorry.

95
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,490
It's fine. We'll go another day.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,290
Sorry.

97
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,650
I'll head home now.

98
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,519
Let me take you home.

99
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,730
That's really not necessary.

100
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,930
Be safe.

101
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,599
Lidong.

102
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,050
What are we eating?

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,890
I'm not eating. Go by yourself.

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,839
Weren't you watching a movie?

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,839
Why are you back?

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,130
My phone ran out of battery.
Came back to charge it.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,079
Didn't you say
you were going out for dinner?

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,610
Why are you eating instant noodles?

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,530
I wasn't full.
Just eating a little more.

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,530
Enjoy.

111
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,959
Ms. Lin.

112
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,719
This event is mainly
to introduce Xitu's S+ project.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,599
At the same time,

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,320
it's an opportunity
to promote our rising talents.

115
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,799
All the materials have been compiled
and sent to headquarters.

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,559
Good.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,610
You can handle this as you see fit.

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,010
Ms. Lin.

119
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,890
Mr. Su.

120
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,479
Long time no see.

121
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,890
You're looking great.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,850
I have you to thank for that.

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,679
The company's stock has been soaring.

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,650
How could I not be in a good mood?

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,730
We owe a lot of our success

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,890
to you, Mr. Su.

127
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,210
That's good to hear.

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,439
Now, let me introduce

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,759
our company's

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,050
S+ project.

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,130
They say Mr. Su spoils his daughter,

132
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,599
but I never expected

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,890
he'd let her step into

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,410
this messy industry.

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,519
(Su Yuling)
The project will feature our rising star, Yan Lidong.

136
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
Yan Lidong is one of our company's

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,559
most promising newcomers.

138
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,690
We hope everyone
will keep an eye on him.

139
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,050
Mr. Yan rarely makes public appearances.

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,290
I thought Ms. Lin
was keeping him under wraps.

141
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,970
Mu Chenxi!

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,130
Mu Chenxi!

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,490
Coming.

144
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,810
Mu Chenxi!

145
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,759
Mu Chenxi...

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,559
Ms. Lin.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,570
What's this?

148
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,730
Is this how you're
taking care of my son?

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,959
No...

150
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,879
This project...

151
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,450
Isn't having one actress
in the family enough?

152
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,330
Ms. Lin.

153
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,690
I'd appreciate it
if you could respect my profession.

154
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,439
Besides, you can't even manage your son.

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,890
How could I possibly manage him?

156
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,959
And anyway,

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,199
it was your own
entertainment company that signed him.

158
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
How could a small-time actress
like me do anything about it?

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,599
Stop making excuses.

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,890
What did you say back then?

161
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,759
I'm here to see Lidong.

162
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,810
He's not here.

163
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,239
Isn't he perfectly fine now?

164
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,850
Healthy, lively, eating and drinking well
and even charming delicate little girls.

165
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,719
Had I known you'd be
so indifferent toward Lidong,

166
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,250
I never would've
let you into the Yan family.

167
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,679
For the Yan family to take
in a daughter-in-law like you...

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,919
We must've been cursed in a past life.

169
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,170
You think I wanted
to marry into your family?

170
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,079
If it weren't for your son

171
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,279
sweet-talking me,
chasing me relentlessly,

172
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,730
deceiving me at every turn,

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
would I have been
blind enough to marry him?

174
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,959
What? You married Lidong?

175
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,770
Yes, we've been married for a long time!

176
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,490
Impossible.

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,570
No way.

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,890
This can't be real.

179
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,370
How could Lidong have married her?

180
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,839
Yes, he's doing fine right now,

181
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,879
but in this
chaotic entertainment industry,

182
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,330
can you guarantee
he'll always stay safe?

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,239
What if something happens
one day that triggers him?

184
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,210
What if his condition worsens?

185

Do whatever you want.

196
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,490
I can't control you anymore.

197
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,999
Sorry.
