(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,040
Yan Lidong, you're truly shameless!

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,199
You're calling me shameless?

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,760
How am I shameless?

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,780
Not only did you go to
a hotel with another woman,

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,419
but you've also been hiding
your first love from me for seven years.

18
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,800
Do you think that's fair to me?

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
If I had known this earlier,

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,000
I never would have married you.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Never should have married me?

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,440
Seems like you still can't
let go of your first love, Chen Zhiqing.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,919
What are you talking about?
Is that really what you think of me?

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,240
Isn't it true?

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,520
Fine, great.

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,839
Yes.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,440
I can't stay
in this house another minute.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
What do you mean by that?

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
I want a divorce.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,600
You want a divorce?

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,360
Then let's divorce now.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,079
Mu Chenxi.

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,120
Don't forget, you're still my woman.

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Yan Lidong...

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
Yan Lidong!

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
Don't scare me!

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,440
Yan Lidong!

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Hurry!

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,860
(Surgery in progress)

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
How could this happen?

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
How could this happen?

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,040
Chenxi, have you finished filming?

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,079
Someone saw Yan Lidong

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,559
with another woman.

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,120
At Shimao Hotel.
You should go take a look.

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
Lidong, don't do this.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
Lidong!

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,680
(Yan Lidong.)

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,280
(So this is why you wanted
to keep our marriage a secret?)

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,240
Cheers.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,840
What are you doing? Drinking this much.
Are you trying to kill yourself?

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,880
Is Mr. Yan worried about me,

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,920
or are you afraid I'll live too long

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
and get in the way
of you marrying someone else?

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,399
"I regret it so much.

57
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,559
I should've never let her go back then."

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,399
You read my diary?

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,159
How else would I know?

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,240
It's her, isn't it?

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,960
Your first love is Su Yuling.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Then what were these seven years to you?

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,439
You're drunk.

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,200
We'll talk when you sober up.

65
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,540

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,559

(spotted entering a hotel with a man.)

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,719
(Is she going public
with her relationship?)

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,999
(Is this rising actress
not career-minded at all?)

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,140
(Su Yuling seen returning)
(Right.)

71
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,977
(to a hotel with a man)

72
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,560
Who's that guy next to you?

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,080
It's Lidong.

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,360
What?

75
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,440
Listen to me.

76
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,320
You have to break up with him.

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,840
Why?

78
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
But I really like him.

79
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,839
I want to be with him.

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,600
You can like anyone,

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
just not him.

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Is it because sister like him too?

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,080
I knew it.

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,759
Ever since we were kids,

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,959
everything sister liked

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,920
always became hers.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,119
If back then

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,400
- I were the one with heart disease...
- Shut up!

89
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
You're awake.

90
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Why am I in a hospital?

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,639
I can't be late for class again.

92
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,840
Late?

93
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,960
You're Mu Chenxi, right?

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,560
Drop the act.

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,520
Nothing you say will change this.

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,540
You're going
to the civil affairs office today.

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,119
Why would I go there?

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,200
To get married?

99
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,199
I'm only nineteen.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm not even old enough to get married.

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
How old are you?

102
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,600
Nineteen.

103
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,159
(How could he not remember his own age?)

104
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,960
Could it be...

105
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,080
Do you know who you are?

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
Of course I do.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,639
I'm Yan Lidong.

108
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,919
A freshman studying...

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,800
Ugh, why does that even matter?

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,760
I just hit my head. I'm not stupid.

111
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,000
This is bad.

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,160
Hello, Qi Ming?
Get to the hospital right now.

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Yes, Third Hospital.

114
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,599
Are you saying I'm not nineteen?

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,359
Of course not.

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
You're already twenty-nine. You're my...

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Assistant.

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,839
There's trouble at your home.

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,359
Your mother owes a huge debt.

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,439
To pay it off,

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,840
you sold yourself to me.

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,639
You're lying.

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,680
That never happened.

124
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
Then tell me.
How much does my mom owe you?

125
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,759
A few million.

126
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,320
A few million?

127
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,159
How could
an assistant be worth that much?

128
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,399
I don't believe you.

129
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,719
Of course,
an assistant alone isn't worth millions.

130
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,239
Then what else could it be?

131
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
Unless I...

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,359
It's exactly what you're thinking.

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,400
You...

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,279
Su Yuling's scandal?

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,840
She's always making headlines.

136
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Chenxi, this is bad.

137
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,079
The chairman is coming.

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,160
The chairman?

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,639
What happened?
I told you not to let her find out.

140
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,919
Then what about the chairman...

141
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,960
Just hurry and get
the discharge paperwork done.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,559
Got it.

143
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Go!

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,040
Who is she?

145
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,319
Hurry!

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,999
I can't leave.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
My head isn't fully healed yet.

148
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
Is it really not healed?

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,200
Stop pretending.

150
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,360
Move.

151
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
Wait.

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,040
I may have sold myself to you,

153
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,600
but at the very least,
you have to guarantee my safety.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fine.

155
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,800
Then stay here and wait.

156
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,199
Your mom's debt collectors

157
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,240
just found out you're hospitalized.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,160
They'll be here any minute now.

159
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,320
