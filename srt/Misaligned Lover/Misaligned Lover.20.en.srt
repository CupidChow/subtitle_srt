Dad.

You're awake.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,210
How do you feel?

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,359
Why am I here?

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,210
Did something happen?

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,290
Don't touch.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,610
My head hurts...

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,050
Your head hurts?

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,530
Where's Yucheng?

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,410
Why isn't she here?

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,370
You...

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,410
You don't remember what happened?

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,530
Not even a little?

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,890
Did something happen?

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,570
Doctor.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,519
What's going on?

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
Why has my daughter

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,450
forgotten everything from before?

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,250
She can't remember anything.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,719
Post-traumatic amnesia.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,359
People instinctively forget

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,050
what they don't want to remember.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,079
In cases like this,

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,079
treatment requires medication
and regular psychological counseling.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,210
Only then can she recover.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,650
Thank you, Doctor.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,210
Dad.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,290
Where's Yucheng?

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,690
Why hasn't she been around for days?

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,810
I killed Yucheng.

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,690
It was my fault...

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,999
(I've already lost one daughter.)

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,410
(I can't lose another.)

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,330
Here.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,039
Yuling.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,239
These are your favorite strawberries.

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,679
Come on, have one.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,610
Here.

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,090
Okay, thanks, Dad.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,570
Good girl.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,439
Sir, the strawberries are washed.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,330
Leave them there.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,479
Yucheng.

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,679
These are fresh strawberries
delivered today.

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,719
They're really sweet.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,770
Try one.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,879
Here, for you.

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,879
Thanks, Yucheng.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,450
Eat more, okay?

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,999
Yuling loves sweets.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,050
Let her have them all.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,559
There's plenty.
You should have some too.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,410
Good girl.

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,770
Yucheng, don't leave me.

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,090
Yucheng is dead.

68
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,050
Dad, is Yucheng really dead?

69
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,850
Yucheng is dead.

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,839
No way...

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,130
Yucheng is dead.

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,959
How could she be dead?

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,599
Yuling...

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,359
Come here.

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,410
How could Yucheng be dead?

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,439
It's all right.

77
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,690
Yucheng is dead.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,039
Dad is here. Don't think about it.

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,690
How did Yucheng die?

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,290
No...

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,490
No...

82
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,490
Yucheng.

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,159
Don't do this.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,650
Yucheng!

85
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,490
Yucheng...

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,050
Chenxi.

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,090
What's wrong?

88
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,570
Another nightmare?

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,370
It's all right now.

90
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,650
Don't be afraid.

91
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,810
It's all right.

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,970
I just dreamed of Yucheng.

93
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,410
Was it because of me?

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,079
Did she die

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,450
because of me?

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,399
If I

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,650
hadn't gone out alone that day,

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,210
she wouldn't have died.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,679
No, Chenxi.

100
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,410
This wasn't your fault.

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,730
If anyone's to blame...

102
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,650
It's that crazed stalker fan.

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,650
Get some rest.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,330
When you wake up,
everything will be fine. Okay?

105
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,090
Here.

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,610
Don't go.

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,519
All right, I won't go.

108
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,879
I'll stay here

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,010
with you.

110
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,810
Yucheng.

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,319
Yucheng, are you okay?

112
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,410
Yucheng!

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,970
This is a video taken by a bystander.

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,480
It's already spreading online.

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,999
Mu Chenxi is one of the people involved,

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,290
reporters and influencers
will definitely swarm in.

117
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,040
They want to interview Mu Chenxi
and will definitely gather at the set.

118
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,090
It'll slow down our filming progress.

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,530
How about

120
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,090
we replace her?

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,490
Give me back my social media account.

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,130
All right.

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,210
But you have to promise me
you won't comment on this incident.

124
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,079
Even if the media asks,

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,290
you can only
express sympathy for the victim.

126
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,690
The internet
is full of baseless speculation.

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,119
Mu Chenxi has nothing to do with this.

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,090
Zhiqing.

129
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,039
Forget about everything else,

130
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,050
but not this.

131
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,290
I'm begging you,

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,119
cut ties with Mu Chenxi.

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,759
I've made myself clear.

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,159
That's not happening.

135
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm standing by her.

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,490
Zhiqing.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,279
At this point,

138
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,359
even her former agency
is cutting ties with her.

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,770
Do you really
have to get involved in this mess?

140
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,250
You've seen the news, right?

141
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,330
Yeah.

142
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,130
What they're saying isn't true.

143
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,370
I see.

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,330
Yan Lidong...

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,810
Of course, I believe Mu Chenxi.

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,159
She's definitely not like they say.

147
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,290
But...

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,970
The public reaction
is intense right now.

149
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,410
Look...

150
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,519
For the sake of this project,

151
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,479
should we find someone else?

152
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,330
No.

153
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,130
Lidong.

154
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,279
The company has spent years

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,759
investing so much money and resources.

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,370
Now everything's on hold
because of this.

157
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,650
I can't explain this to the chairman.

158
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,050
Then Mr. Fan
can just get a new male lead.

159
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,479
You think I don't want
to replace the male lead?

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,610
But when it comes down to it,
it's all because of you.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,210
