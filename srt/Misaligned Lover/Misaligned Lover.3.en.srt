(Written by Xiang Bei, author

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,070
Chenxi, long time no see.

14
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,230
Long time no see.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,429
I never expected you

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,350
to take on this drama.

17
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,629
I accepted this role

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,030
because you're the lead.

19
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,429
I'm heading to makeup. See you later.

20
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,150
Mm.

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,829
Hey handsome, can I get your contact?

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,029
Here's my card.

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,430
And mine too.

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,269
Sure.

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,520
Let's add each other on WeChat.

26
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,430
(Flirting everywhere he goes.)

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,630
Here.

28
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,510
Scan this.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,550
Yan Lidong.

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,029
Come here, I need the script.

31
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,829
Thanks.

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,550
Isn't the script on your desk?

33
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,750
I...

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,510
Hold it for me. I need to read it!

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,390
Let's add WeChat first.

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,950
Let's go.

37
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,749
Hey handsome.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,070
Interested in debuting?

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,589
Director, bad news.

40
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:26,949
Zhu Yi...

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,670
Zhu Yi got into a minor car accident.

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,920
Why did this have to happen
at such a critical moment?

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,909
The second male lead has a big role.

44
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,389
If we cast someone last-minute,

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,950
we won't have enough time.

46
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,830
This...

47
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,109
Mu Chenxi's assistant.

48
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,150
Let him try.

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,229
Chen... Chenxi!

50
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,189
Mr. Yan just got dragged into acting!

51
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,389
If the chairman finds out,

52
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,789
we're doomed.

53
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,909
When did this happen?

54
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,190
Just now.

55
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,190
Your Highness.

56
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,990
Princess.

57
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,030
Your Highness.

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,670
Your Highness.

59
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,110
Why are you so foolish?

60
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,030
Because I promised you

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,270
I would always protect you.

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,190
(Acting with Yan Lidong)

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,110
(isn't so bad.)

64
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,910
Third Prince.

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,790
Wan'er, why are you here?

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,269
I heard you're leaving for battle today.

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,670
I came to see you off.

68
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,429
This is a protection charm

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,390
I got for you at Huguo Temple.

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
Then I'll keep it with me every day.

71
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,230
It's cold outside. Go back now.

72
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,709
They look so good together.

73
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,030
Yeah, they do.

74
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,470
What are you doing?

75
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,309
What did you promise me?

76
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,110
I told you to stay away
from the Third Prince.

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,230
Yet here you are, giving him a charm.

78
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,230
That desperate for his attention?

79
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,749
Whatever he can give you,

80
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,150
I can too.

81
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,549
Don't think I don't know

82
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,390
who you really are.

83
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,830
Cut.

84
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,590
Great performance.

85
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,110
Chenxi.

86
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,789
A new restaurant just opened nearby.

87
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,470
Want to grab a bite together?

88
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,349
Sure, I'm actually a bit hungry.

89
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,469
Let's go now.

90
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,430
Mm.

91
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,389
You go do your thing.

92
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,870
We're having a private dinner.

93
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,350
Let's go.

94
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,310
It's been so many years.

95
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,349
I still think

96
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,110
about our college days.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,389
Look.

98
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,870
This character is written so...

99
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,990
Back then,

100
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,910
things were really great.

101
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,310
What's so great about him?

102
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,589
Isn't he just an overhyped

103
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,470
celebrity?

104
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,109
And saying he took this role for you.

105
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,070
Do you actually believe that nonsense?

106
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,670
I haven't kept in touch for so long,

107
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,390
I feel like I missed out on a lot.

108
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,750
It's all in the past.

109
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,790
I ordered your favorite steak.

110
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,870
Try it.

111
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,670
Not good.

112
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,110
This one's pretty good.

113
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,830
What are you doing here?

114
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,670
I'm here to test for poison.

115
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,790
This one's safe.

116
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,229
Chenxi.

117
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,629
Mm?

118
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,630
I also ordered your favorite cake.

119
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,190
Waiter.

120
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,030
Enjoy.

121
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,670
Try it.

122
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,950
It's good.

123
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,070
You're really not holding back, huh?

124
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,710
Why should I?

125
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,190
You guys don't need to, either.

126
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,550
Eat up.

127
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,870
Everyone full?

128
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,229
So full.

129
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,549
You ate most of the food.

130
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,870
Of course you're full.

131
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,950
I'm starving.

132
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,429
(CEO or not,)

133
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,150
(in the end, he still listens to me.)

134
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,390
Here, your meal.

135
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,390
I'll eat.

136
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,070
Eat up. Keep testing for poison.

137
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,590
I can't eat anymore.

138
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,030
You're full?

139
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,630
It's bland.

140
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,310
