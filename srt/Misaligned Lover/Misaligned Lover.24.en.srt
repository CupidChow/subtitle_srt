00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,140
(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,710
Dear, let's go home.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,499
Who's your dear?

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,710
You, of course.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,470
You burned our marriage certificate,
and you still call me your dear?

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,590
Then let's get married again.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,750
I won't agree.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,910
What will it take for you to say yes?

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,939
Unless you tell me right now,

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,659
what else you're hiding from me.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,710
Nothing.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,739
I did go to the hotel with Su Yuling.

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,379
But I was completely drunk that night.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,579
I swear on my life

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,870
nothing happened between us.

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,670
Why are you here?

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,350
Why am I here?

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,070
Lidong.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,219
You're the one
who wanted to come to the hotel.

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,099
That's impossible.

32
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,950
Why would I come here with you?

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,590
Lidong.

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,110
Don't leave tonight, okay?

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,739
Yuling. I've always
seen you as a little sister.

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,470
Nothing more.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,979
Little sister?

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,310
How could that be?

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,950
You clearly likes me.

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,870
The person I like

41
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,590
has always been Chenxi.

42
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,790
Not this.

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,710
That's not what you meant?

44
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,819
Then there's nothing else.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,779
Really?

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,630
Really.

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,819
If I could go back to being nineteen,

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,939
I would never let go of her hand.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,150
Who are you talking about, Yan Lidong?

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,510
Obviously you.

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,030
As if I'd believe you.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,270
I bet you didn't even
finish reading the diary.

53
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,630
Your name is written at the end.

54
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,670
Miss Mu Chenxi.

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,750
Can you give me another chance?

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,990
Let's go back to being part
of each other's lives.

57
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,299
I can.

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,110
But I have some conditions.

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,910
Name them.

60
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,670
Marry me again.

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,030
Of course.

62
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,499
Oh my God.

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,870
Chenxi looks stunning.

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,470
So beautiful.

65
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,870
Chenxi, I'll step out for a bit.

66
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,910
You look amazing.

67
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,339
I've imagined what you'd look like
in a wedding dress.

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,350
You're even
more beautiful than I imagined.

69
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,470
I'm sorry, Zhiqing.

70
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,219
Everything was a mess back then.

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,179
So...

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,619
I never got the chance to tell you

73
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,539
that Lidong and I were already married.

74
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,179
This was all my fault.

75
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,870
If only I hadn't...

76
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,910
Forget it.

77
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,350
There's no point talking about it now.

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,830
Besides,

79
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,099
I admit defeat to Yan Lidong.

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,939
He loves you more than I ever could.

81
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,870
You'll be happy with him.

82
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,150
Mu Chenxi.

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,430
As long as you're happy, that's enough.

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,430
A wedding gift.

85
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
Just

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,870
a token from a friend.

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,890
(Three years later)

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,310
Come on.

89
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,550
Look.

90
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,950
How about this one?

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,710
Look at this.

92
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,390
So cute.

93
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,750
This one.

94
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,830
Visiting hours are over.

95
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,750
All right, I know.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,790
Yuling.

97
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,270
Be good, okay?

98
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,310
Dad will visit you again in a few days.

99
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,990
There.

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,870
Don't cry.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,859
For such a big CEO,

102
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,470
you can't even comfort a child?

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,779
Baby, don't cry.

104
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,150
There.

105
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,499
See? No more tears.

106
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,710
You stopped crying
