13
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,649
What are you doing?

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,780
Stay away!

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,420
Don't come near me.

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,820
Qianqian.

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,740
You wanted her to suffer.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,460
I locked her in the warehouse.

19
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,580
But she ran away.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,649
I really didn't mean to.

21
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,900
Qianqian, please don't be mad at me.

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,329
You kidnapped Mu Chenxi?

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,329
Why?

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,860
Because you don't like her.

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,980
What does that have to do with you?

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,529
Why would you do this?

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,969
Anyone you dislike, Qianqian,

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,020
I will get rid of them.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,740
Are you insane?

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,580
Why is Qianqian ignoring me?

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,780
What did I do wrong?

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,740
She's not ignoring you.

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,169
There are too many people here.

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,129
She's just shy.

35
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,180
Really?

36
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,580
Of course.

37
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,689
She told me herself.

38
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,020
She appreciates you
teaching people a lesson for her.

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,700
Did Qianqian really say that?

40
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,849
Of course.

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,180
Why would I lie to you?

42
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,849
Do you remember

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,700
what the person you
locked up last time looked like?

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,580
I do.

45
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,180
We can work together.

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,180
Do you not want to take this film?

47
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,569
You looked distracted
when meeting the director.

48
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,860
You have other thoughts?

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,380
I just don't think this role suits me.

50
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,220
It's too similar to
what I've played before.

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,300
You've let Mu Chenxi cloud your judgment.

52
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,249
That's not what I meant.

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,049
I just think it'd be
a waste to turn it down.

54
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,289
It's a great opportunity.

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,740
The director clearly
has his eyes on awards.

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,329
I always thought

57
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,129
you were ambitious.

58
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,580
I never expected...

59
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,780
Ambition?

60
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,769
What do I have to do

61
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,980
to be worthy of my ambition?

62
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,140
I've been in this industry for ten years.
Have I ever stopped for a moment?

63
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm just tired.

64
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,900
I want to take a break.

65
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,860
I just want

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,409
a light left on for me

67
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,940
in this city.

68
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,500
Thank you for tonight.

69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,340
It's cold, isn't it?

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,249
The temperature drops at night.
You might catch a cold.

71
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,540
I'll make you some ginger tea.

72
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,020
I just need some sleep.

73
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,769
I'll head up first.

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,580
All right. Get some rest.

75
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,780
You're here.

76
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,329
Did you call me for something?

77
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,169
Yuling.

78
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,169
My friend brought back

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,740
some limited-edition bags from overseas.

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,500
I thought this one would suit you.

81
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,700
I brought it just for you.

82
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,260
You have something else
to ask, don't you?

83
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,289
It's just...

84
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,729
My last project ended a while ago.

85
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,060
I don't have anything new lined up.

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,529
So I wanted to ask,

87
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,500
does your new drama
need a supporting actress?

88
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,700
I know this puts you in a tough spot.

89
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,740
If it's inconvenient for you...

90
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,580
I don't have
any open roles in my project.

91
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,529
But as far as I know,

92
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,169
Xitu Entertainment
is working on a major S+ project.

93
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,100
They probably need
a lot of supporting roles.

94
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,809
I know about that one.

95
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,969
But with my current standing,

96
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,660
I doubt I have a chance.

97
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,729
Landing a third or fourth lead
might be difficult.

98
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,569
But for smaller roles,

99
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,889
I can ask around for you.

100
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,009
Really?

101
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,889
Of course.

102
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,580
It's nothing to make such a fuss over.

103
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,100
That's great.

104
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,180
Mu Chenxi, it's time to eat.

105
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,649
Come on, get up.

106
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,100
We have to go to the company later.

107
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,300
Mu Chenxi?

108
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,209
Mu Chenxi?

109
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,380
What's wrong?

110
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,500
You're burning up.

111
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,940
You have a fever.

112
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,180
Lidong.

113
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,260
You're back.

114
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,780
I'll make you something to eat.

115
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,820
(She's never called me that before.)

116
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,180
(And she's never cooked for me.)

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,260
Drink some water.

118
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,980
Get some rest.

119
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,689
You're awake.

120
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,780
How do you feel?

121
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,620
Much better.

122
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,849
I cook some porridge.

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,860
Have some.

124
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,700
You cook it?

125
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,780
Let me do it.

126
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,820
Since when do you cook for me?

127
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,660
I cooked?

128
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,129
I never cooked before.

129
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,220
Wasn't it always you who did the cooking?

130
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,260
Really?

131
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,769
Hello?

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,809
My little lady,

133
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,200
why did you take so long to answer?

134
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,480
The new project has been officially announced.
The script reading schedule is set.

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,729
- Get ready.
- I'm sorry.

136
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,820
I'll be right there.

137
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,420
Why is the second male lead
still unconfirmed?

138
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,900
I heard it's because no big names
want to play second to a rookie.

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,200
And the smaller names aren't
good enough for the production.

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
They've been through
several rounds of auditions.

141
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,780
That's tricky.

142
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,940
That's not going to be easy.

143
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,860
Sorry, everyone. I'm late.

144
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,489
Did I see that right?

145
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,089
Superstar Chen Zhiqing

146
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,180
is joining our project
as the second male lead?

147
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,689
Hello, everyone.

148
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,460
I'm Chen Zhiqing,
