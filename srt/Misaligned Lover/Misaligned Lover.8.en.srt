You don't want steak?

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,170
I'll go get you something else.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,610
I'm heading out.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,170
I'll be right back.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,890
Hello?

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,890
Hubby, what are you doing?

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,250
Go film somewhere else, I'm working.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,439
He's always like this.

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,610
So serious when he's working.

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,599
Zhiqing, what are you doing here?

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,719
I'm filming nearby.

24
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,210
Thought I'd drop by and see you.

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,170
Is this for me?

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,319
Thanks.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,530
I'll take it inside for you.

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,370
Sure.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,850
Fate has brought us together again.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,850
This time, I won't let you slip away.

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,370
Will you give me another chance?

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,159
Zhiqing...

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,919
Get out.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,170
You're not welcome here.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,039
Is this something
an assistant should be doing?

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,490
Why don't you ask her
what our relationship really is?

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,090
Chenxi.

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,250
I promise you'll get what you want.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,450
Don't worry.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,450
All I want is Yan Lidong.

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,850
I can't hurt Chenxi.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,850
Do you really think

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,730
Yan Lidong is just her assistant?

44
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,250
What do you mean?

45
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,210
They're in a relationship.

46
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,879
Explain yourself.

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
What exactly is your relationship?

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,439
What's wrong with you?
Throwing a fit in front of others.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,690
I'm throwing a fit?

50
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,639
I went out for groceries,
and you bring another man home.

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,170
And you say I'm overreacting?

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,330
Is that your business?
You're just my assistant.

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,290
Get up, breakfast is ready.

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,490
Last night, I was in the wrong.

55
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,450
I shouldn't have let you go hungry.

56
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,330
I've already apologized for it.

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,690
Let's just move on.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,530

59
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,970

64
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,010
Why are you touching my stuff?

65
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,399
You're married?

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,290
Give it back.

67
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,559
You're married,
yet you still paid for me?

68
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,850
Is your industry always this messy?
Mu Chenxi.

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,450
Why are you...

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,330
Where's your husband?

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,039
You're keeping a man,

72
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,130
and he doesn't care?

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,679
Like he has the right to say anything.

74
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,279
He's always

75
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,050
had someone else in his heart.

76
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,519
Yet he still tricked me,

77
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,439
sweet-talked me into marriage.

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,799
Seven years of marriage,

79
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,839
I gave him my all.

80
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,890
And what did he do?

81
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,079
He took another woman to a hotel.

82
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,199
Compared to him,

83
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,370
what I did is nothing.

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,490
Your husband is a real piece of work.

85
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,559
Where is he?

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,320
- I'll go beat him up for you.
- He's dead.

87
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,370
Dead?

88
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,399
How did he die?

89
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,239
Lover's suicide.

90
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,530
