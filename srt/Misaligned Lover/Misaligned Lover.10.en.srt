(Written by Xiang Bei, author
of Heard You Got a Dog Outside? Divorce!)

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,139
Now, let me introduce

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,619
our company's newest talent.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,859
Yan Lidong.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,870
Please welcome him.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,099
There he is.

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,179
That's Yan Lidong?

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,630
So it's him.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,539
Since Lidong joined our company,

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,499
he has gained a lot of attention.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,480
- Everyone is looking forward to...
- This is bad.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,819
Lidong is one
of our company's key artists.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,899
Moving forward,

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,499
he will be making his debut as an actor.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,270
Yan Lidong, step down.

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,630
- We hope everyone will support him.
- Step down.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,299
What?

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,310
Ms. Peng.

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,019
The press conference is already happening.
The project has been announced.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,379
Whether you like it or not,

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,579
there's no turning back.

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,299
But I...

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,059
No buts.

35
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,670
Take her away. Hurry.

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,419
Take her away.

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,099
Chenxi.

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,339
Lidong will receive
full support for his career.

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,219
Not just in acting.

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,099
That's more like it.

41
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,779
There will also be endorsements.

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,910
And plenty of business activities.

43
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,219
Chenxi, what do we do now?

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,259
What do we do?

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,670
The press conference has started.

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,219
Yan Lidong's debut

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,699
is definitely going to trend.

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,779
If the chairman sees it...

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,070
No way.

50
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,430
We can hijack the trending topic.

51
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,230
Hijack it?

52
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,630
How?

53
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,310
Hello?

54
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,619
Our company's upcoming project

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,379
will feature our new actor, Yan Lidong.

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,430
We've even tailored
several major productions just for him.

57
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,699
Chen Zhiqing made it public.

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,899
- With Mu Chenxi...
- And co-directed

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,200
- Who's Mu Chenxi?
- with several others

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,880
- Third female lead in "My Adorable Consort."
- famous director.

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,939
- Her? I barely remember her.
- A top star going public...

62
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,200
- This is the hottest topic right now.
- Let's go.

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,400
(Yan Lidong, Male Lead in "Misaligned Love")
Everyone...

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,190
Where are them going?

65
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,030
Mu Chenxi and Chen Zhiqing went public.

66
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,259
What?

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,699
Who?

68
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,830
Mu Chenxi and Chen Zhiqing...

69
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,630
It's fine.

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,619
Miss Mu Chenxi,

71
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,219
how did you and Chen Zhiqing meet?

72
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,019
Miss Mu Chenxi,

73
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,110
are you aware
of Chen Zhiqing's social media post?

74
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,179
Miss Mu Chenxi,

75
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,579
how long have you two been dating?

76
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,939
Could you please answer?

77
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,739
Miss Mu Chenxi...

78
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,819
Say something.

79
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,230
Just one more word.

80
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,310
I need to talk to you.

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,070
Can't you see I'm in an interview?

82
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,630
I need to talk to you.

83
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,550
Please answer the question.

84
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,739
Sorry, everyone.

85
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,779
That's all for today.

86
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,459
Miss Mu Chenxi!

87
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,219
Please don't leave.

88
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,110
Could you answer just one question?

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,350
What's going on
between you and Chen Zhiqing?

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,419
You saw the news.
Why ask when you already know?

91
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,950
Do you even know that I...

92
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,499
Forget it. I wish you and him
a happy life together.

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,859
You... You have the nerve to blame me?

94
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,419
If it weren't for your mess,
would I have had to do this?

95
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,430
My mess?

96
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,819
Do you think I dragged you away

97
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,979
because I ruined
your public display of affection?

98
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,630
Who are you to judge me?

99
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,590
Yeah.

100
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,630
Who am I to judge you?

101
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,830
After all,
our relationship is just business.

102
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,110
Yan Lidong.

103
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,019
Hello?

104
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,099
Where did you go?

105
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,550
Your scene is coming up.

106
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,859
Sorry.

107
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,910
I'm coming now.

108
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,230
Come here.

109
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,219
Chen Zhiqing, are you out of your mind?

110
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,830
How could you announce your relationship
on social media?

111
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,859
Most of your fans
see you as their boyfriend.

112
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,030
You're going to lose
a huge number of them.

113
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,550
I didn't announce anything.

114
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,099
I only said Mu Chenxi was my first love.

115
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,259
How is that any different?

116
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,499
Look at what's trending right now.

117
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,379
Tell me,

118
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,339
was it worth it for a nobody actress?

119
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,430
Yes.

120
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,230
Sorry.

121
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,659
I'm with Zhiqing.

122
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,830
I'll talk to him.

123
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,430
Thanks for earlier today.

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,230
It's fine.

125
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,230
I was in a hurry.

126
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,030
I didn't get to explain over the phone.

127
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,590
It doesn't matter.

128
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm just glad I could help.

129
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,250
(Maybe that's why
first love is unforgettable.)

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,619
(So it wasn't an official announcement)

131
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,430
(but just reminiscing about first love.)

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,630
(It's all in the past now.)

133
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,630
Why isn't she home yet?

134
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,490
(Yan Lidong)

135
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,219
Hello?

136
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,350
Hey, Guan Tai.

137
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,859
Have you seen Mu Chenxi?

138
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,230
She's not home yet?

139
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,630
No.

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,230
Aside from the company and set,
where else does she usually go?

141
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,830
She doesn't go anywhere else often.

142
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,030
Where did you last see her?

143
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,510
On set. She was with Chen Zhiqing.

144
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,710
Chenxi left a while ago.

145
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,670
She's still not home.

146
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,470
Mu Chenxi!

147
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,110
Mu Chenxi!

148
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,590
(This belongs to Chenxi.)

149
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,910
(She must be nearby.)

150
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,710
