1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,400
Don't be afraid.

2
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,560
What if my brother finds out?

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
what should I do?

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,170
Yuan Yuan, don't worry.

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,920
Your brother

6
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,880
will never blame you for this.

7
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,450
The one who took the photo is wrong.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,960
Don't worry.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
In our hearts,

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,120
you are always

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
the kindest and cutest Yuanyuan.

12
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
Don't be afraid.

13
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,840
Yuan Yuan.

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,520
Tell me.

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Did your boyfriend do it?

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
What does he want?

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,080
Did he threaten you with this?

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,160
Since when?

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,320
On my birthday.

20
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
[Meanwhile,] [The school has emergency psychotherapy service.] [The school emphasized that]

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,000
[to become more and more discouraged.] to cooperate with the police for further investigation.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,160
[and became more and more discouraged.] and expressed that they will cooperate with the police for further investigation.

23
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
Actually,

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
after Yuan Yuan died,

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
I've been looking for Mr. A.

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,680
Yuan Yuan told me about Mr. A a long time ago.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
I didn't call the police

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,970
because I didn't want to irritate her.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,920
I want to wait for her

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,200
until Christmas Eve.

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,220
Yuan Yuan told me she wanted to see me.

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,960
and promised to tell me who Mr. A is.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
But...

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,000
So on Christmas Eve,

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,079
on Christmas Eve.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
Why were you there

37
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
why were you there?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Yuling, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,360
I still can't accept myself as dirty as I am now.

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,090
You and your brother are right.

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,800
I know nothing about the world.

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,400
That's why I deserve to meet someone like him.

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
This kind of thing...

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,620
I made an appointment with him at Hadeok Apartment.

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,290
I tried to persuade him to turn himself in.

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,800
After all, we loved each other once.

47
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,800
But what he said made me understand

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
I brought this upon myself.

49
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't deserve your love.

50
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,960
Everything started from this day.

51
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
What if my brother finds out?

52
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,520
what should I do?

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
Until Christmas Eve

54
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,860
Yuan Yuan told me she wanted to see me.

55
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,930
and promised to tell me who Mr. A is.

56
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Ling, I'm sorry.

57
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,960
I still can't accept myself as dirty as I am now.

58
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
I have to go back to October 20

59
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
to find Mr. A.

60
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,080
Starting today, the original code experiment is suspended.

61
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,560
Why?

62
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
After these experiments,

63
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,160
we have more and more data.

64
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,640
Professor, stop struggling.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,650
Mr. Li already knows that you're in the hospital.

66
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
I heard that from the second experiment,

67
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
you encountered accidents several times in the primitive code,

68
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,890
You even went to the hospital once.

69
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,520
Simu.

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
If scientific research

71
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,320
is at the cost of human health and life,

72
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,840
Then I'll think about the feasibility of this project.

73
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,400
No, sir.

74
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,240
Stop it.

75
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
It's decided.

76
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,120
Looks like he's determined to stop you.

77
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
About me going to the hospital.

78
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,120
Who told you that?

79
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
It's definitely not me, Professor.

80
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
