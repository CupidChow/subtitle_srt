1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,880
Emotional manipulation.

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
They said she had a breakup

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,980
and couldn't handle the blow,

4
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
so she dropped out and went abroad.

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm guessing Yang Caiyun

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,260
is likely Mr. A's ex-girlfriend.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,520
No wonder

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,900
whenever Mr. A is mentioned around Yang Man,

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,560
she gets so agitated.

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,000
We can't disturb her now.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,760
Senior,

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,500
don't we have any other way to investigate Mr. A?

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,560
He not only shared intimate photos of his girlfriend in group chats.

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,520
And there's this too.

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,289
Come out, give us

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:33,920
a chance!

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
He also abused animals.

18
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,580
Five years ago he studied at Yan University.

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,130
He was already an animal killer back then.

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,840
I believe this Mr. A

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,720
will surface very soon.

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,840
Senior,

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,360
we should pay a visit to Yan University.

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,240
I think before going to Yan University,

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,460
you should apologize to a lady first.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,980
A sincere apology requires genuine effort,

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,660
bringing flowers and gifts and apologizing in person -

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,170
that's what shows true sincerity.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,240
What's this all about?

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,840
I asked the flower shop owner,

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,680
and they said women

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,080
all like these kinds of flowers.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,960
Actually,

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,580
I came to apologize to you.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,400
Apologize?

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Everyone has their own privacy,

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,240
and if there are things you don't want to talk about,

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,970
there must be reasons for that.

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,920
I admit I shouldn't have pressured you.

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,090
Don't worry,

41
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,079
I won't ask about your past anymore.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,480
Actually,

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,640
I thought you wanted to keep asking.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
After all,

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,840
it's related to your sister's death.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,930
I'll go wash my hands first.

47
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Everyone's psychological tolerance

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
has a threshold.

49
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,170
If that threshold is exceeded,

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,240
different people choose different ways to release their emotions.

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,640
For example, people with depression might choose suicide or self-harm.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,170
Sadists choose to release through violence.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
The development of sadistic tendencies

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,680
is often related to their original family

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,210
or childhood experiences.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,920
These are the files of all previous graduates.

57
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
Teacher Gu, Professor Liang.

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,880
These are all students' private information,

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,540
so I'll have to ask you to look through them here.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,560
Please understand.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
We understand.

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
Thank you for your help, teacher.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,880
Why don't you go attend to your other duties,

64
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,940
we can look through these ourselves.

65
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm quite familiar with the school and student situations.

66
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
Who exactly are you looking for?

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Perhaps I can help.

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
It's like this, Teacher Fan,

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
five years ago

70
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
Yang Caiyun was in her first year of graduate school.

71
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
This person

72
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,420
was Yang Caiyun's ex-boyfriend.

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,540
He must meet the following criteria:

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
a student at Yan University,

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
in the same year as Yang Caiyun or

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,880
up to two years ahead,

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,280
a graduate student between first and third year.

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
His family situation is quite unusual,

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,320
either his parents are divorced

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,380
or one of his parents has passed away.

81
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,090
He grew up in a controlling and repressive environment.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
He seems kind and easy to get along with.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,920
He even excels academically at school

84
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,560
and is well-liked by classmates and teachers.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
But all of this

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,240
is just his disguise.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,160
He disguises himself very well.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,920
Only occasionally, when he loses control,

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,600
does he reveal extreme thoughts to others.

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,720
For instance,

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,420
being violent toward small animals.

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Professor Liang,

93
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,120
I do have a former student

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,290
who fits these conditions perfectly.

95
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's go camping tomorrow.

96
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
I heard there's a new photo spot

97
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,080
where you can take really nice pictures.

98
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,740
You all go ahead, I won't join.

99
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
Hey, Yuanyuan,

100
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,960
don't be sad anymore.

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Teacher Yue is a busy person.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm not.

103
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,240
Forget it, let's talk tomorrow.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
I have something to do, I'll go first.

105
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
Are you coming back tonight?

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,640
What are you talking about? Of course I'm back.

107
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,570
I'm leaving now.
