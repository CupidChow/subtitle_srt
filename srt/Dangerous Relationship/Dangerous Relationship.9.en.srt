1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Liang Simu, are you crazy?

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,560
It's a deal then.

3
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,810
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

4
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
I'll wait for you downstairs.

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Are you going to celebrate your birthday with Mr. Liang?

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,620
Maybe another day.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,879
What do you mean?

8
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,040
I won't live with him.

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,400
But you just said

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,480
I lied to him.

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
He was so arbitrary.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,820
I thought he could change.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,320
He just can't change.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,960
He wants to celebrate his birthday with me.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,120
Do I have to say yes?

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,080
I won't. Let's go.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,960
Someone is buying tonight.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll take you to a free dinner.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,120
Who's buying?

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,080
Mr. Liang.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,400
Don't mention him.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
He's another childhood friend.

23
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,680
I feel sorry for Mr. Liang.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,200
Got it.

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,340
Where's Yuanyuan?

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,920
Where did you take Yuan Yuan?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,079
Your own sister

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
came to ask me.

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,160
Who are you?

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll ask you again.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,200
Where is Yuan Yuan? Or I'll call the police.

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,960
Yuan Yuan, Liang Si Yuan.

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
You know her?

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Isn't it her birthday today?

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,400
Ling promised to celebrate her birthday today.

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
but she couldn't attend a business dinner.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,640
I can't go.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
I booked a Korean restaurant for her.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,440
She's celebrating her birthday with her sisters.

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
Why are you talking so much to him?

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
You didn't celebrate her birthday?

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,960
Where is the restaurant?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,360
Where is the restaurant?

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,570
Did something happen to Yuan Yuan?

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,050
I'll take you there.

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Yunling.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,880
The commercial dinner tonight is very important.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
All brands are here.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,700
I'll go back when I find Yuanyuan.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
Bye.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,400
When did she leave?

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
I booked it for her the whole night.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
She just left.

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,000
The three girls said

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
dorm curfew or something.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,020
I need to go back to school.

58
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,970
Yuan Yuan had an accident tonight.

59
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,920
But now Yueling is with me.

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,640
If I didn't come,

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
in order to attend the party,

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,290
to attend Yuan Yuan's birthday party.

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,000
So the person who took her private photos tonight

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
is not Ling.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Lingling is not Mr. A at all.

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,260
Did I find the wrong person

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
from the beginning?

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,760
You were so anxious just now.

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,320
Did something happen to Yuan Yuan?

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,680
I can't reach her.

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
What's the problem?

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
If Lingling is not Mr. A,

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,240
who is Mr. A?

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,920
How could Uncle Liang and Aunt Xu have such a freak?

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,260
Liang Simu, watch out!

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,300
Liang Simu, watch out!

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
How are you?

78
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Professor Liang, I can't stop him.

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
I'm really sorry.

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,360
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,240
I had a dream.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,640
that

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,050
you disappeared in front of me.

84
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
You two talk. I'll go buy breakfast.

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Stop looking.

86
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
Childish.

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,120
Tell me.

88
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,570
Why did you go to the lab in the middle of the night?

89
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,360
Tell me first.

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,440
Since your primitive code experiment,

91
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
I've become mysterious.

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
I dream every day.

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,200
You said it was a dream, right?

94
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
It's so real.

95
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,520
It's like

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,060
experience it myself.

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
I dreamed

98
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,240
you had a car accident in front of me.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Then you...

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,240
disappeared.

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Professor Liang.

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,620
Why don't you explain?

103
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Could it be... The original code is connected to the real world.

104
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
How is that possible?

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Professor Liang.

106
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
If Yunpeng is not Mr. A,

107
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
why was he in the bar?

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
Is this all a coincidence?

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,690
Why are you looking at me like that?

110
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,250
Before I answer your question,

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,500
answer a few questions first.

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,250
Last Wednesday,

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Why did you go to the bar?

114
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,400
Also,

115
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,480
someone saw you

116
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,690
the back alley of the bar last Tuesday.

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,640
It seems to be a memorial service.

118
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
Superstar Yue,

119
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Did you do something wrong?

120
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,450
I need to go worship.

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
I admit

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,400
Last Wednesday,

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
I did go to Mingmei Bar.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
But on Tuesday,

125
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
I didn't go.

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,040
Sacrifice?

127
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Who told you that?

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
The bar waiter told me.

129
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
She must be mistaken.

130
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,760
Last Tuesday,

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
I was somewhere else.

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I saw it wrong.

133
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,280
What about Mr. A?

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
You know Mr. A?

135
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,159
You also know Mr. A.

136
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,720
And you already knew.

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
I know Mr. A.

139
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,340
Don't you want to know where I went last Tuesday?

140
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,720
That's all for today.

141
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
Thank you.

142
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,600
You're much better than five years ago.

143
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
But

144
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,760
I still hate myself.

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
If you didn't go to the bar,

146
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,490
then who was the one who went to the back alley?

147
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Mr. A.

148
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:29,920
Actor table.

149
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,280
