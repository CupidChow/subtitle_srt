00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,200
Simu.

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,360
Zhang Yixing: Congratulations. Zhang Yixing: Congratulations.

3
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,280
Congratulations to you and your team.

4
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
Your primitive code project

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,100
has written about human history.

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,490
We will hold a press conference today.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,400
Yang Man

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,560
will announce the good news

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,760
to the world.

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,080
Thank you.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,880
Here.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,400
This is the famous reporter Lin Yuchao.

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,520
The original code

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,320
since the research phase.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,320
So the leaders have decided

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,320
to invite the famous Mr. Lin

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,100
to participate in the record.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,600
The original code experiment.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,360
This is...

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
Professor Liang Simu.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
When I was six,

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,400
I found my first circuit board.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
I developed my own

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,480
V8 engine.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
When I was 16,

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
at 16.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
and even in quantum mechanics,

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
than your father

29
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
than your father.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,160
He was hired by

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,520
by top scientific research institutions.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,039
But you refused all of them

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,960
Because Miss Li is your teacher,

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,920
you stay without hesitation.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
Am I right?

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Professor Liang.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,880
Yang Man.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
5 p.m.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,400
the first use of the original code.

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
I want to go back to

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,320
December 24.

42
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
[In Liang Simu's 25-year-old body,]

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,919
[In order to benefit humans,]

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,580
to fulfill the wishes of the deceased families.

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
Our team finally

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,810
finally developed the original code.

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,440
This afternoon,

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,440
the first experiment will complete

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,770
the great achievement of history travel.

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
The world of primitive code is virtual.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,600
and based on the past images and incidents,

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
according to the past and events.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
No one can change it.

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,880
Otherwise, if the balance is broken,

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,610
we don't know what will happen.

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,420
To prevent you from facing Liang Si Yuan,

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,400
and affect your decision,

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
We will adjust the time to go back

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,520
December 24, 2024.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
11 p.m.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Professor Liang.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Don't forget

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,400
the brain nerves

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
The duration for code is one hour.

65
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,079
Over an hour.

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,680
your brain will be permanent hurt.

67
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,200
or enter the void of code.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,040
and never come back.

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,480
So,

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,200
when the safe time is up,

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
you have to press the button

72
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
to return to reality.

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,260
Otherwise,

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,560
your brain will be permanent damage.

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,400
Xiong.

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,770
The test begins.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
Ms. Lim.

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,480
Have we met before?

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Professor Liang.

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,360
I graduated from Yandae News Department.

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,220
I think I saw you at school before.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,920
Ready.

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,840
Five.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,480
Three.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,399
Start.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeonsei.

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,960
What day is today?

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
December 24th.

89
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,940
Which year?

90
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,820
Are you crazy? It's been 24 years.

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
Yuan Yuan, pick up the phone.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Move.

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm her family.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,080
Let me in.

96
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,040
Let him in.

97
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,480
Sir.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,040

was saved.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,440
Hurry.

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,600
Come down.

106
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Thank you.

107

24-11-19 from Phone Customer Duan.

118
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,380
