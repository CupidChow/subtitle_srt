1
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,600
Perfect timing.

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,120
Let's go, the car is waiting downstairs.

3
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,920
I have something to do today,

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,160
I'll go with you to meet him another day.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,400
What are you doing, Yue Ling?

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,960
Didn't we agree

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
to introduce you to the senior tonight?

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,690
Where are you going?

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,560
I...

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
Meeting Liang Siyuan again?

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,519
You could date any other day,

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,050
why does it have to be today?

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,320
Think about it carefully.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,050
What about your future career?

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,810
I've thought it through very clearly.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,440
Before,

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,210
I probably didn't understand.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,289
For the sake of so-called success,

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,490
I became more and more selfish.

20
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,760
In the end,

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,640
I hurt the people I care about.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,200
From now on,

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,160
that won't happen again.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,560
I don't care what you say!

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,120
Hey!

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,840
Yue Ling will definitely be there tonight,

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,080
don't worry.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,920
What?

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,220
Director Yi Mou will be there too?

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,600
Li Yi Mou.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Brother Yue Ling.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm telling you, my brother is really being stupid,

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,920
he actually followed me here just now,

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,850
can you help me get rid of him later?

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,200
Sure.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,329
I'll help you get rid of this idiot,

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Yuanyuan.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,370
There's a popular restaurant that's getting good reviews lately.

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
What now?

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
Yuanyuan,

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,200
though your brother won't interfere with your life anymore,

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,440
guys like him

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
who are old and ugly

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
and have too many sneaky intentions

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,440
are best avoided.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
Are you kidding me?

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm old and ugly?

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,600
Well then,

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,160
you must be old enough to be a grandfather.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,820
If you want to call me grandpa,

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,090
I wouldn't mind,

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,520
grandson.

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,880
Grandpa.

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Grandpa.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,220
Goodbye, grandpa.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
Go on, grandpa, bye-bye.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,840
I'll

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,240
be careful,

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,000
bye-bye.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,730
Look at your brother

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,500
wearing a suit and all,

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
people might think he's our bodyguard,

63
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,290
don't you think?

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,660
Just stop talking,

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,620
I'll go mix us some drinks.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,000
So,

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,740
did you find anything?

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,080
Who did you see?

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Where have you two been?

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Bathroom.

71
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,280
You both went to the bathroom together?

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello,

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,130
here's your drinks.

74
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
We can't drink.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,060
What kind of person comes to a bar and doesn't drink?

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm well over 18.

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
Alright,

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,810
we can drink.

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Today

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,820
we'll both drink with you.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,440
Really?

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,200
Really.

83
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,840
Come on,

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,960
cheers!

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,520
However.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Actually, I'm quite curious

87
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,730
about how much Professor Liang can drink.

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
My tolerance isn't very good.

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,320
I'd better not drink anymore,

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,520
otherwise you'll have to carry me back later.

91
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,180
You're actually making Yueling carry you back.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
How are you doing, Reporter Lin?

93
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,020
What's your experience like?

94
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,810
Are you feeling unwell?

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,840
Should we take you to the hospital?

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
Professor, I'm fine.

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,400
It seems my physical condition

98
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,960
really can't compare to Professor Liang's.

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,640
Otherwise,

100
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,600
I wouldn't have hallucinated.

101
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
Hallucinations?

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,700
What hallucinations?

103
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,440
I think

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,920
I saw the current Professor Liang

105
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
in the primitive code world.

106
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
You saw Simu?

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
How did that guy

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,920
get in there?

109
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
Reporter Lin,

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,200
I must thank you for sharing your experimental experience.

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Now I can firmly decide

112
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,600
to shut down the primitive code experiment first.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,260
Professor.

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,620
I must be responsible to science.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
Reporter Lin,

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,140
here's your phone I've been keeping for you.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,130
It seems someone called in the middle.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay, thanks.

119
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
There's a class reunion next week, Lin.

120
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,840
You should come if you're free.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,240
Many classmates who went abroad are coming back for this one.

122
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,210
Hello, Teacher Fan.

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,860
This is Lin Yuchao.

124
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,500
Thank you for your concern, Teacher Fan.

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm sorry,

126
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
but for this class reunion,

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
I won't be attending.

128
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Please don't share my contact information with the others.

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,460
Thank you for understanding.
