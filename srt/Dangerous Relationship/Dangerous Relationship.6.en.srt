1
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,260
What are you doing?

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,039
Yuan Yuan

3
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,400
Who was Mr. A just now?

4
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,640
Why haven't you

5
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,039
mention him before?

6
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,780
None of your business.

7
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,440
You don't even care about my friends, do you?

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,320
Yuan Yuan.

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
I won't interfere with you anymore.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,039
But you're still young.

11
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,920
You can't tell good from bad.

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm asking because I'm afraid

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,440
That's why I'm asking you.

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm an adult.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,080
Whether it's good or bad,

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,759
I have my own standards.

17
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Can you stop imposing

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,160
on me?

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,080
Yuan Yuan.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,009
Don't follow me.

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,320
Don't follow me.

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,759
Where is Yunpeng?

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,210
Why didn't he show up at the bar?

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,760
Mr. A.

25
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,000
Where's Yuanyuan?

26
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Where did you take Yuan Yuan?

27
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
What?

28
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,290
You dare not show your face?

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't you dare to admit it?

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,600
I dare not admit that I'm Mr. A.

31
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
I can only hide

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,200
like a clown.

33
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,860
and doing those dirty things.

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,130
Are you crazy, Yunpeng?

35
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,399
You want to kill me?

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Xiong.

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,120
Hurry!

38
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
The specimen is in a coma.

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,730
The consciousness can't connect to the mainframe, Man.

40
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,200
Professor Liang. Professor Liang.

41
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,960
Forced to bounce out the original code.

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,640
Hurry.

43
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,600
Simu.

44
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Simu.

45
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Professor.

46
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,400
Simu.

47
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,280
Professor.

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,690
Professor, wake up.

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,520
It's so nice.

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm going to cry just by now.

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,810
Fill out the lyrics.

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
After you fill the lyrics,

53
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,200
after filling the lyrics.

54
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
I've already figured out

55
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,940
how to promote and marketing.

56
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,000
The famous music producer, Ling.

57
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,800
to continue the depressed style for five years.

58
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,080
and then write a sad song.

59
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,760
Lingling.

60
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
What are you doing?

61
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,159
This is my hit song.

62
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,840
I'm tired.

63
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,600
Go home first.

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Again?

65
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,880
You're doing this again.

66
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,410
You'll go crazy every time.

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,320
It's been five years.

68
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Is it that bad to you?

69
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,640
Okay.

70
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,050
You must be really tired today.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,260
Let's call it a day.

72
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,860
I'll check the next business for you.

73
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,370
You're so arrogant.

74
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,980
You were popular with high music,

75
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,760
but it became gloomy five years ago.

76
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,220
Just wait to lose your fan.

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,160
Excuse me.

78
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
I have to go.

79
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,780
The patient is awake. Come in.

80
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm here.

81
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,560
Go back to the lab and pack up.

82
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
and check the cause of the accident.

83
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
Okay, Sister Man.

84
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,080
Simu.

85
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,200
Are you okay?

86
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
You haven't woken up.

87
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
We were all scared.

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
I'm...

89
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,740
Xiong and I are worried about you.

90
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,160
Doctor.

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
How is he?

92
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,100
I don't know the experiment process,

93
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,100
but the picture shows clearly

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Mr. Liang's brain

95
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,400
in his brain.

96
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,680
This is no joke.

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,330
If it happens again,

98
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
brain damage

99
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,040
may become brain death.

100
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,320
Mr. Liang,

101
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
I hope you know

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
the premise of science experiment

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,930
is to protect yourself.

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,800
Anyway,

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,690
we doctors are not deities.

106
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,080
If he can't even protect himself,

107
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,559
we can't save him every time.

108
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,680
The previous two experiments were fine.

109
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,760
Why did this happen?

110
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Professor.

111
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,060
Did you break your promise

112
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
and approached Si Yuan?

113
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,420
It has nothing to do with this.

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Of course.

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,520
Yunling.

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Are you crazy?

117
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,570
What are you doing here?

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
What?

119
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,120
You didn't kill me in the code world.

120
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,320
Do you still want to kill me in real life?

121
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,480
