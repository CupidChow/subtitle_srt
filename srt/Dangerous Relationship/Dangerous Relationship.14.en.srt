1
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,720
By the way.

2
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,160
That bar anniversary celebration,

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
weren't you there?

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
Did you notice anything?

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,320
How is that possible?

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Besides that time at Original Code,

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,080
when have I ever been to a bar?

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,760
What do you mean impossible?

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,400
Look,

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,360
I've got it all on camera.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,660
Playing amnesia with me, huh?

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,520
The butterfly effect.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
What effect?

14
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I get it now.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,760
I know why this person impersonated you

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,620
to go to the bar for that memorial.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,920
Because everything that happened in the Original Code world,

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,050
he remembers it all.

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,120
So he wanted to fabricate evidence

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,850
to disrupt our investigation.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
So

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,160
when events in the source code world

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,600
are altered,

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
the real world

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,180
will change accordingly.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
Let's go back to August 5th, that crucial day,

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,919
catch that guy,

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,640
and verify if our theory is correct.

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,360
This time,

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll go with you.

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,970
We need one more person's help.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
One last time,

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Professor Liang.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,079
I'll help you this one last time.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
What's wrong?

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,960
Man,

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,960
I couldn't reach the professor by phone.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,040
Check online quickly,

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,320
the news about the professor being injured in the Original Code world and hospitalized

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
is trending.

41
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,800
Professor.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,010
Reporter Lin, you're here.

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,040
Professor,

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,300
did you call me here because of today's trending topic?

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,040
The Original Code project

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
represents the hard work of many people

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,680
and is being closely watched both domestically and internationally.

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
The project isn't perfect,

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
which is completely normal.

50
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,840
But now,

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
this trending topic about 'research endangering lives'

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
is complete nonsense.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,240
If we allow public opinion to influence

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,960
the Original Code experiment,

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,220
it will certainly be forced to shut down.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,460
I understand your concerns and worries.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,240
How can I help you?

58
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,960
Reporter Lin,

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
would you be willing to

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,370
write a positive feature article?

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,180
To let the public know that

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
the Original Code

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,400
is a project beneficial for humanity's future development,

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,280
rather than

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
life-threatening dark science.

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Professor,

67
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,240
our news reports

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,650
are generally objective and factual.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,280
If they appear too biased,

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
it might backfire.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Unless

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I experience the Original Code myself.

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,680
That kind of report

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,240
would have authenticity and persuasiveness.

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,200
I wonder if that would be

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,460
possible, Professor?

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,280
Of course.

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
It would be our honor.

79
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,610
Reporter Lin wants to personally experience the primitive code experiment.

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,960
Why did the professor agree to let an outsider in?

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Because they want Reporter Lin to write a positive article

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
to eliminate the current negative publicity.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,060
So what do we do now?

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
The lab is being used.

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,200
Even if the lab wasn't occupied,

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
we still couldn't get in.

87
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,120
Without access, we can't conduct the experiment.

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
Without the experiment,

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
how can we catch Mr. A?

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I know what you're thinking.

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
But even if I go to the lab

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,920
and steal the primitive code converter,

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,520
once we leave the facility grounds,

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,450
we still won't receive any signal.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,360
That's right.

96
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,640
Stop thinking about it, Professor Liang.

97
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,600
It's okay,

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
we'll stay within the facility.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,560
As soon as the countdown ends,

100
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
you must immediately press the button to return.

101
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,240
Don't worry, Professor.

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,210
27

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,080
1968, February 5

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,720
August 5

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,720
I said I don't want to take the graduate exam

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,180
Why won't you listen to me?

107
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,130
What gives you the right to sign me up without asking?

108
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,280
Yuanyuan

109
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,960
Okay

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,040
We won't take the exam

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,159
If you don't want to take the graduate exam, we won't

112
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,490
If you want to find a job,

113
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,380
I'll help you with that too

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,530
I'll never force you to do anything you don't want to do again

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,120
Liang Simu, you...

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
Are you crazy?

117
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Yes,

118
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm seriously messed up,

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
that's why you've been unhappy all these years

120
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,680
Yuanyuan,

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
I swear,

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,690
I swear I'll never argue with you again

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh no

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
I think you're really sick,

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
and it's pretty serious

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,160
You're crazy! Stop following me! Stop following me!

127
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
Hey, Yueling!

128
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Oh no! Something's seriously wrong with Liang Simu.

129
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,400
He's suddenly stopped pressuring me about grad school

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,860
and even promised I could do whatever I want.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,880
Do you think

132
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,680
he might have

133
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,180
been driven crazy by those experiments,

134
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,170
or got his brain damaged by radiation?

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,080
Is it possible that

136
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,340
your constant resistance

137
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,560
actually taught Liang Simu to reflect on himself?

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Would someone named Liang reflect?

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,330
Shouldn't he be forcing others to self-reflect?

140
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,799
I suspect

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,220
those experiments have made him stupid.

142
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,780
Alright, Yue Ling,

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
see you at Mingmei Bar in two hours,

144
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,919
don't be late.

145
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,520
Yuanyuan.

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,040
Is going to a bar

147
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
fun?

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
I want to go too.
