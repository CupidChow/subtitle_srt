1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
What?

2
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,920
You didn't kill me in the code world.

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,120
Do you still want to kill me in real life?

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,320
Are you delusional?

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Do you want to see

6
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,120
who's doing this to?

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,680
Are you playing dumb with me?

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Fine.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,840
Sooner or later,

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,880
I will dig out

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,160
what you did.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,560
Okay.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
You found something, right?

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,200
I hope you can dig it all out.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Keep investigating.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
We must find Yunpeng as soon as possible.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,640
as soon as possible.

18
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,240
Get lost.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Let go of me!

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,560
Are you my son?

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,240
You don't even listen to me, do you?

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you want to abandon me

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
abandon me and hurt me?

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,920
Kneel down!

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,760
Why is this happening?

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,320
I can never see them again.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
It's okay.

29
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,160
I'm here.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll be with you.

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Yuan Yuan.

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,840
Liang Simu.

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,410
Is this how you treat your brother?

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,540
Is this how you take care of Yuan Yuan?

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
Let go!

36
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,650
Yuan Yuan will never come back.

37
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
You don't deserve to be her brother.

38
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Didn't you say

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,760
to stay with her?

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
What's up?

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,280
Brother.

42
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Did you change my college entrance exam application?

43
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,240
The Department of Physics of Yanxi University

44
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,880
He's the top student in the country.

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
You came here

46
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
I can take care of you.

47
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
But I don't like physics.

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
I like news.

49
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,210
I want to apply for the Journalism Department of Gyeongdae.

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,480
No.

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,800
Why?

52
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,480
Being a reporter was my childhood dream.

53
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Even my parents didn't oppose it.

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,760
Why are you against it?

55
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Woon-won.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,130
Do you think it's easy to be a reporter?

57
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
My parents said that

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,000
because they don't know the situation

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
because they don't know the situation.

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,970
But now my parents are gone.

61
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
I have the responsibility to think about your future.

62
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,320
But...

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
No buts.

64
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
It's a deal.

65
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
You'll get into Yanxi University with your score.

66
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,080
It should be fine.

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
I've talked to the teachers.

68
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
Just wait for your entrance.

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Yuan Yuan.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm not a good brother.

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,250
How did you know I wanted sugar?

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,010
Of course I know what you're thinking.

74
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,160
Why

75
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Why are you here?

76
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,940
Did you quarrel with your brother again?

77
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,800
My brother changed my college entrance exam application.

78
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I wanted to go to Beijing University News Department.

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,760
He changed me to the Physics Department of Yanxi University.

80
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
Yanxi University is also good.

81
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,480
It's close to us.

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,280
The point is

83
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
I don't want you to stay too far away.

84
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
Yuan Yuan is here too.

85
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm so lucky today

86
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,480
I bought it on the way.

87
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Thank you.

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,020
You're not eating?

89
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,400
Yuan Yuan, eat it.

90
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
No.

91
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,880
Yuling, Wenxi.

92
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
I have something to do. I have to go.

93
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,480
Let me see you off.

94
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
The Golden Song Award is coming.

95
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,080
Are you sure

96
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,880
Dating will affect your future?

97
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
Simu.

98
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
What happened? He's hospitalized?

99
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,640
Something happened.

100
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,200
It's okay.

101
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,760
The doctor said

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,140
he can be discharged after observation.

103
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,860
What's going on there?

104
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
I asked a friend to help me restore some

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,320
of the chat software.

106
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,610
You need to be prepared.

107
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,840
See for yourself.
