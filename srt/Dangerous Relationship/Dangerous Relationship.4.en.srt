4
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,079

11
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680

23
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400

26
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Professor Liang.

27
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,240
You can't drive in this state.

28
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760

36
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
May 14 is Ling's birthday.

37
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,520
It's really him.

38
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,040
Yuan Yuan's social account

39
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,840

47
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,680
The frequency of her post is getting higher.

48
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
She called that man

49
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Mr. A.

50
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,320
It's so hot in June.

51
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,680
it turns out boys have low blood sugar too.

52
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,760
I gave him the only candy on me.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,880
July 20, 2024.

54
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
He confessed to me.

55
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
He said in his heart,

56
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,760
in his heart.

57
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
He said he liked everything about me.

58
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
Whether I'm a good person,

59
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
or a flaw.

60
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,960
I admit that my heart fluttered.

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
But

62
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,760
On August 5, 2024,

63
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,520
at Mingmei Bar,

64
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
he held a pot of gardenia

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,620
and confessed to me again.

66
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,360
I promised him this time.

67
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm dating him.

68
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,040
He called me Ms Gardenia.

69
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
I call him Mr. A.

70
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,800
The days with him

71
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
are beautiful.

72
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,520
We walk the campus hand in hand,

73
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,159
and fed stray cats.

74
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,290
He went to class with me.

75
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,320
and I work with him.

76
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,560
How I wish

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
my life could go on like this.

78
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,440
But why did you

79
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,080
drag me into hell?

80
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,840
But why did you

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
drag me into hell?

82
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,880
October 20.

83
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,610
Her diary style changed suddenly.

84
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,480
From the girl who used to be cheerful,

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,520
become gloomy and twisted.

86
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,760
full of self-doubt and despair for life.

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
