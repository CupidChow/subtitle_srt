1
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Professor Liang.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Professor Liang.

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,090
Are you okay?

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Are you okay?

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm fine.

6
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
Professor Liang.

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,880
How was your first trial?

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,530
Did you see your sister?

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,560
Then...

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,360
what did you find

11
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Did Professor Liang find out anything?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Sorry.

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,920
I asked too directly.

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Maybe I hit

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,080
about Professor Liang.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,080
Let's meet next time for the interview.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,140
I'll check on Professor Liang first.

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
Did you find her phone

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,090
in Yuan Yuan's belongings?

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,420
He's here to get his phone.

21
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Simu.

22
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,040
Yunling.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Why are you here?

24
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Can you really go back to the past

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,260
can go back to the past?

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,490
It's none of your business.

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
Have you seen Yuanyuan?

28
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,320
Did you...

29
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,000
No.

30
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,690
I have something to ask you.

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
Where were you

32
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,200
where were you?

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm at the cafe in Jongshin Building.

34
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
Where are you?

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
We'll find out soon.

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,380
Professor Lee.

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,519
Sorry to bother you.

38
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,519
I have something to ask you.

39
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
So you suspect that Yuan Yuan's death

40
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,250
is related to Yuanling?

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
I saw Yue Ling

42
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,500
at the place where Yuan Yuan died.

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,140
He was standing beside Yuan Yuan's body.

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,880
by Yuan Yuan's body.

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,640
And

46
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,800
I found a smurf account

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
in Yuan Yuan's phone.

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,040
The content is very weird.

49
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,280
The comments.

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,340
The real pressure.

51
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
So I came back from the lab right away.

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,100
I saw the mysterious person stealing the phone.

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
So the cause of Yuan Yuan's death

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
is probably in here.

55
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,580
And the content is not good for Lingling.

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
So he wanted to steal the phone.

57
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,020
and destroy the evidence.

58
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,140
But I don't have the password.

59
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
I can't log in.

60
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,130
That's easy.

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,680
I know some technicians.

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,780
and asked them to crack it.

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,340
Thank you, senior.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,930
In order to find something on Ling,

65
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,050
I want to enter the original code world again.

66
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Professor Liang,

67
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
You adjusted the time to 11:20.

68
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,200
Don't worry.

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,970
The professor came earlier. Do you want to meet your sister?

70
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Professor Liang.

71
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,800
Is your second trial

72
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Shall we begin?

73
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,880
Dear listeners,

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
It's 11:30 p.m.

75
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Welcome to "Meeting".

76
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,320
Today,

77
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,800
Haide Apartment is nearby.

78
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
He's not going to Hadeok Apartment.

79
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,770
What are you doing here?

80
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,560
What would you like to drink?

81
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,090
These are our necessities.

82
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Sir.

83
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,120
One juice.

84
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,210
Okay, thank you.

85
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Professor Liang.

86
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,840
Why are you here?

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,450
Why are you walking so quietly?

88
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
I...

89
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,240
Can't I be here?

90
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,280
Of course you can.

91
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,880
Tell me.

92
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,480
are we destined to meet?

93
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
It's like we agreed

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,520
to spend Christmas Eve here.

95
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,500
It's an ill-fated relationship.

96
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Professor Liang

97
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
as always.

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,050
Who are you waiting for?

99
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Me.

100
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,610
It's Christmas Eve.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
I'm waiting for a beauty.

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,360
Do you think everyone is like you?

103
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,440
