1
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,360
This time, you absolutely

2
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,820
must not try to change major events in the original code world.

3
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,640
Professor,

4
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,039
what brings you here?

5
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,080
If I hadn't come,

6
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
who knows what mess you would have created.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,160
You and Simu have disappointed me greatly this time.

8
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,320
Escort both of them out.

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,960
Without my permission,

11
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
they are not allowed to enter the research facility again.

12
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
Please give Liang Simu one last chance,

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,820
he will definitely find the evidence this time.

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
What's wrong, Professor Li?

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
Nothing.

16
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,170
I'll just wait here until they wake up.

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,479
From what I understand about the source code world,

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,680
it's always been a virtual world, right?

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,479
Of course.

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,080
Then under what circumstances

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,140
would events in the source code world

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
have an impact on reality?

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,210
That's impossible.

24
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,960
The virtual world always remains virtual.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,280
So if someone makes a mistake in the virtual world

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,880
and then returns to reality,

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,480
they wouldn't face any punishment, right?

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,600
That's correct.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,000
Why do you ask?

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
No reason.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,480
Don't worry,

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,760
all the surveillance footage

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,960
that could capture you has been erased.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,600
Yang Man,

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,480
at 5 p.m.,

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,210
we'll officially launch the first trial of the source code.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,680
Professor Li.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,960
Sorry to disturb you,

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,370
I have something I'd like to ask you about.

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
Miss Yang,

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Da Xiong,

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,240
you've both been waiting here for an hour now,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,170
have some water.

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,360
I think

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
I saw Professor Liang

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
in the primitive code world.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
You met Simu.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,920
How did that guy get in there?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Reporter Lin,

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,860
I want to thank you for sharing your experience.

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,780
It helped me make the decision

52
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,000
to shut down the primitive code experiment first.

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
The laboratory parameters are all preset.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
To avoid raising suspicion,

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,930
I can only send you to

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,120
October 20,

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
2024.

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,020
That's enough.

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,540
Congratulations.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
After today,

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,460
you will become the greatest scientist.

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,450
Then I hope Reporter Lin

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
will keep her promise.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Of course,

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,640
with my help.

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,610
You will certainly gain worldwide recognition.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,480
Bye-bye.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,360
Yueling.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Sorry, Yuanyuan,

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm late.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,930
Happy birthday.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,800
Thank you.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,700
It's your birthday today,

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,240
whatever you want to do later,

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,200
it's your call.

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
I get to decide.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
Let's go.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,330
Yue Ling, you've been such a scaredy-cat since we were kids.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,640
We should've picked an even scarier movie.

80
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
Liang Siyuan, you heartless girl.

81
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,840
Yuanyuan, don't mind him.

82
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,280
Such a coward. Not very manly.

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,540
Since when is it illegal for men to be scared?

84
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Yuanyuan,

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,040
look at him, he seems proud of it.

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,320
Come on, stop pretending, Professor Liang.

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,730
I don't believe you weren't scared at all.

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
Alright, professors,

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
can you stop arguing?

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,940
Let your little sister

91
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
watch the movie in peace.

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,320
How wonderful, Liang Siyuan,

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,240
you're the luckiest girl in the world.

94
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother.

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,680
What's going on?

96
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,400
It's already past the safety time limit,

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,530
why haven't Professor Liang and the others come out yet?

98
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,650
How is my brother doing?

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,320
The patient hasn't successfully passed the critical period yet,

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,720
we need to observe him for another 12 hours.

101
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,159
If after 12 hours

102
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
he wakes up,

103
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,210
then it means

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,120
he has successfully passed the critical period.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,180
Thank you, doctor.

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,040
Thank you.
