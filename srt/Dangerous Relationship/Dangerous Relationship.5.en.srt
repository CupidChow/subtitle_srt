1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,930
Why are you here?

2
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,240
As Professor Liang's assistant,

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,520
I have to pay attention to

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,560
Professor Liang's physical condition.

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Don't worry.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
I won't die.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Thousands of years of calamity.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,600
You can rest at home today.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
I took a day off for you.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,960
Professor.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,840
I can't find out what happened

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,920
on October 20.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,039
I won't rest.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
What are you going to do?

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm going to Mingmei Bar.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
Let me take you there.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
No need.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,720
Go back and rest.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
I'll give you a day off today.

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,800
I said I'll give you a day off today.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,039
There's overtime pay.

22
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,440
I like working overtime.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,240
Yunling.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Why are you asking this?

25
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,520
You...

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
know that gentleman?

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,760
He

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,840
a famous music producer.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
You don't know him?

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
Both of us

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,079
are his fans.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,200
Are you stalkers?

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,079
No.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
It's nothing.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,880
He just asked me

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,980
what happened here on August 5th.

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
He also mentioned a girl.

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,079
He asked me if I remember.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,520
August 5th.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,220
Did he ask you about this girl?

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Take a look.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,520
Yes, that's the girl.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,160
What did you tell him?

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
I didn't say anything.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,680
It's been so long.

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
I can't remember.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,460
Did he tell you anything else?

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll get back to work.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,900
I wish you success in fangirling.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Yunpeng.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
Why did you ask about your sister?

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,180
He wants to destroy the evidence.

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
Are you talking about

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
the man who just left?

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,200
Actually,

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,760
I saw him last night.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Where?

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
He was at work last night.

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,800
He...

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,440
He's sacrificing the dead.

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,520
It's so scary.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
The gardenia flowers.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,340
It's still over there.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
It's nothing.

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
He just asked me

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,900
what happened here on August 5th.

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
He also mentioned a girl.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
He asked me if I remember.

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,840
He...

70
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,600
He's sacrificing the dead.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
It's horrible.

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
The gardenia

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,050
is still over there.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Yuan Yuan.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
What happened?

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,040
What did Yunling do to you?

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,320
Why are you here?

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Add some vegetables in your fridge.

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,480
Go home early.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
If you don't rest well today,

81
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
they'll say I'm exploiting the workers tomorrow.

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Tomorrow?

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,460
Are you going to the lab tomorrow?

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm in charge of the primitive code lab.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,690
and experimental subject.

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I won't do the experiment tomorrow.

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,010
What about the experiment?

88
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,290
2825.

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,159
I said I don't want to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

91
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,760
I don't want to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,220
Why won't you listen to me?

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,880
Who are you to decide on your own?

94
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
to sign me up?

95
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,080
Yuan Yuan.

96
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,600
Great.

97
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,370
You're still alive.

98
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,880
Liang Simu, are you crazy?

99
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
Yunling, don't forget.

100
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,640
[Don't be late]

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't be late.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
Okay.

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
One minute late, I want a bag.

104
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,210
I knew you went to see Yunpeng tonight.

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,700
You want to scold me again?

106
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm an adult.

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,400
