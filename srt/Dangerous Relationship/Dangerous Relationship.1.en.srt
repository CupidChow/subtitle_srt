1
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Friends

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,360
Let's count down to ten.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
Ten, nine, eight.

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,720
Six, five, four.

5
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,120
Three, two, one.

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,320
The winner of the big gift bag is...

7
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,600
What's going on?

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,520
Who is this?

9
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,180
Why did someone fall down?

10
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,800
Who is this?

11
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,979
I think he's the deceased's brother.

12
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,479
What happened?

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
Falling down by accident

14
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,079
Why was Woon-won there at night?

15
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,120
Or alone?

16
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,880
This doesn't make sense.

17
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
The police have closed the case.

18
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,480
Simu,

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,320
Your suspicion

20
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,440
doesn't mean that Yuan Yuan was murdered.

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,700
They won't file another investigation.

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
I know.

23
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,360
But Senior,

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
you have to help me.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
You're a professor.

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,320
You are a criminal technology teacher.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
You'll find something.

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
I can't watch Yuan Yuan

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
die like this.

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
This is the CCTV footage I took from the apartment.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
Senior, look.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Look.

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
The CCTV shows

34
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,530
Yuan Yuan entered the building alone.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Look at her.

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,860
Yuan Yuan must have encountered something.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,040
Before the incident,

38
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,360
before the accident.

39
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Have the police visited?

40
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
But...

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,120
Nothing unusual.

42
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
During the time of the crime,

43
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,720
Yuan Yuan didn't call.

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,520
Her social app seems normal.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,800
Nothing.

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
Unless we go back to the past,

47
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,300
we can know what happened.

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,400
Yuan Yuan.

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,320
I still don't believe that you would commit suicide.

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
There must be a secret.

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
I have to find out.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Sir,

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
I have a new research direction.

54
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
to simulate a virtual time and space

55
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,240
through code programming.

56
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,880
The user can repeatedly enter time and space

57
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
and experience the past.

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,420
This experiment is called

59
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,760
primitive code experiment.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
How was the test?

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,320
It's still in the test.

62
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
The code is unstable.

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,520
I wonder if the new simulator

64
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,040
can stabilize the data.

65
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Let's begin the 730 experiments.

66
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Done.

67
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,920
Professor.

68
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
You mean our original code?

69
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,770
The program is perfect.

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
It works.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
I knew it.

72
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
we can make it.

73
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
It's been five years.

74
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,760
We finally made it.

75
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
I want to go back to

76
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,600
