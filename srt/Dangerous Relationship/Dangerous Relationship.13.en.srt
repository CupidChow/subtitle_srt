1
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,600
Isn't that Yang Caiyun?

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Hey, Teacher Fan.

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,450
Do you know why she went abroad?

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,730
As for the specific reason,

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,130
I'm not really sure.

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,760
But back then in the journalism department,

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,420
there was a rumor going around

8
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
that she had gone through a breakup.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,880
She couldn't handle the heartbreak,

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
so she decided to drop out and leave the country.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
Being the top student in journalism,

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
she was always under the spotlight.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,380
Has she not contacted any of you since going abroad?

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,880
Back then in class,

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,480
she didn't have any particularly close friends,

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,610
and nobody knew who her boyfriend was.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,400
But we're having a class reunion soon,

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,440
I sent an email to her old address,

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,900
though I don't know if she'll receive it.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,120
Thank you, Teacher Fan.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,880
No problem.

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,240
Here's the surveillance footage I asked them to pull from that day.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
Take a look for yourself.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Thanks, man. I'll buy you a drink sometime.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,520
One drink? No way, make it ten!

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,660
Just watch this first.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,080
This guy,

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,840
he's about my build.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,000
He deliberately wore a jacket identical to mine

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,330
with his face obscured,

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,780
no wonder Liang Simu misunderstood.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Despicable!

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
Found it.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
For these anniversary photos,

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
I've invited lots of internet celebrities.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,080
So please take good photos for me,

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,280
as I need them for the bar's promotional brochure.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Yes, great, thank you.

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Bro.

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,420
Do you always walk so quietly?

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,180
I wanted to ask about those anniversary photos,

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,520
you take them every year, right?

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,720
So, do you still have the photos from five years ago?

44
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,520
I think so.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,880
He saves all the photos

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
on a USB drive every year.

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
Let me look for it.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
Great! Bro,

49
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,770
name your price for those photos from five years ago.

50
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
Sell? No need, they're yours.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,020
Just buy me a drink.

52
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,810
Absolutely,

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,560
deal.

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Professor.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,490
You're here to plead for Simu, aren't you?

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Professor,

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,290
you've known Professor Liang longer than I have,

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
so you must understand his feelings toward his sister, Liang Siyuan.

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,240
If the original code experiment is truly terminated,

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,480
he might never

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,200
discover the truth behind his sister's death.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
So I'm begging you,

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,960
please give us one more chance.

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,079
Do you remember

65
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,880
why we started the Original Code project?

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,040
We originally intended

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,460
to use the Original Code in the future

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,080
to help people fulfill

69
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,940
their wish to reunite with deceased loved ones,

70
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
so they could live without regrets.

71
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,440
But lately,

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,290
I've been reflecting on

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
whether the Original Code's existence

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,159
might actually trap those

75
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,360
who can't accept their loved ones' deaths

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,620
and keep them living in the past forever.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
Like Simu, for example.

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,000
Like you.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,480
Manman.

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
Everyone has a past.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
I do.

82
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,600
Simu does.

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
You do too.

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,360
But life is so long,

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,050
we can't stay trapped in the past forever,

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,760
everyone needs to move forward.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,260
These are Simu's research notes.

88
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,180
Please give them to him for me.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
All right.

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,040
Come on.

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,080
The bar owner gave me these anniversary photos,

92
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,210
I just checked them,

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,370
there are over 500 photos in total.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,159
Looks like

95
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,380
we're pulling an all-nighter today.

96
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Professor Liang,

97
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
you researchers

98
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,440
must pull all-nighters all the time,

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,040
right? Just routine for you?

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,200
All-nighters?

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,850
That's just for ordinary people like you.

102
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,860
Who are you calling ordinary?

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Number 68.

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,740
You're scrolling so fast, are you even looking?

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,600
68.

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,880
68.

107
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,820
Professor Liang, are you home? I'd like to come see you.

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes, I'm here.

109
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,800
Teacher Li asked me to bring you the notes.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,720
Is that convenient for you?

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,200
Sure, Liang Simu.

112
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
It's this person.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
The scar on his arm is identical.

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,980
I'm sorry, Professor.

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,520
I... I can't make it. Something came up.

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
I'll hang up now.

117
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,840
Hello?

118
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,159
Who was that? They hung up so quickly.

119
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,960
Yang Man.

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
She suddenly hung up.

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
Miss Yang.

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,380
You two really have nothing to say to each other?

123
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,360
No way.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,680
You can't be that oblivious.

125
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,010
Miss Yang has a thing for you, doesn't she?

126
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,520
The renowned Professor Liang Simu,

127
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
when it comes to love,

128
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,360
is completely clueless.

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Can you cut the nonsense?

130
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,560
So,

131
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,580
did you find anything?

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
It's this guy.

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,440
Look.

134
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,409
Even at the anniversary event,

135
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,440
he's still wearing a hat

136
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,320
and a mask,

137
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,760
making it impossible to get a clear shot of his face.

138
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,480
However.

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,360
This scar

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,120
matches the person who was making offerings in the alley behind the bar.

141
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,040
Exactly the same.

142
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
It's definitely him.

143
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,650
After Yang Caiyun went abroad,

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,260
there was no news from her.

145
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,400
This lead is basically dead.

146
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,000
But judging from when she left the country,

147
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,520
she left shortly after Yuanyuan's incident.

148
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,800
So my intuition tells me

149
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,280
she must know something.

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,800
But

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,340
we can't contact Yang Caiyun now.

152
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
So this lead is also dead.

153
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,800
This person

154
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,060
has disguised himself so well

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,300
and hidden so deep.

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
What do we do next?
