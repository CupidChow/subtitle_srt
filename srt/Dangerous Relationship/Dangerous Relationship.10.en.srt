1
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,040
Mr. A.

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,040
Since you knew about Mr. A's existence,

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,300
why didn't you tell me?

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,980
Do you know Yuan Yuan's death has something to do with this person?

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
I know.

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,200
Of course I know.

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,640
If it weren't for my selfishness,

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,960
and cowardly,

9
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,920
Yuan Yuan will be fine.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,730
Congratulations, Yuling.

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,880
I heard your original song "Sparks" was popular.

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,360
and made it to the Golden Song Award.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,610
I heard that girls nowadays like this brand of candy.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,600
I bought you a pack this time.

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,039
Thank you.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,160
What?

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you upset?

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,000
Did you quarrel with Liang Simu again?

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,160
I don't want to take the postgraduate entrance exam, but he forced me to.

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,420
I want to enter the society and find a job.

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,759
Actually, I think

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
you can

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,640
you can speak out

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,040
your own thoughts.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,440
Just tell him.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,160
I did.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
What's the use?

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,520
I

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
always go to a bar

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,520
I like to go to a bar to drown my sorrows.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,760
It's a festival tomorrow.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
What do you think?

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,520
Do you want to relax with me?

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
It's quite interesting.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
OK.

37
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,880
Yunling, it's Yunling.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
Yuan Yuan, I have to go.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
Don't tell my colleagues

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
that we met today.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
If someone asks you about me later,

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,020
just say you don't know me.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Mingmei Bar.

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
If you hadn't asked her to go,

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,020
Yuan Yuan wouldn't have had an accident.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,520
Stop arguing.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Professor Liang,

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
As the person in charge of the primitive code experiment,

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
you're out of control.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,440
It's not like you.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Tell me.

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
What happened

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
at the bar that day?

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
That day,

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
I did ask Yuan Yuan to go to the bar.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
But my manager

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,079
called me to a senior.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,840
When I left the bar

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,700
and rushed back to the bar,

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Yuan Yuan was gone.

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Yunling, I'm in a relationship.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,200
You will bless me, right?

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,780
When I found out that Yuan Yuan is in love,

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
I wanted to force myself not to find her.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
I wanted to let her go.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
But I couldn't help it.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,880
Yuan Yuan.

68
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,320
I...

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,640
I need to go to class.

70
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,840
I'll go back now.

71
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Yunling,

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,600
Let's take what happened just now as an accident, okay?

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's not see each other if you're free these days.

74
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,680
I just confirmed my relationship with my boyfriend yesterday.

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,080
I don't want to upset him.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,160
After that day,

77
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,570
I've never met Yuan Yuan again.

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
She seems

79
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
avoiding me.

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
[Until one night two months later.]

81
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Hello, Yuan Yuan.

82
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,680
You finally talk to me.

83
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,560
Yuan Yuan, what's wrong?

84
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,960
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
No, Yunling, please.

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,810
Don't turn on the light.

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,200
Okay.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,460
I won't turn on the lights.

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,840
Yuan Yuan.

90
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,120
Tell me what happened.

91
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Did your brother bully you?

92
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll go find him now.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't go.

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,280
It's not him.

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Okay, I won't leave.

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
Don't look.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
I won't.

98
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,490
Yuan Yuan, don't be afraid.

99
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,450
Don't be afraid.

100
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,370
Don't be afraid.

101
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,730
Don't be afraid.

102
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,810
Don't be afraid.

103
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,810
Don't be afraid.

104
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,770
I'm here, Yuanyuan.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,120
Mr. Kobayashi, you're here.

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
