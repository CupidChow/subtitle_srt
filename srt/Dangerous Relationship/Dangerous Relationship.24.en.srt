1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,810
Long time no see, Professor Liang.

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,360
Lin Yuchao.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,240
Oh no,

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,320
I should call you Mr. A.

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,480
That's right.

6
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,480
I am Mr. A.

7
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,840
A genius is truly a genius.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,800
You invented a source code

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,420
and managed to find me.

10
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,360
Why?

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,120
Why?

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,200
Why?

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,240
So even geniuses ask such stupid questions.

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,120
All of you love to ask me why.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
When I was little,

16
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,700
my mom always asked me why too.

17
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,020
She'd say, 'Xiaochao,

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,160
oh Xiaochao,

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
why did I love your father so much

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,440
when he abandoned me?'

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,640
Later.

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,440
I met a girl I really liked.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,880
I captured her most beautiful moments.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,600
I showed her beauty to everyone.

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,450
I just wanted to prove how much I loved her.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
And then?

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
She also asked me why.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
Why?

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,560
Why don't you tell me why?

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,080
You say you love Yuanyuan.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Is this how you show love?

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,600
You took photos of Yuanyuan and posted them in group chats

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,730
for everyone to see.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,260
Do you think Yuanyuan would consider that love?

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,640
Stop using your professor routine to lecture others,

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Professor Liang.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you even know what love is?

38
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,740
Do you think what you call love is actually love?

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,420
Your love is just sending her money on her birthday.

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Your love is changing her college application choices.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
You control her and imprison her.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Is that love?

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,500
How are you any different from me, Professor Liang?

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
You're right.

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,780
You're absolutely right.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
I wasn't a good brother.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,600
I didn't even

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,680
become a good friend to Yuanyuan.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
I wish I could go back in time.

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,720
I wish I could do it all over again.

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,120
I wish

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I could go back and make it up to her.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,880
I wish

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,680
you, Mr. A, had never appeared at all.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
It's you,

56
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,760
all because of you.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,440
Simu,

58
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,280
Simu.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
It's you.

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,380
You can't convict me of anything.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,280
Liang Siyuan committed suicide.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
What does that have to do with me?

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Shut up, Lin Yuchao.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,480
What?

65
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Fine.

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,610
If we can't convict you,

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
then we'll expose everything you've done.

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
You'll lose everything you've gained.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
Go ahead.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Morning News reporter Yao Xiaoling reports that

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
former Yanxi Media chief reporter Lin Yuchao

72
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
forced and seduced multiple women,

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,380
and widely distributed their intimate photos.

74
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Lin Yuchao, you're fired.

75
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,720
And

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
the company has already notified

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,440
the entire industry about the reason for your dismissal.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Why

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,980
are they all like this?

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
Lin Yuchao, come out now!

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,720
Why?

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,290
Give me an explanation!

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,560
Why?

84
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,400
Why does everyone

85
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,800
act like this? I love you so much!

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,680
Why are you treating me this way?

87
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
Why?

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Don't touch me!

89
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
Let's break up.

90
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,800
Break up?

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,580
Why is it another breakup?

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,159
Am I not good enough?

93
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
I understand.

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,480
I'll make myself better.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,330
I'll change.

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll change everything.

97
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,840
Yuan Yuan.

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,330
Why are you looking at me like that?

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,600
Yuan Yuan.

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,700
There's no love in your eyes anymore.

101
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,440
Love.

102
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,320
I once considered you my most important person.

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,840
You promised

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
that you would love me

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,840
and accept everything about me.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
I believed you.

107
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,200
But you used my nude photos as something to show off.

108
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,330
That's not true.

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
But I showed them your photos

110
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,500
and they all said you were beautiful,

111
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,409
that you're Miss Gardenia.

112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
Pure and fragrant.

113
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
Why does everyone else understand my love?

114
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
Why don't you understand?

115
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,600
Why?

116
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
Don't do this.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Yuan Yuan.

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
It must be that my love isn't obvious enough, right?

119
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,520
I get it now.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll capture more of our love

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
so more people can see it,

122
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,370
I'll show all our love to everyone.

123
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,240
Why did you jump down?

124
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,840
Why don't you believe me?

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,840
I do love you.

126
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Why?

127
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
Why?

128
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,520
Why are you guys so late?

129
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,560
We're not as free as you are.

130
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,120
What's that new word I learned recently?

131
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,440
Has-been.

132
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,720
Me?

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
Has-been.

134
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
Don't you watch the news?

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
At last night's award ceremony,

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,660
I won the Golden Melody Award.

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
Hey, Liang Simu, what's that supposed to mean?

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,640
Here we go again.

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
You two start bickering the moment you see each other,

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,330
you actually make a good match.

141
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Why don't you two just get together?

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,120
Ms. Yang, please don't misunderstand.

143
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,640
Simu,

144
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,860
I've personally repaired and upgraded the original code,

145
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
and tested it myself multiple times,

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
there are no bugs.

147
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,040
Your team can restart the original code experiment.
