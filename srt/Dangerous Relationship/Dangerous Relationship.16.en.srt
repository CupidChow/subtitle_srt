1
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,760
What are you looking for?

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,440
Where's my phone?

3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,280
Yuanyuan.

4
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,180
Can I borrow your phone to send a message?

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,720
Oh.

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Done.

7
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,880
Thanks.

8
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm heading back to the dorm.

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,240
Take your time, I'm going back first.

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,400
Okay, take care.

11
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Goodbye.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
Bye-bye.

13
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,690
What were you looking for just now?

14
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,080
I was looking for Mr. A's contact information.

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
But that number

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,500
is exactly the same as Yang Caiyun's.

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
What?

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,000
How can it be the same as Yang Caiyun's?

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,460
Isn't Yang Caiyun a woman?

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,640
How could she be Mr. A?

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,370
I don't know either.

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,500
Let's go back and figure it out later.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,520
Wait.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Did you hear any strange sounds?

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
I think so.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,680
It's too late.

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Are you okay? What happened?

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,280
Nothing.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
Thank you for your hard work.

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,680
If you know we're tired,

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,600
then hurry up and take Miss Yang home.

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,040
Da Xiong,

33
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,320
right?

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Yes, Man-jie has been working really hard.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,890
I'll drive you guys,

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,120
in your car.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,329
What are you two doing here?

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,680
Let's go.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,880
I...

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
I still have things to do. I can't leave yet.

41
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,840
I have some matters to attend to as well. I'll handle them first.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,570
What business do you have here?

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,300
Thank you, Professor Liang and Teacher Yue, for bringing me back.

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,720
It's getting late today,

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,650
so I won't keep you both for dinner.

46
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,320
Alright.

47
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,520
Take it easy.

48
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,040
Hmm.

49
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,720
What are you doing?

50
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
Going to get food.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,380
Where am I supposed to eat?

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Professor Liang,

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,160
do you know what it means to be forever alone?

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
How childish.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,640
Let's go.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Wait.

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
Here's your chance.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,860
She left her keys here.

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,600
Yan University badge.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Professor Liang,

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,480
you and Miss Yang are alumni,

62
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,640
quite a deep connection.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
Stop messing around.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,159
She studied in America,

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,820
not at Yan University.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
Give them to me. Wait here,

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,250
I'll go return her keys.

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Fan,

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm sorry,

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,720
I won't be attending the class reunion,

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,810
please don't share my contact information with anyone.

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
We're having a class reunion in a few days,

73
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,160
I sent an email to her old address

74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,640
inviting her,

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
but I'm not sure if she'll receive it.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,810
Private photos.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
I can clean up myself.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,100
Professor, I'm sorry,

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,640
I can't make it because something came up.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
I'll hang up now.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,600
Hello?

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Yang Man.

83
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,520
You're Yang Caiyun,

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,680
aren't you?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Miss Yang,

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
could you tell us

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,570
what exactly happened five years ago?

88
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,160
Why is your phone number

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
identical to Mr. A's?

90
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
I don't know.

91
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,220
I don't know anything.

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Yang Man,

93
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,520
what exactly is your relationship with Mr. A?

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
I already told you I don't know.

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Get out!

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,450
Both of you, get out now!

97
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,640
Miss Yang, this...

98
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,600
Simu.

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,320
You actually reminded us of something.

100
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,200
We've been decoding and examining

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
Siyuan and Mr. A's chat history.

102
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,420
We discovered that

103
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,400
while he was emotionally manipulating Siyuan,

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,840
he used stories about him and his ex-girlfriend

105
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,320
as bragging material,

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
and even posted them in

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,860
a group that teaches men emotional manipulation techniques.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,640
This Mr. A

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
is truly sick.

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
Yuanyuan also told me

111
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,760
that Mr. A was also a student at Yan University.

112
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,620
On Yuanyuan's birthday, she received a call from Yang Caiyun,

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,690
but in Yuanyuan's phone contacts,

114
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,240
the number labeled as Mr. A

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
was actually Yang Caiyun's number.

116
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,240
Emotional manipulation.

117
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
They said she seemed to have gone through a breakup,

118
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
couldn't handle the emotional blow,

119
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
so she dropped out and went abroad.

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
I suspect Yang Caiyun

121
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,890
is very likely Mr. A's ex-girlfriend.
