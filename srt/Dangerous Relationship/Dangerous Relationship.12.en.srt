1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,250
Why did Professor Liang come to my temple?

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,770
That's why you don't go to work.

3
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,040
What?

4
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,520
Are you really going to give up your work in the lab

5
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,160
and become a cook?

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
Even if I become a cook,

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
it's better than being your subordinate

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,960
than being your subordinate.

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Tell me. Why did you come to my house?

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,620
Did you know the teacher stopped the original code?

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,760
You want me to call the teacher and beg?

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,400
Yes.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,840
You're the first person my teacher recommended to me.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,370
It shows that he values you.

15
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,920
Besides,

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,000
he dotes on you the most.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
He will consider what you said.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
But why should I help you?

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,520
Why don't you help me?

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
Once the primitive code project succeeds,

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,460
the participants of this project

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,000
will remain in history.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,720
How will you repay me?

24
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,840
I won't help others for nothing.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,120
What do you need me to do?

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,320
Professor Liang,

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,840
make the simplest fried egg with cucumber.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,400
Let's go

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,120
Hello, Mr. Li.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,280
Please help him.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,440
These hands have affected countless domestic and foreign experiments.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
can't make a dish.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,120
Eat up.

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,680
Okay.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I called the teacher and begged him.

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
He was very determined.

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,800
The experiment has temporarily stopped.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,520
Professor Liang, what should we do?

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,970
We can't do the experiment.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
We still need to investigate the truth.

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm going to find someone.

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
I found Professor Liang.

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,840
The three people in Yuan Yuan's dorm

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,600
one of them stayed in the city.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,500
Her name is Yiu Hsiaoling.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,040
She is working in a media company.

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,160
The secret residence of the best actor's lover.

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,720
It should be here.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Hello, delivery.

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Put it at the door.

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,320
Sorry. This needs your signature.

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Here.

53
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,120
What are you shooting?

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,760
I didn't.

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,519
What are you shooting?

56
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
I didn't. I really didn't.

57
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,200
Let go of me!

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
I took a picture of who started it.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,300
Why are you still here?

60
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
Mr. Liang.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
Mr. Liang, long time no see. I didn't expect to see you again.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,280
Yes, it's been five years.

63
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
Mr Liang, I guess

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,170
you came to me for Yuan Yuan, right?

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
That day, Yuan Yuan said

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
a brother would celebrate her birthday with her.

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
Let's go. Someone is buying tonight.

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,360
I'll take you to a free dinner.

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
Who's buying, Mr. Liang?

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,220
Don't mention him.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
He's another childhood friend.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Don't lose weight on your birthday.

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,120
You should eat more too.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Sure.

75
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Happy birthday.

76
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,960
Happy birthday to you

77
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Happy birthday to you

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Miss Liang.

79
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,680
Mr. Yue can't make it tonight.

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,360
He called our restaurant

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,920
to give you flowers and gifts.

82
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Miss Liang, happy birthday.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Thank you.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,000
Yuan Yuan didn't talk to me

85
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,840
she never talked.

86
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Let's go camping tomorrow.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
I heard there's a new hideout.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,520
It's very nice to take photos.

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
You guys go. I'm not going.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Yuan Yuan.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,400
don't be sad.

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Mr. Yue is busy.

93
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm not.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
Forget it. Let's talk tomorrow.

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,130
I have something to do. I have to go.

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,690
Will you come back tonight?

97
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
What are you talking about? Of course I'm back.

98
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,660
I'll get going.

99
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
It's good to be in love.

100
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,680
Yuan Yuan didn't go back to the dorm that night.

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
She must have received a message from Mr. A.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Senior. I checked Yuan Yuan's text records on her birthday.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,840
When she parted with Yiu Hsiaoling,

104
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
someone texted her.

105
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,170
Her name is Yang Caiyun.

106
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,560
She's also a student in Yan University.

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,360
She was a few years older than Yuan Yuan.

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,330
I'm going to Yeonsei to ask around.

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,240
After you told me about Myeongmyung Bar last time,

110
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
I called the owner of a bar abroad.

111
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,840
The man who pretended to be me in the back alley.

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,080
I think I have a way to find him.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Keep in touch.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,800
Keep in touch.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,159
Yang Caiyun.

116
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
Since Yang Caiyan went abroad four years ago,

117
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
I haven't heard from her.

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,440
Professor Liang, why do you ask about her?

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,280
You said she went abroad.

120
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,420
Professor Liang, take a seat.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
Have a seat.

122
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,840
She probably went abroad in 2025.

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
It's a pity.

124
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,320
She used to be a top student in our department.

125
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
She has excellent professional skills.

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,000
There are no shortcomings in each subject.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,280
If she graduates successfully,

128
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,640
she will be an excellent reporter.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Unfortunately,

130
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,080
Lin Yuchao is also a student of this year.

131
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Yes.

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
By the way,

133
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,400
many celebrities

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,559
in our department.

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Isn't this Yang Caiyun?

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
She doesn't talk much with glasses.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,440
Actor watch

138
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,800
