1
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,240
He approached Liang Siyuan.

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,960
He used the same act of pretending to be pitiful

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,960
and insecure to gain sympathy.

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,620
Hey, student! Check this out!

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,960
Student! Take a look!

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,130
The benefits are great.

7
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,160
Student!

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,480
Student!

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,140
Hey, student! Check this out!

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,160
Are you okay?

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,280
Thank you.

12
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,490
Are you having low blood sugar?

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,050
Have one of these, you'll feel better.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,240
Are you from Yan University too?

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
You are too?

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm Lin Yuchao, first-year graduate student in Journalism at Yan University.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm Liang Siyuan from the Physics Department.

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,930
Senior, you should really take care of your blood sugar levels from now on.

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,890
Please, have a seat.

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,440
Ms. Yang.

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,640
What can I do for you?

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,880
Regarding entering the original code world tomorrow,

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,210
I have something to say.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,880
Luckily I was smart enough

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,010
to sneak out the code converter again.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
That Lin guy is extremely cunning.

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,600
I only know that he has hidden

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
all the previously taken photos in a cloud drive.

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,480
But it seems the evidence has been completely destroyed.

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,400
It's up to you

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,280
whether you can find

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,480
that cloud drive file in the 2024 world.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
Your upcoming schedule

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,079
has been packed full for you.

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,360
You must make sure to get enough rest lately.

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
And at the cocktail party we're attending later,

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,079
you must find the right opportunities

38
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,600
to chat with those luxury brand bigwigs

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,960
and talk with them more,

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,920
to build rapport and get more familiar.

41
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,640
You know what? Stop the car.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,570
I want to get out.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,740
What are you doing?

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,320
Yue Ling.

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,360
Yue Ling.

46
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Hey, Yue Ling.

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,720
Is everything going smoothly on your end?

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm already on my way to Yan University.

49
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,280
How are you doing?

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,079
So far so good,

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,519
proceeding as planned.

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,120
Good.

53
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,960
Get up.

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,840
Hey, Mrs. Lin,

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
please calm down.

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
There are people around. It doesn't look good to make a scene.

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,760
Whatever it is, can we discuss it in my office?

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,080
Xiaochao, call your father,

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,560
tell him there's a man here trying to bully me.

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,640
Call him right now,

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,680
immediately!

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
Call him! Did you hear me?

64
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,320
Stop making a scene, ma'am.

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,570
Look what's happening to your son.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,960
If you keep acting like this every day,

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
how can your husband handle it?

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,480
Who are you? What right do you have to judge me?

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Mom!

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
What gives you the right to criticize me?

71
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,520
Calm down! Who do you think you are?

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,400
Quick, call the hospital!

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Don't do this, Mom, please stop!

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
Put me down!

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,320
Excuse me.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,100
Can I borrow some clothes?

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
Hey, Lin,

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
you live nearby, take him to change clothes.

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,050
I'll go check on your mom's injury.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,840
I'll go get you some clothes.

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,410
Hey, classmate.

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Can I use your computer

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,640
to send an email to my agent?

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,400
Sure.

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,330
Short-haired girl.

86
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,940
What are you doing?

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,680
Who are you really?

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm your ancestor,

89
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,200
came from 2029 specifically to end you.

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,520
Eat more,

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,260
we can't finish all this food.

92
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,600
Try it now.

93
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,800
Happy birthday to you.

94
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
Happy birthday to you.

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,600

98
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Happy birthday to you.

99
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Yuanyuan,

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
happy birthday.

101
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,160
Quick, make a wish.

102
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,560
Hmm.

103
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
I wish

104
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
to be with Liang Simu

105
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,970
