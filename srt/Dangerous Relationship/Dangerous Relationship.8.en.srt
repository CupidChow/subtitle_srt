1
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,600
Mr. A.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
My colleagues in the technical department

3
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,320
found Mr. A.

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,360
I found that the other side is an alt account.

5
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,960
I tried to add the other side, but there was no response.

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,560
I don't think they'll use this number anymore.

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,960
What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,720
You said you would do anything for me.

9
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,920
Yes, I love you.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,039
What am I to you?

11
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
You are my master.

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,120
I will definitely obey you.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,160
Impossible.

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,250
This can't be Yuan Yuan.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,360
I found a psychologist

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,400
to analyze these chatting records.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Yuan Yuan is controlled by Mr. A.

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,960
That's what people say about emotional manipulation.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,220
Yuan Yuan and Mr. A are in a relationship.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,840
is August 5, 2024.

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
From the chat records,

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
the beginning of their relationship

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
was quite sweet.

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,320
But all changes

25
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,800
starts from October 20.

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
October 20.

27
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,490
Her diary style changed suddenly.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,280
From the little sunny girl

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,320
become gloomy and twisted.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,400
full of self-doubt and despair for life.

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
So on that day,

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
on that day.

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,200
October 20.

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
Mr. A seems to be stimulated.

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,920
and took a photo

36
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
of Yuan Yuan.

37
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
His love manipulation of Yuan Yuan

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,540
started from this day.

39
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,840
I... I'll clean up.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Go back first.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Okay.

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,280
Senior.

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,840
Go on.

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,760
His emotional manipulation

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,300
started from this day.

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,040
Sorry, Miss Yang.

47
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
I left in a hurry.

48
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
I didn't see you.

49
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm a grown man. I can't even see Mr. Lin.

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
You really deserve the observation of a reporter.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,000
But Miss Yang,

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,260
did we know each other before?

53
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,520
I feel

54
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,650
you have prejudice against me.

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,840
I studied abroad when I was young.

57
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,640
I just came back these two years.

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,210
I really don't have much to do with Mr. Lin.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
But I'm straightforward.

60
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,170
I also like to be straightforward.

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,730
Lin Ji, do you hold a grudge?

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Miss Yang,

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,900
Do I look like someone who holds grudges?

64
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
You seem upset.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
Have a candy.

66
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
Change your mood.

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
October 20

68
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,080
is Yuan Yuan's birthday.

69
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,720
If I wasn't busy with work,

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,250
I went to celebrate her birthday with her,

71
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
nothing would have happened.

72
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
Mr. A can't hurt her.

73
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Yuan Yuan, happy birthday.

74
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
So Mr Liang still remembers that today is my birthday.

75
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Yuan Yuan, I transferred some money to you.

76
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,010
I have work to do today. I can't accompany you.

77
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,680
Go watch a movie with your friend.

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,010
and have a good meal.

79
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,800
and celebrate your birthday.

80
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,840
I don't need your hypocritical care.

81
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
I can celebrate my birthday however I want.

82
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,170
Have some water.

83
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,159
Thank you for your hard work.

84
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,890
Why didn't you rest in the ward?

85
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,090
Why did you come out?

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
I've been thinking

87
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,200
if I had known Yuan Yuan more,

88
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,920
and cared about her,

89
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,100
everything wouldn't have happened.

90
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,880
It's all my fault.

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
I didn't even know

92
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,090
what happened at that time.

93
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Professor Liang.

94
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,320
It's not your fault.

95
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
It's the one who hurt her.

96
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,080
No matter what,

97
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
he shouldn't hurt

98
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
a girl who truly loves him.

99
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
So I must make him pay.

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,320
Yang Man.

101
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,320
I want to go back to the original code world.

102
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,799
To October 20

103
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,280
[The day Yuan Yuan's nightmare began,]

104
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
[I must find]

105
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,320
that he hurt Yuan Yuan.

106
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,240
No.

107
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Your body won't allow you to do that.

108
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
It's okay.

109
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
I know my body.

110
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,160
Okay.

111
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
I'll report it to Mr. Li

112
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,220
and ask him to stop you.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
You won't.

114
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,400
So you still remember today is my birthday.

115
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,280
Yuan Yuan.

116
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,120
Where are you?

117
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,660
Let me celebrate your birthday with you tonight, okay?

118
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,740
I shouldn't have neglected your feelings because of work.

120
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,300
Let me celebrate your birthday with you.

121
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,840
Okay, Yuan Yuan?

122
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,360
