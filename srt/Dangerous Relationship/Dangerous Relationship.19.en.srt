1
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,370
It seems Lin Yuchao was well prepared,

2
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,280
the residential cameras didn't capture him coming or going,

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,280
there's nothing we can do about him.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Every surveillance system has blind spots,

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
it wouldn't be difficult for him to avoid the cameras.

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,880
He's always been smart

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
and extremely cautious,

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,480
never leaving any traces behind.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,039
Even that phone number for Mr. A back then

10
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,700
was registered under my name,

11
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,160
which is why you know nothing about Mr. A.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,760
I was deceived by him back then,

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
and got pulled in deeper and deeper,

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,530
until I almost lost my life.

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,560
Ms. Yang,

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
so

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,720
five years ago,

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,800
what exactly was your relationship with Lin Yuchao

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,039
?

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
A secret

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,680
relationship.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,920
Hi.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,360
What are you doing?

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Yunyun, don't be angry.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,210
I'm not afraid of others knowing we're together.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
What are you really worried about?

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
Qing.

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Yunyun.

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm worried that

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,240
you'll regret being with me someday.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,160
How could you worry about that?

32
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,440
Didn't I promise you

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,360
that I'll always be with you?

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,520
If you don't believe me,

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,360
I'll post about our relationship on social media right now.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,420
What are you doing?

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,800
I...

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm giving you the security you've always wanted.

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,640
Security?

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,160
This isn't giving me security,

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
you're embarrassing me.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
Do you want everyone to know

43
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,360
that I can't measure up to my own girlfriend in every way?

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Then what do you want from me?

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Break up?

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,280
No...

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,210
I don't want to break up.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,260
How could I ever bear to break up with you?

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,480
Yunyun.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
Don't leave me.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,520
Don't.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay,

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
don't leave me.

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,240
I will never leave you.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,360
There's a new spicy hot pot place that just opened near the school entrance,

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
let's go there for lunch today.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Senior,

58
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Yang Caiyun.

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,360
I like you

60
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,380
Will you be my girlfriend?

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,210
The junior really has guts.

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
Caiyun, you don't have a boyfriend anyway,

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,400
just say yes.

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,960
Yeah, say yes to him.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:19,079
Say yes!

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,960
Yuchao.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,740
What are you doing?

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,520
Weren't you on a date with someone else?

69
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Why are you here then?

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Nonsense!

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,680
How could I possibly be dating someone else?

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,740
You're lying to me!

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
You think I don't know

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
that you went camping with them?

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
Silly.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
I already have a boyfriend,

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,400
how could I possibly date someone else?

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
Trust me.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
Yunyun.

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,770
I'm so jealous of those guys

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
because you're really amazing.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,880
Whenever there are admirers around you,

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
No.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
any guy near you makes me suffer.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Yunyun.

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,640
Do you think I'm too controlling?

88
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Am I too possessive?

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,570
If you can't handle it anymore.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's break up.

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,320
No.

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,080
I don't want to break up with you.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,409
I actually love your dominance and possessiveness.

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
You are mine.

95
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,480
I won't allow anyone near you.

96
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
You will always be mine.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
I am yours.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,660
I never expected this.

99
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,740
This Lin Yuchao is such a fake.

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Teacher Yue was right,

101
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
this is his advantage.

102
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,160
This guy

103
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,610
is best at exploiting others' weaknesses to set them up.

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
Just like soon after,

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,740
when he approached Liang Siyuan.

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,280
He used the same act of playing pitiful and insecure

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
to gain sympathy.

108
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
Back then,

109
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,820
he refused to make our relationship public.

110
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,560
It's just to make it easier

111
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
for me to find prey later.

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,200
Lin Yuchao.

113
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,940
Let's break up.

114
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Are you sure you want to break up with me?

115
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
What do you think?

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
You cheated on me first.

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
Lin Yuchao, you have thick skin,

118
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,680
but I have principles.

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,640
Look.

120
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,640
I thought it was fun,

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
so I recorded it.

122
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
What do you think?

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
I even shared it with others.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
Lin Yuchao, what are you doing?

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,440
I'm the only one who gets to use you and dump you when I'm bored. Got it?

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,320
Understand?

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
You beast!

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
From that day on,

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
I developed severe depression.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,720
My weight

131
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,600
kept dropping.

132
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,240
My hair

133
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,920
was falling out in clumps.

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Until

135
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,090
I saw the news about Liang Siyuan's incident.

136
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
I finally woke up.

137
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,520
Why should victims

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
struggle to move on,

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,720
while perpetrators act like nothing happened,

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,130
even enjoying bright futures?

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,840
Now.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,040
He is my enemy.

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
To get revenge,

144
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,400
I infiltrated the lab.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
I tipped you off.

146
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,120
The password is 223514.

147
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,340
That anonymous number

148
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,440
was you.
