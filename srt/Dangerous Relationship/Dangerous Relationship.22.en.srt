1
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,120
Hey

2
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,640
Liang Simu,

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,200
you're not going to die here like this, are you?

4
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
No wonder

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Yang Man told me

6
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,900
not to try to change things that have already happened.

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,210
Please, have a seat.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,760
Ms. Yang,

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
what brings you here today?

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,039
Regarding tomorrow's entry into the Original Code World,

11
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,370
I have something to say.

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,320
This time,

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,520
you absolutely must not attempt to change

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,780
major events in the Original Code World.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,759
From the beginning of this experiment,

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,220
our protocol has been that

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,200
experimenters cannot arbitrarily alter

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,460
major events in the Original Code World.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
Like Simu,

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,520
he was actually very clear about the parameters of this experiment.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,280
However,

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,690
he was influenced by Liang Siyuan,

23
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,940
which created numerous butterfly effects.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Moreover,

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,100
the butterfly effect comes with a price.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
So,

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,039
what happens

28
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,890
if changes are made?

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,160
His body has actually been failing for some time.

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,960
The safety time can only serve as a reminder for you all,

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,760
but it can no longer restrict you.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
Because of our repeated unauthorized use,

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
soon,

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,540
the original code world will completely collapse.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,060
And when that happens,

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,250
you'll never be able to return.

37
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,920
I understand.

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Professor Liang,

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,660
what exactly should we do?

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,400
What is the original code?

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,620
The butterfly effect.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Could it be

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,890
that we're no longer in the same world?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,480
No wonder

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,560
I have so many inexplicable memories.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,420
So it was you, brother.

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Brother.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
Don't you feel like

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
we've gone back to our childhood?

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,320
I remember.

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,490
We were really close when we were kids.

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,180
I was always getting into trouble as a child.

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
One time,

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,200
I went to the lab

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,640
and accidentally started a fire.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,680
And then,

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,930
when Mom and Dad were about to scold me,

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,520
you took all the blame.

59
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Then,

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,720
after I grew up,

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
you became so strict with me.

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't even want to play with you anymore.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,200
Brother,

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
do you know?

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,060
After Mom and Dad left,

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,640
I've always really,

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,000
really wanted to share my feelings with you.

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,040
I wanted you to be like when I was little,

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,159
caring for me

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,460
and protecting me.

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,040
I want to tell you

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,280
you're the best brother in the world.

73
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,600
Brother,

74
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,930
Brother,

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,770
Science can't change the past.

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Let's

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,360
let it go.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
From now on,

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
even if I'm not by your side anymore,

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,420
you need to take care of yourself.

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Goodbye,

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,520
Yuan Yuan.

84
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,800
Have something to eat first, Yuan.

85
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Brother Yueling,

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I don't know if you'll

87
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,130
laugh at me when I tell you this.

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,520
I don't know when it started,

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,400
but memories I've never experienced

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
keep appearing in my mind.

91
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,200
So many sad images.

92
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,480
Some with my brother,

93
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
some with you, Brother Yueling,

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,320
and some of myself.

95
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
My two brothers,

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880
to help me get justice,

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,600
kept crossing time and space.

98
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,680
They got hurt

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
and almost died.

100
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
I know

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,100
these are the costs of trying to change fate.

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,080
But,

103
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,090
I also want to be someone

104
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
who can protect you.

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,080
I know

106
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,880
only if I

107
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
let what's meant to happen, happen,

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,580
can everything return to normal,

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
and you can safely go back.

110
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,010
I've been stubborn all my life anyway,

111
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
so this time,

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,370
let me be selfish once more.

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,880
I need to go my own way now.

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm not afraid.

115
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,760
Because,

116
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I love you all.
