1
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,730
It perfectly matches all the conditions you mentioned.

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,640
Xiaochao.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Can you forgive Mom?

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Mom was wrong.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,560
I shouldn't have sent you away last time.

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,080
You can stay as long as you want from now on, okay?

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,440
Can you forgive Mom?

8
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Xiaochao, Mom is begging you.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,400
Mom is on her knees begging you.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,440
Call your father.

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,600
Tell him I want to remarry him.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,520
Get up, Mom.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,039
If he agrees to remarry me, I promise.

14
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,760
I promise I won't interfere with him anymore, okay?

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm begging you, Xiaochao.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,360
Will you please call your father?

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,320
Get up.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,160
Mrs. Lin.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,640
Please calm down first.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,840
There are people around. This scene is embarrassing.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,039
Whatever it is, can we discuss it in my office?

22
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,920
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,280
Xiaochao, call your father.

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,810
Tell him there's a man here trying to bully me.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
Hurry up.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,680
Please stop talking.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm begging you.

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,960
How can I stay at school if you make a scene like this?

29
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,160
Then don't stay here,

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
since you don't even care about your mother anymore,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,460
if I'm suffering, you won't be happy either.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you okay?

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm fine.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,039
Lin Yuchao

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
was already studying journalism at Yan University,

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
and because of his excellent grades,

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,240
he was admitted to the graduate program at the same school.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,770
I know quite a bit about his family situation.

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,200
When he was young,

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
his parents didn't get along,

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
and eventually got divorced.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
His mom has been making a fuss about getting back together

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,680
and because of this

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
she's been coming to school to harass him quite often

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,760
it almost turned deadly.

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,160
On Christmas Eve 2024

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,240
I got a call from the fire department

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,640
and it scared me to death.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,280
Mom, don't do this.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
Let go! Don't do this, Mom.

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
Let go of me! What are you doing?

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Let go! Come here! Don't touch me!

53
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,780
If you come any closer, I'll jump.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Call your father

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
tell him to come here

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
or I'll jump right now.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,380
Okay, I'll call him right now.

58
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Hello?

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
It's connected, Mom.

60
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,960
Christmas Eve.

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
So that means

62
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,090
on the day of Yuanyuan's incident,

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,200
Lin Yuchao was also at the scene.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right,

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,240
but according to the surveillance footage from that night,

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,520
he and Yuanyuan didn't have any interaction.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,920
By the time Yuanyuan climbed to the rooftop,

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Lin Yuchao should have already been at the hospital with the ambulance.

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,920
Let me go! Let go of me!

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,400
I called Lin Yuchao the other day

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,280
to ask if he was coming to the class reunion.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
He actually asked me

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,920
who exactly would be attending.

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,800
He specifically asked about Yang Caiyun.

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
I thought he was asking

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
because he cared about his classmates.

77
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,490
This is going to be trouble.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,900
What are you doing?

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,820
Yang Man, are you okay?

80
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,520
Simu.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Stop chasing.

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
It's him.

83
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,880
I found out

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
that he

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
logged into my email account.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,980
They found the number I left for Teacher Fan.

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,960
It's okay.

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,159
Come here.

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
Bear with it.

90
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,520
It's fine now.

91
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,760
All better.

92
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
Reporter Lin, come quickly,

93
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,330
your mother is causing trouble in the ward again.

94
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
Um, I'm sorry,

95
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,450
I have something to attend to. I need to go.
