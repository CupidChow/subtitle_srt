3
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,670
Madam, are you okay?

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,920
I'm okay.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,310
Thank you.

6
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,820
Are you feeling better now?

7
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,480
Yes.

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,440
I guess I've become old now.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,530
When I was young,

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,850
many men couldn't beat me
when it came to drinking.

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,240
Use this.

12
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,680
Thank you.

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Zhiqian

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,680
still hates me, right?

15
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,320
Madam,

16
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,210
don't be sad about this.

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,850
It was my fault.

18
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,450
My old house is nearby.

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
Really? Show me the place.

20
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
It was demolished.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,650
Say, if a Tibetan Mastiff

22
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,090
suddenly jumped out on this street,

23
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,370
it'll scare people to death.

24
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,400
Why?

25
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,800
So now you remember

26
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,520
you have to be a good person
because you're a doctor, huh?

27
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,880
Growl for me.

28
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,160
Don't believe Xiao'er's nonsense.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
I really can't imagine

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
what you were like at the time.

31
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,520
There's a shop ahead
that sells delicious soup dumplings.

32
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,040
Didn't you have your fill just now?

33
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,240
I didn't eat anything.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,320
Serves you right.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,850
It was your fault for being petty.

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,290
Do you want to go or not?

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,850
Why not?

38
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,760
I'd like to watch
the Tibetan Mastiff eats buns.

39
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,290
It was so many years ago.

40
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,400
Why can't you forgive

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,650
your dad and Madam Liu?

42
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,210
Madam Liu told me

43
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:55,680
that you...

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,010
I don't want to know what she said.

45
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,130
I don't care

46
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,800
about them at all.

47
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,570
Do you know

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,960
when my dad divorced my mom,

49
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,200
I thought my dad

50
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,800
would fight my mom for my custody?

51
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,450
But it turned out he never wanted me.

52
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,240
He treated me disdainfully
as if I was a piece of old furniture.

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,730
It was at that moment I realized

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,800
that hate isn't the opposite of love,

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,920
but indifference.

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,800
I see.

57
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,700
That's why you tried every means

58
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,710
to fight for Ning Xiang

59
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,900
because you want to tell him

60
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,820
that you really cared about him.

61
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
You want him to know

62
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,200
that he can come back
to you anytime,

63
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,360
right?

64
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
That being said,

65
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,400
you're a good father.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
It's not what you think.

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,360
I just find it unfair

68
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,850
to give the kid
I've painstakingly raised

69
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,770
to others without any reason.

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,450
Did she even pay?

71
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,050
Are you so not used
to being complimented by someone else?

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,290
Are you "someone else?"

73
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,130
I can't just take it from you.
You can have it.

74
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,570
Just eat.

75
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll order another tray.

76
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,610
One tray of buns, please.

77
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,290
Okay.

78
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,200
Thank you.

79

(Beiya Hospital)

80
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,890
I've read your surgical plan.

81
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,290
It's well-written and perfect.

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,960
Take a break.

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,770
I'm going to limit the duration
of this surgery

84
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
to three hours.

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,570
Three hours?

86
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,360
It's your first time as a main surgeon.

87
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,130
It'll be too difficult to finish it
within three hours.

88
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
I can do it.

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,730
I need to remind you

90
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,730
that any surgery seeks stability

91
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,890
rather than speed.

92
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,680
I have practiced

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
the main steps dozens of times.

94
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,730
I'm stable and fast now.

95
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,050
Is this wrong?

96
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,890
Has the assistant
for my surgery been picked out yet?

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,610
Who do you want as your assistant?

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Wu Xiaofan.

(Beiya Hospital)

100
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,450
I'll see you tomorrow.

101
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,890
I'll help you.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,050
Why are you here?

103
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,360
Ning Xiang is gone.

104
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I have nothing to do at home anyway.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,290
I'll just keep you company.

106

(Nurse Station)

107
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,890
Where are you going at this hour?

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
We want to leave

109
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,290
and do the conventional treatment

110
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,240
at the hospital back home.

111
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,570
Did Dr. Cheng agree to this?

112
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,960
Well,

113
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,920
Li Aiying's current condition

114
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,080
is very complicated.

115
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Without the permission
of the doctor in charge,

116
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,640
how could you take the liberty
and leave the hospital?

117
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,640
We've placed the money for the bills

118
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,850
under the pillow.

119
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,920
We never thought

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,130
about taking advantage of the hospital.

121
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,050
This isn't about money.

122
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,890
How about this?

123
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,010
The patient's family
go to the conference room with me.

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,570
We'll have a casual talk.

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
You're...

126
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm the Deputy Chief Physician
of the neurosurgery department.

127
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,240
My name is Ning Zhiqian.

128
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,050
He's our specialist in brain tumors.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,920
Hello.

130
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,330
Let me carry your bag.

131
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,610
Come with me.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,130
Follow me.

(Beiya Hospital, Jiangzhou
HD screenshot required)

134
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,570
How's the patient?

135
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,640
I did an examination.

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,800
She's doing okay

137
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,770
and she's asleep now.

138
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,170
The patient gave birth at the age of 23.

139
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,450
So she suffered hypertension
during her first pregnancy?

140
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,800
I think so.

141
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,920
What happened to the baby?

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,080
She had a miscarriage.

143
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,240
Did you want
to have another child after that?

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,530
No.

145
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,720
Why do you

146
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,210
suddenly want it at this time?

147
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,240
Your wife's condition is complicated.

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,650
You need to tell us

149
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,800
the reason.

150
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,840
Only then we can find a way

151
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,010
to help you.

152
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,650
Doctor,

153
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,330
I need to explain

154
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,240
something first.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,450
She's not my wife.

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,920
She's not?

157
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,890
She's my older sister.

158
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,280
Your older sister?

159
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,530
Yes, my biological sister.

160
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
Where's your brother-in-law?

161
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,970
He passed away.

162
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,890
He was a firefighter.

163
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
He always wanted a kid with her.

164
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,210
But she couldn't get pregnant

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,890
because of her health condition.

166
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,840
Later, she finally got pregnant.

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,530
But my brother-in-law met
with an accident.

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,720
During a rescue operation,

169
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,450
he rushed into the fire

170
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,720
and rescued five people.

171
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,090
Only

172
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,450
he didn't return.

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,210
So my sister desperately wants

174
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,840
to keep the child.

175
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,410
Why didn't you tell us

176
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,010
about this before?

177
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
My sister doesn't allow me
to tell you guys.

178
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,130
(Conference Room)

179
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,720
Doctor,

180
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,010
please don't tell anyone

181
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,770
what I told you

182
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,530
because my sister
doesn't want anyone to know.

183
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't worry, I won't tell.

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,090
Okay.

185
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
Go and keep her company.

186
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,720
Thank you.

187
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
What's the matter?

188
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Let me do the surgery on Li Aiying.

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,090
But she's Dr. Cheng's patient.

190
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,480
It's not proper for you to do it.

191
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,680
How is it not proper?

192
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,450
Her condition is very complicated

193
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,130
and risky.

194
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,010
If anything happens,

195
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,480
it would be even more inappropriate

196
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,650
for others to take responsibility.

197
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,480
Morning.

198
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,450
Why are you here?

199
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,890
Where's Dr. Wu?

200
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,360
Why?

201
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,280
Are you scared of me?

202
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
Are you nervous?

203
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,650
I never knew

204
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,680
what nervous is

205
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,600
all my life.

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,570
Good.

207
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,700
When you're inside the OR,

208
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,970
make sure you maintain
this state of mind.

209
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,720
Dr. Ding,

210
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,530
after you.

211
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,480
How's the patient doing?

212
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
Vitals are normal.

213
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,450
Dr. Ding,

214
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,360
you may start now.

215
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,420
Let's begin.

216
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,900
(Operating Time)

217
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,890
Scalpel and gauze.

218
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,410
Electric drill.

219
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,700
(Operating Room Control Panel)

220
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,890
Rongeur and gauze.

221
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,770
Zhao Daxi's tumor

222
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,970
is bigger than we thought.

223
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,410
Moreover, it's growing
toward the intracranial.

224
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,210
Take it easy and take your time.

225
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,620
(Operating Room Control Panel)

226
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,920
Suction.

227
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:19,770
Bipolar.

228
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,210
It's pretty much done.

229
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,530
You can start with nerve dissection now.

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Detacher.

231
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,820
(Operating Time)

232
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,340
(Operating Time)

233
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,530
You did well peeling.

234
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,530
You can carry on and remove the tumor.

235
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,280
Tumor retractor.

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,920
Dr. Ding,

237
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,770
focus on the surgery.

238
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,770
Stop looking at the timer.

239
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
It's finally clean.

240
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,260
(Beijing Time)

241
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,970
You did well.

242
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,860
(During the operation)

243
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,410
Dr. Ding is here.

244
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,650
Come on.

245
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,160
Let's applaud.

246
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,060
- Dr. Ding,
- Thank you, everyone.

247
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,770
congratulations on your first surgery
as the main surgeon.

248
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,040
Dr. Ding

249
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,840
is an outstanding student

250
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,800
at Johns Hopkins.

251
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,530
Minor surgery like this
is a piece of cake

252
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,450
for her.

253
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,450
She's gifted.

254
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,650
Stop complimenting me.

255
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,410
If you don't stop, I'll lose myself.

256
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,600
Don't be arrogant on my behalf

257
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,840
or be proud of me.

258
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,530
We're not.

259
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,530
I'm someone

260
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,720
who likes to speak the truth.

261
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,410
Mr. Ning.

262
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,410
Dr. Ding,

263
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,920
I heard you checked
the timer eight times

264
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,130
during surgery just now.

265
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,330
- I was checking the...
- What was on your mind?

266
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,090
- I'm just checking the...
- Are you competing against anyone?

267
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,840
- I wasn't...
- What are you trying to prove?

268
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,880
Mr. Ning,

269
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,630
- I control my time because I want...
- Dr. Ding.

270
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
Before you become an outstanding doctor,

271
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,390
please be a doctor with a conscience.

272
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't take it personally.

273
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,500
(Beiya Hospital)

274
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,510
Eat something.

275
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,680
I think what you said
to Ding Yiyuan today

276
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
was a little too much.

277
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,710
She's too competitive.

278
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
It's taboo as a neurosurgeon.

279
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,950
Performing surgery is not a race

280
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,150
where you race with one another.

281
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,750
But everyone grew up

282
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,270
in a competitive environment.

283
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,510
Besides, she never depends on her dad.

284
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,390
Look,

285
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,190
have you seen Mr. Ding bother

286
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,070
about how Dr. Ding is doing here?

287
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,510
Even her surgery

288
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,360
was decided

289
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,120
by you,

290
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,510
Dr. Cheng,

291
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,390
and Dr. Qian.

292
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,590
I think she's someone with a big heart.

293
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,830
She's not

294
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,480
a doctor without conscience
like you said she is.

295
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
She's always mean to you.

296
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,830
Why are you taking her side?

297
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,960
She never targets me

298
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,990
when it comes to working.

299
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,630
She even helped me
with Lei's case last time.

300
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,040
I think you ought

301
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,150
to get a full picture of her operation.

302
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,230
Whose medical record is this?

303
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,080
Li Aiying.

304
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,350
Have you decided on the treatment plan?

305
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,920
It won't be easy.

306
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,270
Eat up.

307
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,600
Open your mouth.

308
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,230
What are you doing?

309
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,800
Just do it.

310
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,920
I don't need you to feed me.

311
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,150
Open your mouth.

312
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,630
That's a good boy.

313
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,110
Mr. Ning.

314
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,560
Oh, you're still here.

315
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,800
Are you eating?

316
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,390
Have you eaten?

317
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,270
Not yet.

318
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,040
Do I get some?

319
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,750
Join us.

320
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,600
Then I'll help myself.

321
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,750
I had a long day.

322
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,870
Here's the spoon.

323
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,110
Oh, thank you.

324
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,510
Dr. Ruan, please continue.

325
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,990
Sure.

326
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,350
Eat it yourself.

327
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,680
Thanks.

328
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,990
You don't get drunk.

329
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
So stop drinking.

330
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
You're only wasting money.

331
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,350
Why are you everywhere?

332
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,470
When at work,

333
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,080
I see you when I lift my head.

334
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,630
Now, it's already nighttime.
You're still around.

335
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,600
I heard what happened this afternoon.

336
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,750
Why didn't you explain it to Ning?

337
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,440
What can I even say?

338
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,270
You didn't race against time
to show off.

339
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
It was
because the anesthesiologist told you

340
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,350
that Zhao Daxi has high blood pressure.

341
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,720
The sooner the surgery ends,
the better for her.

342
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,230
You're being responsible
for your patient.

343
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,110
Thanks.

344
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,600
Thank you for not judging me
like Mr. Ning.

345
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,270
Ning

346
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,270
is strict with others

347
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,270
and even more strict with himself.

348
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,960
He's afraid young doctors

349
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,800
have some kind of wrong ideas

350
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,750
that would lead them astray.

351
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,350
That's why he said those to you.

352
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,870
Is that what he truly thinks?

353
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,920
How would you know
when he never scolds you?

354
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,080
He did scold me.

355
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,440
Not only did he scold me,

356
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,080
but he also beat me up.

357
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,990
Both of you are classmates.

358
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,270
How could he beat his classmate?

359
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,870
I once caused the death of a patient.

360
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,200
When did that happen?

361
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,720
What happened?

362
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,110
She was the mother
of a four-year-old boy.

363
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,270
She and her son
were in a road accident.

364
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,320
When they arrived,

365
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,270
the kid's head was bleeding.

366
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
We did a CT scan

367
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,390
and he was fine.

368
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,440
The mother said she felt dizzy
and had a headache.

369
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,560
So we did a CT scan too.

370
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,840
We found nothing.

371
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,110
So I discharged them.

372
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,680
On her way home, she passed out.

373
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,870
When she was sent back to the hospital,

374
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,600
she died before she even had the chance

375
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,560
to undergo surgery.

376
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,230
It was a delayed intracranial hematoma.

377
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
She complained
about dizziness and headaches.

378
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,320
I thought it was a concussion at most.

379
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,320
I may have requested her

380
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,990
to do

381
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,800
another CT scan.

382
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,320
But she said, she needed
to watch her son.

383
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,870
She declined to say she was too busy.

384
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,720
So I stopped insisting.

385
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,080
Why didn't I insist at the time?

386
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,390
If I insisted

387
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,840
and was firmer,

388
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,320
tragedy

389
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,470
can be completely avoided.

390
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,920
Ning told me

391
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,870
it's impossible for us
to be doctors with experience

392
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,800
without lessons.

393
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,840
The lesson is the price we get

394
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,960
from the patients.

395
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,150
So while we thank the patients,

396
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,350
we must also remind ourselves

397
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,960
not to wait until someone dies

398
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,510
when it can't be undone.

399
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,840
But still didn't learn anything.

400
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,560
That's the greatest sorrow

401
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,630
as a doctor.

402
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,440
I'm not used

403
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
to you being serious out of a sudden.

404
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,230
Good or bad, I'm also your teacher.

405
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,150
So I should behave like one.

406
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,510
Thank you.

407
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,840
After listening to your experience,

408
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,510
I feel a lot better.

409
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,990
Since you feel better,

410
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,080
then let's go home
after we finish these drinks.

411
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,470
After all, the sun will rise
as usual tomorrow.

412
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,350
We'll also go to work as usual.

413
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,150
I don't need alcohol anymore.

414
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,840
If there's any problem,

415
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,510
please contact me anytime.

416
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,900
- Thank you.
- How are you feeling?

417
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,440
Mr. Xue.

418
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,270
Hello.

419
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,040
You haven't eaten your buns.

420
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,230
- Hi, Mr. Xue.
- Liuzheng.

421
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:55,960
Dr. Ding.

422
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,870
I'm here to see Mr. Li

423
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,600
and bring him the medical fees

424
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,510
paid by the construction site.

425
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,320
Mr. Xue is truly a good person.

426
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,350
It's all thanks to him

427
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,230
that he asks money for us.

428
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,470
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

429
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,680
It's my duty.

430
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,230
Call us anytime if you need help.

431
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,800
Then get some rest.

432
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,870
The blood clot had dissolved.
The patient can be discharged.

433
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,320
Okay.

434
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,040
Patient Bed 13

435
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,720
needs another CT scan

436
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,720
and blood work.

437
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,110
Okay, Mr. Ning.

438
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,080
Patient Bed 13

439
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,870
needs a CT scan

440
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,960
and blood work.

441
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,680
Blood work?

442
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,080
I told you

443
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,390
Mr. Xue isn't someone like that.

444
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:35,920
I'll make the arrangement.

445
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,080
It's a good thing.

446
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,870
But we don't know if he was faking it.

447
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,080
If he's faking it,

448
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,040
how long can he fake it?

449
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,510
You must relax.

450
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,390
When the test result is out,

451
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,470
you must listen to the doctor.

452
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,200
I'll take care of the house.

453
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,870
So don't worry.

454
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,440
Doctor,

455
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,320
I want to be discharged.

456
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,260
- What did I just say?
- I want to leave.

457
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,350
I want to leave.

458
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,750
Doctor,

459
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,990
you must not discharge her.

460
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,110
Inform the obstetrics department
and the neonatology department

461
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,920
to do the consultation right away.

462
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,350
Okay.

463
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,920
Okay.

464
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,110
Family, come here.

465
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,320
Zhao Daxi.

466
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,510
Calm the patient down.

467
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,980
Wait for my news.

468
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,800
- Dr. Ding.
- How are you feeling today?

469
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,820
I feel good.

470
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,840
- Didn't we just talk about it?
- It feels really good

471
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,040
not to feel anything on my head.

472
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,720
But I still feel hungry.

473
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,080
You're still hungry?

474
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,870
You should stop eating junk food

475
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,270
and control your weight.

476
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,720
You should bring down
your blood pressure too.

477
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,840
Dr. Ding.

478
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm truly

479
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,870
thankful.

480
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,040
But doctors no longer
accept red packets now.

481
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,080
I don't know

482
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,350
how I should thank all of you.

483
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,350
How about this?

484
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,390
Have some apples.

485
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,230
Apples aren't junk food.

486
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,470
We can't take anything
from the patients.

487
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,390
Then...

488
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,440
I'll take them if he doesn't want them.

489
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,470
Just one?

490
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,470
You should take it.

491
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
All right. Lie down

492
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
and don't get too excited, okay?

493
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,800
Get more rest.

494
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

495
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,270
Thank you, all.

496
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,440
Come in.

497
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
This is Dr. Feng
from the obstetrics department.

498
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,510
This is Dr. Xu
from the neonatology department.

499
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,560
We're discussing your treatment plan.

500
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,840
We have concluded

501
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,510
to conduct a biopsy of your brain tumor

502
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,040
to determine its nature.

503
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,270
Then let your child

504
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,840
be prematurely born as early as possible

505
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,080
to buy time for your treatment

506
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,840
after confirming your child
can survive.

507
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,600
I don't want any treatment

508
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,440
so long I can bring the baby
into this world.

509
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,990
The baby is in your womb.

510
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,510
You're sharing one body now.

511
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,320
The baby will only be fine
if you're fine.

512
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,110
So we still hope

513
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,750
you can cooperate to do the treatments.

514
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,560
We know you're determined

515
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,960
to have this baby.

516
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,920
So we'll do everything we can

517
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,750
to help you.

518
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
My goal

519
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,960
is to save you

520
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,320
and the child.

521
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,680
I don't matter.

522
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,390
It's fine as long I can bring
the baby into this world.

523
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,440
Li Aiying, I want to ask you something.

524
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
If a child is born without a mother,

525
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
do you think he'll live happily?

526
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,440
What do you think he would think

527
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,680
after he grows up

528
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
when he finds out

529
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,600
his mother lost her life

530
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,960
to give birth to him?

531
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,750
He might spend his life

532
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,230
blaming himself.

533
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,230
Is this what you wish to see?

534
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,440
I have a son too.

535
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,750
Coincidentally,

536
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,150
my son was born

537
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,320
without a mother.

538
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,680
I love him very much.

539
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,040
I would do anything for him.

540
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,840
Even so,

541
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,350
I can never substitute

542
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,270
his longing for his mother.

543
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
If you truly love your child,

544
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,390
don't make him lose his mother.

545
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,630
Do you think Li Aiying

546
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,600
will accept the treatment
we proposed just now?

547
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,680
That was already my bottom line.

548
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,110
Let her think about it.

549
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,510
Dr. Ding.

550
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,840
Yes, Mr. Ning.

551
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,920
I want to solemnly apologize

552
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,800
for criticizing you that day.

553
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,750
Without knowing

554
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,960
all the facts,

555
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,200
I made a subjective conclusion

556
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,560
that day.

557
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,840
Not only did I deny

558
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,560
your efforts for the patient,

559
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,560
but I've also dampened
your enthusiasm for work.

560
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,510
Today,

561
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,960
I want to apologize for that.

562
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm sorry.

563
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,150
I guess I've lived long enough

564
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,350
to see Mr. Ning

565
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,350
actually make an apology.

566
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,870
Why? Do I owe you an apology, Wu?

567
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,470
Of course, not.

568
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Mr. Ning, I didn't take it personally.

569
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,750
I feel touched

570
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,510
that you apologize to me.

571
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,470
I'll keep working hard.

572
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,960
I hope you can continue pushing me,

573
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,920
helping me, and motivating me.

574
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,720
I'll be a better doctor.

575
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
So

576
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,510
can I have a hug?

577
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,600
Do your best.

578
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,680
I will.

579
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,800
I want a hug too.

580
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,040
Do you lack love?

581
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,150
I want a hug too.

582
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,080
Why do you want a hug?

583
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,720
I want one too.

584
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Get back to work.

585
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,870
Grow up, people.

586
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,230
Stop being mischievous.

587
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,840
Why did you apologize
to Ding Yiyuan out of a sudden?

588
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,680
Didn't you say

589
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,680
I was wrong about her?

590
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,390
Dr. Ding is a good doctor.

591
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,680
I can't make her lose confidence

592
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,560
in the industry just because of me.

593
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,920
Giving her comfort
after harsh criticism.

594
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,990
She'll remember

595
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,320
what I said for life.

596
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,920
You sure can see through her thoughts.

597
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,990
Move over and make room for me to sit.

598
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,960
Dr. Ruan,

599
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,350
I noticed you get jealous easily lately.

600
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,440
What do you mean?

601
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,720
You get jealous of everything.

602
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,270
Then shouldn't you

603
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,960
apologize to me and Dr. Wu?

604
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,990
Well, it's not necessary.

605
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,920
Why?

606
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,680
I should modify my teaching method
based on students' natural abilities.

607
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,110
Both of you have thick skin.
You'll survive.

608
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:01,960
By the way,

609
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,230
I have good news.

610
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,920
Li Aiying finally accepts

611
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,110
our treatment plan.

612
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,960
Really?

613
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,390
She had been transferred
to the OB/GYN for treatment.

614
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,350
But before she left,

615
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,470
she made a request to you.

616
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,960
What is it?

617
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,440
She hopes you can name her child.

618
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,750
In any case, you should mull it over.

619
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Actually, I was quite surprised

620
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
by your behavior this time.

621
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,630
I thought

622
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,320
you would tell her
to give up on her child

623
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,230
to do the treatment.

624
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,470
I didn't expect you
to have a warm heart.

625
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,270
Are you complimenting me

626
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,390
or judging me?

627
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,200
Are you saying
I was cold-blooded in the past?

628
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,750
I do think you've changed lately.

629
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,960
Changed again?

630
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,960
What am I? Monkey King,

631
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,320
who has 72 transformations?

632
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,320
You put up a cold front for decades.

633
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
But you still have a warm heart.

634
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,040
Dr. Ruan,

635
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,110
have you been reading

636
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,680
martial arts novels lately?

637
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,750
Why don't we remarry?

638
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,680
What?

639
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,470
I said let's remarry.

640
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Pick a day when you're free.

641
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,150
What is he talking about?

642
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,200
He brought up such an important matter

643
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,870
with such understatement,

644
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,920
you know?

645
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
What did you say?

646
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,720
Did you say yes?

647
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
Of course, not.

648
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,510
I still need to think about it.

649
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,600
Why are you sitting here

650
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,870
with that distressed look?

651
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,920
Did you fall for someone else?

652
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,680
Is it Mr. Xue?

653
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
Of course, not.

654
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,870
Why are you hesitating then?

655
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,080
Do you have any idea

656
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,920
how he delivered the news to me?

657
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,600
He said,

658
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,200
"Pick a day when you're free.

659
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,470
Let's remarry."

660
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,840
After that, he just left.

661
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,080
He left me there all alone.

662
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,870
Well, it sounded like... Yes,

663
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,720
he's not romantic.

664
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,080
This is very consistent

665
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,230
with Ning Zhiqian's
consistent personality,

666
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,920
which is practicality.

667
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,600
How is this a proposal?

668
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,720
It was as if he was giving me a notice.

669
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,440
Just like,

670
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,470
"Ruan Liuzheng,

671
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,390
move these medical records
to the resource center,"

672
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,270
That's easy, get it?

673
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,390
I don't like the method
of the marriage proposal.

674
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,270
I'm going to shower.

675
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,230
Don't be mad. Enjoy your bath.

676
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,200
I'll think of something
to make you feel better.

677
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,110
I'm free next Friday.

678
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,350
Let's go and change the certificate.

679
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,230
What certificate?

680
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,680
Change the divorce certificate
to a marriage certificate.

681
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,560
When did I agree to remarry?

682
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
Didn't you nod your head that day?

683
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,680
I meant I'll think about it.

684
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,200
So have you decided yet?

685
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,230
No.

686
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,750
How long will it take
for you to think about it?

687
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,080
I don't know.

688
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,080
Wait. Come on, wait.

689
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,680
Why are you angry?

690
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,510
Mr. Ning,

691
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,320
you can ask me
to record medical records,

692
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,680
carry things, and perform surgery.

693
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,200
But you can't ask me to remarry.

694
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,230
I thought you were willing to remarry.

695
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,470
You didn't even propose to me.

696
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,350
Yet, you request me to remarry.

697
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,110
Wait.

698
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,440
Do we still need...

699
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,600
I still need to propose?

700
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,560
Ruan Liuzheng.

701
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,200
Marriage proposal?

702
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,140
(Zhongjian Fitness)

703
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,910
Qian,

704
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,120
did someone beat you up again?

705
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,510
No.

706
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,470
Calm down. Take a seat.

707
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,990
You scared me.

708
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,470
I'm glad you're fine.

709
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,270
I thought there was trouble
at your hospital again.

710
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,400
Why did you call me here urgently?

711
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Yesterday,

712
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,400
I suggest remarrying to Liuzheng.

713
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,230
That's great.

714
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,510
Did she reject you?

715
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,990
She said

716
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,320
I must propose to her first.

717
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,600
Then propose.

718
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,640
Women like romance.

719
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,080
You give her a romantic proposal.

720
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,990
She'll definitely feel touched
and happy.

721
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
You're clueless, right?

722
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
I'll teach you.

723
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,040
You

724
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,950
should make a reservation
at a western restaurant.

725
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,230
Then

726
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,430
hire a violinist

727
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,560
to play the violin next to you.

728
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,430
At this time, the dessert will arrive.

729
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,160
But you have to hide the ring

730
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,800
in the cake in advance.

731
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,950
When Liuzheng noticed the ring
as she eats the cake,

732
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,600
you'll immediately kneel on one knee

733
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
and propose to her.

734
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,320
"Liuzheng,

735
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,990
please marry me."

736
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,160
That's so typical.

737
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,320
Is it?

738
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,040
Hey, focus.

739
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,600
I have another idea.

740
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,080
Take Liuzheng to the seaside

741
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,560
to pick seashells.

742
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
At this time,
a messenger bottle drifted over.

743
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,230
When Liuzheng picks up
the messenger bottle

744
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,430
and saw a ring in it.

745
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,750
"Liuzheng,

746
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,510
please marry me."

747
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,710
So many people had used that.

748
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,880
It's too old fashion.

749
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,040
Is it?

750
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,800
You find my ideas to be old-fashioned.

751
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,160
Then fine.

752
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,360
I'll come up with a new one.

753
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,640
You'll go to the zoo.

754
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,040
Then you'll check out
the animals together.

755
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,510
Then you pose as a cute panda.

756
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,910
I have to pose as a cute panda?

757
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,470
Cute doesn't work on me.

758
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,800
Tell me.

759
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,640
Is remarrying this troublesome?

760
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,750
It's not even the first time.

761
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,080
To you, it's a change
in your household registration.

762
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,670
Women look at it differently.

763
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,710
The seriousness of your proposal

764
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,270
represents your attitude
toward marriage.

765
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,190
The more effort you put into it,

766
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,990
the more she thinks you value her.

767
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,950
Then she'll feel more confident
in your marriage life.

768
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,910
Are you saying

769
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,670
it takes a proposal to determine

770
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,840
if I value her enough
to spend the rest of my life with her?

771
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,470
I think what you said

772
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,670
is focusing on the form
instead of the substance.

773
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,430
It's about making it
a special occasion, okay?

774
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,600
The foreigners even get married
in the church.

775
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,990
Do I have to go to church too?

776
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,190
It's too much to handle.

777
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,750
Ning Zhiqian,

778
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,560
what's wrong with putting in effort
for Liuzheng?

779
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,400
What's the point of doing
these fancy things?

780
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,270
It's not as good as taking her
to two surgeries

781
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,360
to guide her

782
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,190
and publish
two scientific citation indexes.

783
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,640
What kind of attitude is this?

784
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,990
I thought you had changed
for the better.

785
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,710
I can't meet her demands.

786
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,710
Then forget about remarrying.

787
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,670
I don't want to waste
my time talking to you.

788
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,840
Ning Zhiqian,

789
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,080
do you know why you divorced back then?

790
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,750
I don't know.

791
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,190
It was because you didn't propose
to her seriously.

792
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,750
Why didn't you take your lunch today?

793
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,710
I've been looking for you all morning.

794
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,430
I have something to do.
So I have to go out.

795
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,560
What is it?

796
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,430
Why?

797
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,670
Let's go and watch a movie tonight.

798
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,470
Tonight?

799
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,160
There is a classic film exhibition.

800
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,670
You like classics, right?

801
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,040
I can't make it tonight.

802
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,910
I'm busy.

803
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,320
I'll get going first.

804
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,160
Where are you going?

805
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,750
I told you I have something to do.

806
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
What is it?

807
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,600
Are you avoiding me?

808
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
You told me to pay less attention to you

809
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
when we're at the hospital.

810
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,430
Where are you going tonight?

811
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,640
I have something to do.

812
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,120
Can't you tell me what is it?

813
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm really busy.

814
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,840
Okay, I know.

815
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,560
I'll be there right away.

816
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,880
Fine, whatever.

817
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,190
Liuzheng?

818
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,880
What's the matter?

819
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,190
Let's go over there

820
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,560
and talk about it.

821
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,360
I asked him to propose
but it scared him away.

822
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,640
In our first marriage,

823
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,560
I was at a disadvantage
because I always make the first move.

824
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,400
I'm not letting that happen
this time around.

825
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,800
You're right.

826
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,990
Do you still remember Dong Miaomiao?

827
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,510
When I first married him, she told me

828
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,600
perfect love
is loving each other so deeply

829
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
that your love is even.

830
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,270
He may like me

831
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,750
where he makes it troublesome for me.

832
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,640
But at least I could feel it.

833
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
But to say how much he likes me

834
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,430
or loves me,

835
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,560
I really have no idea.

836
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,800
So I must make him propose to me

837
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,560
to make his intention clear.

838
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,160
Well said.

839
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,950
You must make him propose properly.

840
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,910
Make him kneel.

841
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,670
Yes.

842
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,430
It's rare for everyone
to be here together.

843
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,120
Do you have plans?

844
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,640
No.

845
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,320
Are you busy later?

846
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,710
No.

847
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,120
- Okay, follow me.
- I have no plans too.

848
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,080
I'll take you guys out
for a movie and a meal.

849
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,880
Okay.

850
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,840
Let's go.

851
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,880
Dr. Ding,

852
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,800
do you want to join us
for a movie and hotpot?

853
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,120
Tan Ya is paying.

854
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,910
Come and join us.

855
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,600
We don't meet like this every day.

856
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,560
We must cherish this moment.

857
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,120
Let's go.

858
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,080
Come on.

859
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,910
Everyone is waiting for you.

860
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,430
I'll send you the location.

861
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,950
Dr. Wu,

862
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,270
who's coming?

863
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,160
Dr. Cheng.

864
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,910
Since we're having a get-together,

865
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,320
it'll be fun to invite more people.

866
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,640
As a family,

867
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,080
it's important to have everyone here.

868
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,400
I'll call Bai to see if he's coming.

869
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,510
Dr. Ruan, why don't you ask Mr. Ning?

870
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,510
Will you guys be able
to enjoy yourselves if he's here?

871
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,990
Forget it then.

872
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,120
We should ask out of politeness.

873
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,470
It'll be awkward if he finds out

874
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,560
we didn't invite him.

875
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,120
I'll call him then.

876
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,400
They're asking if you're coming.

877
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,360
Is he coming?

878
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,600
He's busy.

879
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,880
Bai can't make it either.

880
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,040
He has a date.

881
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,750
What could he be busy with?

882
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Important matter.

883
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,560
Let's eat.

884
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,400
No one else is coming.

885
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
So dig in.

886
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,990
Since Dr. Ning isn't here,

887
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm going to tell you guys something.

888
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,990
The seniors who used to work
at the hospital said

889
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,080
Dr. Ning was married once.

890
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,430
But he divorced after being married
for more than a year.

891
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,840
He divorced after being married
for more than a year?

892
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,990
Then who abandoned who?

893
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,120
It must be Dr. Ning
who didn't want his ex-wife.

894
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,510
How do you know?

895
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,430
Think about it.

896
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,840
Dr. Ning is a perfect man.

897
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,880
Any woman would feel reluctant
to divorce him.

898
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,710
What was so reluctant about that?

899
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,040
He's human.

900
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,670
There are times
when humans are imperfect.

901
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,710
If it were me, I might have dumped him.

902
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,880
Dr. Ruan,

903
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,470
did Dr. Ning scold you

904
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,120
in the OR again today?

905
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
Mei, eat your meat.

906
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,160
I... I was kidding.

907
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,320
Don't be mad.

908
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,470
Just eat.

909
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,670
If you don't, the meat will get tough.

910
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,880
Eat up, guys.

911
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,750
We're going to the movies after this.

912
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,470
Eat up.

913
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,160
Okay.

914
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,980
(The End)

915
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,360
Let's go.

916
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,120
Just stay for a while.

917
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,840
We'll leave after they're gone.

918
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,600
Sit.

919
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:28,880
They're all gone.

920
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,360
There's no one else here.

921
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,910
Just stay for a while.

922
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,190
The movie was so touching.

923
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,710
Can't we immerse in it for a while?

924
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,360
Old films are nevertheless classic.

925
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,510
Let me snap out of it slowly.

926
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,220
(Stay with me)

927
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,910
What's this?

928
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
What's going on?

929
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,160
What's this?

930
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,670
Look.

931
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,750
Liuzheng?

932
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,750
Your legs were pretty long.

933
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,190
Isn't that Ning?

934
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,320
Why is Dr. Ruan on the screen?

935
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,160
Dr. Ruan

936
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,880
and Dr. Ning?

937
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,400
What's going on here?

938
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,420
(Ning Zhiqian Ruan Liuzheng)

939
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,560
(Liuzheng,)

940
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,670
(I'm sorry)

941
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,120
(for losing you six years ago.)

942
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,470
(My life was dull)

943
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,640
(without you in those six years.)

944
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,320
(All that was left in my life
was breathing.)

945
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,320
(Luckily,)

946
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,270
(fate sent you back to me.)

947
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,950
(I believe you're my destiny.)

948
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,040
(You're the remainder of my life.)

949
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,510
(Please say yes)

950
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,270
(and marry me again.)

951
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,080
Marry him! Marry him! Marry him!

952
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,710
Marry him! Marry him!

953
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,360
Wait a minute.

954
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,510
Ning is proposing.

955
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,910
But why isn't he here?

956
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,360
