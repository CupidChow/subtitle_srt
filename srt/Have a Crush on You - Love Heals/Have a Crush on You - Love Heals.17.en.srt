1
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
Lawyer Xue is here.

2
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,839
Dr. Ding, Ruan

3
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,239
Liuzheng Your friend is here?

4
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,680
Lawyer Xue is here.

5
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,959
Are you off work now?

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
I'm about to get off work.

7
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,120
That's good.

8
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,599
I'm here today

9
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
to tell you a piece of good news,

10
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,199
Maybe Li Xiangui's case

11
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:58,800
has made progress.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,559
That's right.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,519
Please come in.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,040
Please.

15
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:02,919
Please come in.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Lawyer Xue,

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
would you like some tea or water?

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,919
And juice and sparkling water.

19
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,240
And coffee,

20
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,360
just a glass of white water.

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay,

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,880
Thank you.

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,639
Tell me,

24
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,360
I've found the person

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,479
in charge of the construction site.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,919
He has promised to compensate Lee Hsien Gui

27
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,440
for the cost of his treatment,

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,199
As for the follow-up compensation,

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,119
when he leaves the hospital,

30
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,080
Then we can negotiate.

31
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,479
That's great.

32
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,800
Lawyer Xue, you've really done us

33
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:31,600
a great favor.

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,039
It solved a big problem.

35
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,479
Thank you.

36
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't be so polite to me.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,839
Lawyer Xue,

38
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,080
look at this,

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,479
How should I thank you?

40
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,559
How about I treat you to a meal?

41
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:41,839
Yes.

42
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,039
Ask her to treat you to dinner.

43
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,160
Is this your friend?

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
You should treat her to a meal,

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,279
too. You said you'd treat her.

46
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,600
I'll treat you first.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,559
Don't argue with each other.

48
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,880
One meal for each person. Take turns.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Perfect.

50
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,880
I happen to be free tonight,

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,399
so let me treat you to dinner first.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,399
Dr. Ding,

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,479
if you're so active at work,

54
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,639
He has been the surgeon for a long time.

55
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:01,800
Lawyer Xue,

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
are you free tonight?

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,679
Tonight,

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,720
I'm afraid not.

59
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,919
Tomorrow,

60
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,800
tomorrow night,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,160
All right,

62
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,000
This … This

63
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,160
Have a good eye for it, okay?

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Is this your dish?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
It's Dr. Ruan's dish,

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,559
Cheng Zhouyu,

67
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,279
You didn't take your medicine today, right?

68
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,199
You didn't prescribe medicine for me?

69
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,960
What medicine

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,240
should I take?

71
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,479
I'll make an appointment some other day,

72
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,880
how about we get together together?

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay.

74
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,160
Maybe Lawyer Xue

75
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,720
will become a family member of our neurosurgery later.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
To your family,

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,279
come on,

78
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,919
Mr. Ning,

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,759
do you still like to play with squirt guns?

80
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,119
It seems that the atmosphere in your office

81
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,119
is quite childlike.

82
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,119
Mr. Xue,

83
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,839
I'm sorry,

84
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,080
According to the hospital's rules,

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,919
no one else is allowed to enter this office,

86
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,279
Understood.

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,119
I'm leaving now.

88
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,399
Liuzheng,

89
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,440
come out with me.

90
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,279
I need to talk to you.

91
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,440
-Let's go. -Lawyer

92
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Xue is gone.

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,080
Yes.

94
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll come to see you

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,600
when I'm free next time.

96
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,679
Okay,

97
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

98
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:53,839
Okay.

99
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,839
Miss Ning,

100
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,119
see you next time.

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Lawyer Xue,

102
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,479
I'll ask Liu Zheng to treat you to dinner today.

103
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,320
If I treat you again next time,

104
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,399
it's all yours.

105
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,479
Stop pouring it.

106
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,440
The flowers won't be yours if you water them again.

107
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
It has nothing to do with you.

108
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,079
So childish.

109
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm sorry about that.

110
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,279
It's okay,

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,359
Are you free tonight?

112
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,119
There's a cocktail party in our legal profession,

113
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,920
and I'd like to invite you,

114
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Come with me.

115
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
Just take it as a personal favor.

116
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,519
Okay,

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,079
I'll go with you

118
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,480
tonight. Let's have lunch first.

119
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,559
Next to your hospital,

120
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,640
there's a new fast-food restaurant,

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
It won't take long.

122
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,359
The food in our canteen is quite good,

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,239
but I get tired of eating it every day.

124
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,519
Let's go.

125
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,559
Wait for me.

126
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll go back and get changed.

127
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,480
Okay.

128
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:10,959
Hey,

129
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,160
Qian Qian, what are you doing?

130
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,519
What else can I do?

131
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,480
Mr. Ning,

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,920
it's not a craniotomy,

133
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,119
On the way to the craniotomy,

134
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,880
I heard it.

135
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,799
If you're in a bad mood,

136
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,760
did Xue Weilin

137
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
go to the hospital to look for Liu Zheng?

138
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,720
Am I right?

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,519
Tonight,

140
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,320
our Lawyers Association is having a commendation reception,

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
Xue Weilin,

142
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,119
he's one of the top ten lawyers

143
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,160
who won awards this year.

144
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,720
I guess,

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,480
if he goes to the hospital and brings Liuzheng there,

146
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,480
he can perform well in front of Liuzheng,

147
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,239
I'll get twice the result with half the effort in the future.

148
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey,

149
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,679
Hey,

150
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:47,239
He hung up before he finished speaking.

151
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,279
How rude.

152
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,399
Mr. Xue, are you free every day?

153
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm waiting for Liuzheng for lunch.

154
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:17,959
Dr. Ruan,

155
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
why are you

156
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
here?

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,679
What's up?

158
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,799
What is it?

159
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,160
You'll know when you're here.

160
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
Wait a minute.

161
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,559
What's wrong?

162
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,440
Come here.

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
You … You do it.

164
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,239
What's wrong?

165
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,839
Look at

166
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,600
the game Xiao Ou recommended, right?

167
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,119
I played a few games

168
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,279
and I always died if I didn't understand,

169
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,440
Can you explain to me

170
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,960
why you want to hang up slowly?

171
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
Then don't fight alone.

172
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,440
Let's hold a group.

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Dr. Ruan,

174
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,760
you have to work hard tomorrow,

175
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
Let's go to the printing shop.

176
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:48,919
What are you doing?

177
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,119
Don't enter as an idle person.

178
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,039
How about putting up a banner?

179
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,200
Put it on the door of our department,

180
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
or I'll always be afraid of someone,

181
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I don't know where my unit is.

182
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,440
Mr. Ning,

183
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,479
could you please be nice

184
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,760
to Lawyer Xue

185
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,880
in the future,

186
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
He did a good thing

187
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,359
for our department.

188
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,880
Even if you don't appreciate him,

189
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,760
you don't have to be so embarrassing.

190
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,719
Is he doing something good for Corey?

191
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,440
Isn't that doing you a good deed?

192
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,159
What does he want from you?

193
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,200
You don't know?

194
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
Okay,

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,559
Even if

196
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,520
his original intention is to pursue me,

197
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,599
But it turned out that

198
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,799
he helped someone else.

199
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,840
If the result is good,

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,880
then it's good.

201
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't think so.

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
To do good deeds,

203
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,080
the purpose must be simple,

204
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,039
Do things with selfish desires.

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
They will eventually give up halfway.

206
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,559
You look at the problem

207
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,679
from such a tricky angle.

208
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
Men are not that simple.

209
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,479
But it's not as complicated

210
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,239
as you said. I'm a man.

211
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,479
Don't I know what he's thinking?

212
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you jealous?

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,119
When you suddenly mentioned remarriage last time,

214
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,440
it was a whim.

215
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,599
still

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
It has been planned for a long time.

217
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,479
Can you stop spinning?

218
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,679
Aren't you dizzy?

219
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,640
I'm not dizzy.

220
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
You're dizzy.

221
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,039
I've never been so good-looking before.

222
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,280
It's not too late to be beautiful now.

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Show off.

224
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,760
Do you like me very much now?

225
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,280
Tell me.

226
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,479
You're dead.

227
00:10:58,719 --> 00:10:59,559
I don't have a chance.

228
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,359
See you tomorrow.

229
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,320
Ms. Ning.

230
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,080
What's wrong?

231
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,119
There's a car accident patient in the emergency department.

232
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,119
I'm going to check

233
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,440
on the patient in the emergency department.

234
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,479
Sorry,

235
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,479
I may not be able to go today.

236
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,119
Mom,

237
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,679
Mom,

238
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,840
Mom,

239
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,799
Mom,

240
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,799
Don't let the kids see it.

241
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:46,719
That was when her mother

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,679
was crossing the street,

243
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,799
Her mom pushed her away

244
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,960
and got hit by a car.

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,359
Don't worry,

246
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,479
we'll try our best

247
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,159
to save your mother's heartbeat,

248
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,640
First, arrange

249
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,359
a CT scan of the skull,

250
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,760
Inform the anesthesiology department of the operating room

251
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,479
to prepare for the operation.

252
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,119
Okay,

253
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,880
Take care of him.

254
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,719
Mom,

255
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,960
Mom,

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,599
Mom,

257
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,799
Mom,

258
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,640
Mom,

259
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,239
kid, you can't get in here,

260
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,440
Wait in the chair over there.

261
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,599
Mom will be out soon.

262
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,599
Mom,

263
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,039
Mom,

264
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,280
Mom,

265
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,440
Mom,

266
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,719
Mom,

267
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,919
Mom,

268
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,400
Mom,

269
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,119
let me do a craniotomy.

270
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,640
My heartbeat is gone.

271
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,080
Stop the surgery and rescue him immediately.

272
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,919
Remove the equipment.

273
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,599
Hurry up!

274
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,719
Defibrillator. Defibrillator's

275
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,400
energy

276
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
is 200 joules in two-way wave.

277
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,440
Get out of the hospital bed

278
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,280
and discharge the electricity.

279
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,559
Declare her clinical death.

280
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,239
The time is 8: 28.

281
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,919
Where's my mom?

282
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,239
Has she finished her surgery?

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,640
Thank you.

284
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,719
Mr. Ning,

285
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,799
why can you

286
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
always be so calm?

287
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,479
After being a doctor for a long time,

288
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm used to it.

289
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,040
Eat something.

290
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
I can't eat it.

291
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,719
Have some.

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,800
It gives me a headache whenever there's an urgent notice.

293
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,680
The heavy rain caused a series of car accidents,

294
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,479
and the wounded arrived at the hospital one

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,880
after another ten minutes later.

296
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,640
Dr. Ruan,

297
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,640
you still have ten minutes.

298
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,880
I feel sorry

299
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,400
for my last patient. Eat something.

300
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,719
Otherwise, tonight,

301
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:42,439
you won't even be able to survive an operation.

302
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,199
From now on,

303
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,119
be responsible for the next patient.

304
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,400
Director Ning,

305
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,239
it's past three o'clock,

306
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,400
Why is she still here?

307
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,359
The patient's family will come to pick him up right away.

308
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:33,839
Thank you for your hard work.

309
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,239
I'm fine.

310
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:43,119
Watch out!

311
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,640
Are you okay?

312
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,239
It's okay.

313
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:50,719
Are you okay?

314
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,640
Thank you.

315
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,199
Where are you going?

316
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,520
Let me send you there.

317
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,800
My car is over there.

318
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,680
-Thank you. -Thank you, baby.

319
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,439
Fasten your seat belt.

320
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,319
All right, all right.

321
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,760
Thank you.

322
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,239
It's okay.

323
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:21,959
Bye-bye.

324
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,479
Be careful.

325
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,599
What's wrong with your hand?

326
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,280
It rained yesterday

327
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,119
and I slipped.

328
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:13,920
I fell down.

329
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:14,920
It's nothing serious.

330
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Slight bone fracture.

331
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:16,959
How old is he?

332
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:17,920
You're so careless.

333
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:20,119
Let's go.

334
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,359
I specially brought you

335
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,520
a gift from America,

336
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,239
Guess what it is?

337
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:25,760
What?

338
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,640
Dark chocolate

339
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,599
for weight loss,

340
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,079
Come on.

341
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,479
It's not dark chocolate.

342
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,560
Come on. You have it. You have it.

343
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,319
Here. Here. Here.

344
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,199
Men don't like this.

345
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:36,719
We like to

346
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:37,239
try it.

347
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,319
You like to try it.

348
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,640
One for each person,

349
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,199
five for each person,

350
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,040
Ding,

351
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,599
come on.

352
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,560
Look,

353
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,040
open it

354
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,680
and try yours,

355
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:49,479
Thank you, Director Qian.

356
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:49,920
You're welcome.

357
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Dr. Qian,

358
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,800
you're too partial.

359
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,199
Four of you divide these five pills,

360
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,199
and the last one will guess the shell.

361
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,359
Old Qian is back.

362
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,160
You're back.

363
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
What happened to your arm?

364
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,239
I accidentally injured myself

365
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,920
last night,

366
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,959
It seems that I came back just in time.

367
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,719
You've worked hard

368
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,839
while I'm not here.

369
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,000
Of course.

370
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,199
Director Qian also brought us gifts.

371
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
Dark chocolate,

372
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,800
Come on,

373
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,119
Men don't like this kind of food.

374
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,680
Thank you.

375
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,280
You're welcome.

376
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,319
We still have things to do.

377
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm leaving.

378
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,280
Thank you.

379
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,079
Let's go.

380
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:21,839
Dr. Cheng,

381
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,479
Director Qian,

382
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,239
Where are the gifts?

383
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,119
What about mine?

384
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,880
Where did you go during the gift sharing?

385
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,719
We're done.

386
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,280
You can't even get hot after eating chocolate.

387
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,920
Eat mine.

388
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:29,719
I'm on a diet.

389
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:31,920
Thank you, Director Qian.

390
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,199
You've gained weight.

391
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,400
You still eat chocolate?

392
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,880
Let's do the rounds.

393
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:41,839
Qian,

394
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,319
the head nurse is here today,

395
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:45,680
Morning,

396
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Good morning,

397
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,280
Director Ning. This old money came back from America,

398
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,520
He's in high spirits.

399
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,319
See?

400
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,079
What's wrong?

401
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,239
The director will be decided soon.

402
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,719
Old Qian was hopeless,

403
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,800
but isn't he disabled?

404
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,680
It's hard to say now.

405
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,560
Snail rice noodles?

406
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,479
You don't even have snail rice noodles for breakfast.

407
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,920
Great, great, great,

408
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,959
You didn't eat in the morning?

409
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,760
Eat, eat, eat.

410
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,359
Your canteen is really nice.

411
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,719
Whatever you want

412
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,199
and what indicators you want are all qualified.

413
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,000
No.

414
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,239
My weight is not up to standard yet.

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,959
Director Ning,

416
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,359
Xiao Ming's target has passed.

417
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,199
We can arrange the surgery

418
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,479
as soon as possible.

419
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,160
Not yet.

420
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
Not yet.

421
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because I hurt my hand.

422
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,400
You can't do it, can you?

423
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,680
Slight bone fracture,

424
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,800
unable to get a scalpel for now,

425
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:34,839
If not,

426
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,119
you can consider changing to another doctor.

427
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,319
Director Ning,

428
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,880
did you do it on purpose?

429
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,079
We won't joke

430
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:48,880
about the patient,

431
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,000
if

432
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
If you really don't feel at ease,

433
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,839
you can also apply for transfer,

434
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,520
Are you kidding me?

435
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,560
Which big hospital is it now?

436
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
It's not overcrowded.

437
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,400
You can't even get a bed.

438
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,239
No way.

439
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,479
We'll do it here.

440
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,400
If you can't make one knife,

441
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,719
how about we find two knives

442
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,800
to make the old money?

443
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,560
Dr. Qian, the schedule is

444
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,719
full.

445
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,439
Where's Cheng?

446
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,239
Then I'll talk to Dr. Cheng. Okay,

447
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,040
you can ask him.

448
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Without Dr. Ning,

449
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,000
I think Dr. Ruan can do it.

450
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,680
Kid, stop fooling around.

451
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,880
It's such a big deal,

452
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
We need to find someone reliable.

453
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,839
Dr. Ruan is reliable.

454
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,199
What do you know?

455
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,719
This is craniotomy,

456
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,280
craniotomy,

457
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,800
How about this?

458
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,000
You two talk about it first,

459
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,760
Tell us

460
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,719
when you have a clear answer,

461
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,000
Dr. Ningning,

462
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
we've made up our mind.

463
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
We don't have to think about it.

464
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,479
We'll let Dr. Ruan do it.

465
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,359
Don't play games.

466
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,640
Dr. Ruan, did you do it?

467
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,439
Why did you ask me to operate on you?

468
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,560
We're perfect partners.

469
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,800
Can't you take me with you?

470
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,640
Old driver, take me. Stop

471
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,199
messing around.

472
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,239
I've never been operated on before.

473
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,319
Other doctors

474
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,439
must have more experience than me.

475
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,280
What is this?

476
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm 14 years old.

477
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,479
It's my first time to participate

478
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,760
in a game design contest,

479
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,560
I have no experience.

480
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,680
I even won a grand prize.

481
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,520
When you're on the operating table,

482
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,400
you're putting your life in the hands of a doctor.

483
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,079
You know what?

484
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,040
That's why I have to choose

485
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,119
someone I trust.

486
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,160
What's wrong, Dr. Ruan?

487
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,880
You don't seem confident.

488
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Of course I do.

489
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,920
That's fine.

490
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,880
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,520
The network card.

492
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,199
Dr. Ruan, why aren't you moving?

493
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,400
It's all human.

494
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
How did I die?

495
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,119
It's okay.

496
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,079
I'll avenge you later.

497
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,800
Did that red dress

498
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,439
kill you just now?

499
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,560
Look at me.

500
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,199
Stop running!

501
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Stop running!

502
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,839
Dr. Ruan,

503
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
have you had enough fun today?

504
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
You can rest now, right?

505
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,760
No, I haven't avenged you yet.

506
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,319
You can rest after your revenge.

507
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,439
One more round

508
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,160
after revenge.

509
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,239
No way.

510
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,959
Ten minutes.

511
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,280
Dr. Ruan

512
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,079
promised me.

513
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,800
This is the last round.

514
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,839
Ning Xiang,

515
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,959
such a nice name,

516
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,520
Who gave it to you?

517
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,920
Why is my father

518
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:46,079
called Ning Xiang?

519
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,680
Because my dad said,

520
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,760
a brain that likes to think,

521
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,599
That's a good brain.

522
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,599
Good brain.

523
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,079
What can I do for you?

524
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,280
It's okay,

525
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,400
Ning Xiang,

526
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,000
Come to me.

527
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,040
I don't know what you like to eat.

528
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,119
Try them all.

529
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,439
Try it.

530
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,560
Don't worry.

531
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,319
I got it.

532
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,119
Okay,

533
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,239
I'm coming now.

534
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,040
What's wrong?

535
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,280
The old man said he would rather be picked up by someone else.

536
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,319
He said he's an hourly worker in our family.

537
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,640
When did I hire an hourly worker?

538
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,880
What does he look like?

539
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,520
It's a woman

540
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,680
in her twenties. Don't worry.

541
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,280
If it's not your son,

542
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,959
of course you're not in a hurry.

543
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,199
I know who it is.

544
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,880
Wait for me to make a call.

545
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,520
Have some of this.

546
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,280
Let's eat.

547
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
What's wrong with your phone?

548
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,599
It keeps ringing.

549
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,199
Do you want me to sleep or not?

550
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,599
Dr. Ruan,

551
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,640
who is this kid?

552
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,520
Dr. Ning's son,

553
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,560
when my mom was hospitalized,

554
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,599
You've helped so much.

555
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:58,880
Treat him to a meal,

556
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,479
Ning Zhiqian's son.

557
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,000
Give it to me

558
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,319
Hey,

559
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,280
Lei,

560
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,800
put Juanzi on the phone.

561
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,560
Give it to me.

562
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,239
She's taking care of Dr. Ning's son.

563
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,839
I didn't have time to call you.

564
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,359
What are you doing?

565
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Hey,

566
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,599
Ning Xiang is really at your place,

567
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,239
he's eating at my place,

568
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
Don't worry.

569
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,400
It could be

570
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,359
your sister's child,

571
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,959
Address,

572
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,359
hurry up.

573
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,560
Or we'll call the police.

574
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,359
The hospital can find your address.

575
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,079
Okay,

576
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,680
I'm sending it to you now,

577
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,199
Let's go

578
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,119
At Juanzi's place,

579
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,719
it looks so similar.

580
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,479
Look at your eyes.

581
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,959
She looks exactly

582
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,760
the same as your mother.

583
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,199
Turn left ahead.

584
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:01,920
Okay.

585
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,079
Turn right.

586
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,760
This child

587
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,040
must be the one you left

588
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,359
in the hospital six years ago.

589
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't talk nonsense.

590
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,359
Are you staring at me?

591
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,119
Are you staring at me?

592
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,319
Little eyes,

593
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
when staring at people,

594
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,959
Just like that little leopard,

595
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,839
Come on,

596
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,280
My first nephew,

597
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,119
Lei, be gentle!

598
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,760
This is your mother,

599
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,319
and this is your grandmother,

600
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,079
I'm your uncle.

601
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:54,920
Hurry up!

602
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,880
Call me uncle.

603
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,839
Lei,

604
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,000
don't scare the child.

605
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,959
Come on. Call me uncle.

606
00:30:58,959 --> 00:30:59,439
Tell uncle

607
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,239
to put me down.

608
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:00,920
Lei,

609
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,800
the child doesn't want to

610
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,520
let me down.

611
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,479
Call me uncle,

612
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:07,800
Lei.

613
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,920
Put it down!

614
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,880
Lei,

615
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,239
Lei,

616
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,599
Lei, put it down!

617
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,079
Call me uncle.

618
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,319
Ning Xiang,

619
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,040
Dad,

620
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,959
I'm here.

621
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,680
Juanzi, open the door.

622
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
I'm here.

623
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,520
Help me!

624
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,479
Dad, I'm here.

625
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,520
Stop it!

626
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
Dad, I'm here

627
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,040
to tell uncle to listen to me,

628
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,959
You kid,

629
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,439
open the door!

630
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,880
Give me the baby.

631
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,760
-Put the baby down. -What

632
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,119
are you doing?

633
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,959
Put the baby down!

634
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,400
What are you doing?

635
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,839
Put it down!

636
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:39,680
Let go of me.

637
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,439
Or I'll call the police.

638
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
This is my nephew. What are you doing?

639
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,560
What nephew?

640
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,880
Put the baby down.

641
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,359
He even called the police.

642
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Mom,

643
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,520
oh, my god,

644
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,719
Call the police.

645
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,560
Let the police drop their blood to identify their relatives,

646
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,880
and see whose kind this child is.

647
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:55,000
You're abducting and selling children, do you know that?

648
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,119
Dr. Ning,

649
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,760
don't make a mistake.

650
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
This is my home.

651
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,640
It's not a hospital.

652
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,079
Let's go. Let's go.

653
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,640
Lei,

654
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,359
Let's go.

655
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:01,920
All right,

656
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,599
Lei,

657
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,719
Dr. Ning, you can leave now.

658
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,280
I'll explain it to you another day.

659
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,239
Don't get me wrong.

660
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,400
Lei, that kid … Kid

661
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,040
… I.

662
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,119
Mom.

663
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,839
Where's my mom?

664
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,079
Mom, mom is home.

665
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,239
What about my grandpa?

666
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,640
Grandpa went home, too.

667
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,640
Go to bed

668
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,280
early.

669
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I want to sleep

670
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,959
with my dad today.

671
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,920
Come on.

672
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,160
You don't need to cover it.

673
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,199
I'll cover it for you.

674
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
Dad,

675
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,760
what story are you going to tell today?

676
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,319
What story do you want to hear today?

677
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,880
You hurt your hand today.

678
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,839
Let me tell you a story.

679
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,359
Okay What story are you going to tell me?

680
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,199
Kitten looking for a hole

681
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,000
Come on,

682
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,119
One day, Kitten grew up.

683
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,479
It needs to be

684
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
like its mother,

685
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,040
-Catch a mouse. -Cat went

686
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
to look

687
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,560
for a mouse.

688
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,560
And then?

689
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,640
He asked his mother,

690
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,520
where is the mouse?

691
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,040
Mom said,

692
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,359
"The mouse is in the cave. ",

693
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,199
I'm sleepy.

694
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,479
I'm sleepy.

695
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,760
Dad, I haven't heard enough. Let's talk about it.

696
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,400
I'll tell you after I take a break.

697
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,319
Get some sleep.

698
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,760
Okay, go to sleep.

699
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,359
Dad, don't go.

700
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,879
I didn't expect

701
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,199
Juanzi to be

702
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,080
Ning Xiang's biological mother,

703
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,600
This is such a vulgar plot. I'll see you

704
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
in a long time.

705
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,520
Even if she asked

706
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,159
about Ning Xiang's background again,

707
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,159
You're giving him clothes again.

708
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
No one thought about that

709
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,679
either. When I called her,

710
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm still thinking,

711
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,800
there's only a 1% chance.

712
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,639
But there's nothing strange about that.

713
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,800
This is a hospital,

714
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
where good and evil are mixed up every day.

715
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
It's a story that tests human nature.

716
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,239
When I asked Ning Zhiqian that day,

717
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,080
he suddenly mentioned remarriage to me. What do you mean?

718
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,919
See if he likes me now.

719
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,280
You're brave.

720
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,399
What did he say?

721
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,360
He didn't mean to answer.

722
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,520
What happened next?

723
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,360
Then I stopped talking about black and white.

724
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,080
Ask him again.

725
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,760
You can hide from the first grade

726
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,879
and the fifteenth grade,

727
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,639
I don't want to ask him.

728
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,919
I finally got it in the past seven years.

729
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,719
Whoever takes the initiative loses the initiative.

730
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,800
I don't want to be led by him.

731
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,560
You've improved.

732
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,479
Didn't I tell you

733
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:25,560
not to come to the hospital if you're fine?

734
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,159
Isn't that Cheng Zhouyu?

735
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,399
Who's that woman on the side?

736
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm not feeling well.

737
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,879
Patient,

738
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Let's go.

739
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,840
What's wrong with you?

740
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:35,919
What's wrong with you?

741
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,560
It hurts here.

742
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,679
This doesn't look like an ordinary patient, does it?

743
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,760
Is it another cheesy plot?

744
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,919
Dysmenorrhea?

745
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,040
Let's go.

746
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,760
-I'll get you some

747
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,159
medicine. -No,

748
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,479
I haven't been here for more than two months.

749
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,760
Come with me.

750
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,239
Go in and see for yourself.

751
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,439
I've already said hello.

752
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,479
We'll find the result later.

753
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,320
Just let me know.

754
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,879
Okay.

755
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,679
Come in

756
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,719
Cheng,

757
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
why are you on our floor?

758
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:28,959
Nothing.

759
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Doctor,

760
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,120
what's wrong with me?

761
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,479
Shen Chunyan,

762
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,679
go and do these tests first.

763
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:54,479
You are.

764
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,199
Dr. Cheng's relative

765
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,879
from his hometown,

766
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,719
I'm his fiancée.

767
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,520
I didn't expect Dr. Cheng to be such a person.

768
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,760
Luckily, Dr. Ding didn't believe him.

769
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Otherwise, you'll be on a thief boat.

770
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
Have you seen

771
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,399
Dr. Cheng's fiancée before?

772
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:19,919
I've never heard of it.

773
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,280
She seems to be pregnant.

774
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,520
Really?

775
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,679
He's not that kind of person.

776
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,520
How long have you known him?

777
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,800
Do you know him well?

778
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,080
You know each other but you don't know the heart.

779
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,479
Then you know him better.

780
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,879
I don't understand.

781
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,360
I don't know anything about it.

782
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,639
Dr. Cheng

783
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,719
believes you.

784
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,760
Ding,

785
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,159
let me explain.

786
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:57,800
Don't pull me.

787
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Disgusting. I can be

788
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,000
misunderstood by others.

789
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,360
You can't misunderstand me.

790
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,399
You're going to be a father.

791
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,520
Can you be more responsible?

792
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,399
Stop pretending to be single and hooking up with girls.

793
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,000
Who's going to be a father?

794
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,879
I'm really single.

795
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:11,959
I'm not lying.

796
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,399
Get out of the way.

797
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,800
She's not pregnant. Okay,

798
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,040
even if she is,

799
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,399
That child can't be mine.

800
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:19,959
She and I are not together.

801
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,000
You are green.

802
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,199
I didn't expect you to be such a loser.

803
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,199
Please trust me, okay?

804
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:25,879
I have no feelings

805
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,360
for her at all.

806
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,280
If you don't have feelings,

807
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:31,360
you'll get pregnant.

808
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,520
Bad guy,

809
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,000
Ding,

810
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,840
I can't explain it clearly in a few words.

811
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,360
To put it simply,

812
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,199
she's my fiancée.

813
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,000
But it's a doll kiss.

814
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
Do you know that

815
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,919
parents forced marriage

816
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:42,679
without feelings?

817
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:44,959
I told you

818
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:45,959
to be careful.

819
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,280
Xiaoding.

820
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,639
Xiaoding. Xiaoding.

821
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:14,959
Dr. Ning,

822
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,000
Dr. Ruan,

823
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:17,959
Have a seat.

824
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,080
Waiter,

825
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:24,439
bring up

826
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,840
what I just ordered.

827
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
This way.

828
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,439
All this way.

829
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,639
This way, too.

830
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,159
Thank you.

831
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,320
Have some coffee

832
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
and some cake,

833
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,719
Just say what you want to say.

834
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:52,120
Can you give my baby

835
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,159
back to me,

836
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,439
I know what I said

837
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,320
is not right.

838
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,679
But no matter what,

839
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm his biological mother,

840
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
My biological mother.

841
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,679
I know.

842
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,040
In the past six years,

843
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,320
you've been very kind to him,

844
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,959
Dr. Ning,

845
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,120
I don't know how to thank you.

846
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,199
I'll kowtow to you.

847
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,760
Thank you.

848
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:30,959
Thank you.

849
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:31,959
Stand up and say something.

850
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:32,719
Thank you.

851
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,360
Get up first.

852
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,879
Thank you.

853
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,879
Stand up and talk.

854
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,159
I have to make it clear today.

855
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,800
Dr. Ning,

856
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,159
I know that for Ning Xiang's sake,

857
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,280
I've never been married.

858
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,600
It's not easy for you

859
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,239
to take care of the child alone.

860
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,800
Plus, you're so busy with work,

861
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,639
before 7 pm,

862
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,239
It's impossible to get home.

863
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,520
If there's an operation tonight

864
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,239
or something,

865
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,919
I'd rather be alone at home,

866
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,159
you say,

867
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,439
What does that mean?

868
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,199
He still needs to look for you

869
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,239
tonight. We don't know

870
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,080
if you're his biological mother.

871
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,040
Let's talk about it after testing DNA first.

872
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,919
Dr. Ning,

873
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,959
that's not what I meant.

874
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:21,479
Walk slowly.

875
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,760
Your hand is still injured.

876
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,719
Don't be mad at yourself.

877
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,439
You also think that

878
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:34,439
I'm not a good father.

879
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,159
I don't think so.

880
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,600
Go back to the hospital.

881
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,919
I'll give myself a holiday today.

882
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,719
Hey,

883
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
Mom, it's me.

884
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,159
Ning Xiang,

885
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:02,959
what's wrong?

886
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:04,760
Dad is sick

887
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,239
and grandpa is not at home.

888
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,719
Can you come over?

889
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,120
Okay, I'll be right there.

890
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:24,840
Mom,

891
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,080
what's wrong with Dad?

892
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,280
Dad had a high fever just now,

893
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,239
and when I touched it,

894
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,760
It's very hot.

895
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:34,639
Okay, let me see.

896
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,719
Did you put this antipyretic sticker on your dad?

897
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:50,040
There's nothing for adults at home,

898
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,439
so I can only put mine on my dad.

899
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:56,199
Get me a cup of hot water.

900
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,159
Be careful.

901
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:04,239
Mom,

902
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,280
tell me to drink more water.

903
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,399
Good boy.

904
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:09,159
When I had a fever,

905
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,439
my dad told me to drink more water.

906
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,120
Come on,

907
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,600
Help me hold my father's head.

908
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:19,800
Miss Ning.

909
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,959
Miss Ning.

910
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,879
Mr. Ning,

911
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:28,280
why are you here?

912
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,919
You have a fever.

913
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,120
Get up and take the medicine.

914
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,439
Open your mouth.

915
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,760
Mom,

916
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,439
Dad's heart is beating.

917
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,959
This is how you usually

918
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:06,520
take care of Dad,

919
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,879
He's always single.

920
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:14,399
Can I not take care of him?

921
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:16,239
Come on,

922
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,520
Let's go.

923
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,479
Go to bed, okay?

924
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:39,320
Go to sleep.

925
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,600
I'll take care of Dad.

926
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,000
What's wrong?

927
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm worried about taking care of her.

928
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm worried about Dad.

929
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,520
What if I leave in the future,

930
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,919
and no one takes care of Dad?

931
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,879
Silly boy,

932
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:00,439
where are you going?

933
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
My biological mother came to see me.
