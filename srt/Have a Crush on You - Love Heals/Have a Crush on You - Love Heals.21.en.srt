Marry me.

Marry him!

Dr. Ruan.

15
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,600
Why didn't you tell us earlier

16
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
that you are
Deputy Manager Ning's ex-wife?

17
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,730
That's right.

18
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,440
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

19
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,970
Ruan Liuzheng!

20
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,290
You've fooled us

21
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,690
about your relationship with Mr. Ning.

22
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,570
The answer to this riddle
is too shocking.

23
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,200
That's right.

24
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,290
I've pursued Mr. Ning

25
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,290
in front of you for so long.

26
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,250
This is so awkward!

27
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,360
You brat.

28
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Are you holding a grudge against me?

29
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,200
How's the result?

30
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,810
Is Set A worth it?

31
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,440
That script is too romantic.

32
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,290
So, I edited it myself.

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:54,760
It doesn't matter.

34
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,040
Did Liuzheng say yes?

35
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,730
Yes.

36
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,290
Why are you still unsatisfied then?

37
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,690
I'll make the final payment then.

38
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,850
Make the final payment?

39
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,920
Ask him to give me a discount.

40
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,730
Don't make the final payment.

41
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,850
Why are you all alone here?

42
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,570
I have to hang up.

43
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,480
Everyone is looking for you.

44
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,290
Come. Let's go.

45
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,010
Let's go.

46
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,640
Head Nurse.

47
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,850
Didn't I tell you

48
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
to ask Liuzheng to come here alone?

49
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,250
Why did you

50
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,570
bring so many people?

51
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,850
I'm doing you a favour.

52
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,920
A proposal is something major.

53
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,090
You can't keep it
between just the two of you.

54
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,600
The whole world has to witness it.

55
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,040
Didn't you see

56
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,570
how happy Liuzheng is today?

57
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,920
Ning.

58
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,640
Well done!

59
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,640
Let's dance. Come on.

60
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,880
The door is opened.

61
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,920
When did you do this?

62
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,320
So pretty. There are even flowers here.

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,730
Actually, these are...

64
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,090
I'm so happy.

65
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,640
I never thought

66
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,440
that you would say those words.

67
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,440
Today, you said

68
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,730
that when I was gone,

69
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,090
the sky lost its colour.

70
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,530
And that you couldn't let go of me
for the past six years.

71
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,250
Actually, I couldn't let go of you too.

72
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,160
Do you know?

73
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,480
For the past six years,
I had regretted it.

74
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,760
I really regretted
filing a divorce with you

75
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,290
so recklessly back then.

76
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,040
On the day we were divorced,

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,130
when I was packing my bag,

78
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,090
I fantasised about you running to me
to hug me.

79
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,920
I wouldn't leave
if you had hugged me even once.

80
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,810
That day,

81
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,360
I wanted to hug you.

82
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,250
But I didn't have the courage.

83
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,530
I was afraid that you would reject me.

84
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,010
Why would I reject you?

85
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,320
I love you so much.

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,530
Six years.

87
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,010
Finally, you've come to me.

88
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,290
Finally,

89
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,200
you say that you love me.

90
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Say it again.

91
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,690
I love you.

92
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,320
Say it again.

93
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,320
I love you.

94
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,290
Say it again.

95
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,530
I love you!

96
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
So,

97
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,530
after this,

98
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,880
can you not lose your temper
with me anymore?

99
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,810
Yes.

100
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,290
Can you

101
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,880
humour me after this?

102
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,250
No problem.

103
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,440
Can you give me

104
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,920
more surprises after this?

105
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,530
Of course I can.

106
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
Do I look pretty today?

107
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,320
Yes.

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,730
I think

109
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,640
the whole hospital

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,370
will be talking

111
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,370
about us by now.

112
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,320
They won't.

113
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,090
Of course they will.

114
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
Do you want to bet on it?

115
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,200
What are we going to bet on?

116
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,200
Five yuan.

117
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,410
See?

118
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,680
Nothing is going on.
Everything is as usual.

119
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,050
May Dr. Ning and Dr. Ruan
have a lifetime of love

120
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,090
and happiness!

121
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,290
Congratulations!

122
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,850
Thank you.

123
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,970
Congratulations.

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,440
Thank you.

125
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
What are you doing?

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
What time is it now?

127
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,320
It's time to work.

128
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,970
What will other departments think
if they see us like this?

129
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,440
Fortunately,

130
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,530
fate has brought you back to me.

131
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,200
I'll accept your blessings
and congratulations.

132
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,440
But don't do something useless like this

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,490
during work hours.

134
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,090
You are my forever.

135
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,410
Please say yes

136
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,730
and marry me.

137
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Turn off the computer.

138
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,730
Ask the cleaners to clean this place up.

139
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,290
Hurry up.

140
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,120
Thank you.

141
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,240
Thank you.

142
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,200
Hurry up.

143
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,410
Let's go.

144
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Why did you lose your temper
this morning?

145
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,760
They were just trying to be nice.

146
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,760
I'm sure it was planned by Wu Xiaofan.

147
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,640
He's almost 30.

148
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,090
But he still doesn't have
a sense of propriety.

149
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,730
I really think that it was fine.

150
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,120
Don't make a big deal out of it.

151
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
They made the office a mess.

152
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,490
And with those glitters

153
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,880
all over me.

154
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
It was so uncomfortable.

155
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,050
What was it
that you were uncomfortable about?

156
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,050
Why do you have to do this?

157
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,320
You must be tired after work.

158
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,050
Ning Xiang is not here.

159
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,610
We just need

160
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,000
to eat something simple.

161
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,490
Or we can order food delivery.

162
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,200
That kind of food is oily and salty.

163
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
And it's unhealthy

164
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,290
and bad for the stomach.

165
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
Here. Give it a taste.

166
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,640
I made it with the previous cookbook.

167
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,170
I even added some nourishing ingredients
for the stomach.

168
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,410
How is it?

169
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,680
Is it good?

170
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,410
To be honest,

171
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,880
you don't have
to go through the trouble.

172
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,730
When you were gone,

173
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,120
I ate well too.

174
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,880
The soup is really good.

175
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
It's warming up my stomach.

176
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,760
Drink more then.

177
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,610
When are we going

178
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,930
to take our wedding photos?

179
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,880
Now, we need to make reservations
in advance to do that.

180
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,170
When are we going
to take the wedding photos?

181
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,930
Do we still need to take wedding photos?

182
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,850
The ones that we took
are quite nice already, right?

183
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,200
The big one that we had
at the head of the bed

184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,800
is being kept under the bed
all this while.

185
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,680
I've kept it well.

186
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,090
We can just take it out and hang it up.

187
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,050
And the ring too.

188
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,440
I've kept the ring.

189
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,930
Right? Don't you think
that it's quite troublesome?

190
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,850
Yes, it is.

191
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,680
Right?

192
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,880
The hospital is so full now.

193
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,320
It's better to spend
our free time resting.

194
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,530
No need to do those useless things.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,050
Where are you going?

196
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,290
Continue with your dinner.

197
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,850
If you want to take wedding photos,

198
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,760
we can squeeze out some time to do so.

199
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,530
When do you want
to take the wedding photos?

200
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,760
The soup is so delicious today.

201
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,440
Can you stop laughing?

202
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,880
No. Both of you are so funny.

203
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,970
To be honest,

204
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,090
Ning Zhiqian is not wrong too.

205
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,410
Are the two of you in the photo

206
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,370
under the bed?

207
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,050
Is the ring made to your size?

208
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,530
If the answer is yes,

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,760
why do you have to waste the money

210
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,200
and time to redo them?

211
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,930
But I think

212
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,930
those things

213
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,610
represent a failed marriage.

214
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,880
This time, I want to start anew.

215
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,410
It's not like we can't
reuse those things.

216
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,370
And I'm not adamant
that we can't use them.

217
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,200
But lately, I really can't accept

218
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,090
his attitude towards me.

219
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,800
He's like a totally different person
compared

220
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,850
to the one who proposed to me.

221
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,410
Deputy Manager Ning.

222
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,290
Come. Take a seat over here.

223
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,490
You are going to remarry him soon.

224
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,200
You should just be honest with him.

225
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,000
Have you eaten?

226
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,530
I'll eat later.

227
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,730
Let me show you this.

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,760
What is it?

229
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,930
This is a shop that's opened

230
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,680
by Xiao'er's friend.

231
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,370
If we want to go there,

232
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,610
they can arrange
the time for us at any time.

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,560
Even at midnight.

234
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,760
What about this Saturday?

235
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,680
Do you want to do it
in the afternoon or at night?

236
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,290
A Korean-style shop?

237
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,170
You like this kind of style, right?

238
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,320
It has been six years.

239
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,640
Everyone will change.

240
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,930
What kind of style do you like now?

241
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,760
European or Chinese?

242
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,090
What about you?

243
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,530
What kind of style do you like?

244
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,730
I don't mind.

245
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,560
Yes.

246
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,490
That has always been your style.

247
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,880
You are the main character
of the wedding photos.

248
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,530
We just need to make sure
that you look nice.

249
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,370
Isn't that right?

250
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,200
We can look at the options.

251
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,970
What about this?

252
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,170
Not this one.

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,610
This one.

254
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,520
This one looks refreshing.

255
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,250
This looks nice.

256
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
We'll choose this one then.

257
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,490
It has been so many years.

258
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,250
And you still like
the old-fashioned style.

259
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,010
Didn't you buy any fish?

260
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,250
Here.

261
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,970
I want to eat Chinese sauerkraut fish.

262
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,850
Ask him to make it for you tomorrow.

263
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,490
Hello, Mr. Ning.

264
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,320
Next month, right?

265
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,130
Let me discuss it with Zhiqian then.

266
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

267
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,850
Let me tell you something.

268
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,850
Go ahead.

269
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,040
Well.

270
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,280
We are getting married too suddenly.

271
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,770
So, we couldn't make reservations
for our wedding banquet.

272
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,200
But then,
your father contacted the hotel

273
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,370
where Jiahua held
his engagement party last time.

274
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,090
They say that they have
an empty slot next month.

275
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,970
Sure.

276
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,370
He's quite reliable this time.

277
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,520
Are you okay with the date on the 14th?

278
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,650
I don't mind.

279
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,890
It's the 14th of the month.

280
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,040
The 14th of the month.

281
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,610
Foreigners celebrate
Valentine's Day on that day.

282
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,920
And on the 24th, they celebrate

283
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,440
Christmas Eve, right?

284
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,920
We are doctors.

285
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,090
Don't be superstitious.

286
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,770
It'll be fine.

287
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,320
Okay.

288
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Let's check out the venue tomorrow then.

289
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,200
Let's see how many people it can fit.

290
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,850
I can't do that tomorrow.

291
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,200
I have to work at the Second
Affiliated Hospital tomorrow morning.

292
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,490
Go to work then.

293
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,130
I'll go with Mr. Ning.

294
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,520
Do you have any requirements
for the tables?

295
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,770
Up to you.

296
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
Later, I'll give you my card.

297
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,890
You can make all the decisions, okay?

298
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,680
Okay?

299
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,320
All of our wedding halls

300
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,770
have been reserved

301
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
for the next few months.

302
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,610
This is the only one left.
Please take a look.

303
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,370
This hall

304
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,280
can cater to 50 tables at most.

305
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,850
If you reserve 30 tables with us now,

306
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,010
we will waive the entrance fee
for the wedding planner.

307
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,370
Besides that,
we'll provide a free emcee for you.

308
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,770
Not bad.

309
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,560
This is quite good.

310
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,560
That emcee last time

311
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,490
was quite good

312
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,610
at keeping the atmosphere lively.

313
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,650
Fifty tables?
Do we have that many people?

314
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,730
Yes.

315
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,160
Take a look over here.

316
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,090
Look.

317
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,130
I've always treated him like my own son.

318
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,010
Now, he's getting married.

319
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,770
We should invite all
of Zhiqian classmates, friends,

320
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,130
- colleagues
- Are you satisfied with this?

321
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,520
and all of his relatives

322
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,490
from his family

323
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,040
to attend the wedding.

324
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,970
Let me tell you.
30 tables won't be enough.

325
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,730
Yes.

326
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,010
We should invite
all the relatives and friends

327
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
to make it livelier.

328
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,490
Yes.

329
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,680
- Isn't it too grand?
- Please wait.

330
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,320
I have to take a call.

331
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
Of course not.

332
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
This is just nice.

333
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,370
Liuzheng.

334
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,890
Are you satisfied with this venue?

335
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,920
If you like it,
we have to reserve it at once.

336
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
It'll be Chinese New Year soon.

337
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,010
Many people

338
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,730
will be getting married.

339
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,680
If you hesitate,

340
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
we will lose this venue.

341
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,850
Okay.

342
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,010
Let me call Zhiqian

343
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,970
to discuss with him.

344
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,400
Wait.

345
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,440
There's no need to discuss it with him.

346
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,440
I know my son.

347
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,010
You can just decide on it.

348
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,490
You decide.

349
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,610
That's it then.

350
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,890
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,490
This hall has just been reserved

352
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,040
for the 14th of December.

353
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,650
Our customer has just paid
the deposit for it.

354
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,560
I'll pay the deposit now.

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Our customer has already paid.

356
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
Maybe you can choose another day?

357
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
Help me check for available dates then.

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,250
Please find a hall for us.

359
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,970
Okay.

360
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,130
But the holidays and weekends
for the next few months

361
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,160
are almost fully booked too.

362
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,970
We have an available date here.

363
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,040
The 5th of April.

364
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,200
Okay. We'll take it.

365
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,010
The 5th of April.

366
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,040
Wait.

367
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,400
That's the Qingming Festival.

368
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,680
How could you suggest it?

369
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,730
What kind of a person are you?

370
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,010
Why are you so bad?

371
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,320
Why did you choose that date for us?

372
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,200
How awful.

373
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,560
No. You...

374
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,400
I really didn't know.

375
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,770
You are too mean.

376
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,090
Did you do it on purpose?

377
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,160
This is your job.

378
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,610
How can you not know

379
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,090
what date is it?

380
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,520
Sir.

381
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,010
Ignore him.

382
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,610
He's too mean.

383
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,160
This is not how you do business!

384
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,200
I can't believe you.

385
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,400
Madam Liu, are you okay?

386
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
Be careful.

387
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,920
You are not young anymore.
If you fall down,

388
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,490
Lean on me.

389
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,250
you'll suffer.

390
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm so mad that I'm feeling dizzy.

391
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,370
Wait. Let me stand here for a while.

392
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,160
Do you feel better now?

393
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,320
You scared me.

394
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,770
Liuzheng.

395
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,800
Don't worry.

396
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,280
I have many friends.

397
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,850
I'll ask them

398
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,850
to keep an ear out
for any available slots.

399
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,610
We

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,320
will do our best
to give you a great wedding.

401
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,010
Thank you, Madam Liu.

402
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

403
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,560
Don't worry.

404
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,650
Let's go.

405
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,200
Be careful.

406
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,650
Are you okay?

407
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm fine.

408
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,650
Hello.

409
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,920
Where are you?

410
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,890
Come and pick me up.

411
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,010
Okay. Coming.

(Wanda Realm)

413
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,650
Did you manage to book the venue?

414
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,130
No.

415
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,610
What happened?

416
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,250
Let's go home first.

417
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,370
We can talk at home.

418
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Your phone is ringing.

419
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,730
You can pick it up.

420
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,250
I think it's from Mr. Ning.

421
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,680
I think he wants to talk
about the wedding banquet.

422
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,370
You should pick it up.

423
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,320
I don't want to talk to him.

424
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,370
Hello, Mr. Ning.

425
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,560
Really?

426
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,130
Okay. Send it to my e-mail then.

427
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,850
Bye.

428
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,010
Here. Get up for a while.

429
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,040
What is it?

430
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,130
I need to check something.

431
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,090
He has looked up some hotels
that cater to wedding banquets.

432
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,160
He has sent them to my e-mail.

433
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,250
Let's discuss it and give him an answer.

434
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,250
You can make the decision.

435
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,520
Go and keep an eye on the fire then.

(Nurse Station)

444
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Hello, Liuzheng. What is it?

445
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,970
I want to ask you.

446
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,650
During the proposal,

447
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,200
did Ning Zhiqian invite Wu and Mei

448
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,520
or were you the one who did it?

449
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,370
I was the one who did it.

450
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,130
The more the merrier, right?

451
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,620
(Ask the girl to stay for end credits,
play the proposal video on the screen.)

452
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,610
So, Ning Zhiqian

453
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,090
didn't know that they would
be there, right?

454
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
Why are you asking me that?

455
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,090
Just tell me.

456
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,560
Ning Zhiqian

457
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,730
didn't know about it.

458
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,130
Okay.

459
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,250
I got it now.

460
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,320
It's time to work.

461
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,490
What will other departments think
if they see us like this?

462
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,890
I'll accept your blessings
and congratulations.

463
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,090
But don't do something useless like this

464
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,130

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,090
It's for my future wife.

472
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,010
Of course I have to put in some money.

473
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,610
That's quite the effort.

474
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,200
Those candles, balloons
and fresh flowers

475
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,610
are prepared by others.

476
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,490
Even the script is written by another.

477
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,490
No. I did change the script.

478
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,400
His script is too cloyingly sweet.

479
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
I didn't use his script.

480
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,970
If you knew

481
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,520
that so many of your colleagues
would be there,

482
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,250
you wouldn't be able to say
those romantic words, right?

483
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
No wonder you were so mad

484
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,520
the next day at the office.

485
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,850
You felt ashamed for proposing to me.

486
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,250
Nonsense. You think too much.

487
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,400
I did think too much.

488
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,370
I thought that I could change you.

489
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,890
You can never change someone.

490
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
Yes. I admit

491
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,920
that I hired a planning company
to help me.

492
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,970
But I'm really sincere towards you.

493
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,440
I spent tens of thousands on it.

494
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,370
Tens of thousands?

495
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,970
Why did you spend so much on it?

496
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
It cost a few months of your salary.

497
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,490
Isn't that what you want?

498
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,200
What I want is your sincerity.

499
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,920
I don't need a wedding banquet.

500
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't even need
to take wedding photos.

501
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,090
But I want to know
if your love for me is true or not.

502
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,280
Of course I love you.

503
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,970
Otherwise, why would I do it?

504
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,130
A romantic surprise.

505
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,010
I gave you everything

506
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,250
that you wanted, right?

507
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,200
You haven't changed at all
even after six years.

508
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,200
Says who?

509
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,490
I've been working on it, right?

510
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,250
Do you really need me?

511
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,280
Of course I need you.

512
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,920
You just need someone to accompany you

513
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,280
and raise your kid together with you.

514
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,400
Isn't it good to have a stable life?

515
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,370
There's nothing wrong with it.

516
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,130
But it's not something that I want.

517
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,680
No. What do you want then?

518
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,440
I just want an equal relationship.

519
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,560
It was not equal six years ago.

520
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,650
And it's not equal now.

521
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,650
Enough.

522
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,010
Stop mentioning things
from six years ago.

523
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,440
Let go of me.

525
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:40,850
Let go of me.

526
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,730
Don't be mad.

527
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,650
Don't touch me.

528
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,890
No.

Why are you here

instead of staying home?

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
You are even drinking.

536
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,770

What did Ning Zhiqian do to you?

He wants to register our marriage.

540
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,770
Register your marriage?

541
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,320
Isn't that a good thing?

542
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,800
Do you think

543
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,800
I can have a good married life with him?

544
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,800
Will we divorce again

545
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
just like six years ago?

546
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,970
Excuse me.

547
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,160
Why are you asking me that question?

548
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
How would I know?

549
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,610
But let me be honest.

550
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,890
I don't know if you'll regret

551
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,440
being with him now.

552
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,730
But if you are not with him now,

553
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,850
I know that you'll regret it.

554
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,490
Can you say that you didn't regret it
even once in the past six years?

555
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,800
Why would I regret it?

556
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,440
Sometimes.

557
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
From what I can see,

558
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,770
you still can't let him go.

559
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,650
Why don't you start a new relationship

560
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,650
with someone else?

561
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,320
You are a firecracker.

562
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,850
You are gentle when it comes to others.

563
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,400
But you have a quick temper
when it comes to Ning Zhiqian.

564
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Am I going to be stuck

565
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,440
with him my whole life?

566
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,920
Just stick with him then.

567
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
Just accept it.

568
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,800
Besides, it's not that bad too.

569
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,770
Do you know?

570
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,970
There are two kinds of tragedies
in this world.

571
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,040
The first one is
you can't get what you want.

572
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,090
And the other one is

573
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,920
getting someone that you want.

574
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,400
But then, it's different
from what you actually want.

575
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,650
Do you understand?

576
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,770
What are you talking about?

577
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,490
I don't know.

578
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,090
Forget it.

579
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,850
Stop drinking.

580
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,970
This is enough.

When are you going
to register your marriage?

Tomorrow.

Tomorrow? Why are you still here then?

00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,850
in a marriage?

679
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,000
It's not wrong if you say that to me.

680
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,370
But it won't work

681
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,520
on Liuzheng.

682
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,040
Everyone has

683
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,410
a different understanding of love.

684
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,760
Love

685
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,370
is just the cocktail party effect

686
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,280
of dopamine,

687
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,240
phenylethylamine

688
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,930
and oxytocin

689
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,450
that are secreted by the brain.

690
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,850
This kind of effect

691
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,650
will lose its potency

692
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,890
after around 18 months.

693
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,130
If we follow your theory,

694
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,130
it'll still take 18 months.

695
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,930
You can't try to do it the easy way.

696
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,480
Moreover,

697
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,450
you've already been convicted
six years ago.

698
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,040
You can't fall into the same hole twice.

699
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,960
How can you compare now

700
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,040
with six years ago?

701
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,320
Tell me then.

702
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,800
Besides your physical strength,

703
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,480
how are you different
from six years ago?

704
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,130
I'm totally different.

705
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,650
I think we suit each other

706
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,170
even better now.

707
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:20,890
Qian.

708
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,520
You have to pay back what you owe.

709
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,000
To be honest,

710
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,800
you owe Liuzheng a first love.

711
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,170
How can I pay her back?

712
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,760
That Package A

713
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,090
worked wonder, right?

714
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,210
Stop talking about Package A with me.

715
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,480
It's all its fault.

716
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,560
I am me.

717
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,520
If you don't think I'm good enough,

718
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,930
don't marry me then.

719
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,320
It's fine.

720
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,690
Do you think she will be bothered by it?

721
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,800
Whether or not this marriage will work,

722
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,650
it's totally up to you.

723
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,370
The door is opened.

724
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,410
You are at home.

725
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
I called you a few times.

726
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,040
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

727
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
What happened?

728
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,450
I called your mother-in-law.

729
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,280
She said she didn't know

730
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,090
that you were going
to register your marriage today.

731
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,210
She also said

732
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,040
that Liuzheng has been lying down
the whole day due to a fever.

733
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,720
Have you registered

734
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,890
your marriage or not?

735
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,760
No.

736
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,650
Do you know that she's sick?

737
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,090
Now I know.

738
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,520
I want to ask you a question.

739
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,850
What is it? Ask me.

740
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,850
Why did you

741
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,690
marry my mum back then?

742
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,520
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

743
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,610
When you married her,

744
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,090
did you love her?

745
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,720
I don't know how
to answer that question.

746
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,040
Your mum and I

747
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,930
met on the prairie of Inner Mongolia.

748
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,610
Back then,

749
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,610
she was working at the frontier.

750
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,480
That day,

751
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,090
she came towards me

752
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,610
on a horse in a white coat.

753
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
When I first saw her,

754
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,170
I knew

755
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,040
that she was the woman
that I wanted to marry.

756
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,610
Why did

757
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,520
it change

758
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,320
after that?

759
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,560
It was all my fault.

760
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,450
I was not a good man.

761
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,650
I want to know

762
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,040
the real reason behind it.
