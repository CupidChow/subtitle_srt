Where have you guys been
these past two days?

We couldn't reach you.

What's going on here?

48
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,490
I just haven't come
to see my mother in a few days.

49
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,050
How did she end up like this?

50
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,580
Your mother fell down in the stairwell

51
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,490
and fainted.

52
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,700
We had to operate on her.

53
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,820
She fell and fainted?

This isn't right.

My mother was fine in the hospital.

I know.

58
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,610
You were resentful and did this

59
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,100
because I complained about you.

60
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
You abused my mother!

Well, we can't just let him attack us.

83
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,490
Besides, he assaulted us first.

84

That's enough from you two.

Now I have to clean up your mess.

88

Take this as a lesson, everyone.

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,700
Don't engage
when something like this happens.

where the vitals are?

95

what's wrong with you?

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,140
Didn't I tell you to get out of there?

97
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,490
Why did you stay?

98
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,580
To let him catch you?

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,580
I wanted to help you.

100
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,260
There must've been other ways
to resolve this.

101
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,330
Why couldn't you hold back?

102
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,650
How?

103
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,930

Thanks?

108
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,700
For what?

109
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,860
For helping you fight him off?

110
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,170
You could say that.

111
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,770
You're the one not to be underestimated.

112
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,210
You said all those things this morning.

113
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,860
You were completely different
from your usual self.

114

Even a rabbit
will bite when it's cornered.

115

No need to thank me.

116
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,260
I didn't do it because I like you.

We're all doctors.

118

If that could happen to you today,

119

it might happen to me next time.

120
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,020
Helping you is helping myself.

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,330
Okay.

122

But still, thank you.

123

from my observation today.

124

What?

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,300

No.

No?

128
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,650
He got so upset because of you.

129
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,860
Do you think that's normal?

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,890
It sounded like he was lecturing you,

131
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,420
but something seemed off.

132
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,100
How so?

133
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,330
Ruan Liuzheng, listen here.

134
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,330
I know you like him.

135
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,740
And you might've beaten me to him.

136
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,420
Are you laughing at me?

137

No.

138
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,420
But I'm not worried.

139
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,980
I'm a person of honor and integrity.

140

I don't hide my intentions.

141
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,010
As long as he is single,

142
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,500
I have the right to pursue him.

143
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,740
Got it?

144
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,690
Got it.

take disciplinary actions against you?

No.

Why don't you drive?

Did you miss me?

174
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,560
I missed you too.

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,770
Mom,

176
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,920
I have a present for you.

177
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,650
What is it?

178
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,530
My teacher said
Mother's Day is on Sunday.

179
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,920
This is for you.

180
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,560
That's so nice.

181
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,360
Thank you.

182
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,480
Mom, if Dad gave you flowers,

183
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,040
would you accept him too?

184
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,090
Ning Xiang,

185
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,970
if you keep saying nonsense,

186
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,330
your mom won't pick you up anymore.

187
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,720
You're mean, Dad.

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,680
You're so pretty, Mom.

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
I love you.

190
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,120
Oh, what a sweet talker you are.

191
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,720
Bounce and bounce
goes the yellow flower.

192
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,850
Bouncing to the sky.

193
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,450
Mom.

194
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,560
Liuzheng.

195
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
(23 Huangxian Road)
You're home early today.

196
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,890
Who brought you home?

197
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,330
Zhiqian?

198
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,010
(Huangxian Road)
Mom.

199
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
This is my son.

200
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,920
- Son?
- Greet your grandma.

201
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,010
Grandma.

202
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,920
Hello.

203
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,650
I'm Ning Xiang.

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Ning Xiang?

205
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,800
You're a handsome boy.

206
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,650
How old are you?

207
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,480
Six.

208
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,160
Let's not stand out here.

209
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,090
Let's go inside.

210
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,040
Come on.

211
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,210
Dad,

212
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,560
Grandma is my mom's mom, right?

213
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,680
Yes.

214
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,210
Come in.

215
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,560
Dear,

216
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,970
look who's here.

217
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,850
Oh, Zhiqian is here.

218
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,240
And who is this little boy?

219
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm Ning Xiang.

220
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm six.

221
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,650
This is my son.

222
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,530
Ning Xiang?

223
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,160
Six?

224
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,330
Greet your grandpa.

225
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,360
Grandpa.

226
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,120
Hello.

227
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,800
Come in.

228
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,010
You have gold fish!

229
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
- Yes.
- Ning Xiang!

230
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,530
- Don't be naughty.
- Here.

231
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,360
Like this.

232
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,450
You can feed them.

233
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,240
Zhiqian,

234
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
will you have dinner with us?

235
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,040
Mom,

236
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,040
Mr. Ning has something to do tonight.

237
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Don't trouble him.

238
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,530
Mom,

239
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,090
why do you call Dad "Mr. Ning"?

240
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,010
The other kids' moms call their husbands

241
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,560
"dear".

242
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,240
Right. Ning Xiang.

243
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,360
- I'll go get changed
- Come here.

244
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,210
- and help you.
- Come here.

245
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,850
- Have a seat, Mr. Ning.
- I've got a set of Xiangqi.

246
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,330
- Let's play it.
- Have some water, Zhiqian.

247
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,160
How are you?

248
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,240
Let me tell you something.

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,770
Xiangqi has a set of rules

250
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,290
that dictate

251
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,040
how the pieces move.

252
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,650
The Horse moves diagonally of a square,
and the Elephant of a double-girds square.

253
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,000
The General doesn't leave

254
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,840
- the back garden.
- The back garden.

255
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,530
Oh, you know the rules.

256
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm taking your General!

257
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,890
No, no, no.

258
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,600
That won't do.

259
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
I must hide it.

260
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,650
- Here.
- Then, I'll take this piece.

261
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,290
(Tea)
You act fast.

262
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,850
I'll take your piece here.

263
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,090
You took another one of mine.

264
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,410
Can you remember it now?

265
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,450
Say it out loud.

266
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,450
Come.

267
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,240
The Horse moves diagonally of a square.

268
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,330
The Elephant moves diagonally
of a double-girds square.

269
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,240
The Chariot takes the straight path.
The cannon goes over the hill.

270
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,650
- Which piece is the Elephant?
- The General...

271
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,680
This one.

272
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,210
This one?

273
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,890
Yes.

274
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,210
You know it now.

275
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,650
Not bad.

276
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,410
I'll be waiting for you to come back.
It's a promise.

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Grandma, Grandpa.

278
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,330
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

279
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,120
Goodbye.

280
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,600
Goodbye, Mom.

281
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,970
Aren't you coming home with Dad and me?

282
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
Um, we'll be leaving now.

283
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,970
Okay.

284
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,330
See you, Zhiqian.

285
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,800
Goodbye.

286
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,720
Bye.

287
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
That boy is cute.

288
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
Zhiqian said he adopted him.

289
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,650
How else could he have

290
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,560
a son of that age?

291
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,010
Yes.

292
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,530
Did Zhiqian raise that boy

293
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,600
himself?

294
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
If you ask me,

295
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,010
Zhiqian has it hard.

296
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,800
Yes.

297
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,160
So we must be extra nice to him.

298
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,090
Isn't that right?

299
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,450
But this is good too.

300
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,240
He has experience for it

301
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,680
if you two ever have
your own child someday.

302
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,720
He will have a playmate too.

303
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,210
What are you talking about?

304
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,720
Zhiqian stayed unmarried all these years

305
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
because he is waiting for you.

306
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
What a lovely family
you guys would make.

307
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,650
You already have a son too.

308
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,560
What happened to your mouth?

309
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,330
It has been there all night.

310
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,600
You guys don't care about me at all.

311
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,010
Okay, okay.

312
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,240
She got injured,
and we didn't even notice.

313
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,410
I don't want to wash the dishes.
You guys do it.

314
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,450
All right.

315
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,160
She doesn't want to wash dishes
now that she's a mother?

316
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,560
You do the dishes, then.

317
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,450
I'm a mother too.

318
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Yes, yes.

319
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,530
I was prepared for this.

320
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,680
Look.

321
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,010
There are photos as proof
to go with the article.

322
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,850
That's not true at all.

323
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,800
"Neurosurgeons
At Beiya Hospital Fail To Act."

324
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,530
"Doctors Caught Getting Intimate
While Patients In Need."

325
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,890
That's a clickbait title

326
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,120
to gain attention online.

327
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,800
That's right.

328
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,680
It's all lies and slander.

329
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,890
They don't have any proof!

330
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,920
That's my phone.

331
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,480
What are you guys doing?

332
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,410
Liuzheng.

333
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,770
What's with this photo?

334
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,970
What's this?

335
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,890
Who took this photo?

336
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,680
Is that you in that photo?

337
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,410
Yes.

338
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,650
It is you?

339
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,600
No, it's not what you guys think it is.

340
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
I was just helping him
fasten his seat belt.

341
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,970
Why would you need to do that?

342
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,600
Mr. Ning wanted me to drive.

343
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,450
He was too tired.

344
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,720
He fell asleep the moment
he got into the car.

345
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,360
So I had to help him
put on his seat belt.

346
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,530
This is terrible!

347
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,440
This is slander.

348
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,410
They should sue this guy.

349
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,240
All right. That's enough gossip.

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,050
Get back to work.

351
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,290
Dr. Ding. Where's Dr. Ruan?

352
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,720
The patient in Bed 26
will be undergoing surgery.

353
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,890
We need to inform
the patient and his family

354
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,440
of the procedures to follow

355
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
and prepare for the surgery.

356
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Check his blood type,
hematuria, clotting time,

357
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,010
stool routine,
and liver and kidney function.

358
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,810
Prepare for the blood matching.

359
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,840
Notify the Anesthetic Department
of the medical consensus.

360
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,650
Okay.

361
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,290
Mr. Ning,

362
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,720
this is a big issue.

363
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,080
Aren't you worried at all?

364
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,410
Turn in your shift

365
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,410
and write your records.

366
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,570
Why are you guys still standing here?

367
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
Get back to work.

368
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Let's go.

369
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,930
His blood oxygen level dropped.
And the saturation is low.

370
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,630
(NIBP measurement)

371
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,960
Gastrointestinal bleeding.

372
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,290
Esomeprazole.

373
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,530
40mg.
Intravenous medication administration.

374
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,320
Vitamin K1. 10mg.
Intravenous medication administration.

375
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,440
(Beiya Hospital)

376
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,930
I just got back
from the hospital office.

377
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,650
The President,
Vice President, and Manager

378
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,840
are questioning him right now.

379
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,600
Mr. Ning is in big trouble this time.

380
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,440
Can't they check
the surveillance footage?

381
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,480
They already did.

382
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,690
The crowd blocked the parts

383
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,120
where the patient attacked you.

384
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,440
They can't see it clearly.

385
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,570
Of all times?

386
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,240
I'll explain to the higher-ups.

387
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
It's no use.

388
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Madam Cai fainted in the stairwell.

389
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,530
That made it even harder
for us to explain ourselves.

390
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,480
Where are you going?

391
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,770
I can't just stand idly by.

392
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,120
Yes, we were the ones who found her.

393
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,290
In the stairwell on the third floor.

394
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,320
A couple informed us

395
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,010
an old lady had fainted

396
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,080
in the stairwell

397
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,120
and told us to get there immediately.

398
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,170
Your results look good.

399
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,440
Take your medication on time
when you go home.

400
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Control your diet.

401
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,690
Come back
for routine follow-up checkups.

402
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,890
Please pull up the surveillance footage

403
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,320
in the stairwell
of the neurosurgery ward

404
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,570
and the outpatient lobby

405
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,930
from 4:30 PM last Friday.

406
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,770
All right.

407
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,570
Thank you.

408
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,510
(Friday, Outpatient Lobby)

409
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,290
Please pause.

410
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,410
Can we zoom in?

411
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,960
Hello, everyone.

412
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,120
My name is Ruan Liuzheng.

413
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,570
I'm currently on secondment
at Beiya Hospital.

414
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,930
Dr. Ning is my mentor.

415
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,810
As one of the parties involved,

416
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,480
I have an obligation to tell the truth

417
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,360
and clear up the rumors.

418
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,840
(The Truth Behind)
This is what happened that day.

419
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,830
(So this is the truth. I hate people
who spread misinformation.)

420
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,830
(Doctors are amazing!
Thank you for your contribution!)

421
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,320
(Every job has its woes.
Doctors have my sympathy.)

422
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,810
(We don't know what exactly happened)

423
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
(in the stairwell,)

424
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,240
(but the truth is Dr. Ning operated)

425
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,290
(for more than 20 hours overnight)

426
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,010
(to save Madam Cai's life.)

427
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,840
(We are just a group of ordinary people)

428
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
(doing our jobs at our stations.)

429
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,440
(I never thought
the power of the internet)

430
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,690
(could be so terrifying.)

431
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,120
(It can make you)

432
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,810
(or break you so easily.)

433
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,080
(Isn't it unfair)

434
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,320
(to ruin a good doctor)

435
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,810
(and deny
all his efforts and contribution)

436
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,360
(because of the rumors?)

437
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,440
The comments are turning around.

438
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,360
(- But the truth is)
- Ruan Liuzheng sure did it.

439
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,890
(- Dr. Ning operated)
- She made this video overnight.

440
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,600
(- for more than 20 hours overnight)
- But it looks like the video's working.

441
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,570
(- to save Madam Cai's life.)
- Let's hope that's the end of it.

442
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,690
Sorry for waking you.

443
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,890
You made that overnight?

444
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
You should've
just let Manager Liu and the others

445
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,050
handle this.

446
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,530
Why spent all that time on this?

447
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,240
I just wanted everyone
to know the truth.

448
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,360
If we let the issue fester,

449
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,410
it'll only add to the misconception

450
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,690
of the uninformed about doctors.

451
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,480
One hour before the outpatient duty.

452
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,530
You can get a little more sleep.

453
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,770
No, I'm getting up.

454
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:14,770
Drink it while it's hot.

455
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,120
What's this?

456
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,570
Did you not see the new car at the gate?

457
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,320
Whose is it?

458
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,120
Yours.

459
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,290
I'm warning you.

460
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm not in the mood

461
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
for this.

462
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,650
Who did you borrow it from? Return it.

463
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,170
Don't look down on me.

464
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,240
I'll buy you an even better one
when I become famous.

465
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,200
Enjoy it.

466
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:22,390
(Beiya Hospital)

467
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,840
Dr. Ruan,

468
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,010
where did you get this car?

469
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,080
Ruan Lang bought it

470
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,840
for me.

471
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
Well, he's filial.

472
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,770
So you'll be driving yourself

473
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,480
to and fro now?

474
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,440
Of course.

475
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,570
You need to improve your driving skills.

476
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,810
You're on the line.

477
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,690
You should lose weight, Mr. Ning.

478
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,600
This video proved

479
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,480
Mr. Ning's innocence.

480
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,960
I heard Lei and the others
were placed in administrative detention

481
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,840
and fined.

482
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,050
But Madam Cai has no one
to take care of her now.

483
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,120
Dr. Ruan! Come and see this!

484
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,410
What is it?

485
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,440
Someone uploaded the complete video
of Mr. Ning fighting the patients

486
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,360
online.

487
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,770
This video

488
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,240
provided a clear shot of everything

489
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,080
that happened from start to finish.

490
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,650
Mr. Ning

491
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,690
has been completely vindicated.

492
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,200
Who posted this?

493
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,890
One of the people

494
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,050
in the crowd that day, maybe.

495
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,930
This matter

496
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,440
has finally been cleared up.

497
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,120
Coffee's on me today.

498
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,290
- Thanks, Dr. Ding.
- How nice of you.

499
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,290
Oh, right.

500
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,690
The hospital

501
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,410
offered an opportunity
for a candidate to study in the US.

502
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,840
Originally,
it was sure to go to Mr. Ning.

503
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,120
But now, it's probably going
to Deputy Manager Qian.

504
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,200
Whoever gets sent to the US

505
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,810
is basically

506
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,270
the next manager.

507
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,200
Still chatting? Mind the time.

508
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,050
Ten minutes left to get ready.

509
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,240
Okay.

510
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:38,890
Okay.

511
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Let's go.

512
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,990

513

(Ning Zhiqian, Neurosurgery Department)

514
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,150
(Ning Zhiqian, Neurosurgery Department)

515
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,650
Doctor!

516
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,480
What's wrong?

517
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,720
Someone fainted! Doctor!

518
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,050
- Give me a hand.
- Come quickly!

519
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,530
Help.

520
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,530
Make room.

521
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,690
Wake up. Can you hear me?

522
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,690
Can you hear me?

523
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,170
The patient is unconscious.

524
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:43,770
Send him to ER.

525
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,530
Okay.

526
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,960
(Medical Card, Du Xiaoyu)

527
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,930
Du Xiaoyu? Du Xiaoyu?

528
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,240
Can you hear me, Du Xiaoyu?

529
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,480
Hurry up!

530
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,570
Make way!

531
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,200
The tumor is on his brain stem.

532
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,930
It's deep.

533
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,770
It doesn't look good.

534
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,240
You're awake.

535
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,570
I need you to confirm a few things.

536
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,440
Is your name Du Xiaoyu?

537
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,170
Are you 25 this year?

538
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes.

539
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,530
Do you remember fainting

540
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,290
in the outpatient clinic?

541
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,890
My name is Ning Zhiqian.

542
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,290
I'm the deputy manager of the Neuro...

543
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,080
I know you.

544
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,930
You know me?

545
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,240
When I was here
to see the doctor last time,

546
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,840
I saw you fighting.

547
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,960
It's not what you think...

548
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,200
Those people deserved it.

549
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,360
I recorded everything

550
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,480
and posted them online.

551
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,170
So you filmed those videos?

552
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,010
Thank you so much.

553
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,410
You did us a huge favor.

554
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,170
I don't want to see a great doctor

555
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,010
get falsely accused.

556
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,050
Du Xiaoyu,

557
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,320
your condition is complicated.

558
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,170
Can you ask your family
to come to the hospital?

559
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,570
I have no family.

560
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,240
Just tell me.

561
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,810
How bad

562
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,320
is my condition?

563
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,010
You fainted in the outpatient clinic.

564
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,810
We did an MRI of your brain.

565
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,010
We found a tumor growing

566
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,440
on your brain stem.

567
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,720
Based on my experience,

568
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,570
it's likely to be malignant.

569
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,890
How long do I have?

570
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,720
Depends on the treatment plan.

571
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,770
Can you save me?

572
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,890
I can't make any promise,

573
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
but I will do my best.

574
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,290
I trust you,

575
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,410
Dr. Ning.

576
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
We might need

577
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,810
to run some other tests on you later.

578
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,720
Get some rest.

579
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,010
My name is Ruan Liuzheng.

580
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,290
Deputy Manager Ning
put me in charge of your case.

581
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,320
If you need anything,

582
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,010
ring that bell behind you.

583
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,810
It's behind you.

584
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Do you think he's telling the truth?

585
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
About what?

586
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
About not having any family.

587
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,720
How would I know?

588
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,010
Do you think he said that

589
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,960
because he didn't want
to worry his family?

590
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,480
Can you not fuss over these things?

591
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,840
Can't you have some empathy
for your patients?

592
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,650
Can your empathy

593
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,960
remove his tumor?

594
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:45,190
(Beiya Hospital)

595
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,840
Mr. Ning.

596
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,170
I think you got in the wrong car.

597
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,080
Didn't you promise Ning Xiang

598
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,810
you would come to my place
to see him a few days ago?

599
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,050
I think I did.

600
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,440
Let's go.

601
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,530
Slow down.

602
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Is he asleep?

603
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,050
Yes.

604
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,410
Leave the dishes.

605
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,360
I'll wash them later.

606
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,360
I wasn't planning on cleaning them.

607
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,810
Mr. Ning,

608
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,360
you've been on your laptop all night,

609
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,170
ordering me to do this and that.

610
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,960
Do you actually take me for the nanny?

611
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,600
Of course not.

612
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,120
Everyone has times when they're busy.

613
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm not goofing around. I'm working.

614
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,770
Besides,

615
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,570
the boy likes your cooking.

616
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,320
He wants you to play with him.

617
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,410
What can I do?

618
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,840
Fine. That's my fault.

619
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,770
When are you going to find him a mother?

620
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,690
I'll hurry up.

621
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,720
But the problem now is

622
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,360
even if I do find him a mother,

623
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
he'll regard her as a stepmother.

624
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
I don't even know if he'll accept her.

625
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,930
Do you know what this is?

626
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,010
Chain reaction.

627
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,170
Your showing-up

628
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,810
complicated things.

629
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,600
Fine. My bad.

630
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,810
I'm leaving.

631
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,890
I won't see you off.

632
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,440
(Zhiqian)

633
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,120
(Zhiqian)

634
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,320
Ning Zhiqian!

635
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,530
Who is it?

636
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,720
(I'm Xiao'er!)

637
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
It's my brother.
Do you want to say hello?

638
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,200
Open the door, Zhiqian!

639
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,570
Mom.

640
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,010
Took you long enough.
Are you hiding a lover?

641
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,770
Hold this.

642
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,240
I need to use the toilet!

643
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,690
Is Ning Xiang asleep?

644
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,840
I haven't seen him in a while.

645
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,480
I'll check on him.

646
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,410
He is asleep.

647
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,960
Don't go inside. Don't wake him up.

648
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,440
Ning Xiang?

649
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,690
Uncle?

650
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,010
I brought you gifts.

651
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,930
Play with them when you wake up.

652
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,650
Dad...

653
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,440
No talking.

654
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,360
Go back to sleep.

655
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,160
See? You woke him up.

656
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,200
Go back to sleep.

657
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,160
Go to sleep.

658
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,400
It took a long time to put him to bed.

659
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,880
Why are you here so late at night?

660
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,130
I bought these

661
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,610
just for you and your boy

662
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,610
when I was on business trip
in Northeast China.

663
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,050
Thank you.

664
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,440
Hey, I came to visit for once.

665
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,680
Let's have a chat.

666
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,330
A chat?

667
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,200
What's there to chat about at this hour?

668
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,880
Sit down.

669
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,010
I need to talk to you about something.

670
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,570
How's the case
with you beating up a patient's family

671
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,570
going?

672
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,400
It's resolved.

673
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,050
Has it been settled?

674
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,240
If that's the only reason you're here,

675
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,850
you could've just called me.

676
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,050
It's not the first time
this happens.

677
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,200
Would I need to come all the way here
just because of that?

678
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
It's your sister-in-law. She woke me up

679
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,200
at 3 AM last night,

680
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,370
and said she dreamed of your mother.

681
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,810
My wife dreamed of your mother.

682
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,570
She dreamed of my mother?

683
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,570
She said your mother came to her dreams,

684
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,810
telling her that she's worried about you

685
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,680
in heaven because you have a kid
but not a wife.

686
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,770
So she wanted me to ask you

687
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,960
what kind of woman you like.

688
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,640
You've met at least a dozen girls

689
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,160
over the past years.

690
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,530
Is there really no one to your liking?

691
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
It's fine. The boy is asleep.

692
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,810
Still, keep it down.

693
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,810
Okay.

694
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
What about Liu, the model?

695
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,920
Beautiful face. Great physique.

696
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
She is good.

697
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,200
I think she suits you.

698
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,130
To heck with you.

699
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,480
Can my wife compare?

700
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,010
What about Wang, the rich lady?

701
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,240
We shared a meal once.

702
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,240
Her palate is too strong.

703
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,570
I don't think we can get over
our difference in flavor preference.

704
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,290
Right.

705
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,240
Can't compromise on food.

706
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,200
What about Lin, the teacher?

707
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,960
She gets summer and winter breaks,

708
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,440
and she can even tutor Ning Xiang.

709
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
I thought she was good,

710
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,050
but Ning Xiang thought
she was too fierce and strict.

711
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,130
He's intimidated by her.

712
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,810
You two are so fussy.

713
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,010
All right.

714
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
Tell me what type of woman you like.

715
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,130
Someone suitable.

716
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,440
What?

717
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,810
Suitable.

718
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,160
What does that even mean?

719
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,200
It's like answering "anything"

720
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,090
when I ask you what you want to eat.

721
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,640
I hate people like you
who can't decide what they want.

722
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,640
How am I supposed

723
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,810
to explain this to my wife?

724
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,130
She needs to answer your mother tonight.

725
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,400
Xiao'er,

726
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,810
just tell her

727
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,570
to tell my mother

728
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,610
to come to me.

729
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,010
Tell her not to bother
my sister-in-law anymore.

730
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,010
All right.

731
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,960
You deal with your mother yourself.

732
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,440
Okay.

733
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,880
I've been here for so long,

734
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,960
but I haven't even gotten a drink.

735
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,810
Where's your liquor?

736
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,290
Liquor? My stomach is sensitive,
so I gave them all away.

737
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,810
No alcohol?

738
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,770
Drink some water.

739
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,130
Oh, right.

740
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,680
Liuzheng is back.

741
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,570
Any chance of you two
getting back together?

742
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,850
No.

743
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,570
Xiao'er,

744
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,010
I have an operation tomorrow.

745
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,290
Go home.

746
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,200
We can talk some other day.

747
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,850
I still have one sip left.

748
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,880
Don't waste water.

749
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,090
Call me before you come next time.

750
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:50,880
You...

751
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,330
Xiao'er cares about you a lot.

752
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,920
Xiao'er is great,

753
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,240
but he's just
a little too enthusiastic sometimes.

754
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,050
He found you

755
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
over a dozen ladies
from all professions.

756
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,530
Can you handle all of them?

757
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,610
Well.

758
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,770
We were speaking so softly.

759
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,880
Yet, you still heard us?

760
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,850
I heard everything.

761
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,570
I'm leaving.

762
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,050
Don't go yet.

763
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,610
He might still be downstairs.

764
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,200
You have nothing to do. Why don't you...

765
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,090
I'm not doing the dishes.

766
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:42,640
No.

767
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,330
I meant to say
maybe you could rest here for a bit.

768
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,850
That's more like it.

769
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,790
(Beiya Hospital)

770
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Besides the dozens Xiao'er

771
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,290
introduced him to,

772
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,440
I introduced him
to a bunch of other women too.

773
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,770
I was worried you would be upset,

774
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,400
so I didn't tell you.

775
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,770
Also,

776
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,480
I heard things aren't going well

777
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,570
between him and Huang Qian,

778
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,240
whom he wanted me to introduce him to.

779
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,810
Why?

780
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:22,810
Well.

781
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,680
Ning Zhiqian is too picky.

782
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,370
She's a nice lady,

783
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,200
but he kept nitpicking her.

784
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,920
This time, he complained

785
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,480
that she talked too much.

786
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,920
I mean, he's such a stoic guy.

787
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,770
He needs someone
that's more extroverted and lively

788
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,720
to match him, right?

789
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,160
Doesn't that make sense?

790
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,440
Yes.

791
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,480
My aunt sent me a message.

792
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,010
She says she wants to introduce me
to a university lecturer.

793
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,050
A university lecturer sounds good.

794
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,570
Sounds like a great candidate.

795
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,090
Are you going to meet him?

796
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,570
Of course. Why not?

797
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,960
Liuzheng,

798
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,960
I support you.

799
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,330
You need to take the first step

800
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,570
to enter a new horizon.

801
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,010
Zhao Cong, you go back first.

802
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,130
- Okay.
- I need to discuss with Dr. Ruan

803
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,290
the surgery plan for this afternoon.

804
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,770
All right.

805
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
But when you look around,

806
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,610
you'll find the scenery
ever so familiar.

807
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,960
What are you guys talking about?

808
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,850
Have you set a date for your blind date?

809
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,200
Yes. It's this Saturday.

810
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,530
Aren't you seeing another on Sunday?

811
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,770
Do you have enough clothes?

812
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,770
Why don't I

813
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,850
go shopping with you after work today?

814
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,330
Let's take it one at a time.

815
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,290
I'm needed back at my department.
I have to go.

816
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,050
Go get busy.

817
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,440
Be sure to make well the arrangements.

818
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,050
Stagger the dates.

819
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,570
I see you have a busy weekend coming up.

820
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,240
What? You can do it, but I can't?

821
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,530
Do whatever you want.

822
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,850
I'm just thinking about how
I'm going to explain this to Ning Xiang.

823
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,680
Explain what?

824
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,960
Ning Xiang still thinks
you're his biological mother.

825
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,130
If you find him a stepfather...

826
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,330
You worry too much.

827
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,680
Drink your yoghurt.

828
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,720
You wouldn't know
since you don't have any kids.

829
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,680
A parent always worries.

830
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,400
What's taking her so long?

831
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,050
What's going on...

832
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,570
Are you going to the blind date
dressing like that?

833
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,530
No.

834
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,330
This looks too dull.

835
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,050
I think it looks fine.

836
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,850
Wait right here.

837
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,200
I bought this just for you.

838
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,160
Doesn't it look good?

839
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,770
This is too much.

840
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,200
It looks like a soaked snow fungus.

841
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,570
The pink is lovely.

842
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,680
You have fair skin.

843
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,330
It'll make you look soft and delicate.

844
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,530
You'll look great in it.

845
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,400
Go and change into this dress.

846
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,440
- Mom.
- This...

847
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,640
She's almost 30.

848
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,570
Shut up.

849
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,240
Hurry up.

850
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,480
I won't steer you wrong.

851
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,810
Look! Doesn't she look gorgeous?

852
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,680
Yes, she does.

853
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,570
Look how beautiful she is.

854
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,200
Do I look okay?

855
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,010
You don't look 30 at all.

856
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,370
You could even pass off as 18.

857
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,160
Yes.

858
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,240
An old cucumber

859
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,640
that paints itself green.

860
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,720
An old lady

861
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,160
that wears pink.

862
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,010
Oh, shut up.

863
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,440
Hit him.

864
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,160
Oh, you.

865
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:28,960
All right. Go on.

866
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,160
Take care on your way.

867
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,530
Don't play games all the time.

868
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,770
Talk and spend some time
with our parents.

869
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,330
Did you hear that?

870
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,370
Put that down.

871
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,200
Well.

872
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,850
Are you sure the guy she's meeting today

873
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,680
is reliable?

874
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,850
Of course.

875
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,290
Her aunt introduced her to him.

876
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,720
Really?

877
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,680
He's a university lecturer.

878
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
So what?

879
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,290
My ex brother-in-law
is a university professor.

880
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,010
Don't bring up Zhiqian.

881
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,240
I want them to get back together.

882
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,640
But seeing how dead set
Liuzheng is against that...

883
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,770
Forget it.

884
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,880
Let them be.

885
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,200
You finally let it go.

886
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,680
There must be

887
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,330
a reason why she doesn't want

888
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,640
to be with him.

889
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,720
You think you know everything.

890
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,050
Was I on the wrong side
of the fence again?
