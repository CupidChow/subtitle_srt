3
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,900
Dr. Ruan.

4
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,650
Nice one.

5
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,180
- Nice one.
- That was amazing.

6
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,860
Thanks.

7
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,580
Hi, Dr. Ruan.

8
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,450
Nice work, Ruan.

9
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,730
Good job, Ruan.

10
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,970
Stop it.

11
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,540
So many people said hi to me.

12
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,690
- Morning, Dr. Ruan.
- Dr. Ruan.

13
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,410
Good morning.

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,770
Your rescue footage

15
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,900
was uploaded to the intranet

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,410
and everyone saw it.

17
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,860
Many people messaged me and said

18
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,050
they wanted to meet you.

19
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,170
Oh, the stress.

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,330
Stay humble.

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,860
Don't inflate your ego.

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,140
You're too far gone, aren't you?

23
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,690
Your ego is so high up now.

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,460
Let's go.

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,810
Liuzheng.

26
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,890
You

27
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,460
made our department proud yesterday.

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,660
Although Dr. Ning
operated on the patient,

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,300
you were the one who saved him.

30
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,380
I saw it with my own eyes.

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,580
When Dr. Ruan was carrying out

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,810
that ventriculocentesis,

33
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,330
it was swift and precise.

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,690
Almost textbook worthy.

35
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,050
She's close to my level now.

36
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,940
Oh, come on.

37
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,740
Ruan is much better than you.

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,530
Exactly.

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,740
Oh, Dr. Ruan.

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,530
Do you know?

41
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,220
Yesterday,

42
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,170
the bachelors from other departments
asked me

43
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,100
for your number.

44
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,460
I didn't give it to them, of course.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,610
I just said

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,580
you were taken.

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,330
We already broke up.

48
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,970
Broke...

49
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,410
Broke up?

50
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,380
No way.

51
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,660
For real?

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
No way.

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,330
Deputy Manager Ning came up
with such a romantic proposal.

54
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,610
But why?

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,220
Mr. Ning.

56
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,580
Ruan Liuzheng said you two broke up.

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,500
Is it true?

58
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,250
Yes.

59
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,220
I...

60
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,740
So it's official now?

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,580
Yes.

62
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,940
We were waiting for the wedding
invitation.

63
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,610
Me too.

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,050
No wedding invitation now.

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,660
How about I buy
all of you a meal instead?

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,890
Are you two

67
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,410
pulling a prank on us?

68
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,500
(Doctors' Office)
Exactly.

69
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,770
I guess we should now look
forward to another wedding invitation.

70
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,810
Stop gossiping now.

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,890
Time for the rounds.

72
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,250
Let's go.

73
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,460
- Where are you going?
- Let's go.

74
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,460
Go back in.

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,410
I have an announcement.

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,140
Gather up.

77
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,500
Manager Liu.

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,250
I have an announcement.

79
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,020
Dr. Ruan demonstrated

80
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,380
calmness and swiftness
in her rescue yesterday.

81
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,890
The higher-up called me and sang

82
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,890
praises to her,

83
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,690
saying that she is a competent
and compassionate doctor.

84
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,740
We hope everyone

85
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,610
can learn from her.

86
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,410
Bravo.

87
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,860
Manager Liu,

88
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,660
you didn't say that yesterday.

89
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,810
You said if something bad

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,660
happened,

91
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,050
no one could bear the consequences.

92
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,020
Did I say that?

93
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,690
Yes.

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,610
Either way,

95
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,740
just learn from Dr. Ruan here.

96
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,020
Also,

97
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,890
Mr. Xue helped us locate

98
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,370
the patient's family.

99
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,340
Dr. Ruan,

100
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,300
on my behalf...

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,970
No.

102
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,370
On behalf of the entire hospital,

103
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,930
please thank him for us.

104
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,690
Carry on, Manager Liu.

105
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,580
We have to do the rounds now.

106
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:25,810
See you.

107
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,370
Ning Zhiqian.

108
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Let's go.

109
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,580
We

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,210
will speak later.

111
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:29,580
Okay.

112
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,620
Honestly though,

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,460
I didn't expect

114
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,090
Mr. Ning and you to break up.

115
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,860
Neither did I.

116
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,620
If I may ask,

117
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,340
is it because of Mr. Xue?

118
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,250
Of course, not.

119
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,740
I think Mr. Xue is decent.

120
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,060
You should consider him.

121
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,090
Consider him seriously.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,020
Look.

123
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,020
We're around the same age now.

124
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,740
You have a doctorate

125
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,780
but I only have a Master's.

126
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,930
I have to work harder to surpass you.

127
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,340
Coming through. Be careful.

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,090
You are progressing
very quickly already.

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,370
But it's impossible

130
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,580
to surpass me.

131
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,210
When are Cheng Zhouyu and you
going to treat me to a meal?

132
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,650
He's been avoiding

133
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,690
me.

134
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,690
Knowing him,

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,060
I think

136
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,740
he's an honest man.

137
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Perhaps he's been
under some stress lately.

138
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,020
But I tell you.

139
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,490
He will do well by you.

140
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,650
When I was in school,

141
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,900
he was the resident nice guy.

142
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,620
Nice guy.

143
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,410
For real?

144
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,090
Yes.

145
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,140
Were there ever any

146
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
negative rumors about him?

147
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,300
Tell me now.

148
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,340
Gifts will make me talk.

149
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,620
Since when are you two this close?

150
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,090
Mr. Cheng, come.

151
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,210
Sit beside me.

152
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,340
You are from Neurosurgery, aren't you?

153
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,460
We are from Cardiac Surgery.

154
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,460
Let me buy you drinks.

155
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,020
Thanks.

156
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
We work for the same hospital.

157
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,930
- Let's get along with each other.
- Sure.

158
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,140
- Eat.
- Definitely.

159
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,900
Definitely.

160
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,370
Oh.

161
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,340
Two days ago,

162
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,180
I met

163
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,300
an adorable patient.

164
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,970
She is a girl.

165
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,090
When she left,

166
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,370
she gave me a heart sign
with her hands.

167
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,650
What a coincidence.

168
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,370
I was looking for you.

169
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,650
Tell me.

170
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,530
You went directly to the higher-up

171
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,650
and hung up on me.

172
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,620
What happened?

173
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,180
Manager Liu, I'm busy this afternoon.

174
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,530
We'll speak

175
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,810
when I'm done. Let me eat first.

176
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,060
Ning Zhiqian.

177
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,060
You can't hide from this forever.

178
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,210
Fine.

179
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,900
Let's drop this.

180
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,970
We've been talking about the appointment

181
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,180
of the manager in Ward 3.

182
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,780
As you know,

183
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,740
after Manager Zhang
went into retirement,

184
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,530
that position has been vacant.

185
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,020
Dr. Qian and you

186
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,250
have been co-managing

187
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,020
Ward 3.

188
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,140
The higher-up wants

189
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,020
to finalize the appointment

190
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,930
as soon as possible.

191
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,810
Tell me,

192
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,250
between Dr. Qian and you,

193
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,410
who can do a better job?

194
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,740
You want my opinion?

195
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,490
I'll say me, of course.

196
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,530
The young ones nowadays

197
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,900
are never modest.

198
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,090
But of course,

199
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,690
technique-wise,
you are more talented than him.

200
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,930
Yet you lost to him

201
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,580
experience-wise.

202
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,300
If seniority matters,
why come to me then?

203
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,930
Thanks.

204
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,090
Ning.

205
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,090
You're welcome.

206
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,210
Do you still remember?

207
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,580
I briefed you

208
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,370
during your first day here.

209
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,860
Back then,

210
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,530
you were humble,

211
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,740
down to earth,

212
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,930
and courteous.

213
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,650
But now...

214
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,210
People change.

215
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,460
Indeed.

216
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,780
I didn't know

217
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,060
that you want that position too.

218
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,490
Surprised?

219
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,490
Yes.

220
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,460
I thought you would turn it down.

221
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,460
Why would I?

222
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,780
Tell me then.

223
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,340
Why do you want that position?

224
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,810
Because I think no one

225
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,340
can do the job better than me.

226
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,620
(Beiya Hospital)

227
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,020
Mr. Ning.

228
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,050
You're still here.

229
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,730
How's your thesis going?

230
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,490
I already sent you the outline.

231
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,460
Have you read it?

232
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
I skimmed through it.

233
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,930
Hurry up then.

234
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,170
I expect

235
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,170
SCI from you.

236
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
SCI?

237
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,980
That is very difficult.

238
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,490
All my students have to do that.

239
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,100
We have to delve
into the main content now.

240
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,100
I will organize the materials

241
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,050
and send them to you.

242
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,490
Go through them and make

243
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,580
your choice.

244
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,050
Then, we'll have the discussion.

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,780
You will be busy lately.

246
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,420
Okay. Noted.

247
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,100
I sent it.

248
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,780
Got it.

249
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,220
You're back.

250
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,540
Don't go to your room just yet.

251
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,140
Come here.

252
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,850
Come here.

253
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,610
I have eaten.

254
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,580
Come here.

255
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,930
Talk to us.

256
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,250
About what?

257
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,610
What's the matter with you?

258
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,490
It's an important matter,

259
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,020
so why didn't you tell us?

260
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,460
What matter?

261
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,900
We have heard about it.

262
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,930
Saving a life in public.

263
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,610
And you didn't tell us at all.

264
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,170
You

265
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,930
deserve to be praised.

266
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:26,930
Right?

267
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,690
Yes, it's so heroic.

268
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,340
It is a heroic deed.

269
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,930
But looking back,
it was scary.

270
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,730
If something bad happened,

271
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,460
someone would die.

272
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,370
That's right.

273
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,340
So why didn't

274
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,850
you tell us?

275
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,290
If I have to tell you everything

276
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,460
that happens during the day,

277
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,730
you won't be able to sleep tight.

278
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,540
I am already

279
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,780
losing sleep over this.

280
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,580
Not to mention your failed marriage.

281
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,420
I need sleeping pills now.

282
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,170
Don't worry about it.

283
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,850
How can I not be worried?

284
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,660
At your age, you should

285
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,100
think about your marriage.

286
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,690
By the way,

287
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,140
after you went out

288
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,250
with Xue that day,

289
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,100
his mother

290
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,540
kept asking me about you.

291
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,140
I can tell

292
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,420
she is very fond of you.

293
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,980
Speaking of that,

294
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,660
your mom kept flaunting
how excellent you are

295
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,980
that I was embarrassed.

296
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,980
What embarrassed?

297
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,610
She is excellent.

298
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,140
Yes, she is.

299
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,290
But no need to market her so,

300
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,100
don't you think?

301
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,580
All right. I don't want
to think about all that now.

302
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,580
I have spoken to Xue Weilin that we

303
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,780
are impossible.

304
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,580
When are you going to get married

305
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,250
if not now?

306
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,490
Xue is pretty decent.

307
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,050
Although he is one year
younger than you,

308
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,580
he is mature.

309
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,460
He suits you.

310
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,610
Besides, we know his parents as well.

311
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,220
That's right.

312
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,250
Mom is right.

313
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,170
Mr. Xue

314
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,660
isn't as good as Zhiqian,

315
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,780
but he isn't too far behind.

316
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,610
You sure switch your sides very quickly.

317
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,100
If you guys like him that much,

318
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,460
just adopt him then.

319
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,540
One son is already

320
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,100
a handful.

321
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,660
Exactly.

322
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,370
Don't just worry about me.

323
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,900
Worry about your son too.

324
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,980
Okay?

325
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,900
Oh, right.

326
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,100
We need to talk about you.

327
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,460
Your mom has something to say.

328
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,540
That's right.

329
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,810
You have been acting suspicious lately.

330
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,690
What's going on?

331
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,100
- Explain.
- You found a girlfriend?

332
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,900
What girlfriend?

333
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,140
I'm still young.

334
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,690
I focus on my career.

335
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,730
Right, career.

336
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,930
His career.

337
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,810
I have something to do.

338
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,580
I have to go now.

339
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,930
It's late now. Where are you going?

340
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,730
I have something to do.

341
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,490
He's busy, Mom.

342
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,290
Don't press on.

343
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,730
Something's wrong with him.

344
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,020
Do you know what happened?

345
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,220
It's nothing.

346
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,170
Something has happened to Tan Ya,

347
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,420
so I asked him to take care of her.

348
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,810
I see.

349
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,780
Let's eat.

350
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,490
I even forgot to eat.

351
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,490
Buy books that rely
on an eco-friendly printing process

352
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,610
for a sustainable and cleaner future.

353
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,490
Beijing Municipal
Green Printing Project.

354
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,340
All right. I read the entire book

355
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,460
to you.

356
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,220
Sleep now.

357
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,220
Dad.

358
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,420
Mommy Liuzheng

359
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,460
and you

360
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,730
are not getting married at all?

361
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,810
Even though we are not getting married,

362
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,540
she is still your mom.

363
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,980
If you miss her,

364
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,250
you can visit her.

365
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,250
You mean

366
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,930
Mommy Liuzheng doesn't want you,

367
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,020
but she still wants me?

368
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,220
You can say that.

369
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,460
Fortunately.

370
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,730
Dad.

371
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,730
If Mommy Liuzheng

372
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,580
is not marrying you,

373
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,690
is she marrying Xue Weilin then?

374
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,290
Wait. Why this question?

375
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,610
You can't call Mr. Xue by his full name.

376
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,100
Although you don't like him either,

377
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,540
he is still an adult.

378
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,020
You should call him Uncle Xue, noted?

379
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,220
I used to dislike him.

380
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,050
But now, I like him.

381
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,460
I call him Xue Weilin,

382
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,490
because he's

383
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,460
my friend.

384
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,900
I get along very well with him

385
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
so I asked him to be my big brother.

386
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,420
Who taught you this?

387
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,690
Looking for sworn brothers now?

388
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,690
Did Uncle Xiao'er teach you that?

389
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,980
He's good for nothing.

390
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,420
I asked him to be my big brother

391
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,730
so that he can't marry Mom.

392
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,490
I think he's fun

393
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,690
and handsome.

394
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,250
Tell me then.

395
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,290
Between he and I, who's more handsome?

396
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,850
You.

397
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,660
You're strong

398
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,140
and handsome.

399
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,490
I'm strong, right?

400
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:57,980
Yes!

401
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,170
I can knock him out with one punch.

402
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,810
Yes!

403
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,250
- Hit him.
- Send him to outer space.

404
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,580
Dad, will you play with me
this weekend?

405
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,540
Not this weekend.

406
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,540
I have to work overtime.

407
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,370
Then I'll hang out with Xue Weilin
and Mom.

408
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,100
No.

409
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,140
Why?

410
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,460
No means no.

411
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,690
No why. Sleep now.

412
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,780
Dad, you're strong and handsome.

413
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,810
- Strong and handsome.
- That won't work.

414
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,660
- I'll count from three. You sleep.
- Strong and handsome.

415
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,490
- Three.
- Strong

416
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,250
- Two.
- and handsome.

417
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,660
- One. Sleep now.
- Strong and handsome!

418
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,060
(The Little Prince Lives Here.
Please Knock.)

419
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,020
(Beiya Hospital)

420
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,810
Ning Zhiqian.

421
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,100
Ning Zhiqian.

422
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,930
Stop walking this fast.

423
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,930
It's tiring to catch up to you.

424
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,850
What's the matter, Manager Liu?

425
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,290
It's about the appointment
of the manager of Ward 3.

426
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,490
I nominated you.

427
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,020
The higher-up is willing
to give you a chance.

428
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,100
We'll have an election.

429
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,810
What?

430
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,810
You don't like it?

431
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,250
You made the right call.

432
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,020
When you become the manager,

433
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,140
you have to change that temper of yours.

434
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,900
Stay down to earth.

435
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,460
Am I not down-to-earth enough?

436
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,050
I haven't finished my sentence.

437
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,290
And be humble.

438
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,660
Sorry.

439
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,690
I can't do that.

440
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,290
You...

441
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,020
I bet

442
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,580
you don't have a lot of friends.

443
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,810
Make sure you're on good terms
with everyone.

444
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,580
That was too succinct.

445
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,100
Anything else, Manager Liu?

446
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,370
You know,

447
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,090
people always catch up with me
when they ask something from me.

448
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,660
But you are the opposite.

449
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,540
I have to catch up with you as if
I'm begging you to take the job.

450
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm so done.

451
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Just tell me.

452
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,090
Do you want that position or not?

453
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,250
I do.

454
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,140
Just cast your vote for me.

455
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
Then answer me.

456
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,540
Why do you want to be the manager?

457
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,540
I already answered you that.

458
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Be serious.

459
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,820
I believe

460
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,140
I can manage Ward 3

461
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,300
better.

462
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,210
I already came up with a proposal.

463
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,660
Regardless of who gets the position,

464
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,660
I will

465
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,140
share this proposal with everyone.

466
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,780
Great.

467
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,090
I can't wait to read your proposal.

468
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:37,940
Campaign harder.

469
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,330
Make sure you win it.

470
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,820
Have you heard?

471
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,140
There will be an election regarding
the managerial position of Ward 3.

472
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,370
Between Qian and Ning,

473
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,330
who do you think will win?

474
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,060
It's hard to say.

475
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,970
But I'm leaning towards Dr. Ning.

476
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,140
Me too.

477
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,250
They two are equally skillful,

478
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,330
but Deputy Manager Ning is impartial.

479
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,210
He has earned my respect.

480
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,250
Cheng, what do you think?

481
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,180
I think the same.

482
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,730
You want to vote for Mr. Ning.

483
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,850
Right, Cheng Zhouyu?

484
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,570
I'll vote for whoever you vote for.

485
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,540
Cheng.

486
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,060
You are Dr. Ning's classmate.

487
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,300
You are close to him.

488
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,020
Not just close.

489
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,850
But I

490
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,540
can be very fair and objective

491
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,700
in this kind of matter.

492
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,090
Connection is not the only
deciding factor.

493
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,060
Don't you agree?

494
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,090
Wholeheartedly.

495
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,660
Even though I'm a student of Mr. Qian,

496
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,300
I'm still going to vote for Mr. Ning.

497
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,570
So ungrateful.

498
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,780
Fair.

499
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,420
Objective.

500
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,700
And transparent.

501
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,850
Thank you for your hard work.

502
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,540
Tan Ya.

503
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
Are you all right?

504
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,450
I went

505
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,180
to visit Fu Xiaohui

506
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,820
in ICU.

507
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,570
I have always wondered

508
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,780
how it would be like

509
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,660
when I meet her.

510
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,060
Will I yell at her

511
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,180
or will I make her feel ashamed

512
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,330
of what she did like portrayed
in the TV drama?

513
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,250
I just didn't expect

514
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,820
to meet her like this.

515
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,090
Let bygone be bygone.

516
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,370
You can start over now.

517
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,540
You have

518
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,730
lost so much weight.

519
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,210
Have I?

520
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,420
It's good.

521
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,450
It's like I'm on a diet.

522
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,370
No.

523
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,060
We will have some good food

524
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,060
and gain back the lost weight.

525
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,420
Thank you.

526
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,850
You're a good friend.

527
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,540
Did Jiang Cheng's family pester you?

528
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,850
He already signed the divorce agreement.

529
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,490
We will finalize it
once he's discharged.

530
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,780
Funny, isn't it?

531
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,140
One thing leads to another

532
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,330
and we are both single now.

533
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,700
I quite like it.

534
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,780
I feel relieved.

535
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,180
I can now study to earn

536
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,490
the Chief Nursing Officer certificate.

537
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,420
Let's work hard together.

538
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,820
I have to do the rounds now.

539
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:04,900
Okay.

540
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,780
All right.

541
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,450
Noted.

542
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,370
I'll go now.

543
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,060
Bye.

544
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:09,900
Dr. Cheng.

545
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,940
Can you take my shift tonight?

546
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,660
I'll take two of your shifts in return.

547
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,180
Please?

548
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,450
I can't today. I'm busy.

549
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,610
Next time.

550
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,420
I...

551
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,140
Lover before friends.

552
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,450
You need to swap shifts?

553
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,900
Yes, Mr. Ning.

554
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,610
What's wrong?

555
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,660
My girlfriend has been threatening me
with a break-up.

556
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,300
If I don't see her today,
the relationship will fail.

557
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,370
I'll swap with you.

558
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,140
I don't think that's right, Mr. Ning.

559
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,330
Don't worry about it.

560
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,660
Your private life is important. Go.

561
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,940
Will I be fired?

562
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,020
What fired?

563
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,570
I have to organize the files anyway.

564
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,940
Go. Protect your happiness.

565
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Thanks, Mr. Ning.

566
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,090
Mr. Ning, you're still here.

567
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,140
I'm working overtime.

568
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,610
You said you didn't want
any night shift.

569
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,970
Why today then?

570
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,090
I swapped with Wu.

571
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,370
He went to protect his happiness.

572
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,180
Since we have time,

573
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,820
tell me about your thesis.

574
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,450
Okay.

575
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,610
I refer to this one.

576
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,180
What is this? You wrote it?

577
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,850
All right. Let's go.

578
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,450
Did you notice?

579
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,850
Mr. Ning and Ruan Liuzheng
do not act like

580
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,210
they just broke up.

581
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,330
So do you want them to get back together

582
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,420
or not?

583
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,490
What do I have to do with it?

584
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,450
I think Ruan Liuzheng is happy

585
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,300
doing what she does now.

586
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,140
She focuses on her career

587
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,420
and has Mr. Ning guide her
in her thesis.

588
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,490
I have to work harder.

589
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,780
I can't lose to her.

590
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,250
She has Ning

591
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,820
but you have me.

592
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,490
I was one of the top students

593
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,180
in the medical school.

594
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,610
I was unfortunate enough

595
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,180
to be in the same batch
as the genius Ning.

596
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,700
Otherwise, people would definitely
notice my intelligence

597
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,900
and my beauty.

598
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,850
Not just those two aspects.

599
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,210
There's also another one.

600
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,970
What

601
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,250
other hidden gem do I possess?

602
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,140
You're good at bluffing.

603
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,490
You don't believe me?

604
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,420
Let's talk about dinner.

605
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,700
Fine. Let me show you a place.

606
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,820
You drive. I'll set the navigation.

607
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,660
Okay.

608
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,580
(Beiya Hospital)

609
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,580
(Food Delivery, 30 Lamb Skewers, 2 Coke)

610
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,330
I came with food!

611
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,330
Mr. Xue.

612
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,490
Why are you here?

613
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,020
I know you're on the night shift

614
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,420
and takeouts are unhealthy.

615
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,540
My mom brewed the soup for you

616
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,060
and cooked your favorite dishes.

617
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,250
My favorite dishes?

618
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:17,900
Yes.

619
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,140
Eat.

620
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,210
Please thank her for me.

621
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,730
If you like them,

622
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,060
I'll ask my mom
to make them for you every day.

623
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,020
What do you think?

624
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,490
It smells so good.

625
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,180
You must be hungry.

626
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,300
I am.

627
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,490
Mr. Ning.

628
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,140
Come eat with us.

629
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,570
No, thanks.

630
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,900
Come.

631
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,370
Have this drumstick.

632
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,900
For the protein.

633
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,660
Don't just give me food.

634
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,370
You have to eat too.

635
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,850
Do you like it?

636
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,780
It's delicious.

637
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,490
Have some veggies.

638
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,450
You always look exhausted.

639
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,610
I love the soup.

640
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,020
- Hi. I have Dr. Ning's orders.
- It's delicious, isn't it?

641
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,700
Coming.

642
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,300
You ordered food?

643
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,140
Thank you.

644
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,850
No problem.

645
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,450
It's not bad, isn't it?

646
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,370
It tastes properly.

647
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,250
It's just right.

648
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,570
Please thank your mom for me.

649
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,940
Don't worry.

650
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,370
Have some soup.

651
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Drink it while it's warm.

652
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,020
Come. Have a prawn.

653
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,700
Mr. Ning.

654
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,060
You're having BBQ skewers?

655
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,210
I thought you don't like

656
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,420
unhealthy food.

657
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,490
I didn't see you eat them
during the team-building exercise.

658
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,330
I understand, though.

659
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,060
Eating the same thing over
and over again gets stale.

660
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,090
Switching it up sometimes

661
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,940
can rinse your palate.

662
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,330
Don't you agree, Liuzheng?

663
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,780
Drink it while it's warm.

664
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,450
Is it delicious?

665
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,730
Do you like it?

666
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,420
I'm full.

667
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,820
I'll ask my mom

668
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,780
to make you more next time.

669
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,700
I'll wash them.

670
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,140
I can bring them back.

671
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,420
But you came all the way here.

672
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,330
It's fine.

673
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,450
As long as you enjoy them,

674
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,900
it's not inconvenient at all.

675
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,330
I should get going now.

676
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:25,970
Come.

677
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
No need to see me off.

678
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,370
You have to work.

679
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,210
Do visit us this Sunday for dinner.

680
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,370
Also,

681
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,300
get enough rest.

682
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,020
Understood?

683
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,940
Yes.

684
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,020
All right.

685
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:39,900
I'll go now.

686
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,490
Okay.

687
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,300
I'm back to work.

688
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,210
Okay. Bye.

689
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,180
Thanks!

690
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,450
Mr. Ning.

691
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,370
See you.

692
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,900
Send me

693
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,780
the outline.

694
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
I just sent it to you.

695
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,300
Your campus is beautiful.

696
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,140
Right?

697
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,850
I'll give you a tour

698
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,970
today.

699
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,210
To show you

700
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,940
where I studied

701
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,250
and lived for eight years.

702
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,420
I spent my youth here.

703
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,820
All right.

704
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,420
But I'm hungry now.

705
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,210
Can we have some food first?

706
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,060
You're hungry?

707
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,900
Sure.

708
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,490
First stop.

709
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,570
Cafeteria.

710
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,490
Thank you.

711
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,780
You ordered so many things.

712
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,020
That's worth six months
of your salary, isn't it?

713
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,370
Does it hurt your wallet?

714
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,020
I can't buy you an expensive meal

715
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,780
but I still can afford the food
in the cafeteria.

716
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,850
I have to admit

717
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,940
that the food here is pretty good.

718
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,940
I agree.

719
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,420
I only discovered that today.

720
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,370
When I was studying here,

721
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,540
I only ate one thing.

722
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,700
What thing?

723
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,420
Buns.

724
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,900
You loved buns that much?

725
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,610
It's not about my preference.

726
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,140
I just think buns are very pragmatic.

727
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,820
Think about it. One bun

728
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,570
has vegetables, meat, and carbs.

729
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,370
It's nutritious and is a balanced diet.

730
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,610
Besides,

731
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,610
for one portion of veggies,

732
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,180
the cheapest price is eight yuan.

733
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,210
But for buns.

734
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,060
One vegetarian bun costs one yuan

735
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,370
and one meat bun costs 1.5 yuan.

736
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,330
Back then,

737
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,450
I had one meat bun in the morning,

738
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,660
two vegetarian buns at noon,

739
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,140
and two vegetarian
and one meat buns at night.

740
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,450
I spent less on three meals

741
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,850
than what others were paying for a meal.

742
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,490
Furthermore, this cafeteria

743
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,140
has different types

744
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,060
of buns.

745
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,940
Napa cabbage buns, garlic chives buns,
celery buns,

746
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,330
pickled vegetable buns, carrot buns,

747
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,780
potato buns, zucchini buns,

748
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
and tofu buns.

749
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,330
I bet you haven't had them.

750
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,330
I only ate buns for eight years

751
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,780
so people call me the Prince of Buns.

752
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,450
The entire school knew that.

753
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,300
All right.

754
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,490
A bean counter like you

755
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,820
shouldn't be a doctor.

756
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,370
You should pursue a lucrative career.

757
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,300
Like accounting or finance.

758
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,060
I watched a TV series

759
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
and all the female doctors in it
looked so beautiful.

760
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,210
Just like you.

761
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,210
That's why I became a doctor.

762
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,680
What a big lie.

763
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,820
Answer me seriously.

764
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,180
Why did you become a doctor?

765
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,020
When I was in high school,

766
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,090
my family

767
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,450
spent all our money to treat my dad

768
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,090
but

769
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,020
he still couldn't make it.

770
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,570
He passed away.

771
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,730
Back then,

772
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,610
I thought if I were a doctor,

773
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,330
I might

774
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,300
be able to save my dad.

775
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,850
So I studied very hard

776
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,210
and got

777
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,490
into the medical school.

778
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,900
My family is poor

779
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,420
so my mom borrowed money

780
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
from everyone she knew

781
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,610
to pay for my tuition.

782
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,610
I used whatever money left

783
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,700
to purchase a seatless ticket.

784
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,780
So I stood for more than 30 hours

785
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,570
on my way to Jiangzhou.

786
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,820
During the trip, I told myself

787
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,330
that I will be a good doctor

788
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,420
to save those

789
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,300
who need me.

790
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,180
But you're now

791
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,850
a good doctor.

792
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,610
Yuan.

793
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,210
I want to ask you

794
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,540
something.

795
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,370
Do you think

796
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,180
our background

797
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,730
and upbringing

798
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,140
are too different from each other?

799
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,970
Why?

800
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,820
You think only two similar people

801
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,490
get

802
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,820
to fall in love and be together?

803
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,090
I'm just worried that we

804
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,020
might argue one day
because of our differences

805
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,660
in the value system.

806
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,610
That's easy.

807
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,610
If we ever argue

808
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,820
because of that,

809
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,370
you have to listen to me.

810
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,180
Right.

811
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,020
That sure solves the problem easily.

812
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,610
All right.

813
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,610
I'll listen to you.

814
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,540
The juniors are watching.

815
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Behave.

816
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,330
Eat now.

817
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,730
After we're done, I'll show you

818
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,660
the Lover's Street.

819
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,490
Sure.

820
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,140
Popcorn chicken.

821
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,820
Chicken drumstick.

822
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,740
Sweet and sour pork ribs.

823
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,660
Eat more.

824
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,420
When you're with me,

825
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,220
you eat meat. Not buns.

826
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,140
(Thesis)

827
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,700
Sleepyhead.

828
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,420
I just modified my thesis.

829
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
You can have a look.

830
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
What do you think?

831
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,770
It's mediocre.

832
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,740
Look.

833
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,530
Your introduction is unclear.

834
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,940
This chain of logic is wrong.

835
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,770
Where?

836
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,980
Why didn't you follow my guideline?

837
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,570
All this time,

838
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,460
you failed to understand

839
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,660
the advice I gave you.

840
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,050
You got nothing.

841
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,050
But I don't think it's wrong.

842
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm just using another approach.

843
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Dr. Ruan.

844
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,260
I understand your eagerness.

845
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,570
But you have to learn how to walk

846
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,010
before you run

847
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,180
and fly.

848
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,810
This is your first thesis

849
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,010
with SCI.

850
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,330
Can't you do it

851
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,570
step by step?

852
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,500
Mr. Ning.

853
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,290
Can you accept a certain degree

854
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,290
of deviation?

855
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,740
Why do you always want others

856
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,290
to follow your guideline?

857
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,330
I am your mentor

858
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,660
so you're my responsibility.

859
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,050
You are just giving me excuses now.

860
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,290
I don't care about your private life,

861
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,050
but you got to devote
enough energy and time

862
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,090
to your work.

863
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't worry.

864
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,180
Regardless of whether my thesis
will be published,

865
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,420
I will do my best to complete it.

866
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,980
And I'm not doing all this

867
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,770
to earn accreditation

868
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,050
or a better job prospect.

869
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,330
Also, didn't you tell me

870
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,740
that in STEM,

871
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,940
discovering a dead end

872
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,700
is actually beneficial?

873
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,850
It's still a contribution,

874
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,420
even if it doesn't work out.

875
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,980
You are my mentor.

876
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,370
I will try to accomplish

877
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,220
the tasks you give me.

878
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,980
I can manage my time.

879
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,140
I know what works best for me.

880
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,460
This is my business.

881
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,290
I am three years behind in my study

882
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,570
and I'm working very hard to catch up.

883
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,900
I am three years behind in my love life

884
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,220
so can't I play catch-up too?

885
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,460
I don't care about all that.

886
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,770
I only care about your work.

887
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,530
I don't have the right

888
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,940
nor do I want to meddle
in your love life.

889
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,940
So be it then.

890
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:27,850
What?

891
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,420
Frustrations because of you.

892
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,370
So petty.

893
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,010
Gastric pain?

894
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,530
Can you

895
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,850
give me a break?

896
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,850
Do you have medicine?

897
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,770
No.

898
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,460
Don't you know you

899
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,980
have a sensitive stomach?

900
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,220
Yet you ate something oily and spicy.

901
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,530
Why didn't you stop me
when I was eating them?

902
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,570
You were eating alone.

903
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,770
Serve you right.

904
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,850
Get up.

905
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,740
What for?

906
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,010
I'll send you
to the Emergency Department.

907
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,610
Go away.

908
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,330
I just need some water.

909
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,220
I'm fine.

910
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,850
Don't drink warm water.

911
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,420
I'm fine.

912
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,500
Come to the Emergency Department.

913
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,810
Warm water.

914
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,090
Emergency Department.

915
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,660
Warm water.

916
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,460
Warm water won't help you.

917
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,770
The Emergency Department is packed.

918
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,050
(Emergency Department)

919
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,810
Chen.

920
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,770
Isn't this Deputy Manager Ning?

921
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,010
What's the matter?

922
00:40:59,010 --> 00:40:59,500
Careful.

923
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,260
Gastrospasm.

924
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,810
Gastric pain?

925
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,330
It's an old problem of mine.

926
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,700
I'll prescribe you something.

927
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,770
But we need to examine
your stomach first.

928
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,740
Let's go.

929
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,900
Careful.

930
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,770
You're back.

931
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:22,980
Here.

932
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,810
Come.

933
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,810
Let me have a look.

934
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,610
Deputy Manager Ning.

935
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,090
I guess I don't have

936
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,290
to explain this report to you.

937
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,740
You have neurogenic gastritis.

938
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,660
Are you

939
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,940
under a lot of stress lately?

940
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,180
Or did something major

941
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,610
happen in your life?

942
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,260
Chen, just give me the prescription.

943
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,810
Thank you.

944
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,980
I will

945
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,090
but I have to nag you.

946
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,500
You need to get back

947
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,180
to the right state of mind.

948
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,660
This is neurogenic gastritis.

949
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,290
One,

950
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,770
watch what you eat.

951
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,370
Don't eat anything that agitates
your stomach.

952
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,330
You hear that?

953
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,530
Two,

954
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,330
don't be mad.

955
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,900
When you become emotional,

956
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,220
it will be more likely to act up.

957
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,980
You hear that?

958
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,140
Deputy Manager Ning,

959
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,290
you're a rising star
in the Neurosurgery Department.

960
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:08,980
So please

961
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,330
take good care of yourself.

962
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,090
Please take care

963
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,610
of him.

964
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:14,700
Okay.

965
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,220
As for this one,

966
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,570
take it three times per day.

967
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,810
Take your meds on time.

968
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,090
Give it to me.

969
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,090
Don't forget.

970
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:22,980
Let's go.

971
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,290
I'm fine.

972
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,570
Careful.

973
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,370
See you, Chen.

974
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,770
Thank you.

975
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,460
Let go of me.

976
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,140
Mr. Ning, we're here.

977
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,140
Thanks.

978
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,290
You're welcome.

979
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,770
Remember to take your meds.

980
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,740
Good work today.

981
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,850
Do you want to come up?

982
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,180
No.

983
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,740
I still have some of your belongings.

984
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,900
Do you want to retrieve them?

985
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,900
Okay. I'll park the car.

986
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,850
I'll wait for you by the elevator.

987
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,050
(Door's open.)

988
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:40,940
Come in.

989
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,090
No need to change your shoes.

990
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,900
Ning Xiang likes it
so I didn't throw it away.

991
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,700
I kept it.
