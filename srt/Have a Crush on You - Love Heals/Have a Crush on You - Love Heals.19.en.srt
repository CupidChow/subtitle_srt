=Episode 19=

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
(Mom, I've reached Guangzhou.)

4
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,190
(I called Dad just now.)

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,680
(He's been coughing a lot.)

6
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,270
(I'm worried that he might be sick again.)

7
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,230
(Can you check on him for me?)

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,550
(Okay.)

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,190
(I'll check on him.)

10
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,190
Leave me at the side of the road.

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,510
I have something to do,
so I'm not returning home yet.

12
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,680
Did something happen in the hospital?

13
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,230
It's something else.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,990
It's quite late now.

15
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,960
It's better for me to send you back.

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,150
It's fine.

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,200
Just leave me at the side of the road.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,790
Don't tell me you're looking for

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,120
Mr. Ning at this hour?

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,120
He's sick.

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,480
Ning Xiang wants me to check on him.

22
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,480
Since when did

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,040
Mr. Ning become so frail?

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Is he unhealthy?

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Lately, he has suffered some setbacks.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,560
Both his health and mental health
aren't too stable.

27
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,680
That sounds

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,070
pleasant to me.

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,510
Alright then.

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,960
I won't send you there.

31
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,560
Thank you.

32
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,430
We're here. Thanks.

33
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll wait for you downstairs.

34
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
It's hard to get a cab at this hour.

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,230
No need for that.

36
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,150
You can head back first.

37
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,510
Goodbye.

38
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,150
Liuzheng!

(Chlitina)

40
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,310
Mr. Ning?

41
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,960
Mr. Ning?

42
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,350
Door's unlocked.

43
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,280
Mr. Ning?

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,910
Mr. Ning?

45
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
Mr. Ning, are you in there?

46
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,680
Mr. Ning?

47
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
What are you doing?

48
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,960
Why are you doing this to yourself?

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,600
Are you out of your mind?

50
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,420
(Sunac Mall)

51
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,440
What would you like to eat?

52
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,120
This.

53
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,840
And this.

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,790
I found somewhere fun.

55
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,630
Let's go there next time.

56
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,510
Really?

57
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,910
Let's go there together next time.

58
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,510
I was just joking.

59
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,000
Stop it, you.

60
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,510
What's the matter?

61
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,470
What is this?

62
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,840
Waiter!

63
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,790
What the heck is this?

64
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,910
Is this an extra ingredient?

65
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
Bring me your manager!

66
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,070
Look!

67
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,790
Look at these!

68
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,880
Where's your manager?

69
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,790
A mister told me

70
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,120
to pass this note to you.

71
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,840
What?

72
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,630
A mister told me

73
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,630
to pass this note to you.

74
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,860
(- I will tell you my name directly.)
- What kind of shop is this?

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,720
(Your grandfather, Ruan Lang, did this.)

76
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,440
This is disgusting.

77
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,160
Listen up.

78
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,840
I will file a complaint!

79
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,160
Bring your manager here!

80
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,350
Tell them to bring their manager here.

81
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,960
Tell them

82
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
to bring their manager here?

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,030
Why don't we leave this place?

84
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you saying?

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,910
How could this happen?

86
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,560
Look at all the cigarette butts!

87
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
Let's go.

88
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,400
- What's going on?
- Here's the money.

89
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,560
Let's go.

90
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,280
No way!

91
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Bring your manager here!

92
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
- Come on.
- I want to file a complaint!

93
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Enough already.

94
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,070
Listen!

95
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,030
- Let's go!
- I will file a complaint!

96
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,790
Let's go.

97
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,630
Where's your manager?

98
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,600
- Stop shouting!
- Where is your manager?

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,630
Don't tell me

100
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,750
you thought

101
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,880
that I was trying to take my life?

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Has your hand healed?

103
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,070
It's almost healed.

104
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,960
It's okay now.

105
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,880
Didn't they tell you
to remove the bandage

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,910
after 15 days?

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,510
Today's only the 11th day.

108
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,790
The 11th day?

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,030
You actually remembered that?

110
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,750
I was good at Mathematics
in primary school.

111
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,030
I guess you're truly concerned about me.

112
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,400
Why did you come out of the blue?

113
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,750
Ning Xiang called me

114
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,440
and told me that you were sick.

115
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,750
He insisted on asking me
to check on you.

116
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,790
You didn't get the door

117
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,600
when I knocked.

118
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I thought something happened to you.

119
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm glad that you're fine.

120
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,400
I'll make a move now.

121
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,360
Ning Xiang told you to
check on me, right?

122
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,920
You should take care of me
before you leave.

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,240
If not, you won't be able
to face him later.

124
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,190
You're fine, right?

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm indeed sick.

126
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,190
Hello?

127
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,550
He's fine. Don't worry.

128
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,960
Goodbye.

129
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,430
Was it Xue Weilin?

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
Why was he looking for you?

131
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,670
He sent me here.

132
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,070
I told him that you were sick.

133
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,360
He called to see how you're doing.

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
He's concerned about me, huh?

135
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Tell him to keep his concern

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
for himself.

137
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,990
I'll pass the message to him.

138
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,630
You said you were sick, right?

139
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,310
What's the matter?

140
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,430
My head hurts,

141
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,310
and I feel nauseous.

142
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,400
I have the same disease as Ning Xiang.

143
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,600
What is it?

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,550
When I hear the name Xue Weilin,

145
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,400
my head hurts

146
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
and I feel nauseous.

147
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,510
He's not a bad guy.

148
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,360
Why are you so mean to him?

149
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,670
Don't you know why

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm mean to him?

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't.

152
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,720
You don't know?

153
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah.

154
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,240
You're just pretending here.

155
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,400
What exactly are you up to?

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Can't you tell that
I'm being jealous here?

157
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,960
I'm so jealous of him

158
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
that I'm going to die from it!

159
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,670
So, you're jealous of him?

160
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,670
Are you happy now?

161
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,430
Are you satisfied?

162
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Yeah.

163
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,990
You just wanted me

164
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,840
to admit that, right?

165
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm admitting it now.

166
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
I like you.

167
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,110
If so, do you dare

168
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,110
to admit that you like me?

169
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,040
It counts,

170
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,110
even if it's just a little.

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,920
I truly don't know.

172
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,870
You don't know, huh?

173
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,600
I have an idea.

174
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,360
Let's give it a test.

175
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
Are you okay?

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

177
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,800
Did I hurt you?

178
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,550
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,870
You still don't want to admit it, huh?

180
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,190
You're here already?

181
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,920
You can eat first.

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm not done with work yet.

183
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,110
Hey, you should join me first. Here.

184
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,720
Hurry.

185
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,630
Stop messing around.

186
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,990
It'll be inappropriate if people see us.

187
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,070
Even so,

188
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,840
I can't do anything about it.

189
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,800
Hey, don't tell me
you have a thing for me?

190
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,110
Darned brat.

191
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
It's nice.

192
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,920
You should sit down and have some.

193
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,280
Come on, sit down.

194
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,110
Just five minutes, alright?

195
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,600
They're pretty good.

196
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,110
Yeah, right?

197
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,750
Where did you buy them?

198
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,630
Give me two more.

199
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,550
What time are you getting off work?

200
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,920
Tomorrow morning

201
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,070
at 7am.

202
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,870
I can send Yaya

203
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,400
to kindergarten right after work.

204
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,160
Slowly.

205
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,750
Where's her father?

206
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,870
He went out on a business trip.

207
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,670
It's real this time.

208
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,670
I even bought the flight ticket for him.

209
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
Tan Ya, actually,

210
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,920
I saw your husband today.

211
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,870
He was at a hotpot shop

212
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,480
together with the previous girl we saw.

213
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,870
Don't be scared.

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
You still have us.

215
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,990
Didn't you set an alarm clock?

216
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,750
Didn't you say you were going to set it?

217
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,670
You said I didn't need to set one.

218
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,510
Did I say that?

219
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,160
Let's hurry!

220
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,510
Why are you so early today?

221
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,550
I thought your hand was injured?

222
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,630
I wanted to visit you.

223
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,990
Zheng,

224
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,480
why are you here
this early in the morning?

225
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,310
Were you guys together

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,990
last night?

227
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,800
She came here early

228
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,430
to deliver the files to me.

229
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,160
Do you know what era we're in?

230
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,920
You're still reading from paper copies?

231
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
Can't you read them online?

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,070
I'm a nostalgic person.

233
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,430
I love paper copies.

234
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,160
Nostalgic, huh?

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
Your hands are empty.

236
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,160
Where are the files?

237
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,190
Show them to me.

238
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,670
Or, do you have them with you?

239
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,870
Hey, are you here

240
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,720
to investigate me

241
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,550
or visit me?

242
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,160
Just go already.

243
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,280
Seems like your hand is fine now.

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,600
- I can still hit you when I'm injured.
- Fine.

245
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,510
I understand.

246
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,360
We're all adults here.

After five minutes, I'll...

261
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,600
Morning, Ning.

262
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Morning, Dr. Ruan.

263
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,400
You guys came together again.

264
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,070
Save your breath.

265
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,400
Did you guys meet each other
at the entrance

266
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,510
or the subway?

267
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,280
The subway's entrance.

268
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,040
What a coincidence, huh?

269
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,630
Ruan, aren't you working today?

270
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,510
Let's go.

271
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,920
I bought you

272
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,160
your favorite fruit.

273
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,960
Have a seat.

274
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,960
Let's get a divorce.

275
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,310
Please give me one more chance.

276
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,480
Give me one last chance.

277
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,630
I will hold custody of the child.

278

As for the house, car, and savings,

279
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,670
we'll split them equally.

280
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,760
What is this?

281
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,390
Look.

282
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,640
Look closely.

283
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,910
Chunyan isn't pregnant.

284
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,880
She's diagnosed with

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,480
polycystic ovary syndrome.

286
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,600
I've taken a close look at it.

287
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,640
So?

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,960
I've clarified myself.

289
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm not a casual person.

290
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,520
I don't care about

291
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,600
the type of person you are.

292
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,880
You don't need to
explain yourself to me.

293
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,390
Even so, I think you should

294
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,960
care about this.

How did I not know about this?

It's a patient
we just received last night.

301

I'm sure you don't know the patient.

302

This is the first patient

303
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,240
you're taking as the main surgeon.

304
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
You're allowing me
to be the main surgeon?

305
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,070
Don't think that
I'll feel grateful to you

306
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,150
just because you made me a main surgeon.

307
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,720
We only approved you

308
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,600
to be the main surgeon

Of course,

313
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,310
I was the one

314
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,390
who came up with the suggestion.

315

You see,

316
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,520
I always separate public affairs
from private affairs.

317

However,

318
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,190
if you look at me

319
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,480
in a better way because of that,

320
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,310

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,150
No thanks.

346
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,480
Let me check the bump on your head.

347
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,670
Does it hurt?

348
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,310
Yeah.

349
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,520
It hurts a lot.

350
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,360
Tell Dr. Ding

351
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
about your condition.

352
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,000
(Are you coming to my house tonight?)

353
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,430
(I need to go back
and get changed first.)

354
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,840
(If so, I'll pick you up
at your house later.)

355
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,670
(Okay.)

356
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,670
(Okay.)

357
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,190
Mom, I'm heading out.

358
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,190
You're heading out?

359
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,520
It's a class reunion.

360
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,150
Your father asked Xue Weilin
to have dinner with us.

361
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,240
Why don't you leave
after saying hi to him?

362
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,670
I'm running late. I can't wait for him.

363
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,760
We'll talk about it next time.

364
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,840
This child is...

365
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,030
Liuzheng?

366
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,790
You're here?

367
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,670
Dinner is ready.

368
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,520
You should head inside.

369
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,760
You're heading out again?

370
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,070
Was Mr. Ning doing okay last night?

371
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,390
He was fine.

372
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,880
That was disappointing.

373
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,390
Go in now.

374
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,550
My parents are waiting for you.

375
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,000
What kind of illness does he have?

376
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,360
He gets it in one day,
and he's okay the next day?

377
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,150
Anyway, I can't cook tonight.

378
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,190
Mr. Ning,

379
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,150
why don't you show me
your culinary skills?

380
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:21,960
What's the matter?

381
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,390
I cut myself by accident when
I was tying a knot during a surgery.

382
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Which hand?

383
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,390
You're so unprofessional.

384
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Don't tell other people
that you're my student.

385
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,390
Are you angry?

386
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,000
No.

387
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,550
I want boiled fish with pickled mustard.

388
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,880
That's unhealthy.

389
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,030
I'll steam some fish for you.

390
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,910
Hello.

391
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,760
Hello.

392
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,480
Get us a fish.

393
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:10,790
Okay.

394
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,360
Get us the big one.

395
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,190
Don't get that one.

396
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,480
Get that one.

397
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,760
Yes.

398
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,360
Yes, that's it.

399
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,380
Okay.

400
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,000
What's the matter?

401
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,520
Was the fish I picked not good?

402
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,600
Couldn't you tell?

403
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
It's obvious that the fish
has low oxygen saturation.

404
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,500
You have to pick

405
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,620
fish with strong reactions.

406
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,270
The stronger its reaction,
the healthier it is.

407
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,240
You don't even know that?

408
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,790
You're such a poor student.

409
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah, yeah. You're the best.

410
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Let me ask you something.

411
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,910
If a 500g fish needs to be steamed

412
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,190
for six minutes,

413
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,790
how long do we need to steam this fish

414
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,550
if it's 568g after removing

415
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,360
the weight of ginger and spring onion,
which is 25g?

416
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,150
How much does it weigh again?

417
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,310
568g.

418
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,120
568g?

419
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,120
So...

420
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,310
2 minus 25...

421
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,190
It's 6 minutes and 5 seconds.

422
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,790
Who said she was good at Mathematics

423
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,790
in primary school?

424
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,880
You're so strict.

425
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,720
Start the timer.

426
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,190
We have six minutes.

427
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,390
What should we do?

428
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,760
What should we do?

429
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,600
Why don't you sing for me?

430
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,670
My hand is hurt. I can't sing.

431
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,880
That's your microphone.

432
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,150
No.

433
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,640
I want you to sing for me.

434
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,070
Beg me then. I'll sing for you.

435
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,960
No.

436
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,000
If so, I won't sing.

437
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,840
I won't sing for you.

438
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,270
Hurry up.

439
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
Sing a song for me.

440
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,360
What song do you want?

441
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,150
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

442
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,360
Why did you choose the same song
as Ning Xiang?

443
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,720
Give me a key.

444
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,520
♪Twinkle, twinkle, little star♪

445

449
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,600
No!

450

What do you think?

457
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,030
Mr. Ning, you're truly
good at everything.

458
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,670
Even if you don't become a doctor,

459
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,840
you can become

460
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,640
a fine chef.

461
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,520
And, you can sing too.

462
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,150
You're quite

463
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,270
the boot-licker, aren't you?

464
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,070
You do learn from Ning Xiang quickly.

465
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,640
I can't just lose out to him
at the starting line, can I?

466
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,070
Here, have some fish.

467
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,720
It's good for your brain.

468
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,790
I did it on purpose.

469
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,720
I wanted to give you

470
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,120
a chance to perform.

471
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,720
You wanted to give me
a chance to perform?

472
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
If so,

473
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,240
do I have a chance to perform later?

474
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,760
What do you mean by this?

475
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,030
Tell me

476
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,790
what you mean by that first.

477
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,190
I want to take a sip.

478
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,520
Yes or no?

479
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,670
Of course,

480
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,600
I want to listen to Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star before I sleep.

481
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,760
I'll give you another chance to perform.

482
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,360
Alright. If so, this time,
I'll do more than just surround sound.

483
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,840
I'll provide you with a 3D experience.

484
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,840
Here.

485
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
You came out.

486
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,270
Stop tickling me.

487
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,790
I didn't.

488
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm ticklish.

489
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,390
Look at the pair of roosters.

490
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,600
Hurry, look.

491
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,720
Focus on the film.

492
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,190
Look.

493
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,880
Look, they're rolling around.

494
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,670
Tan Ya?

495
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,360
Hello?

496
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,030
(Nurse station)
Liuzheng, there's been a road accident.

497
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,000
Come to the hospital immediately.

498
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,190
Okay.

499
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,910
And,

500
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,670
Ning Zhiqian didn't answer my calls.

501
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,790
I'll contact him.

502
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,670
The hospital needs our help
for a pileup.

503
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:28,820
(Beiya Hospital)

504
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,390
There are all kinds of people now.

505
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,030
How dare he still drive on

506
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,120
the highway after drinking?

507
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,670
One dead and six injured.

508
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,000
But the driver is fine.

509
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,310
Do you think God was sleeping
when it happened?

510
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
I can't stand it anymore.

511
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,760
I need to take a nap after lunch.

512
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,190
Where's Ning Zhiqian?

513
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,390
He's still in the surgical theater.

514
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,640
He hasn't left the room yet.

515
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,000
Our doctors will die
sooner or later if they keep this up.

516
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,030
Look at them.

517
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,000
Didn't you say that
Ning Zhiqian has changed?

518
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,120
He pulls all-nighters so often

519
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,030
that his endocrine system
has gone crazy.

520
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,070
Of course he changed.

521
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,270
Enough.

522
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,760
You should eat more
if you have time to complain.

523
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,550
I'm so infuriated that I can't eat.

524
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,070
Don't eat so much then.

525
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,000
Were you two together

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
when I called you last night?

527
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,430
So, you two
have reconciled with each other?

528
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,270
Wait.

529
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,670
Have you two reconciled
for real this time?

530
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,390
Lower your volume.

531
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,030
Did he initiate it?
Or did you initiate it?

532
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I can't say for sure.

533
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,670
I think...

534
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,600
You couldn't help it.

535
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,880
If so, what's the relationship
between you two now?

536
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,240
I don't know either.

537
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,640
Didn't Ning Zhiqian give you an answer?

538
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,030
What about you?

539
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,600
What do you think then?

540
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,360
Just go with the flow, I guess.

541
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,520
I have something to tell you too.

542
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,480
I told Jiang Cheng that
I wanted to get a divorce.

543
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,150
Before this, I was worried
that he might cheat on me

544
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,550
with that woman again.

545
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,430
But now,

546
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,790
I don't need to worry about anything.

547
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,070
In the past,

548
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,670
I said that I would support you

549
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,760
no matter what decision you make.

550
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,190
I'm very happy

551
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,360
that you're willing to take this step.

552
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,390
Do you know something?

553
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,190
Mr. Ning used to tell me

554
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,520
that if you have two minutes
to be upset,

555
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,790
you should use the time to eat

556
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,760
so that you can
handle your next patient.

557
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:52,840
Hurry and eat.

558
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,760
You have two minutes.

559
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,670
Time will be up soon.

560
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,150
Ruan Liuzheng,

561
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,640
you're making me cry here.

562
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,600
Eat up.

563
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,670
You're giving me food?

564
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,640
You can take all of my meat.

565
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,640
That was touching.

566
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,760
What's the matter?

567
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,430
Ning Zhiqian's father is looking for me.

568
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,760
Ning Zhiqian does act quickly, huh?

569
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,300
Judging from his tone,

570
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,670
I don't think it's something good.

571
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,430
Mr. Ning.

572
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,430
Liuzheng.

573
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Have some coffee.

574
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,480
- It was just served.
- Thank you.

575
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,240
This.

576
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,520
(Bliss)

577
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,480
This is?

578
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,430
This is an engagement invitation.

579
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,960
Zhiqian grew up in an orphanage.

580
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,310
His eighth brother is getting engaged.

581
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,910
Liuzheng,

582
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,120
you should join him.

583
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,190
Why should I?

584
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,720
Xiao'er said you reconciled

585
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
with Zhiqian, right?

586
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,390
Liuzheng.

587
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,720
Here's your dessert.

588
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,120
Here.

589
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,150
Try it.

590
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,120
Liuzheng,

591
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,150
I need you

592
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,720
to do me a favor.

593
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,760
Please tell me.

594
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,000
You see,

595
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,430
about the engagement ceremony,

596
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,840
my wife

597
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,150
will be going too.

598
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,520
By then, you need to help me

599
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,120
to tame Zhiqian.

600
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,390
Don't let him throw a tantrum

601
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,640
and make everyone awkward.

602
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,880
It's an engagement ceremony.

603
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,760
If things do

604
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,150
get out of hand,

605
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
it'll be embarrassing, right?

606
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,880
If so...

607
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,960
If so, you should ask Mr. Ning

608
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,030
to stay home.

609
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,070
That won't do.

610
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,430
He and his eighth brother

611
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,910
grew up together.

612
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If he doesn't attend the ceremony,

613
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,030
people will think that Zhiqian

614
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
is looking down on other people

615
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,360
just because he's a capable doctor.

616
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,030
You do have a point.

617
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,150
If so,

618
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,840
Madam Liu is...

619
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,670
The fiancee of his eighth brother

620
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,360
is Madam Liu's niece.

621
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,310
Tell me. How could she not go?

622
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,390
You do have a point.

623
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,720
Both of them have to go.

624
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,120
Actually,

625
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,910
I have an idea.

626
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,150
I was thinking

627
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,190
that we can hold

628
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,720
an ice-breaking trip

629
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,030
for Zhiqian and my wife

630
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,120
during the engagement ceremony.

631
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,880
You...

632
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,030
That's a good idea.

633
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,240
However, I think

634
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,880
we need to plan this through.

635
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,760
After all,

636
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,430
you and Mr. Ning

637
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,790
are still not on speaking terms yet.

638
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,150
Plan this through, huh?

639
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,880
I've been planning this
for over 20 years.

640
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,910
There's no time better than the present.

641
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,520
Liuzheng,

642
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,190
I'm begging you here.

643
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,720
Please do me this favor.

644
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,300
(Bliss)

645
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,070
(Beiya Hospital)
Dear, we're at the hospital now.

646
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,120
Dear, hang in there.

647
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,310
Dear, we're at the hospital now!

648
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,270
Doctor!

649
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,390
Doctor!

650
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,000
Doctor!

651
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:12,760
- Doctor!
- What's the matter?

652
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,240
What's the matter?

653
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,150
My wife fainted!

654
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,910
She's fallen into a coma!

655
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,190
Calm down.

656
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,070
Tell me what's going on.

657
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,190
She's an elderly pregnant woman!

658
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,550
She had severe headaches
for the past few days.

659
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,790
And, she threw up too.

660
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,760
Notify the O&G Department and the
Department of Neurosurgery.

661
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,150
Okay.

662
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,960
Doctor, is my wife okay?

663
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,030
Doctor!

664
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,120
Dr. Wu.

665
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,480
Is Mr. Ning still in
the surgical theater?

666
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,390
Yes.

667
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,720
ER just received a pregnant woman.

668
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
The O&G Department wants one of you guys

669
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,670
to attend the medical consensus.

670
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,000
Dr. Cheng, are you free right now?

671
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,310
Yes. Let's go.

672
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,550
The O&G Department wants us
to join their medical consensus?

673
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,600
Let's go and take a look.

674
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,790
Doctor, what kind of condition
is she having?

675
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm from the O&G Department.

676
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,360
(Emergency Department)

677
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,240
Alright, you can head inside first.

678
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,790
They're inside.

679
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:49,960
Dr. Cheng.

680
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,480
What's the situation?

681
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,720
It's an elderly pregnant woman.

682
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
She has gestational hypertension.

683
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,240
She was already unconscious
when she was sent here.

684
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,880
Now, her heart rate
and breathing are normal.

685
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,030
However, her blood pressure
remains high.

686
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,150
That concerns the O&G Department.

687
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,190
Why did you call us here?

688
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,760
Her kin said

689
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,640
she suffered from severe headaches.

690
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,430
Yes.

691
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,240
She has headaches.

692
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,760
And, she also experienced
projectile vomiting.

693
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,790
How old is she?

694
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,070
39 years old.

695
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,840
39?

696
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,830
How old is the child?

697
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,870
22 weeks old.

698
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,480
Arrange an MRI scan for her later.

699
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,480
Doctor,

700
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,960
I heard that an MRI scan

701
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,630
is radioactive.

702
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,870
Will it affect my child?

703
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,040
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

704
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Let's check on the patient first.

705
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,560
Did you see it?

706
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,910
The tumor is pretty big.

707
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,430
It doesn't look too good for her.

708
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,080
What should we do in such situations?

709
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,150
We should operate on her
as soon as possible.

710
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,830
But she's pregnant.

711
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,320
Now, we can only perform
labor induction for her

712
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,590
and abort the child.

713
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,110
However, the child
is already 22 weeks old.

714
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,830
I know that.

715
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,390
However, she's an elderly
pregnant woman.

716
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,190
And, she has both hypertension
and brain tumor.

717
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,430
She can't just sacrifice her life

718
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,670
in order to give birth, right?

719
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll give birth

720
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,350
to my child, even if it kills me.

721
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,350
Please calm down.

722
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,630
I don't think you understand

723
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,630
the situation you're in.

724
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,590
I'll brief you about
your medical condition again.

725
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,630
You have severe
gestational hypertension.

726
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,720
Right now,

727
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,870
you should be experiencing
giddiness, headaches,

728
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,800
abdominal pain,

729
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,870
shortness of breath, blurry vision,

730
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,190
stuffy chest, irregular heartbeat,

731
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,150
nausea, vomiting,

732
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,870
and so on.

733
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,830
That's not the most severe part.

734
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,910
The most severe part

735
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,560
is that there's a tumor

736
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,630
growing in the middle part
of your brain.

737
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,830
Right now, its diameter
has already exceeded 5cm.

738
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,080
If we continue to let it grow,

739
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,480
the consequences will be dire.

740
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,000
What will happen?

741
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,350
It will endanger her life.

742
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,190
Doctor, what should we do then?

743
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,760
I suggest you terminate the pregnancy

744
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,350
and undergo chemotherapy
and a craniotomy.

745
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,000
No!

746
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,960
I must

747
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,480
give birth to this child!

748
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,280
Madam Li, please calm down.

749
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,720
I think you should consider that option.

750
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,320
You can get pregnant again
if you terminate the pregnancy.

751
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,040
However, all will be lost

752
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,520
if you're gone.

753
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,630
Do you know how hard it is
for me to get this child?

754
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,040
If I lose this child,

755
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,870
I won't be able to give birth again.

756
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,390
I know.

757
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,390
But medical technology
is very advanced now.

758
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,870
We'll find a way somehow.

759
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,320
Don't mention science in front of me.

760
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,480
I've already attempted
in vitro fertilization for five years

761
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,040
before I could get this child.

762
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,320
Please calm down.

763
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,350
Mei!

764
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,280
Take her blood pressure measurement.

765
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,830
Calm down.

766
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,080
Rest well.

767
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,830
We'll discuss your condition
in the meeting.

768
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,320
Calm down, okay?

769
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,040
Let's go.

770
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,040
What the heck is she thinking?

771
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,150
She's already in that state,

772
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,190
yet she still wants to
give birth to the child?

773
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,150
What else can she be thinking?

774
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,430
I'm sure she gave birth
to several daughters before this.

775
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,480
And now, she wants a boy
even at the expense of her life.

776
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,190
I've encountered
many situations like hers.

777
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,910
Ruan Liuzheng,

778
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,110
I thought you were full of reasons
usually?

779
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,000
Why didn't you utter
a single word just now?

780
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,000
I think

781
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,590
that there's more to this
than meets the eye.

782
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,080
I think

783
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,670
she has an unspeakable secret.

784
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,240
What other secret

785
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,430
is forcing her to give birth to
this child at the expense of her life?

786
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,830
I'm sure she has a throne to ascend.

787
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,350
What about this?

788
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,670
I'll tell Mr. Ning
about this case later.

789
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,830
I'll see what he thinks about it.

790
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,590
What else do you think will happen?

791
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,910
I understand Ning too well.

792
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,320
He'll surely say this.

793
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,630
"Doctors can only
provide suggestions to patients".

794
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,870
"However, the patient"

795
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,040
"needs to make the final decision".

796
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,150
Mr. Ning does have a point.

797
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,560
He has a point?

798
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,870
Are you saying that
I don't have a point?

799
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,720
As doctors,

800
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,350
we must learn how to form
our own judgment.

801
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,320
Doctors can only
provide suggestions to patients.

802
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,320
However, the patient

803
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,830
needs to make the final decision.

804
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,430
It's just like what
Dr. Cheng had predicted.

805
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,350
Our only choice

806
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,190
is to respect the patient's wish.

807
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,590
By the way,

808
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,720
Jiahua

809
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
is getting engaged this weekend.

810
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,590
Mr. Ning told me to pass
the invitation to you.

811
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,040
He did call me.

812
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,280
You'll attend it, right?

813
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,110
I will.

814
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,910
And,

815
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,080
Madam Liu will be attending it too.

816
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,630
The hardest thing in the world

817
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,590
is to make decisions.

818
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,480
We have to let the patient

819
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,190
and her relatives

820
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,430
make the final decision.

821
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,480
Listen.

822
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,390
Don't be mean to Madam Liu

823
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,430
during the engagement ceremony.

824
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,870
Jiahua spent a lot of money this time.

825
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,430
He booked this hotel
just for his engagement ceremony, huh?

826
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,110
Thank you so much.

827
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,000
Thank you.

828
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,390
Please go inside.

829
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,480
Alright.

830
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,480
(Zhao Jiahua & Liu Jiajia,
engagement banquet)

831
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,670
Ning Zhiqian.

832
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,350
Ruan Liuzheng.

833
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:02,720
Okay.

834
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,190
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

835
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,830
Don't be nervous.

836
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,430
Jiahua didn't manage to
attend our wedding ceremony

837
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,560
last time.

838
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,350
He doesn't know who you are.

839
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,110
Jiahua!

840
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,560
Zhiqian!

841
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,390
You're finally getting married, huh?

842
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,670
You look pretty suave.

843
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,480
Of course.

844
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,350
Jiajia,

845
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,190
this is Zhiqian.

846
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,080
Hurry and greet him.

847
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,110
Hello, Zhiqian.

848
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,560
Congratulations.

849
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,110
This must be Liuzheng.

850
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,390
Yes.

851
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,150
Your wife is so beautiful.

852
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,150
You two look perfect
standing next to each other.

853
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,960
Zhiqian, Liuzheng, please go inside.

854
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,190
Mr. Ning and the rest
have already arrived.

855
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

856
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,280
Congratulations.

857
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,150
Thank you.

858
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,190
What?

859
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,800
Are you trying to deny
what had happened on that night?

860
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,870
I know Jiahua didn't see me

861
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
during our wedding ceremony.

862
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
But your father and relatives
did see me, you know?

863
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
It's already been seven years.

864
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,560
All those elderly people
won't remember who you are.

865
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,110
Let me ask you something.

866
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,670
Just now,

867
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,830
Jiahua called you Zhiqian.

868
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,080
Are you two

869
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,670
and Xiao'er relatives?

870
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,480
We're not considered relatives.

871
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,910
We grew up together.

872
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,590
We became

873
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,320
sworn brothers.

874
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,190
I'm number six within the gang.

875
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,190
That's why he calls me
his sixth brother.

876
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,190
What's the matter?

877
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,520
You sound like you were in a triad.

878
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,040
Look at how successful

879
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Zhiqian is now.

880
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,150
Precisely.

881
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,320
He's the deputy manager of a department
in Jiangzhou's Grade 3A Hospital.

882
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,110
Everyone has to depend on him.

883
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
I think

884
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,590
we need Zhiqian's help in the future.

885
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
No matter how successful he is,

886
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
he did grow up

887
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,040
under your watch.

888
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,060
(Groom: Zhao Jiahua, Bride: Liu Jiajia)
Just tell me if you guys need any help

889
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,800
(Welcome to our banquet)
in the future.

890
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,350
I'll tell him

891
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,040
to arrange everything for you all.

892
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,560
But I hope you guys won't need his help.

893
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,000
Zhiqian?

894
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,590
Zhiqian!

895
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,080
Sit down.

896
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,830
Mr. Ning.

897
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,590
Liuzheng.

898
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,240
Qian.

899
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,760
You brought yourself a girl.

900
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,480
He brought someone.

901
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,480
Introduce her to us.

902
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,720
Hurry, introduce yourself.

903
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,670
My name is Ruan Liuzheng.

904
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm working in Beiya Hospital's
Department of Neurosurgery.

905
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,720
Mr. Ning is my mentor.

906
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,350
You've seen Xiao'er before.

907
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,630
You know him too.
I'll skip the introduction then.

908
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,630
This is...

909
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm his third brother.

910
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,870
Hello.

911
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,560
I'm his fourth brother.

912
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,430
Hello.

913
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,480
I'm his fifth brother.

914
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,870
Hello.

915
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,520
That's my sixth brother.

916
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm his seventh brother.

917
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,720
Hello.

918
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,590
We'll sit with you guys then.

919
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,240
We have no space for you.

920
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,590
We can squeeze.

921
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,720
No, no.

922
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,000
Your old man is over there.

923
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,800
Come.

924
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,350
Sit down.

925
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,960
Sit over there.

926
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,560
Come.

927
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,830
Hurry.

928
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,590
Sit.

929
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,870
That's right. This is your seat.

930
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,430
Misters, madams, long time no see.

931
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,670
Let's have a toast.

932
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,080
Madam, to you.

933
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,390
Zheng,

934
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,960
since you're here,
let me tell you why we were called

935
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,830
The 12 Young Masters of Zhendong Street.

936
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,040
Back then,

937
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,830
we ruled over Jiangzhou.

938
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,870
Why is that the case?

939
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,870
Our first brother can
hold his liquor well.

940
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,390
I can boast well.

941
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
Our third brother can run well
while our fourth brother can write well.

942
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,390
Our fifth brother can act well.

943
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,320
When it comes to Zhiqian,

944
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,720
he's the best.

945
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,560
What is he good at?

946
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,000
He's good at fighting.

947
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,590
Back then, whenever there was a fight,

948
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,240
if we brought him to the fight,

949
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,720
it'd be like bringing
a Rottweiler to the fight.

950
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,720
Whenever people hear his name,

951
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,190
they'll run away.

952
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,720
Xiao'er,

953
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,560
stop that.

954
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,800
It's all in the past.

955
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,520
Alright.

956
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,080
You guys can return to your seats.

957
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,590
Later.

958
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,320
I'll drink with you guys later.

959
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,150
Enjoy yourselves!

960
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,000
Zhiqian is so tall now.

961
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,240
I carried you on my back
when you were young.

962
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,760
Do you still remember me?

963
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,830
I do.

964
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,520
Zhiqian's girlfriend

965
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,000
looks pretty familiar.

966
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,240
She does look like his ex-wife.

967
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,320
Is that so?

968
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,870
I arranged for you guys to sit here.

969
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,110
If you sit with his brothers,

970
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,390
they will

971
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,960
get you drunk.

972
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,590
You're considerate indeed.

973
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,150
Here, eat up.

974
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,040
Please sit down.

975
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Sorry that I'm late.

976
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,150
You're here.

977
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,150
Sit down.

978
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,080
Madam Liu.

979
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,000
Liuzheng, you're here?

980
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,870
Long time no see.

981
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,910
You're getting prettier and prettier.

982
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,960
Thank you.

983
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,320
Today's Jiahua's engagement ceremony.

984
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
When will you two

985
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
hold your wedding then?

986
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,080
That's our business.

987
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,590
Outsiders don't need
to worry about that.

988
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,320
What's wrong with you?

989
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,910
Everyone, eat up.

990
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,670
Look at all the people around you.

991
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Hurry.

992
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,150
Why didn't you tell me
that she was coming?

993
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,080
Who said I didn't tell you?

994
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
When did you tell me?

995
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,590
Today's his engagement ceremony.

996
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,960
Don't do something stupid.

997
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,190
Eat more vegetables.

998
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,630
It's fine for me to indulge myself
once in a while.

999
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,560
Besides, today's a joyous occasion too.

1000
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,960
Even so, you need to
take care of your health.

1001
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,520
Alright.

1002
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,190
My goodness.

1003
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,430
I need to take my medicine.

1004
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,870
Is the water warm enough?

1005
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,110
Yeah. It's fine.

1006
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,150
Here, Ning.

1007
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,350
Cheers.

1008
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,190
Come.

1009
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,910
Bottoms up.

1010
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,350
Sorry.

1011
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,190
Ning has hypertension.

1012
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,830
The doctor said he can't drink.

1013
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,280
Today's Jiahua's engagement ceremony.

1014
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,080
It's a joyous occasion.

1015
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,960
Why can't I drink?

1016
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,800
Put it down.

1017
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,080
Zhiqian,

1018
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,910
you're a doctor.

1019
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,150
Can your father take alcohol?

1020
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,150
That's his business.

1021
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,960
I have no say over that.

1022
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,870
So,

1023
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,350
Zhiqian is saying...

1024
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,110
What are you trying to do?

1025
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,480
He's saying that
I can drink if I feel like it.

1026
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,280
Here, cheers.

1027
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,960
Come.

1028
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
Let's drink.

1029
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,800
That's enough. What are you doing?

1030
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,630
Enough.

1031
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,560
Madam Liu.

1032
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,280
I'm fine.

1033
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,480
Come.

1034
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:45,870
I'll drink

1035
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,430
on Ning's behalf today.

1036
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,800
Bottoms up.

1037
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,760
- Cheers.
- Okay.

1038
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,590
- Come.
- Let's drink.

1039
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,380
Let's drink.

1040
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,350
Sorry about that.

1041
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,080
Eat up.

1042
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,480
I'll go.

1043
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,240
Come, Xiao'er,

1044
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,320
Third Brother, Fourth Brother.

1045
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,760
Since I'm driving today,

1046
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,870
I'll be drinking water instead.

1047
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,670
Let's continue.
