00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,769
Dr. Cheng. Dr. Ding.

4
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,368
Wu Youwei.

5
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,089
Why are you here?

6
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,968
I'm about to be discharged.

7
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,049
I wanted to say goodbye

8
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:52,888
before I left.

9
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,209
You're too courteous.

10
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,529
We only did what we should.

11
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,608
I know you won't accept gift money.

12
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,008
But you must

13
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,968
(Decisive and Prompt, Brilliant Doctor)
accept

14
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,489
these two pennants

15
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,368
that represent my heartfelt gratitude.

16
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:05,409
(Decisive and Prompt, Brilliant Doctor)
Decisive and prompt.

17
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:06,729
Dr. Ding.

18
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:07,849
Thank you.

19
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:08,888
Brilliant doctor.

20
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:09,728
Dr. Cheng.

21
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,129
Thank you.

22
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:13,448
Brilliant doctor.

23
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:14,728
Decisive and prompt.

24
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,409
Impressive.

25
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,289
We'll accept these,

26
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:16,888
then.

27
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:17,528
Okay.

28
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:18,409
You guys continue your work.

29
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,168
I'll take my leave now.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,280
- Bye.
- Bye.

31
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,129
Decisive and prompt...

32
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,888
Stop it.

33
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:34,968
Store these well

34
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,049
in our department.

35
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,489
This is my first pennant.

36
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,328
Make sure they're kept well.

37
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:40,808
We will.

38
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,009
How nice.

39
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:46,129
Another patient discharged
with a clean bill of health.

40
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,049
No need to live with a secret anymore.

41
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:50,409
Dr. Ding,

42
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:51,528
do you have

43
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:52,649
any secrets?

44
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:53,489
No.

45
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:54,608
I do.

46
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,009
You do?

47
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:57,888
I don't want to know.

48
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,688
I like you.

49
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:09,289
I'm off

50
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,009
to the outpatient department.

51
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,248
Okay.

52
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:10,929
Okay.

53
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,289
You're really taking your time.

54
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:40,769
You've been staring at me all morning,

55
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:41,808
but you still haven't asked me.

56
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:44,088
Ruan Lang told you, right?

57
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:46,849
Yes.

58
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,968
What are your plans now?

59
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:51,929
He promised me
he would break up with her.

60
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,168
Liuzheng,

61
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,608
don't laugh at me.

62
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:00,929
I have

63
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,049
a sharp tongue,

64
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:06,168
but I have a soft heart.

65
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,569
I'm not like you.

66
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,369
You say you don't mind,

67
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,248
but you're quick and firm
in your decisions.

68
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,168
You've been through
more things than I have.

69
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,529
So I trust that you have your reasons

70
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,969
for your choices.

71
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,489
But just know

72
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,489
that I'll be here

73
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:27,689
whenever you need me.

74
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:32,728
Eat.

75
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,128
I'll get you some fruit.

76
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:53,209
Mr. Xue, you're here.

77
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,008
Liuzheng.

78
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:55,649
I was around the area,

79
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,649
so I thought I would stop by to see you.

80
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:57,328
Have a seat.

81
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:58,608
I bought coffee for everyone.

82
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:00,769
I hope I'm not interrupting your break.

83
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:01,529
No.

84
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:02,049
Thank you.

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
- Mr. Xue brought us coffee.
- Here

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:03,888
Have some coffee.

87
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:04,848
Here.

88
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:05,689
This is great.

89
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:06,489
Coffee.

90
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:07,128
Here.

91
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:07,848
Thanks.

92
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:10,249
Allow me to introduce myself.

93
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:11,489
I am

94
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,689
a good friend of Dr. Ruan.

95
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,369
My name is Xue Weilin.

96
00:05:14,728 --> 00:05:15,769
I am a lawyer

97
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:16,608
by profession.

98
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,128
I don't know your preference for coffee,

99
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,408
so I just got you something.

100
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,369
Thanks.

101
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,489
It's all free

102
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:22,649
for Dr. Ruan's friends.

103
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:23,249
Good.

104
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,249
Great.

105
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:25,848
Mr. Xue.

106
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:26,969
Mr. Ning.

107
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:27,769
Why are you here?

108
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,328
Here to get your health checked?

109
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,608
You can't register here.

110
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,089
Coffee, Mr. Ning?

111
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:31,728
No.

112
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:32,608
Thanks.

113
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,408
Mr. Ning is a humorous guy.

114
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,089
This is my business card.

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,489
Of course.

116
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:51,128
Wu.

117
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,288
Mr. Ning.

118
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:55,249
Isn't there

119
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,328
an explicit rule in our hospital

120
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,089
that states

121
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,529
that non-staff members
are not permitted to enter the office?

122
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,120
- I have a friend.
- I know.

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,369
She and her husband...

124
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:02,888
Dr. Cheng.

125
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:03,848
Let me introduce you.

126
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:04,809
He is an elite doctor and backbone

127
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:05,929
of our department,

128
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:06,608
Dr. Cheng.

129
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,608
Hello. I'm Cheng Zhouyu.

130
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,008
Hello. I'm Xue Weilin.

131
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,969
I'm a good friend of Dr. Ruan.

132
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,288
Oh, Dr. Ruan's friend.

133
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:15,689
No wonder you're so handsome.

134
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:17,008
Let's all exchange contacts on WeChat.

135
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:17,689
Wu Xiaofan.

136
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,128
Wu Xiaofan!

137
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,288
Let's exchange contacts too, Mr. Xue.

138
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:23,888
Mr. Ning.

139
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,288
Can't you see that we have

140
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:27,328
a non-staff member here?

141
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:30,489
Got it.

142
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:36,728
Dr. Ning said

143
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,168
that it's working hours right now.

144
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:39,249
Everybody, get back to work.

145
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,168
Disperse.

146
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:41,408
Stay in touch via WeChat.

147
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:42,568
Okay.

148
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,209
Stay in touch on WeChat.

149
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:44,929
Sorry.

150
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:45,769
Let me add you on WeChat.

151
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,408
Thank you for the coffee.

152
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:50,168
Goodbye.

153
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:57,769
Liuzheng,

154
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,089
I'll be leaving now.

155
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,489
I'll come and see you again
when I'm free.

156
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:03,049
I'll see you off.

157
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:15,408
Let's go.

158
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,249
Don't mind him,

159
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,489
Mr. Xue.

160
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,128
Dr. Ning is very serious

161
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:37,168
when he is at work.

162
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:38,969
It's fine. I understand.

163
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,649
Don't feel pressured or anything.

164
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:41,809
Mr. Xue!

165
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:43,888
Mr. Xue.

166
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:44,408
Hello.

167
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:46,008
My name is Ding Yiyuan.

168
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,568
We're in the same department.

169
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,049
You said we could consult you

170
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,689
if we had any legal issues?

171
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,288
Do you have legal problems, Dr. Ding?

172
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,209
No, it's my patient.

173
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,209
I'll take you to him.

174
00:07:57,888 --> 00:07:58,328
Let's go.

175
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:58,608
All right.

176
00:07:58,608 --> 00:07:59,249
This way.

177
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,448
His name is Li Xiangui.

178
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,448
He's a construction worker
at a nearby site.

179
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:18,168
A few days ago,

180
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,929
he fell and injured his head
at the site.

181
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,809
The person in charge

182
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:22,489
dropped by once.

183
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,448
He paid 10,000 for his medical expenses

184
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:25,489
and disappeared.

185
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:26,728
So I wanted to ask you

186
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,168
if you could help him

187
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,529
given his circumstances.

188
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,689
I have a general idea of the situation.

189
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:37,768
Don't worry, ma'am.

190
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:38,728
I'll have my assistant come over

191
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:39,968
to get the details.

192
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,489
So you mean...

193
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,489
I'll take the case.

194
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:45,249
Thank you.

195
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:46,249
Thank you, Dr. Ding.

196
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,049
Thank you, sir.

197
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,208
Don't mention it.

198
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:54,608
It's normal for doctors

199
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,129
to work overtime.

200
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:57,329
She should understand this.

201
00:08:58,768 --> 00:08:59,408
What?

202
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,088
She thinks he is too short?

203
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:02,848
Well, she knows nothing.

204
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:03,929
He is knowledgeable.

205
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:05,889
The best of the best is concentrated.

206
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:06,968
Besides,

207
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:07,728
what matters is

208
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:09,049
he is kind and has a good character.

209
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:10,968
That's right.

210
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,648
You can't judge a book by its cover.

211
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:14,608
Get her to introduce him well.

212
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:27,929
Mr. Cheng,

213
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:29,929
it's time for us to make the rounds.

214
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:32,929
There are two minutes left.

215
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,288
Don't be impatient.

216
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,489
Dr. Ding,

217
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:37,968
flowers for you.

218
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,369
Who are those from?

219
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,728
Do you have a boyfriend, Dr. Ding?

220
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,369
No.

221
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:46,809
These flowers

222
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,489
look lovely.

223
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,809
It's obvious
that the gifter has good taste.

224
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,608
So who sent you these flowers?

225
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,369
No idea.

226
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:55,768
I know.

227
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,208
It's the attending doctor
of the thoracic surgery department,

228
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,569
Xie Haojie.

229
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:00,809
Dr. Cheng,

230
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,929
I bet you don't know this.

231
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:02,889
Dr. Xie has been

232
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,329
pursuing Dr. Ding

233
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,408
aggressively.

234
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:06,889
A few days ago,

235
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:07,929
I saw him

236
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,288
giving Dr. Ding breakfast.

237
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,329
Two large barbecue pork buns.

238
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,489
He did buy me those buns,

239
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,728
but I gave them to you, remember?

240
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:17,249
Right.

241
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,168
I ate all of them.

242
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,088
What's that Dr. Xie's background?

243
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:22,408
Dr. Xie?

244
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,009
He came from a family of doctors.

245
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:24,968
Just like Dr. Ding,

246
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,249
he returned from the US.

247
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,968
If they get together,

248
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,369
they'll definitely be a perfect match

249
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:30,369
made in heaven.

250
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:31,648
They have great chemistry between them.

251
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:32,929
Wu Xiaofan.

252
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,249
Let me correct you.

253
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,168
I've seen that guy.

254
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:37,848
He is only

255
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:38,968
about this tall.

256
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:40,768
If Dr. Ding puts on high heels,

257
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,129
she could be
half a head taller than him.

258
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,369
You call that a perfect match?

259
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:43,968
I mean...

260
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:45,569
Am I that tall?

261
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:46,168
I'm here,

262
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:47,329
and Dr. Xie is here?

263
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:48,848
We're half a head apart in height?

264
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,049
Yes.

265
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,129
Dr. Xie is short.

266
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,648
But essence is concentrated.

267
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:53,489
Maybe Dr. Ding

268
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:54,768
prefers a guy with short legs.

269
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,329
I do like a guy with short legs.

270
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,848
I do like essence.

271
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,088
See, Dr. Cheng?

272
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,689
You're too old-fashioned.

273
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,208
Height is never the problem.

274
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,009
They're equally matched
in intelligence and talent.

275
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,088
They would make a perfect couple.

276
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:07,009
I think they're a great match.

277
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:07,369
That's right.

278
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,408
"Dear Ding,

279
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:09,129
may you smile

280
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,249
as beautifully as a flower every day.

281
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,689
Please allow me to be your guardian.

282
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,049
From your most respected

283
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:19,449
Dr. Cheng."

284
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:23,408
Spreading misinformation
so early in the morning.

285
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,208
Listen.

286
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,049
Stop spreading lies!

287
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:26,809
I picked this up in the hallway.

288
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:27,689
I'll throw it out for you.

289
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:28,288
Give it here!

290
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,449
Stop! Stop right there!

291
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:30,049
Give it back!

292
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:32,528
Let's make the rounds.

293
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:43,728
Wait for me!

294
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:49,889
Ding,

295
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,129
do you like the flowers I got you?

296
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:53,489
What do you want?

297
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,288
I want to be your Big Big Wolf.

298
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:00,809
Will you be

299
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,569
my Pleasant Goat?

300
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:06,809
Stay away from me.

301
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:08,088
Okay.

302
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,408
Can you not lift your pinky fingers

303
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,489
when you adjust your glasses?

304
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,369
You're so cheesy.

305
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:15,809
Yes, Ding.

306
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:19,968
Ding,

307
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,208
what's your answer?

308
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,049
No.

309
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:23,569
Why not?

310
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:26,608
Don't you like
teacher-student relationships?

311
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:27,728
Our relationship right now

312
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:28,449
is perfect for that.

313
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:29,889
Have the pink bubbles in your mind

314
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,088
finally burst?

315
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,569
Let me be frank with you, Cheng Zhouyu.

316
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:34,929
I will not fall for you.

317
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:36,848
Why?

318
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,569
Even if I'm not
the most handsome guy there is,

319
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:39,728
I definitely look more like a hero

320
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:40,929
than Xie Haojie.

321
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:42,648
I don't like Xie Haojie.

322
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:43,329
Really?

323
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,569
But I don't like you, either.

324
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:46,889
I guarantee

325
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,929
that I'm the second-best man

326
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,329
within a 50-metre radius of you.

327
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,129
Is there anyone here?

328
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,249
I'm standing right here.

329
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,208
I think

330
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,809
you have a misconception about yourself.

331
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,728
I'll be assessed
for the associate position next year.

332
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:01,689
I'll be the second

333
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,689
deputy chief physician that's so young

334
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:05,249
in the entire hospital.

335
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,088
A toad wishing to eat swan meat.

336
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,889
Don't say that.

337
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,968
I'm an excellent guy,

338
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,489
but you're definitely not a toad.

339
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,648
I meant you.

340
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:14,168
You're the toad!

341
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,249
Me?

342
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,049
Just give up,

343
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:17,848
Cheng Zhouyu.

344
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,968
Is there a toad as handsome as me?

345
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,369
Assemble at Point B!

346
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,288
Head Nurse,

347
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,168
we can stop the antibiotics
for the patient in Bed 14.

348
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:41,768
All right.

349
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:42,929
The patient in 501

350
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,569
was admitted
to the emergency room last night.

351
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:46,408
He had a terrible migraine
when he was brought in.

352
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:53,449
Snipe! Don't go forward!

353
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:54,728
Hide in the back!

354
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,088
Be careful!

355
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,088
We're the only two left.

356
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:01,809
Ou Xiaoming.

357
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,088
How old are you?

358
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:03,929
98!

359
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:05,968
98K, don't charge ahead!

360
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:07,329
Go back!

361
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:08,528
Xiaoming,

362
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:09,528
Dr. Ning is talking to you.

363
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:11,168
Ask away.

364
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:11,968
I'm listening.

365
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:12,528
Go on.

366
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,608
How old are you?

367
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:15,489
Are you dumb?

368
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,369
Doctor, it's all up there.
See for yourself.

369
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:18,689
Do you have

370
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:19,929
any other symptoms besides headaches?

371
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:22,728
We're the only two left.

372
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,889
You can't be so reckless!

373
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,009
Xiaoming, stop playing.

374
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:26,009
Dr. Ning is asking you questions.

375
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,329
Just ask. I'm listening.

376
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,009
Do you have

377
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,329
any other symptoms besides headaches?

378
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:30,689
All right. I'm dead.

379
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:33,489
What did you say

380
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:34,648
I... I had,

381
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:35,489
Doctor?

382
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:37,489
Dr. Ruan.

383
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,528
From the density,

384
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,009
it appears to be a meningioma

385
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:42,049
located

386
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,608
in the superficial cerebral hemisphere.

387
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:44,608
It's not

388
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,848
a terminal illness, is it?

389
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:46,569
No.

390
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:47,848
We just need to remove it.

391
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:48,768
It's not serious.

392
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,129
What will happen after that?

393
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,528
You'll be just as you are now.

394
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:52,929
Remove it, then.

395
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,728
We're confiscating

396
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,528
your phone.

397
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:57,889
Head Nurse,

398
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:58,889
keep that phone for him.

399
00:14:58,889 --> 00:14:59,249
All right.

400
00:14:59,249 --> 00:14:59,929
Don't...

401
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:00,569
I'm confiscating that.

402
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,009
Give it to me.

403
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:02,288
We're confiscating that.

404
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:02,889
Dr. Ruan,

405
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:03,689
I'll leave him to you.

406
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:04,528
All right.

407
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,728
I'll check your vision.

408
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,288
Well, at least finish that round!

409
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:12,728
Here. Look at me.

410
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:14,728
Look me in the eye.

411
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,088
Can you see my fingers?

412
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,449
No. Look at my eyes.

413
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:21,968
Can you see them?

414
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,009
Not even at this distance?

415
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,049
Do you play games

416
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:28,689
all the time?

417
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:31,689
You have very poor eyesight.

418
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:32,768
You really shouldn't be
playing any more games.

419
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,288
Get online.

420
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:46,689
How is he?

421
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:47,889
Narrow field of vision.

422
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,528
Further tests required.

423
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:51,168
Why don't you perform

424
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,809
Ou Xiaoming's operation?

425
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:56,848
Me?

426
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:58,689
Is there a problem?

427
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:02,208
No.

428
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:03,408
Continue the rounds.

429
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,449
Congratulations,

430
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,049
you're going
to perform your first surgery.

431
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,049
Well,

432
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,689
I'm a little nervous.

433
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:16,329
What's there to be nervous about?

434
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:17,768
Don't get cold feet. You got this!

435
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:21,728
We're all colleagues.

436
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,689
Even if you're upset,
you shouldn't show it.

437
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,088
When will I get to perform an operation?

438
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:26,569
When I think

439
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,168
you're ready for it.

440
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,489
So I have to get your approval

441
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,329
before I can do it?

442
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:33,489
Did you just find out?

443
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,968
Cheng Zhouyu, you're abusing your power
for personal reasons!

444
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,129
I'm not that petty.

445
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,408
Dr. Ding,

446
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:39,689
impatience

447
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:40,968
is a big no-no for surgeons.

448
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:42,608
You require

449
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,408
more training.

450
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,208
I think Dr. Cheng

451
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,369
made some fair points.

452
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,849
Ou Xiaoming.

453
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,008
Why are you playing games again?

454
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,288
Didn't I tell you to stop?

455
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:17,368
Where did you get that phone?

456
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:18,408
I bought a new one.

457
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,168
Which is more important?

458
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,329
Your game or your life?

459
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,729
Game.

460
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:25,648
Where are your parents?

461
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:27,648
On the plane in Australia, I think.

462
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:28,729
They should be back soon.

463
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:31,768
Give it to me.

464
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:32,729
What are you trying to do?

465
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,689
Dr. Ruan,

466
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:36,729
do you play games?

467
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:38,168
No.

468
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:39,368
I figured as much.

469
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:40,168
You're so boring.

470
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:41,248
You definitely don't play any games.

471
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:45,008
Give it to me now.

472
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,248
No!

473
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,049
Do you know Crossfire?

474
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,288
We designed that game.

475
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:55,209
You guys designed that?

476
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:57,488
Want to try it?

477
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:01,969
Sure. I'll give it a try.

478
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:05,368
No more games.

479
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:06,209
I'm confiscating this.

480
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,008
Lay down and get some rest.

481
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:11,288
She's no fun.

I'm reading up on Ou Xiaoming.

(Daily Life)
Ou Xiaoming.

490
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:11,729
Dr. Ruan,

491
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,729
Mr. Ning wants you to open up

492
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,969
the head of a young prodigy.

493
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,049
The future of Chinese games

494
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,849
lies in your hands.

495
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,329
You've been entrusted
with an important mission.

496
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:24,008
Make sure your hands don't shake.

497
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:29,329
Good luck.

498
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,368
He is asleep.

499
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,689
Don't worry.

500
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,128
This is your first surgery.

501
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:31,689
I've got a closer eye on him than you.

502
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:32,729
I promise he'll pass

503
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:33,488
all the indicators

504
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:34,729
before the operation.

505
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,128
This is the third one.

506
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:44,569
What's wrong?

507
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,888
Do you know who he is?

508
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,168
Who is he?

509
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,768
He designed several of the games

510
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,408
that are super popular right now.

511
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,609
He is a young prodigy.

512
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:57,609
I couldn't tell.

That chubby little guy

is a genius?

Ning Zhiqian assigned you

518
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,248
isn't hard.

519
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,408
You can do it with your eyes closed.

520
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,049
I wasn't so nervous before.

521
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:15,929
Feel my hands. They're covered in sweat.

522
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:17,929
My heart is racing.

00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,689
I'm worried, you know?

524
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,449
His tumour is in

525
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:23,729
the superficial part of his cerebrum,

526
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:25,488
but if I make a mistake

527
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,408
and damage his brain tissue,

528
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:28,648
I would ruin

529
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,929
a young prodigy.

530
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:32,008
I can't afford
to take responsibility for that.

531
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,569
What's the matter with you?

532
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:35,248
The most important thing

533
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,008
for a surgeon is confidence.

534
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:38,209
Imagine

535
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,488
you're Ning Zhiqian.

536
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:40,288
Think of the way he considers everything

537
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:41,449
a piece of cake.

538
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:42,528
You got this.

539
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:47,648
Will you be mad

540
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:50,089
if I say I don't want

541
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,569
to do the surgery anymore?

542
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,008
I won't.

543
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:56,849
I would strangle you.

544
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,248
If you don't do it,

545
00:22:59,248 --> 00:22:59,888
Ding Yiyuan

546
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,288
will take over in an instant.

547
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,168
She can do it if she wants.

548
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:06,689
Can't you be more motivated?

549
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:09,648
There's still some time
until the operation.

550
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:10,929
You better shape up.

551
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:11,609
Dr. Ruan.

552
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:12,488
Adjust yourself.

553
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:14,929
Understand?

554
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,809
See you.

555
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,128
(The future of Chinese games)

556
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,970
(lies in your hands.)

557
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:54,329
(You've been entrusted
with an important mission.)

558
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,609
(Make sure your hands don't shake.)

559
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,400
(My mentor once told me)

560
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,800
(that neurosurgery)

561
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,130
(is like ballet on the tip of the blade.)

562
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,280
(Your hands must be stable.)

563
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,160
(Your mind must be calm.)

564
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,680
(Your eyes must be sharp.)

565
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,008
After you're done attending
to the patients in the morning,

566
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,008
make sure you eat lunch on time.

567
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:49,809
Don't forget about the two operations

568
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:50,449
in the afternoon.

569
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,209
Mr. Ning,

570
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,729
I don't think
I can be there for the surgeries.

571
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,528
I'm not feeling well.

572
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:55,488
What's wrong?

573
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,128
I'm on my period. My stomach hurts.

574
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,209
Does it still hurt
as much as it used to?

575
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,809
You should've said sooner
that you were unwell.

576
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:06,888
Take the day off.

577
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:08,049
It's fine.

578
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,288
I can handle my usual duties.

579
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:10,329
Tell Wu to take your place.

580
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:11,809
Will he be fine?

581
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:12,849
He'll do a better job than you.

582
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:14,128
Dr. Ning.

583
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:15,368
Please wait.

584
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,329
Please wait.

585
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:17,168
Please wait.

586
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:18,049
Please wait.

587
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:25,248
Who is it?

588
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:26,689
It's me, Liuzheng.

589
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:36,929
Is this your dog?

590
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:37,569
Yes.

591
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,449
Its name is Sisi.

592
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:39,168
Sisi.

593
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:40,368
-You're so cute.
-Greet her.

594
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:41,648
I didn't know

595
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:42,128
you had a dog

596
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:43,008
on top of your plants.

597
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:44,089
Come here.

598
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:47,329
Where are your parents?

599
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:49,408
The weather was nice,
so they went out for a walk.

600
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,168
Have a seat.

601
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:50,569
Okay.

602
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:53,329
I came

603
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,729
to tell you about the case.

604
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:56,648
There has been progress
in Li Xiangui's case.

605
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:57,648
Really? How is it going?

606
00:25:58,008 --> 00:25:59,089
The construction company

607
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:00,729
says he injured himself on accident

608
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:02,008
during his break.

609
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,168
But according to the labour laws

610
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:04,609
and the work-related injury regulation,

611
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:06,168
it should be recognised
as a work-related injury.

612
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:07,609
I'll continue to liaise with them.

613
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,329
If there are any updates,

614
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:09,209
you'll be the first to know.

615
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,609
That's great.

616
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:11,488
Thank you.

617
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:13,449
I want to do

618
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,329
meaningful things

619
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:15,609
that don't require anything in return.

620
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:18,768
You became a doctor

621
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:19,528
to save lives.

622
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:20,689
I became a lawyer

623
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:21,768
to save lives too.

624
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,168
Liuzheng,

625
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:24,768
our ideals

626
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:25,809
are the same.

627
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,569
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

628
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:35,648
Thanks.

629
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:37,528
You've had Sisi

630
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,368
for a long time now, right?

631
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:40,049
Yes.

632
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,368
Sisi has been with me for many years.

633
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,648
It's the weekend.

634
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:46,168
Why didn't you go out?

635
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:47,408
It must be boring at home.

636
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:51,528
I'm getting ready

637
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,408
for

638
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:53,849
my first operation.

639
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:55,329
You're going to perform
your first surgery?

640
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,008
Congratulations.

641
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:58,329
Thanks.

642
00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:00,008
Nervous?

643
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:01,449
Yes.

644
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:02,929
I keep wondering

645
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:04,329
what will happen if the surgery fails.

646
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:05,849
A doctor is a profession

647
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:06,969
that holds a lot of responsibility.

648
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,089
If I make a mistake,

649
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,049
the consequences are irreparable.

650
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,528
A string
that's pulled too tightly will break.

651
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:14,888
You need to learn how to relax.

652
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:35,689
Door opened.

653
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:38,768
Let me do it.

654
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:42,128
Dad, Grandpa and I are back.

655
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,049
Are you heading out?

656
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:47,648
I'm going out for a bit.

657
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:48,528
Can you stay here

658
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:49,008
with Ning Xiang for a while?

659
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:49,969
Okay.

660
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:50,689
I'll look after him.

661
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:51,609
Go on.

662
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,209
Be good and listen to your grandfather.

663
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,368
Got it.

664
00:27:58,329 --> 00:27:59,449
Ning Xiang, get the shoes.

665
00:27:59,689 --> 00:28:00,288
Okay.

666
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:03,248
Sisi,

667
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:04,648
do you like your mom?

668
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,408
Who are you calling Sisi's mom?

669
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,049
Sisi likes you.

670
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,329
Sisi.

671
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:12,689
Who's here?

672
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,168
That's a cute dog.

673
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:20,569
What's its name?

674
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,008
Sisi.

675
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,128
Mr. Ning.

676
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,209
Why are you here?

677
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:25,929
Sit.

678
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:29,089
You're rather free, Mr. Xue.

679
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:30,849
It's the weekend.

680
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:34,488
Ears.

681
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:36,209
Why didn't you reply

682
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:37,288
to my message?

683
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:38,569
My phone's charging.

684
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:40,768
I thought you were feeling awful.

685
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,049
But here you are,

686
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,168
playing with a dog.

687
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:44,969
Mr. Ning,

688
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,128
pardon me for being frank.

689
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,368
As her ex-husband,

690
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,969
you're in the past now.

691
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:50,089
If

692
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:51,569
Liuzheng and I remarry,

693
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:53,168
I'll be her present and future,

694
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:54,449
right?

695
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,569
Who said I'm remarrying you?

696
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,528
Mr. Xue and I

697
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,049
are discussing tenses.

698
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:01,689
The person in question
didn't even give you her consent.

699
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,488
Remarry?

700
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,569
I think that's just wishful thinking
on your part.

701
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:22,488
Ning Xiang

702
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:23,569
wanted me to give you these.

703
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:25,488
Remember to eat them.

704
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:27,488
Don't forget about the thesis.

705
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:29,569
Thanks.

706
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,248
Thank Ning Xiang.

707
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:38,729
Liuzheng,

708
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,648
Mr. Ning said

709
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,008
he wanted to be your present

710
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,329
and future.

711
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,128
I hope

712
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:46,488
we can have
a bright future together too.

713
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:51,248
Sisi,

714
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,089
I need to do my homework.

715
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:55,168
I'll play with you next time.

716
00:29:59,248 --> 00:29:59,929
Here.

717
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,049
Sisi.

718
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:06,089
Liuzheng,

719
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:08,288
are you hungry?

720
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:09,528
Why don't I make you something to eat?

721
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,929
That's all right. Thank you.

722
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,609
I want to be alone.

723
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:24,929
Let's go home,

724
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,689
Sisi.

725
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,020
(Beiya Hospital)

726
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,209
Promise me no more games.

727
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:10,569
Dr. Ruan.

728
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:14,368
Isn't today your day off?

729
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:15,689
I was called in

730
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:16,888
for an urgent operation.

731
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:17,768
It's late.

732
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:18,648
Why are you here?

733
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:20,888
I came to check on Ou Xiaoming.

734
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:26,569
Mr. Ning.

735
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:30,609
I would like to talk to you.

736
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,008
About what?

737
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:40,248
What's wrong?

738
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:41,729
Can I not

739
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:42,929
perform this operation?

740
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:47,128
Why?

741
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:49,849
He's so young

742
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:51,609
and he's a prodigy game designer.

743
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:53,849
This is my first surgery.

744
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:54,849
I...

745
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:58,849
You said it yourself.

746
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,008
A doctor can't guarantee

747
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,329
that he won't make any mistakes.

748
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:06,609
Do you think

749
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,969
a doctor has the right
to choose his patients?

750
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:11,329
What profession,

751
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,648
status, or age

752
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:13,329
do you think

753
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,288
makes a suitable patient
for your first operation?

754
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:16,888
Yes.

755
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,368
A doctor can't choose his patient.

756
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:20,929
But for the past few days,

757
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,488
whenever I think about the surgery,

758
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:24,729
I get very anxious

759
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:26,008
and nervous.

760
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:32,888
And?

761
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:39,368
Can you give this opportunity

762
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,488
to Ding Yiyuan instead?

763
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:49,449
I thought

764
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,449
you had matured after all these years.

765
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:53,049
But

766
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:55,248
you're the same as you were in school.

767
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:56,729
Cowardly.

768
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:58,768
Weak.

769
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,209
No, I'm different.

770
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:04,329
How so?

771
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:06,329
I just want to be responsible

772
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:07,089
for my patient.

773
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,408
If you really want

774
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:10,609
to take responsibility for your patient,

775
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:11,368
you should prepare yourself

776
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,368
for the operation.

777
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:14,248
If you give up

778
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:15,449
this time,

779
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:16,689
you'll do the same

780
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:17,368
whenever

781
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:18,408
you run into difficulty

782
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:19,768
and come up with an excuse

783
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:20,609
for yourself

784
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:21,768
to run away.

785
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:24,768
You want to be

786
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:25,768
a great doctor, don't you?

787
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:28,849
If so,

788
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,209
when you're faced
with challenges and anxiety,

789
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:32,768
you should face them

790
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:34,248
and overcome them.

791
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,168
Remember.

792
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:40,329
This is something

793
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:42,488
no one else can help you with

794
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:44,929
but yourself.

795
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:04,208
Dr. Ruan,

796
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,288
tell us your surgical plan

797
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:06,609
for Xiaoming in Bed 9.

798
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,329
Yes, Mr. Ning.

799
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,728
Given that the tumour is located

800
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,448
in the motor cortex,

801
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:12,968
it would be dangerous

802
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:14,248
if he showed any emotional fluctuations

803
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,569
during the operation.

804
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:16,488
So I plan to use

805
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:17,569
intraoperative waken-up

806
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:18,809
to ensure

807
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:19,968
the procedure goes smoothly.

808
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,569
And most meningiomas are...

809
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:22,329
Excuse me.

810
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:24,849
Who is the doctor in charge here?

811
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:27,768
I'm the deputy manager of neurosurgery,

812
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:28,528
Ning Zhiqian.

813
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:29,488
Who are you?

814
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:31,129
Hello.

815
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,569
Hello.

816
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:33,049
Are you Deputy Manager Ning?

817
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,488
I'm Ou Xiaoming's mother.

818
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:36,089
I just got back
from Australia yesterday.

819
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:37,928
We're discussing

820
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,809
your son's condition right now.

821
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:39,569
Please have a seat.

822
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:40,409
Okay.

823
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,240
- Thank you.
- Wu, get her some water.

824
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:41,968
All right.

825
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:46,409
Are you here to find out
more about your son's condition?

826
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:47,688
I heard

827
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,248
the doctor that's going

828
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:51,369
to operate on my son is new?

829
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:53,649
And it's their first time?

830
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,448
Hello.

831
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:58,569
I am that doctor.

832
00:35:59,248 --> 00:36:00,409
My name is Ruan Liuzheng.

833
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:01,768
I will be Ou Xiaoming's surgeon.

834
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:04,329
Hello.

835
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:06,528
Deputy Manager Ning,

836
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:09,329
such a young and pretty girl

837
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:11,288
performing the surgery?

838
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:13,889
Don't use my son as practice.

839
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,369
Your son's operation is not complicated.

840
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:18,008
Given Dr. Ruan's current abilities,

841
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,008
there is absolutely no problem.

842
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:20,248
Even so,

843
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:21,569
it's still a ´╗┐craniotomy.

844
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,208
What if something goes wrong?

845
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:24,968
She's so young,

846
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,728
and it's her first surgery.

847
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:28,768
Who will take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

848
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:29,649
It's a responsibility

849
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:30,649
none of us can afford.

850
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,208
But as doctors,

851
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:33,609
we will do our very best.

852
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:34,609
Rest assured.

853
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:37,169
That is not appropriate

854
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:38,528
for you to say.

855
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,008
I can't accept any risks

856
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:41,728
in my son's surgery.

857
00:36:42,528 --> 00:36:43,448
Deputy Manager Ning,

858
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:44,369
I looked it up

859
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,809
on the internet before I came.

860
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:46,849
I want you

861
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:48,569
to operate on my son.

862
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,569
Once my boy's on the operating table,

863
00:36:58,129 --> 00:36:59,129
his life

864
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,809
is in the doctor's hands.

865
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:01,849
So

866
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,688
I specifically came today

867
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:05,488
to request you

868
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:06,688
handle his surgery.

869
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:15,728
Here.

870
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:16,849
Have some fruit.

871
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,288
To the back, sniper!

872
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:24,528
Goodness...

873
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:28,008
She's playing games now?

874
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,928
Just like Ruan Lang.

875
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:32,008
Oh, dear.

876
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:33,369
Oh, no...

877
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:34,849
She's doomed.

878
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:48,008
Silly!

879
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,000
- Drink more water.
- How are you feeling today?

880
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,768
The same as yesterday.

881
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:54,248
Dr. Ruan.

882
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,928
I looked at your report card.

883
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:58,288
Haemoglobin value is a little low.

884
00:37:58,288 --> 00:37:58,968
But it's not a concern.

885
00:37:58,968 --> 00:37:59,968
He can still undergo the operation.

886
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:00,768
Okay.

887
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:02,049
Try to eat

888
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,849
more foods that are low in fat

889
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,768
and high in protein.

890
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:05,609
And be sure to eat on time.

891
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:06,728
Okay.

892
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,409
I'm not his surgeon anymore,

893
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:10,688
but I'm still his ward physician.

894
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,208
Let me know if there's anything.

895
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:14,968
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

896
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:16,169
Actually,

897
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,569
I wasn't picking your faults...

898
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:20,129
It's all right. I understand.

899
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,089
Talk to my son, will you?

900
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,208
He's about to undergo surgery,

901
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,528
but he's still playing games every day.

902
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:27,688
Mom,

903
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:29,488
I'm just trying to relax.

904
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:30,768
The doctor says

905
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,528
that relaxing will help my tumour.

906
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:33,728
If I don't relax,

907
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,809
I feel like my tumour's going to burst.

908
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:35,849
Okay, okay.

909
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:37,688
Relieving stress in moderation

910
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:38,649
is fine.

911
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,248
But

912
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,288
don't get too agitated or excited.

913
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,208
You understand me, Dr. Ruan.

914
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,248
Which map are you on?

915
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:50,928
The cargo ship?

916
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:53,409
You play this game too?

917
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:55,968
I recently got into it. It's addictive.

918
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,129
What guns do you use?

919
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,049
M4A1. AK47.

920
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,768
I love those too.

921
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:03,129
Give me your phone.

922
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:03,889
Why?

923
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,008
I'll give you two limited-edition
mechanical skins.

924
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:06,889
Hurry up!

925
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:09,288
Put them on,

926
00:39:09,288 --> 00:39:10,488
and you'll look so cool.

927
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:19,288
"Charlie's Angel"?

928
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,649
That used to be my mom's ID name too.

929
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:27,728
Here you go.

930
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:29,288
Thanks.

931
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,169
They've never seen those skins before.

932
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,928
So you're "One Finger Master"?

933
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,688
No wonder you're famous

934
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:38,809
on the forums.

935
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,728
Oh, it's just a name.

936
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:40,968
Come on. Play a round with me.

937
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:41,968
Now?

938
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,008
I can't do it now.

939
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,089
I need to go to the outpatient clinic
in the afternoon.

940
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,488
Just one round.

941
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:46,089
You said

942
00:39:46,089 --> 00:39:47,248
playing games could relieve stress.

943
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:48,248
It'll be good

944
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:49,129
for my tumour.

945
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:50,049
You said it yourself just now.

946
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:55,409
Mom,

947
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:56,409
you said the room
was too stuffy, right?

948
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,089
Maybe you want to go outside?

949
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:58,129
Go on.

950
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:01,728
Well, Dr. Ruan,

951
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,169
I'll let you handle him.

952
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:09,809
Come on. Play a round.

953
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:11,688
Play a round with me.

954
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:12,609
Just one.

955
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:14,409
Okay. Just one.

956
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,288
I need to tend to the patients
in the afternoon.

957
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:17,129
Just one round.

958
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:18,369
You have to go to sleep after this.

959
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,130
Promise me.

960
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,569
Promise.

961
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:21,448
I'll add you.

962
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:22,248
Add me.

963
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:23,768
I'm starting.

964
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:26,329
You're involved

965
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:27,609
in the development of this game.

966
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:28,928
Is it fun for you to play this?

967
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,369
It's because I designed this

968
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,329
that I have to play it.

969
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,849
How else would I know
if there are any bugs?

970
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:34,488
If I don't know what's wrong,
I won't know how to fix it.

971
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,528
You must spend a long time
on this game every day.

972
00:40:36,528 --> 00:40:38,129
Your level is so high.

973
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:39,369
Follow me. Keep up.

974
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:40,688
I'll take you to a place.

975
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:41,688
They'll definitely go there.

976
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:42,369
Slow down.

977
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:43,248
I can't see you anymore.

978
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,049
Listen.

979
00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:46,609
I know this path
like the back of my hand.

980
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:49,169
They call me
the "Middle Lane Bullzoder".

981
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:53,008
Deputy Manager Ning,

982
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,649
I was looking for you.

983
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:55,768
That Dr. Ruan

984
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:57,049
has gone too far!

985
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,688
I told her to stop Xiaoming

986
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,049
from playing games.

987
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:01,609
But not only did she not stop him,

988
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:03,409
they were even playing together!

989
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,609
I told you she wasn't fit

990
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:06,809
to be my son's surgeon.

991
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:08,329
Girls like that

992
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,488
have no sense of proportion at all.

993
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:10,008
I mean she...

994
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:10,688
Let's go and check on them.

995
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:12,089
Is she doing this for revenge?

996
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,340
- Is she doing this...
- Let's go and check on them.

997
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:16,288
Save me!

998
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,768
I'm coming!

999
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:17,649
Don't worry!

1000
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:18,248
You guys turn around

1001
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:19,049
and hide here.

1002
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:19,688
I'm coming.

1003
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:20,288
I'm too scared to move.

1004
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:23,129
Yes!

1005
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:25,129
Perfect teamwork!

1006
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:26,688
Dr. Ruan.

1007
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:27,928
Step outside.

1008
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:33,889
I'll go to sleep right now.

1009
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:35,169
No more games.

1010
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,649
Are you going to be okay, Dr. Ruan?

1011
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:38,528
No more games.

1012
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:39,768
Go on.

1013
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:48,809
What's the matter with you?

1014
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:49,649
His mother complained about you

1015
00:41:49,649 --> 00:41:50,609
to me.

1016
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,169
How do you manage your patients?

1017
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:53,369
Mr. Ning,

1018
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:55,569
I don't think that's fair.

1019
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,728
Specific issues
require specific assessment.

1020
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:00,528
Dr. Ruan.

1021
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:03,688
Come here.

1022
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:05,008
Analyse the situation for me.

1023
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:09,448
Look.

1024
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:11,208
In Ou Xiaoming's case,

1025
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,129
if you confiscate his phone,

1026
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:12,889
he'll just buy another.

1027
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,008
The more you try to stop him,

1028
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:15,288
the more he tries to play those games.

1029
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:17,049
If you don't let him play,

1030
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:17,728
he won't eat

1031
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:18,569
or sleep.

1032
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,208
That'll seriously affect
his preoperative status.

1033
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:21,809
Ou Xiaoming refuses

1034
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,369
to communicate with others.

1035
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,169
As his ward physician,

1036
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,809
this is the only way I can

1037
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,049
reach him

1038
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,208
and gain his trust.

1039
00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:31,409
This way, he'll be more willing

1040
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:32,448
to cooperate with us
for the operation, too,

1041
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:33,248
right?

1042
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,089
Are you sure you won't fight

1043
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:42,968
to be his surgeon?

1044
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,369
Let nature take its course.

1045
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:51,609
Oh, right.

1046
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:54,369
I think Crossfire is a great game

1047
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:55,928
for you.

1048
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,208
You can build finger dexterity

1049
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,928
and train your reflexes.

1050
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:01,129
It's perfect for you.

1051
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,169
You should try it.

1052
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,089
It's just like you.

1053
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:05,169
Plug it in, and you'll be ready
to operate for 24 hours.
