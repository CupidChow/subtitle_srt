If I leave in the future,

00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,940
who's going to take care of Dad?

5
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,900
Silly.

6
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,470
Where would you be going?

7
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,790
My birth mother has come for me.

8
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,750
I'll have to go with her
sooner or later.

What is it?

11
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,540
Do you know

12
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,980
the lady who took me back

13
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,950
to her house that day

14
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,950
is my birth mother?

15
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,700
Do you know

16
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,870
Dad adopted me?

17
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,590
There, there.

18
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,230
We love you very much.

19
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,900
We'll always love you.

20
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,670
Mom, I love you too.

21
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,740
You're still young.

22
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,180
You don't understand
the adult world yet.

23
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,740
I can't explain it

24
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,100
in simple words.

25
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,100
But I want you to know.

26
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,310
No matter what happens in the future,

27
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,390
we will

28
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,870
always love you.

29
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,230
Mom, I understand.

30
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,310
Good boy.

31
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,150
Now, go to bed.

32

Then I'll leave Dad to you.

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,460

you had a fever last night.

86
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,390
I listened to your heartbeat.

87
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,950
It was beating.

88
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,950
Who took care of me?

89
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,660
Mom took care of you.

90
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,180
She even took care of you all night.

91
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,660
Eat up.

92
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,150

your cooking tastes different

96
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,180
from Mom's cooking.

97
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,660
I prefer Mom's cooking.

98
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,420
Mom, your food is delicious!

99
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,070

Why are you so good
at flattering others?

101
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,740
You should learn from him.

102
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,180
That's because you're handsome

103
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,070
and she's beautiful.

104
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,180
What about you?

105

You're handsome?

107
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,420
Since you're handsome,
you should eat more.

108
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,910
Eat more.

109
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,150
Handsome men eat a lot.

110
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,660
Mr. Ning,

111
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,740
are you well enough to work?

112
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,220
I'll be fine.

113
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,420
Eat some more

114
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,420
so you'll grow up.

We should leave now.

Come on.

121

123
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,830

of the Ministry of Education.

176
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,540
This is how children

177
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,030
of ordinary families live.

178
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,740
Your education levels?

179
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,710
High school.

180
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,180
I dropped out.

181
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,070
Junior High School.

182
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,220
With your level of education,

183
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,270
I'm afraid you can't even help

184
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,470
Ning Xiang
with his primary school curriculum.

185
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,590
Mr. Ning.

186
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,620
So far, it looks like

187
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,590
your financial status

188
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,540
and education levels

189
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,660
are far inferior to mine.

190
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,390
Then for what reason

191
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,620
do you want Ning Xiang
to suffer with you?

192
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,350
I've lived with Ning Xiang

193
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,390
for six years.

194
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,710
I don't care
who his biological parents are.

195
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,950
I'm now his father.

196
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,910
As his father,

197
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,180
how could I watch my son live

198
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,070
without a permanent residence

199
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,980
and study

200
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,390
at a school

201
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,470
that's not accredited?

202
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,070
Mr. Ning, please calm down.

203
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,660
He loves the kid very much.

204
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,470
Yes,

205
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,590
you're right.

206
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm indeed inferior

207
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,950
to you in every aspect.

208
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,350
You have social status,

209
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,030
and you're financially stable.

210
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,740
If Ning Xiang lives with me,

211
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,540
he won't live a comfortable life
for sure.

212
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,100
But I can give him

213
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,660
what others can't.

214
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,620
I can give him a mother's love.

215
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,910
Can you?

216
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
I know I can't give him a mother's love.

217
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,420
But how long

218
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
can your maternal love last?

219
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,740
When you abandoned him

220
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,540
in the hospital's corridor,

221
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,150
where did your maternal love go?

222
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,510
Did you lose it?

223
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,470
Yes,

224
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,220
I did it.

225
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,510
That year,

226
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,710
I was 20.

227
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,270
When that guy knew I was pregnant,

228
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,180
he left me.

229
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,620
I planned

230
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,270
to give the child up for adoption

231
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,510
after I gave birth to him.

232
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,590
But the moment he was born,

233
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,620
I regretted it.

234
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,300
His eyes,

235
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,220
his ears,

236
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,710
and his nose

237
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,590
are all mine.

238
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,150
He's a piece of me.

239
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,070
Just like that,

240
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,350
I took care of him for six months.

241
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,300
One day, he was ill.

242
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,180
I took him to the doctor.

243
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,740
The doctor said,

244
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,780
"There's a tumor

245
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,830
in your son's brain."

246
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,860
I had no money to treat him.

247
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,150
If he doesn't get treatment,

248
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,860
he'll die.

249
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,420
So I could only leave him

250
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,780
in the hospital's corridor,

251
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,710
hoping someone could raise him

252
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,980
or save his life.

253
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,780
I had no choice.

254
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,180
For the past six years,

255
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,300
every day had been a living hell.

256
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,420
Why

257
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
must my child suffer so much pain?

258
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,750
If I could,

259
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,420
I would give up my life for him.

260
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,900
If I could,

261
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,590
I want to be a good mother for once.

262
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,420
A good mother?

263
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,180
Dr. Ning,

264
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,830
I beg you.

265
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,780
Please give me a chance.

266
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,300
I'm not going to buy it.

267
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,540
Mr. Ning.

268
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,300
Dr. Ning.

269
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,110
Mr. Ning.

270
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,140
Please.

271
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,180
Can you give me a chance?

272
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,380
Do you know how hard it is

273
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,590
to raise a child?

274
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,180
Can you guarantee you won't neglect him

275
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,780
because you're busy working?

276
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,750
Can you guarantee that his studies

277
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,260
will not be affected
by financial pressure?

278
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,900
Can you guarantee

279
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,230
you won't abandon him again

280
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,750
because of the frustration of life?

281
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,870
Can you do all these?

282
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,260
I can.

283
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,830
In any case, I'm not going to agree

284
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,830
to let that woman take Ning Xiang away.

285
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,380
Liuzheng.

286
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,110
When Zhiqian brought him back,

287
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,780
he was this small.

288
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,660
Now, he's this tall.

289
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,110
To this woman,

290
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,500
it's a blink of an eye.

291
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,300
But to Zhiqian,

292
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,540
it's six years.

293
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,870
He fed him,

294
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,070
taught him to walk,

295
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,380
taught him to speak,

296
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,180
sent him to nursery school
in the morning,

297
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,950
and coaxed him to sleep at night.

298
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,260
He plays the role of a dad and a mom.

299
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,630
At the same time, he worried

300
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,020
that his tumor would relapse.

301
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,070
Do you think it's easy for him

302
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,350
for the past six years?

303
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,420
Mr. Ning, please calm down.

304
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,900
How can he calm down?

305
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,870
His grandpa has been taking care of him

306
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,500
despite many years

307
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,350
of hardship.

308
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,660
Why should we

309
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,780
let her take the kid away?

310
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,630
Please take a seat first.

311
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,630
I have an idea.

312
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,590
Sit down.

313
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,710
How about this?

314
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,110
You can marry

315
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,140
Zhiqian now.

316
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,710
Then Ning Xiang

317
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,540
will have a legal mom.

318
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,750
If the three of you

319
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,710
spend time together every day,

320
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,750
he'll stop thinking

321
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,900
about his biological mom.

322
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,260
Mr. Ning,

323
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,590
what kind of idea is this?

324
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,900
Even if I can pretend to be one,

325
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,630
I'm still not his birth mother.

326
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,110
But...

327
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm not buying it.

328
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,900
Ning Xiang.

329
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,900
Ning Xiang,

330
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,900
I want to ask you something.

331
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,230
Do you want

332
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,070
to go with your birth mother

333
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,780
or

334
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,500
stay here with your dad?

335
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,300
I want to be with my birth mom.

336
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,710
What?

337
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,950
I want to be with my birth mom.

338
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,780
Ning Xiang,

339
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,590
come here.

340
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,260
Tell me.

341
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,660
Do you really want to go with her?

342
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,710
Ning Xiang.

343
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,230
If you really go with her,

344
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,350
what about your dad?

345
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,180
She's my birth mom.

346
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,350
She didn't mean to abandon me.

347
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,870
Come, Ning Xiang.

348
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,900
What if I don't let you go with her?

349
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,870
What if I don't

350
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,470
let you go with her?

351
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,380
Just let me go

352
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,900
with my birth mom.

353
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,110
What birth mother?

354
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,630
Are you sure

355
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,470
she's your birth mother?

356
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,710
Just let me go

357
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,420
with my birth mother.

358
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,180
You're not going anywhere.

359
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,950
Do you hear me?

360
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,900
Just let me go

361
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,230
with my birth mom.

362
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,710
You're not going anywhere!

363
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,070
Stop crying.

364
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm coming in.

365
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,110
Where did he hide?

366
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,950
I found you.

367
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,070
Let me take a look at this little kitty.

368
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,710
I made some noodles.

369
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,110
Do you want some?

370
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,350
Do you want some?

371
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,830
Then can you come out

372
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,830
and talk to me for a bit?

373
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,950
Don't you like me anymore?

374
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,660
I still do.

375
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,230
Come here.

376
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,180
Can you tell me

377
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,140
why you want to go

378
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,540
with your birth mother?

379
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,470
Because she's my mom.

380
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,660
Just for this reason?

381
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,020
Since I was young,

382
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,070
I always wondered
what my mom looked like

383
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,950
and if she had a nice voice.

384
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,350
I also wonder

385
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,750
how she would praise me if I did well.

386
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,710
Then you appeared in my life.

387
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,590
I was so happy.

388
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,630
You may visit me all the time

389
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,420
and be nice to me.

390
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,140
But

391
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,140
I always felt something different

392
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,540
compared to other mothers.

393
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,020
It was until my birth mom came

394
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,420
to the kindergarten to see me.

395
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,350
She never talks to me when she comes.

396
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,590
She would watch me from afar.

397
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,140
She would cry and smile now and then.

398
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,070
I really want

399
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,750
to be with my birth mom.

400
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,590
But if you go with her,

401
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,950
your dad will feel sad.

402
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,630
If I leave,

403
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,260
Dad will still be the same.

404
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,300
But mom will be heartbroken

405
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
without me.

406
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,350
How do you know

407
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,110
if your dad won't be heartbroken?

408
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,500
Because Dad says

409
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,590
a real man

410
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,590
shouldn't weep and sob all day.

411
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,380
He doesn't cry at all.

412
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,540
Why would he feel sad?

413
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,350
Mom,

414
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,950
please talk to Dad

415
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,830
and let me go with my birth mom.

416
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,380
Why don't you come with me?

417
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,350
I'm really thankful

418
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,140
that you've raised Ning Xiang

419
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,470
so well

420
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,660
all this time.

421
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,990
Next time,

422
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,830
just take good care

423
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,900
of Ning Xiang.

424
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,590
I will.

425
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,420
Dr. Ning did question me

426
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,380
at the coffeehouse before.

427
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,990
He wanted me

428
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,540
to give him a definite answer.

429
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,950
No matter what happens,

430
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,230
I'll definitely prioritize Ning Xiang.

431
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,180
My son

432
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,660
is like that.

433
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,780
He has a kind heart.

434
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,180
But

435
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,780
he's harsh with his words.

436
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,110
So don't take it to heart.

437
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,300
I'll make sure

438
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,630
to convey your message to him.

439
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
What time is your bus departing?

440
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,470
After 11.

441
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,780
(The door is open)

442
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,710
Why did you come back?

443
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,630
Dad,

444
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,660
I can't bear to leave you.

445
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,710
Don't cry.

446
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,500
There, there. Stop crying.

447
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,300
That's enough.

448
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,350
Grandpa and your mom are watching you.

449
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,950
Don't make me lose face, okay?

450
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,870
Didn't we talk about this?

451
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,140
That's enough.

452
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,950
Dad, I can't bear to leave you.

453
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,420
I know.

454
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,830
I'll call you, okay?

455
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,070
That's enough.

456
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,140
Okay.

457
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,590
Remember to go for checkups on time.

458
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,830
If anything happens,

459
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,870
call me anytime.

460
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,180
Okay.

461
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,070
All right.

462
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,540
Your mom is waiting.

463
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,870
Dad, I don't want to leave you.

464
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,230
Didn't we agree

465
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,870
that a real man

466
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,950
doesn't weep and sob?

467
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,470
There, there.

468
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,630
We'll come back when we're free,

469
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,780
Come on.

470
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,540
Dr. Ning,

471
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,990
thank you.

472
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,110
Thank you so much.

473
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,420
Let's go.

474
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,870
Watch your head.

475
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,660
(During the operation)

476
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,140
(When you're lying on
the operating table,)

477
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,900
(it's equivalent)

478
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,990
(to putting your life
in the doctor's hands.)

479
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,630
(Do you know that?)

480
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,750
(That's why I want to choose)

481
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,750
(someone I can trust.)

482
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,470
Verify the patient's identity.

483
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,990
The patient's name is Ou Xiaoming.

484
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,420
Male, age 26.

485
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,660
His hospital admission number
is 0308226.

486
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,710
What are his vital signs?

487
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,900
The indicators are normal.

488
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,140
Let's start operating.

489
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,590
Scalpel.

490
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,950
Craniotome.

491
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,070
Hemostatic gauze.

492
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,230
Rongeur.

493
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,540
Gauze.

494
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,870
How are his vital signs doing?

495
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,020
The indicators are normal.

496
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,950
Bipolar.

497
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,350
Detacher.

498
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,630
Tumor retractor.

499
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,590
Prepare the tray.

500
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,430
Prepare to close him up.

501
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,460
Thread.

502
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,700
Forceps.

503
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,070
Dr. Ruan,

504
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,590
victory.

505
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,660
(Beiya Hospital)

506
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,500
When she comes in,

507
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,670
you guys better be smart.

508
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,070
Okay.

509
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,740
Nice.

510
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,700
Well done.

511
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,980
Thank you.

512
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,350
You bought flowers?

513
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,500
I paid for this myself.

514
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,220
Dr. Ruan, congratulations

515
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,780
on your first successful surgery
as the chief surgeon!

516
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,910
Awesome.

517
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,300
You were great.

518
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,740
Ruan Liuzheng,

519
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,110
I may not want to admit it.

520
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,430
But your performance was quite good

521
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,780
just now.

522
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,830
Don't be humble

523
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,940
or arrogant.

524
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,500
Thank you.

525
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,390
Ning,

526
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,150
why aren't you complimenting
your student?

527
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,870
Her skills are almost
as good as mine now.

528
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,150
Hey, I'm talking to you.

529
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,070
Look

530
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,110
at his concentration.

531
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,590
As expected
from the top neurosurgeon here.

532
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,630
Mr. Ning

533
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,980
wants some water.

534
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,350
I'll do it.

535
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,740
So

536
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,670
everyone can leave now.

537
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,020
Don't pour it for him.

538
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,260
Give him hot water

539
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:30,940
and burn him.

540
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,780
I'll get going now.

541
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,220
Okay.

542
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,540
Thanks.

543
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,260
Hello?

544
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,350
Yes, Mr. Ning.

545
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,870
Is something wrong with Ou Xiaoming?

546
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,630
No.

547
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,870
Then...

548
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,220
I know

549
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,460
you were waiting for me to call.

550
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,670
Yes.

551
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,980
I was waiting for your call.

552
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,940
I just want to know

553
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,740
what you think
about the surgery I performed.

554
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,700
There may be some imperfections.

555
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,590
But I want you to tell me

556
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,150
which part I didn't do well.

557
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,540
So I can fix it.

558
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,260
The surgery was perfect.

559
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,670
I can't find any flaws.

560
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,780
Then why didn't you say anything?

561
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,870
I know

562
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,190
you were waiting for me
to compliment you.

563
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
But I won't do it.

564
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,780
I'm not asking for compliments.

565
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,110
I only want you

566
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,630
to comment

567
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,940
if I did well

568
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,980
in the surgery.

569
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,150
Why are you afraid

570
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,070
that you're not good enough?

571
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,350
You mustn't allow yourself

572
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,220
to perform badly.

573
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,670
Every surgery you perform

574
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,940
must be perfect

575
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,830
because every imperfection you do

576
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,780
will affect the patient.

577
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,190
Dr. Ruan,

578
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,540
remember this.

579
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,630
Perfection

580
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,300
is not worthy of compliments

581
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,780
or something to be proud of.

582
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,910
Because perfection

583
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,830
is the basic requirement for a surgeon.

584
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,740
Dr. Ruan?

585
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,430
I'm still here.

586
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
Did you keep quiet

587
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,670
because you thought

588
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,940
I was being too harsh?

589
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,740
Not at all.

590
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,150
Where are you going tonight?

591
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,630
Hey, Liuzheng.

592
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,830
Mr. Xue?

593
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
What are you doing here?

594
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,780
I'll hang up first.

595
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,150
Your dad said

596
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,260
you led surgery today.

597
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,260
It looks like the surgery was a success.

598
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,980
Congratulations
to our young and beautiful Dr. Ruan

599
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,190
for the successful surgery.

600
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,980
Thank you.

601
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,390
This gift is too expensive.

602
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,190
I can't accept this.

603
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,190
Are doctors not allowed

604
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,220
to accept gifts at the hospital?

605
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,910
I'm not your patient.

606
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,540
I think we could at least find a place

607
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,390
to celebrate, right?

608
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,590
Sure, let's go.

609
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,150
This way.

610
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,500
Hello.

611
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,500
Are you Mr. Ning?

612
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,780
You made a reservation
at our restaurant.

613
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,430
So I'm calling to confirm

614
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,500
your reservation for tonight.

615
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,190
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,150
Can you cancel

617
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,190
the reservation for me?

618
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,460
Thank you.

619
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,220
You're so lucky.

620
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,500
This table was originally reserved
in advance.

621
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,780
But they canceled at the last minute.
(Reserved)

622
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:11,740
Have a seat.

623
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,350
Thank you.

624
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,110
Liuzheng,

625
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
the place was fully booked

626
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,500
when I called
to make a reservation this afternoon.

627
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,110
But you insist on coming.

628
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
It looks like you can't stop luck

629
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
from coming.

630
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,020
What would you like to order?

631
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,110
A filet mignon steak, medium rare.

632
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,260
And one

633
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,390
tuna salad.

634
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,870
You always come here?

635
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,780
It's near to the hospital.

636
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,910
I'll have

637
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,780
a sirloin steak, medium rare.

638
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,670
And a potato salad.

639
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,260
How about a bottle of wine?

640
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,430
It's okay.

641
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,700
You'll have to drive later.

642
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,670
No,

643
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,460
we must celebrate today.

644
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,390
Then we'll toast with water instead.

645
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,020
Is that okay?

646
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,350
You sure are looking out for my wallet.

647
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:53,940
Here.

648
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,460
Okay, I'll make it up to you next time.

649
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,700
Okay, please wait for a moment.

650
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,940
What are you thinking about?

651
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,460
I just remembered

652
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,460
I have many precious memories

653
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,670
in this restaurant.

654
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,830
That's great.

655
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,630
In the future, you'll also remember

656
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,540
celebrating your first success

657
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,190
as a chief surgeon with me here.

658
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,110
Here's to you, Dr. Ruan.

659
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,590
Congratulations on your first success
as the chief surgeon.

660
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,540
Thank you.

661
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,540
(The door is open)

662
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,220
How about we try

663
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,740
this barbecued pork bun?

664
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,460
My dad is calling.

665
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,980
Ning Xiang, have you arrived
in Guangzhou yet?

666
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,260
Dad, I've reached Guangzhou.

667
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,670
Why didn't you tell me you had arrived?

668
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,590
What are you doing?

669
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,780
I'm having dinner with Mom.

670
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,110
What are you eating?

671
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,020
Barbecued pork buns.

672
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,740
Barbecued pork buns,

673
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,980
shrimp dumplings,

674
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,870
and rice noodle rolls.

675
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,830
Did you forget

676
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,430
about me because of rice noodle rolls?

677
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,780
Of course, not.

678
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:09,780
Have you called

679
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,700
Mummy Ruan yet?

680
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,540
I'll call her later.

681
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,870
Dad, are you okay?

682
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,700
I've fallen ill from missing you.

683
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,020
If you're not busy,

684
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,070
call Mummy Ruan

685
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
to tell her you've arrived safely.

686
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,190
Okay.

687
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,980
Okay.

688
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,190
Call her now.

689
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,020
I'm hanging up now.

690
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,350
Dad, does your arm still hurt?

691
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,220
It has recovered.

692
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,780
Don't worry about it. Call her now.

693
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,110
Okay.

694
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,870
See you.

695
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,070
Bye.

Mom, I've arrived in Guangzhou.

697
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,220
When I called Dad just now,

698
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,350
he kept coughing.

699
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,700
I'm worried he's sick again.

700
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,540
Can you help me check on him?

701
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,190
Okay.
