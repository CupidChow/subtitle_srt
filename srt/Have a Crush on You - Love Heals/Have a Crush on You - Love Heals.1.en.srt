00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
You need taxi?

00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,080
No, thanks.

6
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,801
Oh, come on. This way.

7
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:00,720
No, no.

Hi.

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,920
Are you Dr. Ruan Liuzheng?

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,081
Yes, I am.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Nice to meet you.

14
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,240

I am Wu Xiaofan.

Are you Dr. Ruan?

19
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,081
Yes, I am.

20
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,040
(Did Jeff pick you up?)

21
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,520
He did.

22
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,800
(Wonderful.)

23
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,481
Take care on your way here.

24
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
See you in the hospital.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,641
See you.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,001
I'm Jeff Ryce.

27
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,361
Welcome to Dahl.

28
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,600
Nice to meet you.

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm Ruan Liuzheng.

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,921
Nice name.

31
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:19,760
You're here to take Engineer Zhao
back to China?

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Yes.

33
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,600
Dahl is different
from other African countries.

34
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,040
The war is still ongoing.

35
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,600
Where is there?

36
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,361
Saint Lake.

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,641
Saint Lake?

38
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,201
It's a very beautiful place.

39
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,001
Yeah.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,201
How long can we get to the hospital?

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,680
About five hours

42
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,441
if there's no accident.

43
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,441
Or they don't shoot at us. We die.

44
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,001
Shoot?

45
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,240
It's frequented by rebels.

46
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,121
Really?

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
My friend, Pis, once ran into them.

48
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,281
But I didn't.

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,121
They never run into me.

50
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Look.

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Don't worry.

52
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,960
We're civilians.

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,080
They won't hurt us.

54
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,041

Mr. Ning.

58
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,640
Can you check this?

59
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,281
Mr. Ning.

60
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:04,881
This one,

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,441
okay?

62
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:05,960
What's the matter?

63
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,480
Jeff went to pick up a doctor

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,601
and they got into trouble.

65
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,640
Jeff got shot.

66
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:10,601
Where?

67
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,561
Around the Saint Lake.

68
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:12,881
Tell Simeone then.

69
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:13,800
Send in the backup.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay.

71
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,960
How many are they?

72
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,601
Jeff and Dr. Ruan?

73
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:18,721
Dr. Ruan?

74
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,480
Male or female?

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,161
Female.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,601
She sounds young.

(Jiangzhou University Medical Faculty,

The central nervous system

80

consists of the brain
and the spinal cord.

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,360
There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,881
and 31 pairs of spinal nerves.

I won't.

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,881
Liuzheng, what are you looking at?

90
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:57,920
What's the matter?

91
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,121
-Ning!
-Ning!

00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,080
Don't run away.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Don't be shy.

95
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,920
Let's go.

96
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,281
Hurry up. The lecture will begin soon.

will take place next week.

100

Have you done your revision?

101
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,360
Ning.

102
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,080
Can you give us a refresher?

103
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,281
Yes.

104
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:30,281
A refresher, please.

105
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,721
I would love to give you one

106
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,761
but do you think

107
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,121
all patients will fall sick

108
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,360
the same way as my examples?

109
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,200
This again.

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,281
(We need to study for five years
to become a doctor.)

111
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,240
(Patients will not fall sick
the same way as textbook examples.)

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,281
(I can deal with that)

113
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,841
(but every single day
of these five years)

114
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,200
(feels like I'm revisiting
my grade 12 days.)

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,001
Exactly.

116
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,240
You forget the five years

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
of post-grad.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,360
Ning.

119
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:53,601
In that case,

120
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,161
when can we find a boyfriend?

121
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,640
All right. Enough squabbling.

122
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,480
Medicine is tough.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,721
I can reassure you

124
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:00,721
that once

125
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,640
you survive this stage,

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,721
it'll only become tougher.

127
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,640
Please look at the blackboard.

128
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,041
(It'll only become tougher.)

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,441
Understood?

130
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,520
That's all for today.

131
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,161
The names I mention here
will have to stay.

132
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,121
The rest are free.

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,841
Li Yi.

134
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Xu Beibei.

Ruan Liuzheng.

136
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,441
Ying Chao.

137
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,881
The four of you stay.

138
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,721
The rest can leave.

139
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:32,841
Let's go.

140
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,400
Li Yi.

141
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,321
You flunked three subjects
last semester.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,601
And you got 48
for your anatomy practical exam.

143
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,561
Ying Chao, Xu Beibei.

144
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,561
I asked you to practice more.

145
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,400
Did you?

146
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,041
When you have the body, you start

147
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:00,761
separating the tissues

148
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,480
and the vessel blindly.

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
Our neural system,

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
vessels,

151
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,561
and muscle texture

152
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,841
are beautiful.

153
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,080
So be careful.

154
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,080
Don't hack away.

155
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,360
Ruan Liuzheng, stop fiddling.

156
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,561
You couldn't even come near the table

157
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,520
and look at the body.

158
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,240
Do you

159
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,321
want to graduate or not?

160
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:20,441
-Yes.
-Yes.

161
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,800
For real?

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,041
-Yes.
-Yes.

163
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:24,480
This Saturday,

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,400
2PM.

165
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,281
Wait for me

166
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,240
in the anatomy room

167
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,240
for private tutoring.

168
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Do you know

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,121
if you can't graduate,

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
it'll affect my pay grade
as a teaching assistant

171
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,321
and my doctorate grant?

172
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,321
Understood?

173
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
I get it now.

174
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,121
Today is April Fool's Day.

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,600
Do I look like I am joking?

176
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
Sorry, Ning.

177
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,401
2PM this Saturday.

178
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,761
Don't be late.

179
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,240
Stand upright.

180
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,600
And salute the body.

181
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,240
Ruan Liuzheng.

182
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:40,360
You'll start first.

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,521
Ruan Liuzheng, you freaked everyone out.

184
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:13,961
Ruan Liuzheng.

185
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,720
Stay right there.

186
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:17,600
What's wrong with you?

187
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,240
You're in your fifth year.

188
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,201
How are you supposed to be a doctor?

189
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
Answer me.

190
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,040
What is the first thing

191
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
a doctor should learn?

192
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:29,561
Answer me.

193
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
How to remain calm.

194
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,040
But you can't

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,920
stay calm whenever you want.

196
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,321
I don't have to be a surgeon.

197
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,121
I don't need to operate.

198
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,401
Don't move.

199
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,520
(Jiangzhou University Medical Faculty)
Ruan Liuzheng, other than a cadaver,

200
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,920
(China, 2012)
what else are you afraid of?

201
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:14,040
Many things.

202
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,641
Name the top three.

203
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,160
Bungee jumping.

204
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,240
And?

205
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,001
Eating fish.

206
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,680
You're afraid of eating fish?

207
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,641
And?

208
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:25,521
Horror movies.

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,280
Okay.

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,360
I'll help you overcome

211
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,441
your fears.

212
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:44,840
Come.

213
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:48,680
You can do this!

214
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,040
Ruan Liuzheng.

215
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,761
What is your mission today?

216
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,881
Overcome my fear.

217
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,121
Yes, overcome your fear.

218
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,001
Come.

219
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:12,920
Hurry.

220
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,641
No.

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,160
What are you doing?

222
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,081
Stand up.

223
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,001
I spent money on this.

224
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:23,321
Come.

225
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,121
Me too.

226
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:24,920
So you guys go ahead.

227
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,121
I can't do this.

228
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,081
Stand up.

229
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,240
Are you boneless?

230
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,641
Go towards the entrance.

231
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,441
Five more meters.

232
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:34,840
Ruan Liuzheng.

233
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:35,720
The fish is here.

234
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:36,600
Enjoy.

235
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,761
The entire fish

236
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,121
on a plate.

237
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,441
With its beady eyes open.

238
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,480
No more eyes now.

239
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:14,240
All right.

240
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,761
Stop yelling.

241
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,441
Guys.

242
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,121
Open your eyes.

243
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,401
Fear is an emotion.

244
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,081
If you don't feel fear,

245
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,401
a horror movie and a comedy

246
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,240
are no different.

247
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,081
Turn to your left slowly.

248
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,160
Walk two steps ahead.

249
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,040
Slowly.

250
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,001
First step.

251
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:36,521
Second step.

252
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,240
And another one.

253
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,121
Lift your head.

254
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,600
Is the sky nice?

255
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,881
It is.

256
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,081
Let's jump together.

257
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,920
Three.

258
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,121
Two.

259
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,160
One.

260
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,840
Your turn now, buddy.

261
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,521
Can I get a refund?

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,961
No.

263
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:20,761
Ruan Liuzheng.

264
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:21,641
You start first.

265
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:25,521
Okay.

266
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,121
Ning.

267
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,881
I have a question for you.

268
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,720
Go ahead.

269
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,201
Why

270
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:39,521
are you helping us?

271
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,201
Because

272
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:46,521
I want this world

273
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,081
to have more competent doctors.

274
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,121
We're in the anatomy room.

275
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,160
Don't bow to me.

276
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,480
Let's begin.

277
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,190
(Dahl, Africa, 2019)

278
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,201
Don't move.

279
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,201
Hands up!

280
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:38,720
Hands up!

281
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,240
No, no!

282
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,201
He's just a driver.

283
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,401
He lost a lot of blood.

284
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,280
Please take him to the hospital.

285
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,480
Take her.

286
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,920
No. No.

287
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,401
Mr. Ning.

288
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
The radio announced this morning

289
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:01,920
that there was

290
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,401
a minor armed conflict
around Saint Lake.

291
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:04,761
I wanted to call them

292
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,200
and tell them to avoid that area.

293
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,360
But when they picked up the phone,

294
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:08,480
Dr. Ruan

295
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,921
told me that they came under fire.

296
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,001
Jeff got shot as well.

297
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,681
When I

298
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,921
pressed Dr. Ruan further,

299
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:14,161
the call got cut off.

300
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,440
Which number did you call?

301
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:16,881
The satellite phone.

302
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,641
In the ambulance?

303
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:18,281
Yes.

304
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,360
I retried several times

305
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,281
but I couldn't reach them.

306
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:22,041
Saint Lake?

307
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,161
Yes, that is the Saint Lake.

308
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,840
You go straight and you turn left.
We're almost there.

309
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:27,521
Okay.

310
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:37,560
Jeff.

311
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:38,281
Jeff.

312
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:38,960
Jeff.

313
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,041
Jeff.

314
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,440
Dr. Ruan?

315
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:42,240
Dr. Ruan?

316
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,161
Jeff.

317
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:45,401
Jeff.

318
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:45,921
Dr. Ruan.

319
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:46,681
Jeff.

320
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,641
Dr. Ruan?

321
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,641
Wu.

322
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:49,161
Dr. Ruan?

323
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:49,600
Wu.

324
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,080
Bring Jeff to the car.

325
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:51,801
Okay.

326
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,681
Let's go.

327
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,121
Ruan Liuzheng!

328
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,360
Abu.

329
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,041
Abu.

330
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,080
Abu.

331
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:24,921
Come over here.

332
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:27,600
Look.

333
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:34,161
Sohzaid? He is the head

334
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35,761
of the largest private

335
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,360
weapon dealers in Dahl.

336
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,240
And he is his man.

337
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,200
Can you help me find him?

338
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,041
Oh, no. Sorry. I can't.

339
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,281
I can't. Sorry.

340
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:46,041
Let's go.

341
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,480
Wu, bring the car back.

342
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:47,921
Okay.

343
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,641
Relax.

344
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:36,240
I want to see Sohzaid.

345
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,360
Who is Sohzaid?

346
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:41,480
Who is he?

347
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,121
I just want to see Sohzaid.

348
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,761
You a doctor also?

349
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,801
Yes.

350
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,200
Where is the doctor?

351
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,281
What doctor?

352
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,560
The Chinese female doctor.

353
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,041
No any men

354
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,960
will risk his life for a woman.

355
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,320
Your relationship must be more
than just simple friends.

356
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,161
She was my wife.

357
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,600
What a surprise.

358
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,840
Bring her.

359
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:03,080
Is she the one you're looking for?

360
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,960
Yes.

361
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,600
(Jiangzhou University Medical Faculty,
China, 2012)

362
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,641
Pass it to me.

363
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:17,121
Here.

364
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:18,360
Airball.

365
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:20,560
Over here.

366
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,200
You only

367
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
took pictures of Ning.

368
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,560
Does Ning have a girlfriend?

369
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:31,320
I don't know.

370
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,320
No, I guess?

371
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:33,281
I have never seen her, at least.

372
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:34,041
Pass it to me.

373
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,080
Have you ever wondered

374
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,121
what type of girls he likes?

375
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,281
Someone like Liuzheng.

376
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,240
Of course.

377
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,001
Shut up.

378
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,281
Liuzheng likes Ning?

379
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Yes.

380
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,600
Go and confess to him

381
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,041
already.

382
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,921
Stop it.

383
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,121
Train harder.

384
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:53,240
Let's take a break.

385
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,921
Go.

386
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,801
Let's go.

387
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,681
You've been here for a long time.

388
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,761
Looking for me?

389
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:04,881
Have some water.

390
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,480
No need. I already have some.

391
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
I bought it for you.

392
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,161
All right.

393
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,281
What's the matter?

394
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,041
Well...

395
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,360
The tutor group wants

396
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,761
to buy you a meal.

397
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,001
When are you free?

398
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,560
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

399
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Just come.

400
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Everyone wants to do it.

401
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:23,480
All right.

402
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,761
When and where?

403
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,001
What do you like to eat?

404
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,200
I don't mind anything.

405
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,840
What is your favorite then?

406
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:33,921
You know what?

407
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:35,121
Let's go somewhere nearby.

408
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:36,521
The hotpot place by our south gate.

409
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:37,360
Tomorrow night.

410
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,720
Sure.

411
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:39,960
What time?

412
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:41,840
5:30PM.

413
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,921
I'd hate to make you
miss your evening revision.

414
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,560
Thanks, Ning.

415
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,161
See you tomorrow.

416
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:48,121
Bye.

417
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,720
Bye.

418
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,401
So?

419
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
Come.

420
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
Japanese cockle.

421
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,041
Scallop.

422
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:56,401
Oyster.

423
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:57,801
One portion each?

424
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:58,960
Prawn paste too, please.

425
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay.

426
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,161
It's time.

427
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:01,801
Why isn't he here?

428
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,041
Let's wait for a while.

429
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,840
He has treated us many times.

430
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,681
Let's pay

431
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,001
the bill first.

432
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:09,761
No worries.

433
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:10,521
I'll handle it.

434
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,240
Is my hair messy?

435
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,320
No.

436
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:16,401
Why did you change your hairstyle today?

437
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,080
Ning.

438
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,681
Ning.

439
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:24,281
Sit down.

440
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:25,480
Don't be courteous.

441
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,360
I ordered the seafood

442
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,960
soup base for you.

443
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,560
Thanks.

444
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,200
You can serve now.

445
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
Everyone is here.

446
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:32,801
What else do you want?

447
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,801
Order it.

448
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:35,681
Have you guys ordered?

449
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

450
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,881
Ruan Liuzheng,

451
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:41,960
you look odd today.

452
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,001
You changed your hairstyle.

453
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,041
You put on lipstick too.

454
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,921
You dressed up.

455
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,121
I'm thirsty.

456
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,801
Come.

457
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:54,440
Thanks.

458
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:55,200
Have some water.

459
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,921
Hello?

460
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,480
You're here?

461
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,001
Add a seat.

462
00:23:59,001 --> 00:23:59,801
Okay.

463
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,801
I'll meet you right now.

464
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:02,761
Okay.

465
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,761
Miss.

466
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:06,641
Can you

467
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:07,681
give us an extra set of cutlery?

468
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,121
And another pot too.

469
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:14,641
Ning.

470
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
This is...

471
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:32,921
Allow me to present.

472
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,200
Dong Miaomiao, your senior.

473
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,161
She's an art major
from the Faculty of Arts.

474
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,240
These are my juniors.

475
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,080
Let me introduce.

476
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,840
Ruan Liuzheng.

477
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,801
Hi.

478
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:42,281
Xu Beibei.

479
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:42,801
Hi.

480
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:43,560
Hi.

481
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:43,921
Li Yi.

482
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,560
Hi.

483
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,001
Ying Chao.

484
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
-Hi, everyone.
-Hello.

485
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,641
Sorry, it was quite congested.

486
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:49,240
That's why I'm late.

487
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,401
It's okay. The food just came.

488
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,761
We haven't even started yet.

489
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:54,401
Great.

490
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:55,401
Ning.

491
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:56,041
You

492
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,480
never mentioned Dong to us.

493
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:58,560
Tell me about it.

494
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
She just came back.

495
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:00,801
I haven't seen her in ages as well.

496
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:01,600
If we don't meet up now,

497
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,440
we'll forget each other.

498
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,560
I was studying for my Master's degree
in France.

499
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,360
I just came back.

500
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:09,960
Let's say a toast

501
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,440
to the returnee.

502
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:12,720
Come.

503
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,761
What toast?
She doesn't even have a drink.

504
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:15,960
Use mine.

505
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,281
Pour him a drink now.

506
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,240
My bad.

507
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,921
Thanks. Let's do this together.

508
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,840
-Come.
-Come.

509
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,401
-Thanks.
-Ning.

510
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,041
Come, Dong.

511
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,801
Dong.

512
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,440
(Dahl, Africa, 2019)

513
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:52,360
Dahl

514
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,200
is definitely an underdeveloped
country in Africa.

515
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:57,200
That's why we're here.

516
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,121
Sohzaid just wanted us
to treat his men's wounds.

517
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,801
Fortunately, we are doctors.

518
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,761
That was so close.

519
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,161
Oh.

520
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:37,521
What happened to the driver
who got shot?

521
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,041
I asked someone to send him back.

522
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:52,600
Do you have another water bottle?

523
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,080
Thanks.

524
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,921
Liuzheng.

525
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,921
You didn't eat a lot.

526
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,000
(Jiangzhou, China, 2019)
You keep drinking.

527
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,080
Let's say a goodbye toast.

528
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,600
Okay.

529
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,641
Well...

530
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,801
She is still suffering from jet lag.

531
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:25,801
We have to go now.

532
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,161
Sorry.

533
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:28,161
Come.

534
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:28,681
Come.

535
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,960
Thanks.

536
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,401
Don't stay up too late.

537
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,641
Will do.

538
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,720
Let's go.

539
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:38,560
See you.

540
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,080
Bye.

541
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,881
Bye.

542
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,121
Bye.

543
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:41,600
Don't let it go to waste.

544
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:44,521
Safe trip, Ning.

545
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I envy him.

546
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,521
Me too.

547
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,240
Your place or my place?

548
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,761
I should go back on my own.

549
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:01,681
No need to send me back.

550
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,041
Why the sudden distance

551
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,921
even though we haven't met for a while?

552
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:06,521
What?

553
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,521
You're just too sensitive perhaps.

554
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,521
Let's go.

555
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:10,681
I'll send you back.

556
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,401
Finish it. Then, we'll head back.

557
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,260
(Better when made on the spot)

558
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:39,560
Come join me.

559
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,840
Morning, Ning.

560
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,560
Morning.

561
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:08,320
Morning, Ning.

562
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:08,960
Morning.

563
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:12,720
Morning, Ning.

564
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Morning.

565
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:17,080
Ruan Liuzheng.

566
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,920
(Dahl Chinese Hospital, Africa, 2019)

567
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,020
(WEN YI, To Cure Sometimes,
To Relieve Often, To Comfort Always)

568
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,401
That's my mother.

569
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,161
Mr. Ning.

570
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,681
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)
Finally, you're back.

571
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,161
Did something happen to you?

572
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,240
Nothing.

573
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,720
Dr. Ruan, are you injured?

574
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,960
I'm fine.

575
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
What a relief.

576
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,600
This is Wu.

577
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:33,840
Hi, I'm Wu Xiaofan.

578
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,080
I called you just now.

579
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,360
Hi, Dr. Wu.

580
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,001
Any update about the injured driver?

581
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:39,801
His vital signs

582
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,041
are stable.

583
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,001
Nothing serious.

584
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,600
I meet with Mr. Zhao later.

585
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,761
He's in the ward.

586
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:47,080
You should get changed.

587
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,521
You're going to scare
Mr. Zhao like this.

588
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,200
Oh, Mr. Ning.

589
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,641
We only have one vacant dorm room

590
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,320
and it's occupied by Mr. Zhao's family.

591
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,761
Where should Dr. Ruan stay?

592
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,720
She can live with me for the moment.

593
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:57,681
I have a lot of space.

594
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:58,641
Find me a mattress.

595
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:58,881
Okay.

596
00:30:58,881 --> 00:30:59,600
Where is her luggage?

597
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:00,281
In the car.

598
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:00,921
Bring it over.

599
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:01,440
Okay.

600
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:01,921
Dr. Ruan.

601
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,881
This way.

602
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:03,921
Let me show you the place.

603
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,281
Hey, Dr. Ning.

604
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:11,840
Hi.

605
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,681
The toiletry is over there.

606
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,080
The shower is on the roof.

607
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:25,240
If you need something else,

608
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
just give me a call.

609
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,681
I don't have your number.

610
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,881
My number's still

611
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:30,600
the same.

612
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:34,600
Why?

613
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,121
You deleted my number already?

614
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,001
When?

615
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,480
The day we got the divorce.

616
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,080
So what's your number then?

617
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,281
Jog your memory then.

618
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,360
Remember to add +86.

619
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:38,881
Hello?

620
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
It's me.

621
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,121
You have a good memory.

622
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,360
You recalled my number.

623
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,440
The water got cut off
when I was showering.

624
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,281
What do I do?

625
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,641
It happens all the time.

626
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,480
Put on some clothes.

627
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't worry.

628
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,121
I'll come to you.

629
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,360
Hurry up.

630
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,440
Do they often have water
or power outages here?

631
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,080
Yes.

632
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,720
Sometimes, it lasts for one to two days.

633
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,121
Sometimes, it lasts
for one to two months.

634
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,121
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)
Where are you bringing me?

635
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,520
A place where you can shower

636
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,721
without electricity.

637
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,121
Hop on.

638
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:46,360
This is the place

639
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,201
where I can shower without electricity?

640
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,000
Yes.

641
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:50,481
I shower here
when there's no electricity.

642
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,921
By the way,

643
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,000
when you shower,

644
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,961
don't go too deep.

645
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,921
There are lake weeds

646
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,161
and you don't want to be caught by them.

647
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,760
Don't tell me
there are crocodiles in there.

648
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,641
Crocodiles?

649
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:02,241
Find out yourself.

650
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:05,881
Look away.

651
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:09,401
Where are you going?

652
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,921
You told me to look away.

653
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,721
Carry this for me.

654
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:24,800
Anything else?

655
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:25,760
Nothing.

656
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,681
Is it cold?

657
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,040
A bit.

658
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:32,560
Hurry up and wash yourself.

659
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,080
Let's keep talking.

660
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:35,840
Otherwise, I wouldn't notice

661
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,481
if you were devoured by crocodiles.

662
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,481
What do you want to talk about?

663
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:39,360
Anything.

664
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,441
Thank you for saving me.

665
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:44,961
No need to thank me.

666
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,481
I'll save anyone.

667
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,441
Otherwise, I'll have to deal
with the consequences.

668
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,040
How long have you been in Africa?

669
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:52,401
Two years.

670
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:54,080
I applied

671
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,641
for multiple short-term missions.

672
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,760
Four missions in five years.

673
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,721
And I stay for six months each time.

674
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:59,721
Because of your mother?

675
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,280
Yes.

676
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,121
Because my mom is here.

677
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,241
What about you?

678
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,441
How have you been?

679
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,681
I went to Xinzhou for my Master degree.

680
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,961
Xinzhou?

681
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,881
Why not Jiangzhou?

682
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,840
Was it to avoid me?

683
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,161
Of course, not.

684
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,921
Why should I avoid you?

685
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,280
Where do you work now?

686
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,080
West District Hospital.

687
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,721
West District Hospital?

688
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,520
I'm close to your President Wang.

689
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Which department are you in?

690
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:35,481
Neurosurgery.

691
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,641
Neurosurgery?

692
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:39,121
We're colleagues then.

693
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Why did you pick neurosurgery?

694
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:43,481
Why can't I?

695
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,121
You have changed.

696
00:36:47,241 --> 00:36:48,560
You're rude now.

697
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
Back then,
you wouldn't even touch a frog.

698
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,000
Now, you break open people's skulls.

699
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:53,961
It's been six years.

700
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,320
We all change.

701
00:36:57,201 --> 00:36:58,401
You have changed too.

702
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:02,080
Did I change

703
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
for the better or the worse?

704
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,681
Tell me.

705
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:15,360
Liuzheng!

706
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,961
What's wrong with you?

707
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,080
Are you all right?

708
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,681
I was washing my hair.

709
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,881
You looked like you were drowning.

710
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,721
The water is cold.

711
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,681
Are you done?

712
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Yes.

713
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,760
Get out of the water then.

714
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:53,280
Go.

715
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,520
You go.

716
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,600
What's the matter?

717
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:57,881
My shoes.

718
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:58,241
Wait.

719
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,000
Aren't you a regular here?

720
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Who showers with their shoes on?

721
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,280
It's cold.

722
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,921
Take the basket for me.

723
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:43,721
Dr. Ning.

724
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,401
Here you go.

725
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:45,481
Thank you.

726
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,800
Put those in the cupboard.

727
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:28,481
You sure you can sleep here?

728
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:30,080
There are a lot of mosquitoes.

729
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,201
Is something wrong?

730
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,520
If you don't like it,

731
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,280
I can sleep at Wu's place.

732
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:36,840
No.

733
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,721
I'll just sleep here tonight.

734
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,881
What did you say?

735
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,681
I said I'll sleep here tonight.

736
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,040
Where? Outside?

737
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
Don't be ridiculous.

738
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,681
I'll sleep here.

739
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll sleep here.

740
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:51,481
No, I'll sleep here.

741
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:54,161
Do you like this spot that much?

742
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,241
Is it because
you want to sleep here with me?

743
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,201
You can take this bed then.

744
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:22,360
Remember to close the mosquito net.

745
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:23,641
The mosquitoes in Dahl are bloodthirsty.

746
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:24,921
They'll eat you alive.

747
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't forget to blow out the candle.

750
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:44,921
Let's take a break.

751
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:46,360
Come back at 1:30PM.

752
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,721
Let's go.

753
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:57,121
Bye, Ning.

754
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,280
Ruan Liuzheng.

755
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
You're not going to eat?

756
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,161
I'm eating this.

757
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,520
Regarding your thesis topic,

758
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:05,520
are you done?

759
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,600
Show it to me.

760
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,441
Here.

761
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:27,760
Zhiqian, I bought some fruits.

762
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:28,681
You're here.

763
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,000
Liuzheng is here too.

764
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,921
Hi, Dong.

765
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:32,840
Want some grapes?

766
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,921
No, thanks.

767
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,401
I'll have some, thank you.

768
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:38,201
Have you washed them?

769
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,040
I'll go and wash them now.

770
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,360
