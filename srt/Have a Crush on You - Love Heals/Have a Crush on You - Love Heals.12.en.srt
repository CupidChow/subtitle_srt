=Episode 12=

3
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,960
Dad.

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,920
You overslept.

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,280
I overslept.

6
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
Why aren't you wearing your clothes?

7
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,850
Wake up. It's time for you to work.

8
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,770
Hurry up.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,770
What time is it?

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,400
It's almost 7 A.M.

11
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,400
7 A.M.

12
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,480
It's time for school too.

13
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,890
Get up now.

14
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,280
I can't get up. What do I do?

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,840
You overslept.

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,410
Wake up and go to work now.

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,170
I'm up.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,090
Why aren't you wearing your clothes?

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

20
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,990
(Milk)

21
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Ning Xiang. Hurry up.

22
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm coming.

23
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Dr. Ruan.

24
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
Mr. Xue.

25
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,160
Let me send you to work.

26
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,880
I'm good. The subway station
is right in front.

27
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,630
I can take the subway.

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
I need you to sign
the power of attorney.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,720
Get in the car.

30
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
It's on my way anyway.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,670
Sure.

32
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,470
Is Ruan Lang your younger brother?

33
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,110
My biological brother.

34
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,390
That's good.

35
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I always wanted an elder sister
when I was a kid.

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,230
By the way, when I was taking
the college entrance exam,

37
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,320
I almost applied for medical school.

38
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,640
Why didn't you do it?

39
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,760
Medicine is a tough subject.

40
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,790
Five years of undergraduate study
and five years of postgraduate studies.

41
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,760
You'll only start your career
when you hit your 30s.

42
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,390
Things are different for lawyers.

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,790
If we have an early head start,

44
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,880
we'll already be very experienced
by the time we turn 30.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's why

46
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,270
I think one needs a lot of passion
to study medicine,

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,270
especially for female doctors like you.

48
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,720
Take craniotomy for example.

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm a man and I get scared
just by hearing the procedure.

50
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,760
And you're a lady.

51
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,110
You have my utmost respect.

52
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,830
I'm flattered.

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,830
I'm really flattered.

54
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,200
It's no less impressive
being a lawyer too.

55
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

56
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,670
Give me a minute, Dr. Ruan.

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,670
I wish you a good day ahead.

58
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,510
I planted them myself.

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,600
You planted them yourself?

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,480
Really?

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm a part-time gardener.

62
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you.

63
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
I'll get going.

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,160
I'll pick you up later in the evening.

65
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,550
I'm good. Thanks.

66
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,670
It's on my way.

67
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,790
Xiaoyu, how are you feeling?

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,830
I asked my mom
to make chicken soup for you.

69
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,670
Give it a taste.

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,950
Dr. Ruan.

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
I don't think I can drink it.

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,070
I know that chemotherapy
makes you very sick.

73
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,640
But if you keep refusing food,

74
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
your body will get weaker later.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Here.

76
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,040
How are you feeling?

77
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,040
Eat the drumstick too.

79
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,320
Finish it.

80
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,040
I'll go ahead and do my ward rounds.

81
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,350
Dr. Ruan.

82
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,760
You're a doctor,
not the patient's family.

83
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,000
Why do you always make chicken soup
for the patient?

84
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,230
If you enjoy cooking that much,

85
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,000
you should make chicken soup
for all patients on that floor.

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,510
Du Xiaoyu has no family
to look after him.

87
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,320
He's experiencing severe side effects
from the chemotherapy.

88
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,390
You don't have to show your concern,

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,160
but you shouldn't stop others
from taking care of him.

90
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,830
You're so cold-blooded.

91
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,950
You only need to tell him

92
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,670
that his readings are off the scale
and he can't undergo the operation.

93
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,320
He'll figure out how
to digest the information on his own.

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,270
Have you decided on
his follow-up treatment?

95
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,200
We'll see how he reacts
to the first cycle of chemotherapy.

96
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,480
If he reacts well to it, we'll continue
with the chemotherapy.

97
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,550
If he doesn't react well,
we'll proceed with the surgery.

98
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
Can the surgery cure him?

99
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,270
Why are you asking me so many questions?

100
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,230
Are you my superior?

101
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
You've been here on secondment
for a few months.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,390
Have you not learned anything?

103
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,880
I know how difficult the surgery is.

104
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,920
That's why I want to know

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,350
how much confidence you have.

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
Dr. Ruan. You're a doctor yourself.

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,880
Why are you asking questions

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,480
like you are the patient's family?

109
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm not confident at all.

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
It's a very difficult surgery,

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,510
and no one has the confidence to do it.

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,470
You...

113
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,590
I've been looking for you.

114
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,960
Why are you here?

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you acting like a guerrilla?

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,030
You just showed up out of nowhere.

117
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,880
Are you crying?

118
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,670
I'm not.

119
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,400
You gave me a fright.

120
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,640
Tell you what.

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
You can't use a smile

122
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,030
to hide the tears in your eyes.

123
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,150
I'm fine.

124
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,790
Tell me what happened.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,640
I...

126
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,280
This one too.

127
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,550
You can order two more.

128
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,790
I think that's enough.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
That's all.

130
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,910
What's the matter?

131
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,400
I suspect Jiang Cheng is cheating on me.

132
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,590
Are you kidding?

133
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,030
He gave me a call today,

134
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,880
saying that his company is sending him
on a business trip

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
and he'll be away for a few days.

136
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Guess what happened next.

137
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,030
Right after he hung up on me,

138
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,670
I received a call from his superior.

139
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,150
He asked for my help
to register him as a patient.

140
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,280
Then, I asked him
about the business trip.

141
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,910
And he told me

142
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,880
that there was no business trip at all.

143
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,350
What will you do
if he really cheats on you?

144
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,880
I have no idea.

145
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,280
My brain is a mess right now.

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,760
Will you file a divorce?

147
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,790
I'm not as good at letting go
as you are.

148
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,910
I won't be able
to divorce him just like that.

149
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,470
Let's eat first.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,880
It's not as simple as you think.

151
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
What will happen to our kid

152
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,470
if we get a divorce?

153
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,080
What about the house?

154
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,150
There are many other issues

155
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,400
and none of them are easy to handle.

156
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,790
Do you still love him?

157
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,520
Love?

158
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,080
What is love?

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,790
Do you still love Ning Zhiqian?

160
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,710
Why are you asking me instead?

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,670
I just realized

162
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,640
that love

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,670
is but an illusion.

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Love is persistent.

165
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,790
Our love for our children

166
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,200
and our parents

167
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
is persistent.

168
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,440
But we will rarely love a man

169
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,670
or a woman the same way.

170
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,470
A romantic relationship
is the most versatile

171
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,590
and the least lasting form of love.

172
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,670
You fell head over heels for the person
in the beginning,

173
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,030
but you will also part ways
without saying a word.

174
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,200
When we were younger,

175
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,550
we mistook the butterflies
in our stomachs as true love.

176
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,440
If I were given another chance,

177
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,880
I would never have gotten married
at such a young age.

178
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,670
Excuse me.

179
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,760
Can we have a carton of beer?

180
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Give me a minute.

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,280
Stop drinking.

182
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,640
Here.

183
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,640
Let's drink.

184
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,440
Dad.

185
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,150
Dad.

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,960
Dad.

187
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,640
Are you starving?

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,110
- Look at you.
- Hey.

189
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,590
Mom.

190
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,030
(Why are you crying?)

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,080
I woke up to use the bathroom,

192
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,840
and I realized Dad is gone.

193
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,230
I'm home alone.

194
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm really scared now.

195
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,520
Where did he go?

196
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,880
Let me... Let me give your dad a call.

197
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,440
I tried calling him,

198
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
but he didn't pick up the call.

199
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,590
Mom, can you come over?

200
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,670
Give me a minute.

201
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,710
Hey. Where are you?

202
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm at Ningxia Street. It's just nearby.

203
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Come here immediately.

204
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,470
Hurry up.

205
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,000
I wish you well.

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,150
What's the matter?

207
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,880
- Why is she drunk?
- Lang.

208
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,590
Help me send Tan Ya home.

209
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,670
Where are you going?

210
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,230
Ning Zhiqian went out
in the middle of the night

211
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,350
and left his son alone at home.

212
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,110
I'll go and check on him.

213
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,110
That's my mic.

214
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,760
Give it to me.

215
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,760
- Be careful.
- Wait.

216
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,200
We...

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,590
Slowly.

218
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,670
Let's get a taxi.

219
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,550
- Where is she going with my mic?
- Don't worry.

220
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,030
There's one in the car.

221
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,280
I want to sing.

222
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,710
Who's there?

223
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,080
Who's there?

224
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,200
It's me.

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,470
Mom, I'm coming.

226
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,790
What's the matter?

227
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,710
Where did your dad go?

228
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,350
I have no idea either.

229
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,000
I had a nightmare.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,350
In my dream, Dad went missing.

231
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,590
So I woke up immediately to find Dad.

232
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,150
Let's go.

233
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,350
Let's get you to bed.

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,110
Why are you here?

235
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,200
You should sleep on your bed.

236
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,150
This is my hideout.

237
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,520
I want to sleep here.

238
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,590
Join me.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,760
It's too small.
It won't be able to fit me.

240
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,150
Try it.

241
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,320
All right.

242
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,550
It's too cramped.

243
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,150
(Beiya Hospital)

244
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,110
Isn't it a safe and comfortable place?

245
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,440
I love this place a lot.

246
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,470
Do you like it?

247
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,030
I do.

248
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,550
Mom.

249
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,150
Shall we sing
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" together?

250
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,320
Sure.

251
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,400
♪Twinkle twinkle little star♪

252
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,880
♪How I wonder what you are♪

253
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,470
(Door's open.)

254
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,510
(The Little Prince Lives Here.
Please Knock.)

255
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,470
Ning Xiang.

256
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,640
Where did you go? It's late now.

257
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,800
There was an emergency
with the patient in Bed No. 8.

258
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,070
Why didn't you ask me along?

259
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,070
I'm glad I didn't ask you along.

260
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,040
You can come out now.

261
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,190
Since you're home, I'll get going.

262
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,110
It's almost dawn.
Don't trouble yourself.

263
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,560
Just sleep on the bed.

264
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,760
I can take a rest on the sofa.

265
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
What are you reading?

266
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,710
You're so hardworking.

267
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
It's Du Xiaoyu's profile.

268
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,040
If you care about him so much,

269
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,280
why don't you be nice to him?

270
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,920
I only care about his condition,

271
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,000
not him as a person.

272
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,160
Although his case is rather challenging,

273
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,310
as his attending doctor,

274
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,800
it's also a rare opportunity
for me to challenge myself.

275
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to publish

276
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,040
SCI soon, right?

277
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,470
The topic happens
to be brainstem surgeries.

278
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,880
Are you treating the patient

279
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
like how you fix a robot?

280
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,070
Grease it if it's too old.

281
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,350
Replace the parts if they're broken.

282
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
I won't explain myself

283
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,520
if that's how you take it.

284
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,680
I think you are a robot.

285
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,680
A robot that repairs other robots.

286
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,000
I agree with what you said.

287
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,800
Dad.

288
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,950
You're up.

289
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,950
Mom.

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,070
You're both here.

291
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,760
Dad.

292
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,520
Where did you go yesterday?

293
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,830
I couldn't find you.

294
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,830
I had to work overtime.

295
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,350
Mom.

296
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,430
Isn't it cozy

297
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,680
in my hideout?

298
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,000
It is.

299
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,590
Go and wash up now.

300
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,920
You haven't brushed your teeth

301
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,310
and you're already exchanging kisses.
It's not hygienic.

302
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Hurry up.

303
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,000
Mr. Ning. Breakfast is ready.

304
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,920
Actually,

305
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,280
you only had to send me home
last night.

306
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,310
You didn't have to stay until morning
and help me send my kid to school.

307
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,350
I couldn't do that.

308
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,800
Zhiqian told me

309
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,350
that when one's drunk,

310
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,310
they might accidentally
inhale the vomit,

311
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,400
and choke on it.

312
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,430
Once my sister was drunk,

313
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,310
Zhiqian stayed in the hotel
to look after her overnight.

314
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,590
I've heard about it.

315
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,710
Were you worried
that I might choke to death?

316
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,880
I didn't know you were so considerate.

317
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Your sister told me
that you were unreliable.

318
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,590
Who says I'm unreliable?

319
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,760
Don't listen to her.

320
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,280
Did she tell you
what happened to the car?

321
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,280
You know how my sister is.

322
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,230
She rarely spends on herself,

323
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,430
but she's very generous
when she's with others.

324
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,920
I simply took advantage of this

325
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,640
and gave her a gentle push,

326
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,190
so that she would buy
something for herself.

327
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,000
She has to pay a few thousand

328
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,920
for her car loan every month now.

329
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,430
Do you think you're being helpful?

330
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,350
When I get paid for my next film,

331
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,520
I'll share the car loan with her.

332
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,110
You better keep your word.

333
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,350
(Beiya Hospital)
Dr. Ji.

334
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
What do you think about this case?

335
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,160
How old is the patient?

336
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,350
If he's old...

337
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,710
Du Xiaoyu is a young man.

338
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,680
He's only 25 years old.

339
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,760
He's very young.

340
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,190
Logically speaking,
we should give it a try.

341
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,070
Although we didn't run a biopsy test,

342
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,430
based on my experience,

343
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,110
this is almost a stage-four tumor.

344
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
It not only has
a rich blood supply,

345
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,400
but also has a high degree of
infiltration on the surrounding cells.

346
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,070
Not to mention that
the tumor is found on the brainstem.

347
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,920
How can we remove this tumor?

348
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,190
Dr. Zhao.

349
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
This is a tough case.

350
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,520
Without a surgery,
the treatment won't be easy,

351
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,400
but it'll be even tougher
with the surgery.

352
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,760
It's too risky.

353
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,160
Mom.

354
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,350
Liuzheng.

355
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Dad and Mom are out.

356
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,190
Stop looking for them.

357
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,640
Stop right there.

358
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
What are you holding?

359
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,110
It's nothing.

360
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,190
It's really nothing.

361
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,070
You're a big boy now.
You know how to be nice to me now.

362
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,110
Let me take a look at it.

363
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,640
Give it to me.

364
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
It's not for you.

365
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,680
Who is this for?

366
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,920
Your girlfriend?

367
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,760
I don't have a girlfriend.

368
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,760
Then, who is this for?

369
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
Tan Ya.

370
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Wait.

371
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
Have you not changed your mind yet?

372
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,800
Do you still have feelings for Tan Ya?

373
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,520
What are you talking about?

374
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,040
I know exactly what's on your mind.

375
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,590
When you were a teenager,

376
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,190
you hid her photo under your pillow.

377
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,070
I saw it.

378
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,070
You violated my privacy, Ruan Liuzheng.

379
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,470
That's outrageous.

380
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,520
Violation?

381
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,110
I just took a look at it.

382
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,880
I'll tell Mom what you did.

383
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,350
Nothing happened when you were
at Tan Ya's place yesterday, right?

384
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,830
Nothing.

385
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,830
What could I do to her?

386
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm your brother.

387
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,830
Don't you know what I'm like?

388
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,040
I only doubted you

389
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
because I know you too well.

390
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,070
Thank you for your trust.

391
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,430
Why did you spend the night
at her place?

392
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,920
You were the one who told me
to look after her.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Her daughter was at home too.

394
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,800
She was drunk.

395
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,710
What would I do
if anything happened to them?

396
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Then, did you do anything...

397
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,760
Nothing. I did nothing to her.

398
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,070
I was a teenager.

399
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,590
You were Jay Chou's fan
when you were a teenager.

400
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,470
Did you marry him?

401
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,880
Then, why did you buy
these skincare products for her?

402
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
They look expensive.

403
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,560
I saw her without makeup this morning.

404
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,640
Her skin looked a little dull

405
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,680
and she had rather huge pores.

406
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,640
I noticed some wrinkles on her face too.

407
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,640
All women are afraid of aging.

408
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,950
We don't know if they will work.

409
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,230
Let me try it out.

410
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,560
They aren't for you.

411
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,830
Why can't you get it?

412
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,070
What's the matter?

413
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,950
(Outpatient)

414
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,070
Come in.

415
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,110
(Please keep quiet)
Dr. Ning.

416
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,950
(Please keep quiet)
Du Xiaoyu is here.

417
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,590
Come on in.

418
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,520
You've completed your first cycle
of chemotherapy.

419
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,040
Look. The tumor has reduced in size

420
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,230
after the chemotherapy.

421
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,590
This is before the chemotherapy,

422
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,950
and this is after the chemotherapy.

423
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,800
So what do we do next?

424
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,830
Now, we have three options.

425
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,520
The first one is to continue
with the chemotherapy.

426
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,280
But I think it will no longer help

427
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,430
in reducing the size of your tumor.

428
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
The second one is palliative care.

429
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,230
And the third one is surgery.

430
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,950
Starting palliative care means
I'll be waiting for my last day to come?

431
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,070
Don't be so negative.

432
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,710
How much time do I have left?

433
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,760
You have at least three months left.

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
What about the surgery?

435
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,230
The surgery carries a very high risk.

436
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,040
Since the tumor is found
in your brainstem,

437
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,590
the brainstem helps regulate

438
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,160
your breathing and heart rhythms.

439
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,280
If anything happens
during the operation,

440
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,000
you might not be able
to leave the operation theater at all.

441
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,520
I'll go with the surgery.

442
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,560
Xiaoyu.

443
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,710
You still have time to think about it.

444
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,950
You should ponder on it thoroughly.

445
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,680
I've thought it through.

446
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,470
I'll go with the surgery.

447
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,760
Time to get off work.

448
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,710
Time to get off work.

449
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,760
Who's working the night shift today?

450
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,640
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

451
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,760
Me.

452
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,000
Dr. Ruan?

453
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,560
Thank you so much.

454
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,280
Thank you.

455
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,640
Dr. Ruan, I hope you'll be blessed
by God of the night shift.

456
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,430
Thank you.

457
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,040
Aren't you leaving yet, Ning?

458
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,800
You'll be blessed
by God of the night shift.

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,590
Mr. Ning.

460
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,520
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

461
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,590
Same to you.

462
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,800
Mr. Ning, happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

463
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,640
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

464
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,710
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

465
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,640
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
I'll get going, Mr. Ning.

466
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,350
Bye.

467
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,190
God of the night shift.

468
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,190
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

469
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,680
Same to you.

470
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,040
Mr. Ning.

471
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,470
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

472
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,160
Aren't you going home
to spend time with Ning Xiang?

473
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,590
He's with his grandfather.

474
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,190
Aren't you going
to celebrate the festival with your dad?

475
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,040
I don't feel like going there.

476
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,520
Will anyone send you dinner later?

477
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,430
No.

478
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,160
I'll just grab a bite at the cafeteria.

479
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,310
Dr. Ruan.

480
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
Mr. Xue.

481
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,430
What brings you here?

482
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,710
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

483
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,520
Thank you.

484
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,520
Your dad told me
that you're on the night shift today.

485
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,190
I don't have a plan this evening,

486
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,350
so I thought I should drop by
and spend some time with you.

487
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,430
(Mooncake)
Here.

488
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,310
Let's have some mooncakes.

489
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,230
You brought mooncakes.

490
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,040
Yes.

491
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,760
How can you not have mooncakes
during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

492
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,350
Why aren't you home
to celebrate it with your family?

493
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,800
I requested a leave of absence
from my mom.

494
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,160
Here.

495
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's see if there's anything you like.

496
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,430
I'll pick this one.

497
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,110
I'll pick one too.

498
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,590
Green tea flavor.

499
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,000
Green tea flavor?

500
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,880
What's the matter?

501
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,710
Nothing.

502
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,640
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

503
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,920
Mr. Ning.

504
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,350
Why are you here?

505
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,230
Let's eat.

506
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,230
You haven't had your dinner yet?

507
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,160
Do you want to join us for dinner?

508
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,590
Let's eat together then.

509
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,310
Sure.

510
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,310
Come here.

511
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,920
Let me do it.

512
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,110
You work really hard.

513
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,950
You haven't had your dinner yet.

514
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm used to this.

515
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Dr. Ruan.

516
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,190
He is...

517
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,470
He's my...

518
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,950
I'm Dr. Ruan's friend.

519
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,680
Xue Weilin.

520
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,070
I'm here to
celebrate the festival with her.

521
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,430
You must be Dr. Ning,
the guy who hit the patient's family

522
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,190
just to help Dr. Ruan, right?

523
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,710
That's me.

524
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,800
Sorry.

525
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,800
Neurosurgeons

526
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,760
have strong hands.

527
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,190
Don't worry.

528
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm a lawyer.

529
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,400
Dr. Ruan commissioned me

530
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,560
to sue Zhang Lei for defamation.

531
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,520
This is my business card.

532
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,110
Wait, Dr. Ruan.

533
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,950
Why didn't you tell me
about the lawsuit?

534
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,520
You're a busy man.

535
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,230
I don't want to trouble you
with trivial matters like this.

536
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,400
Let's dig in.

537
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,760
Don't worry, Mr. Ning.

538
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,110
I'm confident I can win this case.

539
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll definitely clear
your and Dr. Ruan's names.

540
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,710
Let's eat.

541
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,520
The food is getting cold.

542
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,680
Who is working
at the Nurse Station tonight?

543
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,760
They should join us too.

544
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,400
Mei and Xiaoxiao.

545
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,000
I'll give them a call.

546
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,680
Dr. Ning.

547
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,470
Thanks for looking after Dr. Ruan.

548
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,230
That's what I should do.

549
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,400
Are you on duty now?

550
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,280
Do you want to join us for supper?

551
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,640
Mr. Ning bought us food.

552
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,760
Come here now.

553
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,430
All right. I'll see you later.

554
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,350
Let's eat.

555
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,640
They will be right here.

556
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,310
- Dr. Ning. Dr. Ruan.
- Come here.

557
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,760
You can take this seat.

558
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,710
Mei.

559
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,760
Come sit next to Dr. Ruan.

560
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,470
- Xiaoxiao, you can sit here.
- Here.

561
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,280
Here.

562
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,680
Have a seat.

563
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,350
It's Malatang.

564
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,350
You must be starving.

565
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
I am.

566
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,430
I ran into Tan Ya on my way out.

567
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,110
She said

568
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,950
that you love this.

569
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,880
Dr. Ning.

570
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,640
You know us too well.

571
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,710
You know exactly what to order for us.

572
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,560
Let's dig in.

573
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,680
It smells really great.

574
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,600
So delicious.

575
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,390
As I said before.

576
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,000
Why bother eating mooncakes
during the Mid-Autumn Festival?

577
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
We should all eat Malatang.

578
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,670
You're right.

579
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,710
Exactly.

580
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,800
It's so good.

581
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

582
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,190
Dr. Ruan got you some mooncakes.

583
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,360
Are we really getting mooncakes too?

584
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,560
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

585
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,870
- Dr. Ruan, you're too nice.
- Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

586
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,560
Don't thank Dr. Ruan.

587
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,080
Dr. Ruan's friend

588
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,910
brought the mooncakes here.

589
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,630
You should thank him.

590
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,840
Thank you.

591
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,000
Thank you, Dr. Ruan's friend.

592
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,710
You are so handsome.

593
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,320
Are you a celebrity?

594
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,000
Are you a model?

595
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,760
He's neither a celebrity nor a model.

596
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,630
He's a lawyer.

597
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,600
He's a lawyer.

598
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,320
That's even better.

599
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,080
I have never seen
a lawyer this handsome.

600
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
It's my first time
seeing a lawyer this handsome.

601
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,840
I like lawyers.

602
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,390
You're handsome, rich,
and highly educated.

603
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,230
Did you study abroad too?

604
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,430
Yes, I did.

605
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,870
That's great.

606
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,080
Mr. Ning, let's eat.

607
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,280
You bought it, so you should eat more.

608
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,120
I'm good.

609
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,230
I had noodles downstairs.

610
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,870
You go ahead.

611
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,670
Sure.

612
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,320
Give it a taste.

613
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,470
I won't be shy, then.

614
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,190
It's so delicious.

615
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,190
Give it a taste.

616
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,360
Eat more.

617
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,600
What do you think?

618
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,950
It's pretty good.

619
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,320
Right?

620
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,120
Thank you, Dr. Ning.

621
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,230
I have never seen a man

622
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,800
who likes Malatang as much as you do.

623
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,600
Here.

624
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,910
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

625
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,360
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

626
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,560
(Department of Neurosurgery,
please come to Ward 305.)

627
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,000
(Department of Neurosurgery,
please come to Ward 305.)

628
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Sorry, Mr. Xue.

629
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
There's a situation in the ward.

630
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,870
It's fully charged.

631
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,600
Sorry, but you should go back first.

632
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,320
Don't worry about me.

633
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,470
The residential building is on fire.

634
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,470
There are victims who're suffering
from the head injury.

635
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,430
(Operating Room)

636
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Mr. Xue.

637
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,910
Xue.

638
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,320
Why are you sleeping here?
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

639
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,150
Dr. Ruan.

640
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,710
You're here.

641
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Why didn't you go home?

642
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,560
You were busy.

643
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,710
I wanted to say goodbye before I left.

644
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,320
I didn't know I would fall asleep here.

645
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,950
It's morning now.

646
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,230
You worked really hard.

647
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,470
Allow me to treat you to breakfast.

648
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,360
You can go ahead without me.

649
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,230
I have things to do.

650
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,360
Let's go, Dr. Ruan.

651
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,800
Let's go.

652
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm sorry

653
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,840
I kept you waiting the whole night.

654
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,430
Compared to what you do at work,

655
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,430
this is really nothing.

656
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,870
Your work is really tiring.

657
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,190
Liuzheng.

658
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,040
Eat it.

659
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,120
From now on, I'll call you Liuzheng.

660
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,120
It feels rather awkward
to keep calling you Dr. Ruan.

661
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,800
Mr. Xue...

662
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,150
Don't call me Mr. Xue too.

663
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,430
Just call me Weilin.

664
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,080
By the way,

665
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,190
Mr. Ning looks like a serious man.

666
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,840
Is he fierce to you?

667
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,670
Not that bad.

668
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,080
I only brought his name up

669
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,910
and you already seemed frightened.

670
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,470
He must have yelled at you a lot, right?

671
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,190
What about this?

672
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,760
I'll buy him a meal next time.

673
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,630
He won't accept the offer.

674
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,710
I'll be really sincere,

675
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,840
and I'm sure he won't turn me down.

676
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Liuzheng.

677
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,080
You should get a good rest

678
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,430
after this.

679
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,430
I'm meeting my friends this evening.

680
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,800
Do you want to come with me?

681
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,600
I have to work tomorrow morning.

682
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Your work is so intense.

683
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,840
You should take a break from work.

684
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,280
What about this?

685
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,430
We'll leave right after dinner.

686
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,950
You can still wake up early tomorrow.

687
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,230
There's something

688
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,950
I need to tell you.

689
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,150
Go ahead.

690
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,080
You probably don't understand

691
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,470
my situation too well.

692
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,670
I'm a divorcee.

693
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,600
What's wrong with a divorcee?

694
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,800
In this modern age,
this is the right given to us

695
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
by the legal system.

696
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,390
The serious Mr. Ning is my ex-husband.

697
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,870
You're scared now, right?

698
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,800
That's why we should stay friends.

699
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,470
No.

700
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm thinking

701
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
about the case.

702
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,150
What if their lawyer finds out

703
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,230
that you were married?

704
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,470
Will it affect the case?

705
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,190
But the relationship
I have with Ning Zhiqian

706
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,390
won't change the fact
that he slandered our reputations.

707
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,560
Sure.

708
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,430
With these words,

709
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,710
I know what I should do

710
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
for the lawsuit.

711
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,910
Let's eat.

712
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,280
Are you all right?

713
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,600
It's you, Dr. Ding.

714
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,840
I'm fine.

715
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,870
Why don't you stay in bed?

716
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Have some water.

717
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,760
Thank you.

718
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,430
Do you want me to bring Dr. Ruan here?

719
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm fine.

720
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,190
Get some rest on your bed.

721
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,840
Dr. Ding.

722
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,190
Can you do me a favor?

723
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,320
It's just a simple request.

724
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,470
If...

725
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,430
If anything happens to me

726
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,190
when I'm in the operating room,

727
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,630
can you take care of
these succulent plants for me?

728
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,520
Why don't you ask Dr. Ruan to help you?

729
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,600
Dr. Ruan cares for me a lot.

730
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,520
I don't want to make her sad.

731
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm not good with plants.

732
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,670
You should be the one
taking care of them.

733
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,600
Don't think too much.

734
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,230
Besides,

735
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,520
you can't hang them here.

736
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,190
It'll distract the hospital staff
when they're at work.

737
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,230
Get some rest.

738
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,150
How is Du Xiaoyu doing?

739
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,000
Du Xiaoyu?

740
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,760
Why are you worried about him
all of a sudden?

741
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,120
His surgery is in two days, right?

742
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,360
The surgery has a very high risk.

743
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,470
We don't know for sure
if he'll survive it.

744
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,870
That's serious.

745
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,390
You weren't there
during the case discussion.

746
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,840
He has a very low chance of survival.

747
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,000
You should stop being mean to him.

748
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,800
He's a young man.

749
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,760
It's such a pity.

750
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,150
I wasn't being mean to him.

751
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,950
All patients have to abide
by the hospital's regulations.

752
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,800
If all patients act like him,

753
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,320
the hospital will be a huge mess.

754
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,280
I think you're more sensible
than Dr. Ruan

755
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,710
when it comes to dealing with patients.

756
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,910
I agree

757
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,150
that doctors should keep a distance
from their patients.

758
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,560
Take me as an example.

759
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,760
There are three things I don't do.

760
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,870
What are the three things?

761
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,430
I don't offer. I don't turn anyone down.
And I don't take responsibility.

762
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,670
You sound like a jerk.

763
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,320
Let me finish my words.

764
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,390
I don't offer to be a patient's friend.

765
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,470
I don't turn down patients
if they want to be my friends.

766
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,430
I don't bear the responsibility
to answer any questions

767
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,320
that patients might have in the future.

768
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:13,910
These are important.

769
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,870
Bear in mind.

770
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,560
What an experienced jerk.

771
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,600
There's nothing wrong with doing this.

772
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,230
You can ask around.

773
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,870
I always receive the least complaints,

774
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,910
and have the least patients
passing away on my hands.

775
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,910
You have the least for everything.

776
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:28,950
You look rather proud of it.

777
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,630
Just learn from me.
