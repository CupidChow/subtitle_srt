00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,440
(2019 Jiangzhou, China)

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,240
Dad,

5
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,090
when were you and Ms. Ruan

6
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,880
married?

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,410
What kind of question
are you asking this early morning?

8
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,160
Finish your breakfast.

9
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,290
I don't want to go
to the kindergarten anymore.

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,200
What's wrong now?

11
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,410
What's wrong?

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,050
The teacher said

13
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,410
both parents must participate
in the Parent-Child Sports Meet

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,930
the day after tomorrow.

15
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,690
There's no rule saying both parents

16
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,120
must participate
in Parent-Child Sports meet.

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,600
I'll ask if your grandpa is free later.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,930
If he can't make it,
I'll ask your Second Uncle.

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,370
Then I don't want to go even more.

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,650
All three members of the family are men.

21
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,600
My friends will laugh at me.

22
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,400
Hold on. Who says a family

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,810
of three men can't take part
in a sports event?

24
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,680
Finish your breakfast.

25
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,200
What happens if you don't eat breakfast?

26
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,480
Gallstone.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,120
A man is a man.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,120
He can never be the same as a woman.

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,680
Ning Xiang,

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,530
will you finish your breakfast
and go to kindergarten

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,840
if I promise

32
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,370
to take care of this matter?

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,250
Okay, I promise you.

34
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,400
Finish your breakfast.

35
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,890
What a beautiful sight.

36
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,650
Where?

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,120
How dazzling.

38
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,530
Isn't that Dr. Ruan?

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,600
We see her at work every day.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,650
Don't you recognize her?

41
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,560
Your eyesight is so good

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
that you can recognize her at a glance.

43
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,600
You two better cut it out.

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,450
Without her doctor's robe,
in her white dress

45
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,650
with a pair of white boots.
If you ask me,

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,120
she looks beautiful.

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
With her charm and long legs,

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
she's practically an angel.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,960
No, she's Snow White.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,170
Doesn't that mean
all she needs is two dwarfs?

51
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,120
Let's go.

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,530
Dr. Cheng, join us.

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,680
Come on. Bend your knees.

54
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,010
Dr. Ruan is my junior.

55
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,450
Don't think about hitting on her.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,480
She's your junior,

57
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,600
not your sister-in-law.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,320
Dr. Ruan.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,890
Yes, Mr. Ning?

60
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,370
Morning.

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,840
Wait up.

62
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,650
Mr. Ning beat us to it.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,480
The day after tomorrow, can you...

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:06,930
Yes.

65
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,960
Medical records, right?

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll sort it out and send it to you
the day after tomorrow.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,680
That's not it.

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,810
I mean...

69
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,730
The examination report?

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Later,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,250
I'll get it for you.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,410
Anything else?

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,320
Nothing.

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,530
Then keep your distance.

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,280
What's wrong?

76
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,280
I want to avoid suspicion.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,370
Something is fishy about Dr. Ning.

78
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,370
Just go to work.

79
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,690
How many patients are we seeing today?

80
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,930
A total of 62.

81
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,040
It's the first visit for 45 of them,

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,130
and 17 are here for a return visit.

83
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,600
I have surgery this afternoon.

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,810
You should go and empty
your bowels and bladder.

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,930
It's going to be hectic.

86
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,760
Don't worry.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
So long you don't go,

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,650
I assure you that I won't go.

89
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,280
These are the medical records
of the returning patients.

90
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,250
I gave some of them a checklist

91
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
and asked them
to have an examination first.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,930
We can save some time by doing this.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,160
If new patients come in,

94
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,000
you still have time to look at them.

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,090
Don't worry.

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,820
I guarantee I won't hold you up

97
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,620
from getting off work,

98
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,970
and you'll go to your surgery
in the afternoon on time.

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,650
Dr. Ruan,

100
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,760
what's your shift
the day after tomorrow?

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,530
It's time.

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,440
(Ning Zhiqian, Beiya Hospital)
I'll start calling for the patients.

103
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,420
(Outpatient and Emergency
Medical Record)

104
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,700
(Ning Zhiqian, Beiya Hospital)

105
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,940
(Ning Zhiqian, Beiya Hospital)

106
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,620
(Outpatient and Emergency
Medical Record)

107
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,700
(Outpatient and Emergency
Medical Record)

108
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,370
Any more patients?

109
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,760
We've also finished seeing patients
who registered today.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,250
So there were 68 patients today.

111
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,090
We've seen eight more patients
compared to last time.

112
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,810
Mr. Ning, thank you for your hard work.

113
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,650
Dr. Ruan.

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,200
We'll talk when I get back.

115
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,020
Excuse me.

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,820
(Women's)

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,160
Dr. Ruan.

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,650
You're pretty quick.

119
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:49,970
You're not bad yourself.

120
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,760
You've progressed

121
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,690
greatly.

122
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,480
Luckily, I ran fast.

123
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,280
Or else

124
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,530
I'll end up
in the Urological Department.

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,090
Since you run fast,

126
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,090
I'll give you a chance

127
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,880
to show me what you can do.

128
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,410
What is it?

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,760
Ning Xiang's kindergarten
is holding a Parent-Child Sports Meet.

130
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,480
We'll definitely win first place
if we go together.

131
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,530
Parent-Child Sports Meet?

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,370
Are you asking me
to pose as Ning Xiang's mother?

133
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,130
I won't call that posing.

134
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,130
Mr. Ning,

135
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,000
do you think

136
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,090
it's appropriate for me,

137
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,570
or should I say, your ex-wife,

138
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,970
to pretend to be your child's mother

139
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,440
to participate in the sports meet?

140
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,570
Dr. Ruan,

141
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,530
it's nothing complicated.

142
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,000
It's really a sports meet.

143
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,650
What do I say if I go?

144
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,530
How should I introduce myself?

145
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,530
Mr. Ning,

146
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm working for you here,

147
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,250
even helping you pick up your son.

148
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,370
I've already done all I can for you.

149
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm not obligated

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
to be your son's stepmom.

151
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,600
Nobody said anything
about being the stepmom.

152
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,370
It's just a sports meet.

153
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm trying to work here.

154
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,130
It's just a sports meet.

155
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,690
Can't you do me a favor?

156
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,570
Would you stop?

157
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,090
Dr. Ning and Dr. Ruan are here.

158
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,200
You look busy.

159
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,280
What's so funny?

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Why do you care?

161
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,810
Dr. Ruan, are you going for lunch?

162
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,650
Ning,

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
are you going for lunch too?

164
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,200
Aren't you hungry during lunchtime?

165
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,720
What's so funny?

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,130
A person will always have someone
who can subdue them.

167
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,530
Like brine and tofu.

168
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,130
Who's the brine, and who's the tofu?

169
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,650
I'm heading to the cafeteria
to have some tofu.

170
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,370
Ning, wait up!

171
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,090
He's nuts.

172
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,770
Stop bugging me.

173
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,130
Come on. Just go.

174
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,250
You can stay for half an hour.

175
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,840
It doesn't matter how long I stay.

176
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,010
What would your son think?

177
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,040
I've promised Ning Xiang.

178
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,400
Go and find his birth mother.

179
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,450
If I can find her,

180
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,640
would I ask you to help me?

181
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm not going anyway.

182
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,400
You should figure out
how to explain it to your son.

183
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay.

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,770
You'll be my assistant

185
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,570
for the surgery

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,450
this afternoon.

187
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,640
Really?

188
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,930
Did you just try to bribe me
with surgery?

189
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,600
Listen here.

190
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,160
You've crossed the line by doing this.

191
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,400
Dr. Ruan, what were you thinking?

192
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
You were scheduled for the surgery.

193
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,250
All right then.

194
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,520
We should be professional in this.

195
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,330
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,570
Would you have enough energy
for the surgery later?

197
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,040
They only have spicy food left.

198
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,810
I can't eat spicy food.

199
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,890
You can have mine.

200
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Mine is not spicy.

201
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,210
Thanks.

202
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,890
Mr. Ning,

203
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,080
I have some dishes here.

204
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,160
Do you want some?

205
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,810
It's okay. It's enough.

206
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Thanks.

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Dr. Ding,

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
they're having lunch together.

209
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,450
Why are you getting in their way?

210
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,770
Am I right?

211
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,330
What's so funny?

212
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
Why do you care?

213
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,810
I was born with a smiley face.

214
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,720
What can you do about it?

215
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,010
See? This is what I look like.

216
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
Ning, I was born this way, right?

217
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,930
I can't believe you think
my smiley face gets in your way.

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,770
Why did you kick me?

219
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,600
I get it.

220
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,280
You're not happy

221
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
about Ning eating Dr. Ruan's food.

222
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,840
So you're venting on me.

223
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,160
Ning, say something.

224
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,640
I can't believe
this is how a young doctor behaves.

225
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,160
Are you done eating?

226
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,640
See what you did?

227
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,040
Fine.

228
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,820
(Ning Zhiqian Part 3)

229
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,330
Are you here stealing Mr. Ning's skills?

230
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,130
He wants me to assist him
during surgery.

231
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,520
So I need to study.

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,770
You should study well.

233
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,540
(Ning Zhiqian Part 3)

234
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,600
It doesn't help,

235
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,690
no matter how long you watch it.

236
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,640
So what should I do?

237
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,770
Follow me.

238
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,720
My teacher once told me

239
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,810
that neurosurgery is a risky job.

240
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,770
Your hands must be stable.

241
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
You must be calm.

242
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
You must be precise.

243
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,890
Game over.

244
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,080
The patient died in your hands.

245
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,330
Again.

246
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,840
Hold it further.

247
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,890
Don't wear that drill bit.

248
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,370
Okay, hold it a little bit further.

249
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,810
Like this?

250
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,960
Passable. Hold it horizontally.

251
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,720
Horizontally?

252
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,250
- Like this?
- Yes.

253
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,890
- Hold it like this?
- Yes.

254
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,640
You can move upwards after that.

255
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,130
Hold it with three fingers.

256
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,400
See? Hold it like this.

257
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,280
If you hold it like this,

258
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,690
you can see clearly.

259
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,720
Be more gentle.

260
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Okay.

261
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,210
Now let's assume

262
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,770
this is the tumor
in the patient's brain.

263
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,160
Now cut the egg membrane with a scalpel.

264
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,400
But don't stain the scalpel
with egg white.

265
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,600
If you stain it with egg white,

266
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,280
it means you've damaged the patient's

267
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,280
normal tissues.

268
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Then your surgery fails.

269
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,720
Let's begin.

270
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,080
You damaged the patient's optic nerve.

271
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,930
He's now blind.

272
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,160
Again.

273
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,890
I've dissected it.

274
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,330
Okay. Check the tip of your scalpel.

275
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,210
Like this?

276
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,040
Dad!

277
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,890
You said you're going to
get mom back for me.

278
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,450
When did I say that?

279
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,840
Have you forgotten?

280
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,960
You said that this morning.

281
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,600
I've already informed the hospital

282
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,770
and taken the day off.

283
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,930
I'll accompany you that day.

284
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,280
No.

285
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,930
Why not?

286
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,720
Stop making a fuss.

287
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,960
Can't I go with you instead?

288
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Haven't you heard of the father
and son going to battle together,

289
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,400
or an outstanding dad
who never has an average son?

290
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,930
You promised to get mom back,

291
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,160
and it won't be three guys.

292
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,640
Two guys and one woman.

293
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,250
I never said that.

294
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,130
There's no woman.

295
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,130
You said you didn't want three guys.

296
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,160
Am I right?

297
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,960
So there'll be only two guys,
you and me.

298
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,040
Didn't I tell you to get mom back?

299
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,810
I never said that.

300
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,130
I only said it wouldn't

301
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,890
be three guys.

302
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,520
Just two guys.

303
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,480
It'll be you and me.

304
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,520
You can cut it out now.

305
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,720
You lied to me!

306
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
I need to go to the toilet.

307
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,280
You're a liar!

308
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,210
Nature is calling.

309
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,480
You lied to me.

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,080
I didn't lie to you.

311
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,480
Yes, you did!

312
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,010
I did not.

313
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,520
- You did!
- My stomach is aching!

314
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,720
- You and me, together.
- Dad!

315
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,930
But you said...

316
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,520
You lied to me, Dad!

317
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,330
I can't believe him.

318
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,040
How could a grown man lie to a kid?

319
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,210
Outrageous.

320
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,160
I'm so mad.

321
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,930
What kind of an adult
would lie to a kid?

322
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,690
(Outpatient)
I told you that your dad is not here.

323
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
See? He's not here.

324
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,080
Wait here. I'll call your dad.

325
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,640
I came looking for her.

326
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,160
Ning Xiang?

327
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,160
Dr. Ruan, he...

328
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,640
It's okay, Xiaoxiao.
You can get back to work.

329
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,400
Okay.

330
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,130
Why are you here?

331
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,210
Where's your dad?

332
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,330
He's at home.

333
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,570
Why did you come here by yourself?

334
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,210
I want you to accompany me
to the sports meet,

335
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,210
because you're my mom.

336
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,400
How about this?

337
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,930
I'll send you home first.

338
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,850
We'll talk about this at home, okay?

339
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,360
If you don't promise me,

340
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll stay here.

341
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,360
Be good,

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,690
okay?

343
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,690
Why won't you admit that you're my mom?

344
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,810
Okay.

345
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,850
I'll go to the sports meet.

346
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,400
But you must go home now.

347
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,970
Your dad will worry
when you come out here alone.

348
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,490
I don't believe you.

349
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,330
Pinky promise.

350
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,610
To cross your heart and hope to die.

351
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,850
Anyone who breaks it is a doggie.

352
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,850
Doggie?

353
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,360
Okay.

354
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,210
Can you go home now?

355
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:08,970
Okay.

356
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,330
Sit here and wait for me.

357
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,570
I'll give your dad a call.

358
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,360
Then I'll go and get changed.

359
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,970
Coming!

360
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:50,570
Go inside.

361
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,360
Change your shoes.

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,970
You can just come inside.

363
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,690
It was such an eye-opening day.

364
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,120
An adult at home

365
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
didn't even know that a child left home.

366
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,520
Ning Xiang,

367
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,970
come here.

368
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,160
Why

369
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,730
did you leave without telling me?

370
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,450
I told you I went out looking for mom.

371
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Sorry for troubling you.

372
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,450
I made food.

373
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,640
Why don't you join us for dinner?

374
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,850
We already ate.

375
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,570
You ate? What did you eat?

376
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,490
We had mango, dragon fruit,

377
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,880
and pineapple!

378
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,160
What?

379
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,690
Is that what you fed my son?

380
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,690
Did you go to the fruit stall?

381
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,330
We had fruit pizza.

382
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,610
Mom also promised

383
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,850
she'll come to the sports meet.

384
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,090
Really?

385
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,040
You can ask her if you don't believe me.

386
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
Mom, you did promise me

387
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,850
you'd come to the sports meet, right?

388
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,040
Are you happy?

389
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Yes.

390
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,730
She's taking part in the sports meet.

391
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Since I've dropped him off,
I'll get going now.

392
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,930
Where are you going?

393
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,520
Home.

394
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,570
Isn't this your home?

395
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm going to my mom's house.

396
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,240
My mom is waiting for me at home.

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,640
Then you should go home now.

398
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,570
Don't let your mom worry about you.

399
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,970
Come here
after you finish work tomorrow.

400
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,490
I'll see you at the sports meet
the day after tomorrow.

401
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,880
See you tomorrow.

402
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,930
See you tomorrow.

403
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,450
Why did you copy what I said?

404
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,330
I want chicken wings.

405
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,040
You look like chicken wings.

406
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,360
You did well. You can go and play now.

407
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,340
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

408
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,880
Can you explain this one to me?

409
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,360
Transosseous fracture
of the right temporal bone.

410
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,240
Go into a coma after waking up.

411
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,040
Dilated pupil in the right.

412
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,580
Wait,

413
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,810
I already explained this during the day.

414
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,640
I forgot.

415
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,000
Can you explain it to me again?

416
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
Why didn't you pay attention

417
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,090
when I was explaining it?

418
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,450
Are you trying to waste my time?

419
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,330
Are you?

420
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:31,880
I was explaining it.

421
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,850
Did you pay attention to it at all?

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,040
- Did you?
- I did.

423
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,880
I was teasing you.

424
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,930
What do you want for lunch tomorrow?

425
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,730
I'll send it to you.

426
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,090
The postgraduate examination
is around the corner.

427
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,810
You should prepare for it.

428
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,690
You don't have to send me food.

429
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,040
I also need the time to relax.

430
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
Besides, I feel relaxed when cooking.

431
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,360
Come on.

432
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,490
I also need a proper balance
between work and rest.

433
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,730
Tell me what you want to eat.

434
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
After you fell asleep last night,

435
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,970
your phone beeped.

436
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,160
It was a message.

437
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,450
I was worried they might need you
at the hospital.

438
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,880
So I read it.

439
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,880
It was a message from the chief.

440
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,520
He wants to have a meeting
with me tomorrow.

441
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,160
Why? He doesn't care about my meals.

442
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,330
You don't need to eat anyway.

443
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,450
I do.

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,450
Then what will you make for me?

445
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,690
What will you make for me?

446
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,360
Read your book, and stop bothering me.

447
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,570
Remember to send me food tomorrow.

448
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,450
Xiao'er, what are you doing here?

449
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,160
Hey, Zheng.

450
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,730
My relative from out of town
is here to see a doctor.

451
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm sending his medical record
from the medical consensus.

452
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,760
Are you here to send food?

453
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,400
He has been scheduled
for many surgeries lately.

454
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
I was worried he'd be too busy to eat.

455
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,760
What a happy married couple.

456
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,850
I'll leave you guys to it.

457
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,610
I'll get going then.

458
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Remember to eat.

459
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
You sure are fortunate.

460
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,970
Xiao'er,

461
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,330
is it all like this after being married?

462
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,760
Yes.

463
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
Aren't you happy right now?

464
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,570
Xiao'er,

465
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,450
I feel pressured

466
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,850
when she's very nice to me.

467
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,970
What are you saying?

468
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,240
You're already married.

469
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,040
Why would you feel pressured
when she's your wife?

470
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,210
Being married

471
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,880
is different from what I had imagined.

472
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,570
How different?

473
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,730
I'll give an example.

474
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,090
If your wife made you food,

475
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,640
you didn't want to eat
because you had no appetite,

476
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,490
what would you do?

477
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,690
I'll just eat it.

478
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,400
She took the trouble to cook for me.

479
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,850
She'll feel sad if I don't eat it.

480
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,330
Do you mean the marriage won't sustain

481
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,880
if you don't eat the food?

482
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,730
Qian,

483
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,610
I'll tell you what married life is.

484
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,040
When I reach home every evening,

485
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,330
I have to accompany my wife to watch TV.

486
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,610
During the weekends,

487
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,330
I have to accompany her to go shopping,

488
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,570
have a coffee, and buy groceries.

489
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,570
When she has her period,

490
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,930
I have to find ways to make her happy

491
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,000
whether I'm happy or not.

492
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,640
You're now living with another person.

493
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,850
You're not alone anymore.

494
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,760
You should enjoy your married life
and your food.

495
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,240
I'm getting off work now.

496
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,490
Okay.

497
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,000
Bye.

498
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,120
Bye.

499
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,570
You can tell me directly.

500
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,760
It was my fault.

501
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,360
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,090
It's okay.

503
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,360
When I was an undergraduate,

504
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,570
my mom would also make me

505
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,450
some braised dishes.

506
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,850
I couldn't eat it.

507
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,280
So I would either let someone eat it

508
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,330
or throw it away.

509
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,570
So I understand why you did that.

510
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,570
Actually, you don't have
to send me food every day.

511
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,690
It's convenient for me to eat
at the cafeteria.

512
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,330
I feel pressured

513
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,160
if you do this.

514
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,120
But mostly, it's hard on you.

515
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
Okay.

516
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,240
I'll do the dishes.

517
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,360
You can get changed.

518
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,380
(2019 Jiangzhou, China)

519
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,400
Will mom go to the sports meet
the day after tomorrow?

520
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,730
I thought she had promised you.

521
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Come on. Get in your bed.

522
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,810
I'll take this off.

523
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,520
Dad, tell me a story.

524
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,690
I want this one.

525
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,450
Which one?

526
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,040
"My Mother."

527
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,160
(My Mother)
Your mother?

528
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
Does she look like my mom?

529
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,690
Yes.

530
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,690
But I don't think so.

531
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,040
Then why did you ask me?

532
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,690
Let's see how many words you can read.

533
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,160
Read them for me.

534
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,280
My mother

535
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,090
is someone who has...

536
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,090
Magic.

537
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,880
A magic gardener.

538
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
You know most of the words here.

539
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,850
So read it yourself.

540
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,570
No.

541
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,360
I want you to read it for me.

542
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,450
Fine, I'll do it.

543
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,490
She's the world's...

544
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,240
You don't know these characters, right?

545
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,760
Strongest woman.

546
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,400
She's pretty strong, right?

547
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,570
Like a fighter.

548
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,880
This one too.

549
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,210
Dr. Cheng,

550
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,850
the surgery was perfectly done.

551
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,970
Thank you.

552
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,490
Thanks for your cooperation, Dr. Ding.

553
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,850
Did you study
at the same university as Mr. Ning?

554
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,330
Yes.

555
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
Were you in the same class?

556
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,880
Yes.

557
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,490
Was Ruan Liuzheng
from the same university too?

558
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,400
Dr. Ruan is our junior.

559
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,880
Of course, our university isn't popular.

560
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,520
It's definitely not
as good as John Hopkins.

561
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,280
So you've known each other
for a long time then.

562
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
The three of us have known
each other since then.

563
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,520
But you were not from the same batch.

564
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,640
Why are you so close?

565
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,760
Because when they were at the...

566
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,020
(Changing Room, Men's)

567
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,240
You're trying to make me talk.

568
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,570
My strongest attribute is that
I don't gossip.

569
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,570
I have no comment.

570
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,660
(Beiya Hospital)

571
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,280
Good morning, Mr. Ning.

572
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,000
Wait!

573
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,160
Wait up!

574
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,240
Thanks.

575
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,690
Morning.

576
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,180
- Good morning.
- Morning.

577
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,090
Morning, guys.

578
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,850
Mr. Ning,

579
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,520
Dr. Qian scheduled a surgery

580
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,810
where I'll be the head surgeon.

581
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm pretty nervous.

582
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,280
Were you nervous when you led surgery
for the first time?

583
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,330
Yes, I was.

584
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,000
Dr. Ding is going
to perform her first surgery.

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,460
This outstanding graduate
of John Hopkins

586
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,400
sure is impressive.

587
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,280
Ruan,

588
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,400
the university's anniversary
is in a few days.

589
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,120
Are you going?

590
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,690
I'll go if nothing comes up.

591
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,730
They say medical students have it rough.

592
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,330
Baldness comes
before fulfilling our goals.

593
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,930
You don't seem
to have a hair loss problem.

594
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,240
It seems your hair is thicker
than before.

595
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,810
Also, you're still the same

596
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,930
after so many years.

597
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,490
You've become younger.

598
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,850
Everyone looks young
during their studies

599
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,090
and grows older when they graduate.

600
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,810
But look at you.

601
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,040
You practically become younger.

602
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,850
You don't look too bad yourself.

603
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,520
You're more handsome than before.

604
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,450
Really?

605
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,160
Ning, have I become more handsome?

606
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,610
Yes, you've always looked this handsome.

607
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,040
Dr. Ruan,

608
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,360
please come early for the rounds.

609
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,970
Okay.

610
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,360
Dr. Ning.

611
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,690
The patient underwent a reduction
depressed skull fracture treatment.

612
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,300
We've re-examined the skull

613
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,000
with a CT scan once.

614
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,400
We've submitted his blood,
liver and kidney functions,

615
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,810
and blood electrolytes for examination.

616
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,330
The dressing should be changed
every two to three days.

617
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,120
Today is the day to change it, right?

618
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,640
Yes.

619
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,810
Dr. Ning,
I'll make the arrangement later.

620
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,040
Bed 13 underwent drilling
and drainage for craniocerebral trauma.

621
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
It's been ten days since the surgery.

622
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,860
Based on the CT scan,

623
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,760
the blood clot is gone.

624
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,640
Hey, kid.

625
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,330
You're still recovering.

626
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,210
You should eat plain food

627
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,000
instead of cakes like this. Understand?

628
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,450
But today is my birthday.

629
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,360
Can't I eat a little?

630
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
Not even on your birthday.

631
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,770
Don't forget, okay?

632
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,640
Fei,

633
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,690
time for an IV.

634
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,730
No, I don't want to do it.

635
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,880
I don't want to do the IV.

636
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,600
You must do it.

637
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,730
Or else you'll get infected.

638
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,530
The doctor is right.

639
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,560
Be good.

640
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,160
Cai Jinrong, age 65.

641
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,400
She suffers from blurred vision.

642
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,320
The vision range of the right eye

643
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,770
is less than one meter.

644
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,530
The vision on the left is only 0.5.

645
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,290
The lesion is located
in the front of the suprasellar cistern,

646
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,120
which is closely related
to the optic nerve on both sides.

647
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,120
Madam,

648
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,010
try and look at my eyes.

649
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,970
Can you see these two fingers?

650
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,160
You can't see them at all?

651
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,640
Can you see if they're here?

652
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,970
You can't see the one on the left?

653
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,160
We must remove pituitary tumors

654
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,250
as soon as possible.

655
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,160
Doctor,

656
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,490
must I do the surgery?

657
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,210
Can I not do it?

658
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,840
You must do this surgery.

659
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,010
If this continues,

660
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,210
your eyesight will worsen,

661
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,450
and you may go blind, understand?

662
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,730
Did her family sign the consent form?

663
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,050
We were not able
to get in touch with them.

664
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,840
The neighborhood committee
sent her here.

665
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,730
We tried contacting her son.

666
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,400
When he knew it was from the hospital,

667
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,080
he hung up immediately.

668
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Find a way to contact the family.

669
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,250
We must do this surgery
as soon as possible.

670
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,800
Mr. Ning,

671
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,840
shouldn't you help

672
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,080
when we weren't able to
reach Madam Cai's family?

673
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,530
Her children are outrageous.

674
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,880
Are you a doctor or a judge?

675
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,320
Do you have too much free time
lately?

676
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,120
How did it go?

677
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,290
It must be exhausting doing rounds
with Ning Zhiqian.

678
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,730
Can you manage?

679
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,050
I'm two years behind others,

680
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,930
and at least four years
behind Ding Yiyuan.

681
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,010
She's already performing surgeries.
So I need to work harder.

682
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
Well.

683
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,970
If you didn't divorce back then,

684
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,010
your kid would have grown up.

685
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,690
Well, he has a son.

686
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,880
How is that the same?

687
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,120
Speaking of that,

688
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,690
it's not easy for Ning Zhiqian too.

689
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,400
All these years,
he took care of everything

690
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,690
to raise the kid,

691
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,930
even closer than birth parents.

692
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,840
Ning Xiang isn't his biological son?

693
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You didn't know?

694
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,160
Didn't he tell you?

695
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Ning Zhiqian adopted Ning Xiang.

696
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,250
When the kid was three months old,

697
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,010
someone abandoned him
in the hospital's corridor.

698
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,770
We even found he had a brain tumor.

699
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Ning Zhiqian did the surgery.

700
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,690
The child was so young

701
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,800
and needed special care
after the surgery.

702
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,560
He didn't trust anyone
to take care of the kid.

703
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,080
So he did it himself.

704
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,010
He was both the mom and the dad.

705
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,450
Didn't he try to find the mom?

706
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,050
He did.

707
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,640
But there was no clue at all.

708
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,320
This being said,

709
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,400
Ning Zhiqian

710
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
should find a mom for Ning Xiang now.

711
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,210
Liuzheng,

712
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,730
why don't you think about it?

713
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,210
After all, you had feelings
for each other back then.

714
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,360
No.

715
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,880
I just want to tell you this today.

716
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,360
You weren't here before.

717
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,690
Huang Qian from
the Internal Medicine Department

718
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,050
asked me to find out

719
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,360
about Ning Zhiqian's marital status.

720
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,490
After she found out he was single,

721
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,080
she asked me to bring them two together.

722
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,080
So I brought it up to Ning Zhiqian,

723
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,290
and he declined me right away.

724
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,050
But this morning,

725
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,010
Ning Zhiqian asked me
to introduce someone to him.

726
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,250
Isn't that great?

727
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,160
That's why I'm discussing this with you.

728
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,560
If you don't want him
to find someone new,

729
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,970
I can ruin his chance for you.

730
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,320
You better don't mess around.

731
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,970
It's none of my business.

732
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,250
Don't ruin it for him.

733
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,530
Are you sure you don't mind?

734
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,010
Why would I mind?

735
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,290
Why don't you introduce one to me?

736
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,400
Sure.

737
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,800
What kind of guy do you like?

738
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,290
Tall and rich?

739
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,360
A modest and self-disciplined man?

740
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,840
Tall and slender?

741
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,360
Don't all these describe Ning Zhiqian?

742
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,970
Just eat your lunch.

743
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:37,260
(Old Street Li)

744
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,160
Hello there, Dr. Ding.

745
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,800
Did you just finish your night shift?

746
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,880
Did you just finish
your night shift too?

747
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,490
Your appearance is shocking.

748
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,290
A middle-aged man like you
shouldn't eat deep-fried dough sticks.

749
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,560
It's good.

750
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,120
Say, Vice President Ding sure

751
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,930
is devoted to his career.

752
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,840
He even named his kid Hospital Ding.
[*Yiyuan: rhymes with hospital]

753
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,320
Sorry about that.

754
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,400
I mean, Ding Yiyuan.

755
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,970
Your name may be Hospital Ding.

756
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,210
Sorry. I mean, Ding Yiyuan.

757
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,450
But the Ding Family
doesn't own the hospital.

758
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,080
The doctors at the hospital
aren't all from the Ding Family too.

759
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,880
So

760
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,400
your dad may keep you away
from suffering.

761
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,640
But he can't save you from vinegar.
[*Vinegar: rhymes with jealous]

762
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,250
No, thank you.

763
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,400
I may enjoy vinegar.

764
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,080
But I don't just get jealous of anyone.

765
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,080
I've been meaning to ask.

766
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,880
What do you see in Ning?

767
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,640
I thought your strongest attribute

768
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,250
is not gossiping.

769
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,250
You're left
with no positive attribute now.

770
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,010
Okay.

771
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,800
Eat up.

772
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,210
I'm done.

773
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,210
Enjoy your meal.

774
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,080
See you.

775
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,640
Such a spoiled heiress.

776
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,970
What a waste.

777
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,560
Let's go.

778
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,840
Wang Qiantong!

779
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,640
- Don't run.
- This will be the last time.

780
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,400
No more next time.

781
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,120
You better explain it to him.

782
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,210
Actually, you didn't

783
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
have to come today.

784
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,360
What? Why are you so fickle-minded?

785
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,730
You begged me to come first.

786
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,210
Begging you to come is my problem.

787
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,640
It's up to you to come here.

788
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,880
I didn't want Ning Xiang
to feel embarrassed.

789
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,080
Also, you better explain it

790
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,560
to him earlier.

791
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
He has the right to know
who his birth mother is.

792
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,080
Mom!

793
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,800
This is my best friend, Wang Qiantong.

794
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,530
Wang Qiantong,

795
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,730
this is my mom.

796
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,600
Hello, madam.

797
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,450
- Hello.
- So you're Ning Xiang's mom.

798
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,210
Qiantong is a good friend of
Ning Xiang's.

799
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,080
I think it's the first time
we're meeting you.

800
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Yes.

801
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,530
Ning Xiang looks like you.

802
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,730
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

803
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,400
Hello, Ning Xiang.

804
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,770
This is my mom.

805
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,490
Hello, Miss.

806
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,970
She's here to accompany me
to the sports meet.

807
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,840
Both my dad and mom are here.

808
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,560
That's great.

809
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,360
Then make sure
to do your best in the race later.

810
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,290
I now announce

811
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,450
the Parent-Child Sports Meet
of Cosmo Bilingual Kindergarten

812
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,360
begins!

813
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,690
- Yay!
- Yay!

814
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,880
The first event

815
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,970
is Sedan Chair Race!

816
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,010
Parents, please get ready.

817
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,080
Be careful.

818
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,970
Okay.

819
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,210
All right, everyone.

820
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,360
On your marks!

821
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,210
We're going to run soon.

822
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,400
Get set!

823
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,530
Go!

824
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,800
- Go!
- Go!

825
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,460
Run faster!

826
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,700
Dad! Mom! Faster!

827
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,700
Dad, run!

828
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,820
Turn!

829
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,780
Come on. Run faster!

830
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,340
I'm okay.

831
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,600
It's your fault.

832
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,800
It's okay.
We'll do better in the next race.

833
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,530
We'll put in more effort.

834
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,080
It's all right.

835
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,560
Let's do this.

836
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,320
We'll do better in the next race.

837
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,560
Our next event

838
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,010
is Tire Roll Race!

839
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,840
Parents, please get ready.

840
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,600
We must do better in this round

841
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,640
and win a medal.

842
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,250
We're counting on you, okay?

843
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,120
Go!

844
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,080
- Go! You can do it.
- Hurry.

845
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,690
Faster.

846
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,840
- Go!
- You can do it!

847
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,690
Keep it up!

848
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,530
Go get it!

849
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,400
Hurry.

850
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,800
We get last place again.

851
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Tell you what. If your Second Uncle

852
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,690
competes in this race,

853
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,730
he'll definitely win.

854
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,530
What do you mean?

855
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,840
I thought there should be
two guys and one woman.

856
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,560
I don't want Second Uncle to come.

857
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,490
You're right.

858
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,120
Then let's do better

859
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,400
and win a medal, okay?

860
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,010
We'll win a medal
in the next round, okay?

861
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,120
Dad, Mom.

862
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,210
I'm counting you two now.

863
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:37,800
Okay.

864
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,320
Pinky promise.

865
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,010
Okay, pinky promise.

866
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,210
We'll win a medal this round.

867
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,880
Pinky promise.

868
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,930
Cross your heart and hope to die.

869
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,490
Anyone who breaks it is a doggie.

870
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,120
Let's move on to the last event!

871
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,880
You can do it!

872
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,400
It's Mummy and Daddy's
Three-legged Race!

873
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,250
Parents, get in position!

874
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,010
Dad, look!

875
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,730
Other parents are hugging each other.

876
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,840
Ready!

877
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,360
Go!

878
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,160
Go, Dad! Go, Mom!

879
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:21,160
Go, Dad! Go, Mom!

880
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,360
Go, Dad! Go, Mom!

881
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,160
Dad, get up!

882
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,210
I'm okay. Keep going.

883
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,050
Mom, you can do it!

884
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,930
Go, Dad! Go, Mom!

885
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,400
Go, Dad! Go, Mom!

886
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,490
I'm sorry, Ning Xiang.

887
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,250
I didn't win a medal for you.

888
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,640
It's okay, Mom.

889
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,490
You did very well.

890
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,050
I'll give you a like.
