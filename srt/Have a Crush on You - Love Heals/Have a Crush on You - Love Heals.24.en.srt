3
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,810
You see here.

4
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,170
The skull obviously shows
there's still...

5
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,170
Mr. Ning,

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,810
I'll go home if there's nothing else.

7
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,640
How did it go with Fu Xiaohui's family?

8
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you need my help?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,050
I was worried Tan Ya
couldn't handle them.

10
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,170
But I worried for nothing.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,410
I received a last-minute notice

12
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,640
to go to Beijing for a meeting.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
When are you leaving?

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,210
Tonight.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,210
Oh,

16
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,490
Juan said she's taking a few days off

17
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,600
to bring Ning Xiang here.

18
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay.

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,850
I'll contact Juan then.

20
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,240
Bye.

21
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,210
- Dr. Ning
- Dr. Ning.

22
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,290
Mr. Ning,

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,160
I'll be going on a date

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
if there's nothing else.

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,490
Go.

26
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,720
Okay.

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,210
Bye, Dr. Ning.

28
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,050
They all went on a date.

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
Look over there.

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,410
Is that Mr. Xue?

31
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,650
Is she going to let him cut in line?

32
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,800
No way.

33
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,160
I know Ruan.

34
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,210
She's not that kind of person.

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,210
So you know Ruan Liuzheng
quite well, huh?

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,570
Not really.

37
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,800
Just roughly.

38
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,440
You can say we're fellow schoolmates

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,650
at most.

40
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,440
Is that so?

41
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,410
Yes.

42
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,440
It doesn't look like it.

43
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,010
You even pursued Ning Zhiqian before.

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,650
So what if I did?

45
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,570
I was being opened about it.

46
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,960
I didn't do anything unspeakable.

47
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,290
Neither did I.

48
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,210
Yuan. Hey, Yuan.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,720
Before I met you,

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,680
I thought about the stream all the time

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,490
because I had never seen the vast ocean.

52
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,240
When I first met you,

53
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,080
my heart started suffering
from arrhythmia.

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,240
Your smile is like a cedilanid

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,930
that calms my racing heartbeat.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,210
Your eyes

57
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,770
are like compound amino acids...

58
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,960
I think you're sick.

59
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,120
You should see a cardiologist.

60
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,370
How about I make an appointment for you?

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,090
I've prepared this for days.

62
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Don't you find it romantic?

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,090
No.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
I want something heartfelt

65
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,690
from the bottom of your heart.

66
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,810
Okay.

67
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,840
I admit.

68
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,000
When I was studying at the university,

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
I did plan to woo Ruan Liuzheng.

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,490
But Ning Zhiqian beat me to it.

71
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,600
I didn't succeed because he stepped in.

72
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,440
After that, I met you.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,690
When I just met you,

74
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,320
you only had eyes for Ning Zhiqian.

75
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,650
Whenever you looked at me,

76
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,690
you always rolled your eyes at me.

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,210
Yes,

78
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,370
I'm not as tall as Ning.

79
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,690
When it comes to ability,

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm on par with him.

81
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,370
And your mom thinks

82
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,770
I'm the second-best bet.

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,250
But it's okay.

84
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,050
From today on,

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,650
I'll work harder

86
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,930
to make you like me.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,930
No.

88
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,050
I'll make you like me more

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,250
than you do now.

90
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
That's more like it.

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,770
Are you satisfied?

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,490
Let's go.

93
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,880
Dad.

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,880
Yuan,

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,970
come back early for dinner, okay?

96
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm not coming home for dinner tonight.

97
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,840
Tell Mom for me.

98
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,370
You can go home now.

99
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's go.

100
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,490
Mr. Ding, take care.

101
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,770
What are you doing?
Did you have to do that?

102
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,090
You're not doing anything wrong.

103
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,560
Why did you pull away from my hand?

104
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,250
It may be

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
the instinctive reaction.

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,250
If you're not going home for dinner,

107
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,490
what do you want to eat, Yuan?

108
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,490
What did you call me?

109
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,090
Yuan.

110
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,370
That sounds gross.

111
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,000
Should I call you Ding then?

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
I didn't expect

113
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
Tan Ya to settle it herself.

114
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,530
I didn't even get to help out.

115
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,370
I was caught by surprise too.

117
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,560
You look cool wearing a cap.

118
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,930
Handsome.

119
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,440
Why? Are you starting a new life?

120
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
You can say that.

121
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,210
I've been busy with my thesis.

122
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,490
So I want to relax a little.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,720
You guys really broke up?

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,530
It's been so many years.

125
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,880
Can you let it go just like that?

126
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,000
To be honest,

127
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,320
I still can't let go.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
I'll consider it
as the emotional entanglement.

129
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,320
Emotional entanglement?

130
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,840
In psychology, such entanglement
happens

131
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,160
when people can't forget their ex
after a breakup

132
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,600
because they have regrets
about the failed relationship.

133
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,770
I'll try to rephrase that.

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,370
It's like you were conflicted

135
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,720
about buying a shirt.

136
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,160
But when you go and buy it,

137
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
it was sold.

138
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
You really want to have it.

139
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,090
But once you have it,

140
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,000
you notice

141
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,650
it doesn't suit you at all.

142
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,600
The experience is meaningless.

143
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,490
Fine, I get it.

144
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,600
You're saying

145
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,560
men are like clothes.

146
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,600
You said it yourself.

147
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,050
I never said that.

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,880
I'll always support

149
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,090
any decision you make.

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,720
It may sound insincere.

151
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,250
But I'm happy for you

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,810
that you two broke up.

153
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,530
I think this decision

154
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,770
is very wise.

155
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,930
Let me dedicate a song to you.

Okay.

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,160
I'll sing it to you if you break up
in the future.

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
Sure.

161
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,880

Yes, coming.

176
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,130
Do you need anything?

177
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,080
We want another five lamb skewers.

178
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
Five lamb skewers, right?

179
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,200
Mr. Liang, five lamb skewers!

180
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,130
Hey, son!

181
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,100
- Don't clear the table.
- It's okay.

182
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,450
Your hands are precious.

183
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,010
You need them for surgeries.

184
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,960
It's okay.

185
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,370
This is my job.

186
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,640
Just sit over there.

187
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,200
Listen.

188
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,570
I asked you to come over

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
because Mei called again.

190
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,370
She asked about your plan with Chunyan.

191
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,690
Mom,

192
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,450
I told you

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,890
I wouldn't marry Chunyan.

194
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,810
Yes.

195
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,160
I know their family helped us

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,080
when we were in our most difficult time.

197
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,930
I'll never forget their kindness.

198
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,890
That doesn't mean
I have to use my marriage

199
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,930
to repay them.

200
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,490
Why not?

201
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,600
Besides,

202
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,520
you and Chunyan grew up together.

203
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,280
Mei treats you

204
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,960
like her own son.

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,080
Yuan,

206
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,250
I don't forbid you

207
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
from dating.

208
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,520
But

209
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,760
not

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,570
with Cheng Zhouyu.

211
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Why not?

212
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,570
Yeah, why not?

213
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,600
Mom, Dad promised

214
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,760
he would never meddle in this before.

215
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,080
Now, he's not keeping his promise.

216
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,890
- I won't do that if it's someone else.
- That's right.

217
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,280
But not Cheng Zhouyu.

218
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,370
Why not?

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Give me a convincing reason.

220
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,450
Both of you aren't suitable
for each other.

221
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
Do you know about his family?

222
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,450
Do you know about his parents?

223
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
I know.

224
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,520
I'm dating him,

225
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,490
not his family.

226
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,450
Besides,
you're the superior at the hospital.

227
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,330
You should know
the condition and situation

228
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,720
of his family the best.

229
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,400
It's because I know

230
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,840
that I'm talking you out of it.

231
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,810
Your families,

232
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,690
parents' educational backgrounds,

233
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,400
and your upbringings since childhood

234
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,010
have determined you both

235
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,160
don't share the same ideals and values.

236
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,720
I would judge

237
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
whether we share
the same ideals and values or not.

238
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,370
Am I right?

239
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,720
Mom,

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,250
I have something to tell you. Sit down.

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,490
But I'm still working.

242
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,760
I have something to tell you.

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,330
Please sit.

244
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,600
I

245
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,930
have a girlfriend now.

246
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,450
You have a girlfriend?

247
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,930
Who is it?

248
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,010
The one I mentioned to you before.

249
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,690
Dr. Ding from my department.

250
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,570
Dr. Ding?

251
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,890
That Mr. Ding...

252
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,570
Mr. Ding's daughter?

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Her father is the Vice President.

254
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,760
Don't you think she's out of our league?

255
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,450
What do you mean by that?

256
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,450
She can't get enough of me, okay?

257
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,490
Besides,

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
the relationship
is between the two of us.

259
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,130
It has nothing to do with her family.

260
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,160
Your son is not bad too.

261
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,200
You're right. My son is quite good too.

262
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,640
If you two get married in the future,

263
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,840
the prospect of your future career

264
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,930
will be bright.

265
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,250
Mom,

266
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,520
listen to me.

267
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,250
You must never have such thoughts.

268
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,640
If you think this way,

269
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,810
I would really feel unworthy
of her anymore.

270
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,250
I'm dating her because of herself,

271
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,890
not because of her family, right?

272
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,600
About Chunyan,

273
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,810
I'll talk to them about it.

274
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,200
After all, forcing things
doesn't bring happiness.

275
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,760
You switch sides pretty fast.

276
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,640
Of course.

277
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,080
My son's happiness

278
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,490
is the most important thing.

279
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,640
Sit here.

280
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,250
Okay.

281
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,080
Dad,

282
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,200
didn't you always say

283
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,010
all theories stand the test of practice?

284
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,600
Right? You did say that.

285
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,720
Besides,

286
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,640
the one doing the clinical trial is me,

287
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,810
not you.

288
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,330
You've already reached that stage?

289
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,690
Yuan,

290
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,160
is that how far you two have gone?

291
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,080
No.

292
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,450
It's not what you think.

293
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,330
I was making an analogy.

294
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,330
You scared me.

295
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm sorry, Dad.

296
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,640
Your reason can't convince me.

297
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,450
I can't help it.

298
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,720
I have another reason.

299
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,010
You have more?

300
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,720
Tell me.

301
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,520
He even

302
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
wrote a letter
to the hospital anonymously

303
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,050
to report

304
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,960
that I manipulated my power
for my child.

305
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,400
He did that?

306
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
He even came up

307
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,400
with "Messenger of Justice"
as his pseudonym

308
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,130
and sent the email

309
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,400
to the hospital administration.

310
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,050
The hospital investigated me for months.

311
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,760
Luckily, I've never done

312
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,400
anything wrong.

313
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,280
Why are you laughing?

314
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,130
Messenger of Justice?

315
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,450
That's so funny.

316
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,080
You can still laugh?

317
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
How can you laugh?

318
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,690
This guy

319
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,130
isn't forthright at all.

320
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,130
How stupid of him to do this.

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,570
Wait, what makes you so sure

322
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,370
he was the one who wrote that email?

323
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,930
I'm even angrier
when you mentioned this.

324
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,130
He didn't use his work email.

325
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,760
He used his personal email.

326
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Why did he...

327
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,570
He's really stupid.

328
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,720
Too stupid.

329
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,130
He's so stupid, right?

330
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,570
Cheng Zhouyu

331
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,280
is not smart at all.

332
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,640
You...

333
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,810
Of all these men,

334
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,160
you had to pick someone like him.

335
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,200
Calm down.

336
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,050
Sit down

337
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,080
and have an orange.

338
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,960
Mom, sit down too.

339
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,280
Dad,

340
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,930
try and see this from a different view.

341
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,250
He gave you a chance

342
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,640
to prove your innocence.

343
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,450
Right?

344
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Your dad was innocent, to begin with.

345
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,890
He didn't need to prove it.

346
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,330
In any case, I've said
what I need to say.

347
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,930
Think about this yourself.

348
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,010
I've thought it over very clearly.

349
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,280
Based on my observation of Cheng Zhouyu
during this period,

350
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,050
he doesn't have a bad bone in his body.

351
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,570
He may be a little stubborn

352
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,330
and silly sometimes.

353
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,050
But think about this.

354
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,760
You're his superior.

355
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,890
Not only did he not try
to curry favor with you

356
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,640
and grovel at my feet,

357
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,370
but he also reported you.

358
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,080
Do you know

359
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,050
how many people at the hospital

360
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,890
try to get on my good side?

361
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,010
They even call me Her Highness.

362
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,130
But Cheng Zhouyu never did that.

363
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,130
What does this mean?

364
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,080
It shows Cheng Zhouyu

365
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,690
is a very honest and pure person.

366
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,130
So don't be offended by what he did.

367
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,050
When I go to work tomorrow,
I'll beat him up.

368
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,050
I'm going to take my shower now.

369
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,280
It's your fault for spoiling her.

370
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,890
Yes, it's my fault.

371
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
(I miss you.)

372
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,600
(Cheng Zhouyu,)

373
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,720
(how many secrets
are you keeping from me?)

374
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,140
(Beiya Hospital)

375
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,080
Hey, the one with the cap
and sunglasses.

376
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,930
Why are you walking so fast?

377
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,890
Are you avoiding me?

378
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,890
No, I'm not.

379
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,690
I didn't see you.

380
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,450
What happened to your nose?

381
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,050
It's nothing.

382
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,930
I knocked into something last night.

383
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,050
Knocked into something?

384
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,570
How did it happen?

385
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,520
I hit it against the door.

386
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,130
It looks like you have
a lot of secrets.

387
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,640
I don't have any secrets.

388
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,370
I told you all my secrets.

389
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,890
Why didn't you reply

390
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,840
when I texted you last night?

391
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,930
I slept early last night.

392
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,400
I only read it
when I woke up this morning.

393
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,200
Don't you usually sleep late?

394
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,570
Why did you sleep early last night?

395
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,690
Come.

396
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
Come in.

397
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,280
Sufen!

398
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,280
Liuzheng!

399
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,930
Lin.

400
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,930
Look who's here!

401
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,400
Come on in.

402
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
It's been so long.

403
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,330
You're right.

404
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,280
You still look the same.

405
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
You didn't change at all too.

406
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,960
You look so young.

407
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,080
Please sit down.

408
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Okay.

409
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,050
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Xue.

410
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,010
Is this Liuzheng?

411
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,640
Yes.

412
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,400
She's all grown up.

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,760
I remember her

414
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
as a primary school pupil,

415
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,050
and Yuan Lang
was attending kindergarten.

416
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,160
That's right.

417
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,050
Mr. and Mrs. Ruan,

418
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,050
we bought some gifts.

419
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,160
You didn't have to.

420
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,810
That's right.

421
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,250
Liuzheng, serve the drinks.

422
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,400
I'll put these there for you.

423
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,960
Okay.

424
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,600
-Don't just stand.
-Sit down.

425
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,570
Make yourselves at home.

426
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,130
It's been so many years.

427
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,370
I still remember

428
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,890
when Weilin was young,

429
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,130
he used to play with Liuzheng.

430
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,250
Really?

431
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,400
- We already met at that age?
- Really?

432
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,050
You're one year younger than her.

433
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,200
At that time, all he could do
was chasing after her.

434
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,890
When he couldn't catch up, he would cry.

435
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,810
We knew each other when we were kids.

436
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,490
Dad, you never told me about this.

437
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,000
These memories just popped up.

438
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,850
Mr. and Mrs. Xue,
please have some drinks.

439
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,120
Liuzheng is getting prettier
as she grows.

440
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,330
She doesn't look older
than Weilin at all.

441
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,400
- Is that so?
- Yes.

442
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,400
Just like when her mom was young.

443
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,210
Yes.

444
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
Her mom is pretty.

445
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,610
Mr. and Mrs. Xue,
please enjoy yourselves.

446
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,570
I have an appointment today.

447
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,810
So I'll get going.

448
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,450
Okay.

449
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,360
Please come again.

450
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay, go on.

451
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,400
So

452
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,970
how are your chess skills now?

453
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,090
Of course, I'm good.

454
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,120
When you were not here,
Weilin and I would be playing together.

455
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,760
That's right.

456
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,970
How about we play two rounds?

457
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,160
Two rounds.

458
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,280
I don't think you can win me now.

459
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,570
- Weilin sure is tall and handsome.
- Did you read the chess manual?

460
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
Yes.

461
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,730
How about I give you a ride?

462
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,450
It's okay.

463
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,610
Ning Xiang is here.

464
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,640
But Mr. Ning happens to be out of town.

465
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,970
I'm going out to have fun
with Ning Xiang.

466
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,400
Let me join you guys.

467
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I'll send you back tonight

468
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
and pick my parents up.

469
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,730
Go on.

470
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,610
- Just go. Don't rush.
- Go.

471
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
Okay, let's go.

472
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,450
See you, Mr. and Mrs. Xue.

473
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,160
See you, Mr. and Mrs. Ruan.

474
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,690
He's so handsome.

475
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,520
That's what I said.

476
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,690
- He has grown so tall.
- Liuzheng.

477
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,120
That's right.

478
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,280
She is so beautiful.

479
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
They look so good together.

480
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,570
Really?

481
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,970
Yes, well-matched.

482
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,360
That's great.

483
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,260
(Flower Ferris Wheel)

484
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,360
I'll go and buy the tickets.

485
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,810
Stay with Mr. Xue and wait for me.

486
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,520
Do you want some ice cream?

487
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
I'll buy it for you.

488
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,450
Are you trying to bribe me?

489
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,330
I never bribe anyone.

490
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,280
I know you're trying to pursue my mom.

491
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,090
But you won't stand a chance.

492
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
I know I don't have a chance.

493
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,520
But your dad doesn't stand
a chance now too.

494
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,160
I've got the tickets.

495
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,330
Which ride do you want to play?

496
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,450
I want to ride the pirate ship.

497
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay, I'll ride with you.

498
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,360
I want him to sit with me.

499
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,570
Okay.

500
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,690
I love the pirate ship ride.

501
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,240
Let's go.

502
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,850
Okay.

503
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
You're so much like your dad.

504
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,000
Both of you are pretty fond of me.

505
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,690
Does he like you?

506
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,050
It doesn't sound convincing to me.

507
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Tell you what.

508
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,120
Your dad and I played
on the trampoline together before.

509
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,810
You must be scared.

510
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,880
Me? Scared?

511
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,090
I'm not scared at all.

512
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,850
Are you?

513
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,690
Today, we'll have a competition.

514
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,210
Who gets afraid first

515
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,610
loses.

516
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,240
If you lose,

517
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,640
you can't pursue my mom anymore.

518
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,360
Deal?

519
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,450
Deal.

520
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,610
What if you lose?

521
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,480
I won't lose.

522
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,930
Fine. We'll see.

523
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,610
Ning Xiang,

524
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,090
are you scared?

525
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,090
No!

526
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,640
Are you really not afraid?

527
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,240
Yes!

528
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
Really?

529
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,760
Okay.

Hello!

531
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,090
Are you scared?

532
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,240
So?

533
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,090
Are you scared?

534
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,050
No.

535
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,690
No?

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,760

No.

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,050
we've tied.

Do you dare to play something else?

547
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,730
Sure.

548

Wear this.

553
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,400
Does it fit?

554
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,330
Yes.

555
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,400
It's a little bright.

556
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,000
Hold on tight.

Yes.

Ning Xiang.

563

That was so scary.

Do you dare to go on
a more exciting ride?

565
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,400
Then I want to ride that one.

But you're not tall enough.

568

They won't let you ride it.

569
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,730
I want to ride it.

570
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,610
Are you too scared to ride it?

571
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,760
You should rest for a while.

Did Mummy Ruan and Dad

not marry

585
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
because of you?

586
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,930
How do you know?

587
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,160
You grown-ups

588
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
treat me like a kid.

589
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,000
You guys never tell me the truth.

590
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,330
I can tell you seriously

591
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,240
that I don't treat you like a kid.

592
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,120
We're having

593
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,970
a men-to-men conversation.

594
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,850
Then tell me.

595
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm not the reason

596
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,000
they didn't marry.

597
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,090
Then tell me why.

598
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,880
It's just like
when you build Lego blocks.

599
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,970
If you piece one wrong block,

600
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,240
the whole structure will go wrong.

601
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,120
It's the same as getting married.

602
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,850
If they can't piece it together,

603
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,930
it means it's not suitable.

604
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,210
I thought Dad and Mom would get married.

605
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,000
It turns out things will change.

606

Perhaps this is life.

Yes,

Okay, we'll ride in the same car.

619

Yes.

626
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,610
Next time,

627
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,400
can you take me out again?

628
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,880
Sure.

629
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,120
Aren't

630
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,480
we friends now?

631
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
We're not friends.

632
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,760
We're brothers.

633
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,640
How did you do it?

634
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,450
Being sincere.

635
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,610

Hello, First Aid?

641

Normal breathing and heartbeat.

643
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,400
Did you call the ambulance?

Yes.

648
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,210
He came from that direction.

649
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,850
He fell as he walked.

650
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,850
Then he threw up.

651
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,050

652
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,690

658
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,690
Send him to Beiya Hospital.

659
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,360
It's nearer.

660
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,970
Send him to his mom.

661
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,330
Don't worry.

Hello.

664
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,090
What's the situation?

665
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm a neurosurgeon on secondment here.

I'm Ruan Liuzheng.

667
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,930
The patient

668
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,810
fell unconscious
between the 20th to 25th minutes.

669
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,280
He threw up before that.

670
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,930
Schedule

671
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,730
a CT scan of his brain.

672
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,690
What about the patient's family?

673
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,850
We're still trying to contact them.

674
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,760
Schedule the CT scan immediately.

675
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,930
Pay attention to the points
I told you about.

676
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,970
It's not a serious issue.

677
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,400
But you need to be in a good mood.

678
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,360
Okay.

679
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,240
Yes, Dr. Ruan.

680
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,090
Dr. Qian,

681
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,690
an emergency case just came in.

682
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,730
There's obvious hemorrhage

683
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,210
and the mass obviously outgrows
the blood supply.

684
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,850
I suspect

685
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,480
it's pituitary apoplexy.

686
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,730
The patient's current
intracranial pressure is extremely high.

687
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,210
His right pupil dilates.

688
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,610
Herniation of the brain.

689
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,330
Talk to his family.

690
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,090
Let them sign the consent form.
We can't delay the surgery.

691
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,210
We're still trying to contact them.

692
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,480
Dr. Ruan,

693
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,330
this is a major surgery.

694
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,850
Not only do we need
to clear blood clots,

695
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,400
but we also have to remove the tumor.

696
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,330
If his family is not here,
who will sign the consent form?

697
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,120
But it's an urgent situation now.

698
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,610
If the delay continues,

699
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,240
the patient's life will be in danger
at any time.

700
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
We'll go and have a look first.

701
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,360
Dr. Qian,

702
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,120
this tumor is located under the cortex.

703
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,000
The cerebral hemisphere
shows infiltrating growth.

704
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,360
It involves several lobes,

705
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
which invaded the deep brain structure.

706
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,400
And through the corpus callosum,

707
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,970
it affects the opposite hemisphere
of the brain.

708
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,210
It's more likely to be glioblastoma.

709
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,120
The patient is bleeding profusely.

710
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,450
We should perform surgery
on him right away.

711
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
The surgery itself is difficult.

712
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,450
And bleeding tumors like these

713
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,930
are mostly malignant,

714
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,850
like primary intracranial tumors
or metastatic cancer.

715
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,400
He's currently hemorrhaging
inside his brain.

716
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,480
The prognosis is bad.

717
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,400
The patient
hasn't been unconscious that long.

718
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,610
If we perform the surgery right away,

719
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,000
his survival rate is still high.

720
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,210
But his family must be here.

721
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,520
It's a major brain surgery.

722
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,240
According to the procedure,
we must give the family

723
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,210
critical notice.

724
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,450
What do we do now?

725
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,760
We can only wait for his family.

726
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,880
You guys better get a hold
of his family.

We have an emergency case.

730
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm at the hospital now.

731
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,360
I ran into a patient

732
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,520
with the cerebral hemorrhage.

733
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
Calm down.
Take your time to explain it.

734
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,160
The patient

735
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,280
is about 65 to 70 years old.

736
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,000
After he fell unconscious,

737
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,610
I sent him to our hospital.

738
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,120
But his condition doesn't look good.

739
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,970
We suspect it's intracranial tumor
rupture and hemorrhage.

740
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,210
We should perform
the surgery right away.

741
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,640
But we couldn't get in touch
with his family.

742
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,690
Calm down. Listen.

743
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,360
Send all the diagnoses
and the CT film's soft copy

744
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,000
to me.

745
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,930
I'll take a look at it first.

746
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay, I'll send them to you now.

(Left Parietal Lobe: Mass effect,

Dr. Liu,

751
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,090
if we keep delaying,

752
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,090
the patient may lose
the best treatment opportunity.

753
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,160
I know.

754
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,360
We're in a complicated situation now.

755
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,520
If the family doesn't sign
the consent form,

756

the hospital will have
to take responsibility

if anything bad happens.

758
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
But if we don't...

759
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,480
Hello?

760
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,450
Dr. Liu, Ning Zhiqian here.

761
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,810
I've seen the CT film
of the cerebral hemorrhage patient.

762
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,450
I think we should hold
a video conference.

763
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,330
Okay.

764
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,330
We'll do it right away.

765
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,450
Come with me.

766
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,360
Dr. Qian, I've seen the CT film.

767
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,930
I think you guys made the right call.

768
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,480
We should perform surgery
on the patient

769
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,090
to get rid of the blood clots
and the tumor.

770
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,050
This surgery is difficult.

771
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,090
It has a bad prognosis too.

772
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,690
The patient's survival rate is low.

773
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,690
If...

774
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
I said, if the surgery fails,

775
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,970
will the hospital take responsibility

776
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,120
for the patient's death
when the family comes?

777
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,810
Personally,

778
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,240
loss of profit is secondary.

779
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,360
Have you thought

780
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,480
about the adverse effect

781
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,120
on the hospital?

782
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,480
This surgery

783
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,240
may be difficult.

784
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,880
But I think we can give it a shot,

785
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,520
and we can't waste any more time.

786
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,000
I suggest performing ventriculocentesis

787
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,690
on the patient first.

788
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,760
You still need the family's consent.

789
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
I don't think we should take the risk.

790
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,160
What if it causes massive bleeding
in the brain?

791
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
After the drainage,

792
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,450
what would you do
if there's brain herniation?

793
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,850
I'm pessimistic

794
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,090
about this surgery.

795
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:45,970
Can you tell me

796
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,730
if there are any other doctors
on duty in our hospital?

797
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,760
We only have Dr. Ruan and Dr. Bai here.

798
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,640
The rest are either
in the operating room

799
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
or not at the hospital.

800
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,760
The fastest one

801
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,810
can only be here in an hour.

802
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,000
Dr. Ruan,

803
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,210
can you perform the ventriculocentesis?

804
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,090
Yes.

805
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
You can't do it.

806
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
I won't allow it.

807
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
This is Beiya Hospital.

808
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,610
Dr. Ruan is seconded to Beiya Hospital.

809
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,730
If anything goes wrong,

810
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,760
can you bear the responsibility?

811
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,610
No, you can't!

812
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,450
Who can bear it?

813
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,930
Dr. Liu,

814
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,850
the patient's intracranial pressure
is still rising.

815
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,120
Every minute of delay

816
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,810
increases the risk
to the patient's life.

817
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
Dr. Liu, say something.

818
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,360
Dr. Ning,

819
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,640
is there any better plan?

820
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,850
Dr. Liu,

821
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,570
I think letting Dr. Ruan perform
the ventriculocentesis

822
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,640
is the best plan

823
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,050
to buy time for the patient.

824
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm already on my way back.

825
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,930
Leave the craniotomy to me.

826
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,400
But the family has not signed
the consent form yet.

827
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
When the time comes,

828
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,690
who's going to take responsibility?

829
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,570
I'll take full responsibility.

830
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,880
Mister, can you drive faster?

831
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,850
Okay.

832
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,210
How is he?

833
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,730
Intracranial pressure is increasing.

834
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,970
Too much blood loss.

835
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,780
We won't be able
to keep it under control soon.

836
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,740
(RR Low Warning)

837
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,810
His blood pressure drops again.

838
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,090
Brain herniation has gotten worse.

839
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,210
We must do the surgery.

840
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,090
Hello, Mr. Ning.

841
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,640
I'm preparing
for the ventriculocentesis.

842
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,730
Dr. Ruan,

843
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,450
the tumor situation
is more complicated now.

844
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,570
If there's serious brain herniation

845
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,520
after the ventriculocentesis procedure,

846
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,730
have you thought
about how to handle that?

847
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,120
Also,

848
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,760
what would you do

849
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,520
if there is a deviation

850
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,970
after you perform

851
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,610
the ventriculocentesis?

852
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,880
That's likely to happen.

853
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,850
But this is the patient's last hope.

854
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,120
I think I can do this.

855
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
Then prepare for the surgery

856
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,640
and leave the rest to me.

857
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,240
Okay.

858
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,780
Mr. Ding, it's Ning Zhiqian.

859
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,450
(Beiya Hospital)

860
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,090
Dr. Liu,

861
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,730
schedule Dr. Ruan

862
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,360
for a ventriculocentesis immediately.

863
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,160
I'll sign it.

864
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,240
Mr. Ding.

865
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,610
I'm sure Ning Zhiqian overstepped
and reported it to Mr. Ding.

866
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,360
Even an experienced surgeon

867
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,810
can't give their guarantee

868
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,090
to a procedure like ventriculocentesis.

869
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
You would bear the responsibility too.

870
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,730
It's not a trivial matter.

871
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,880
We should make haste
and prepare for surgery.

872
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,970
I want to buy Mr. Ning more time

873
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,850
for his surgery later.

874
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,050
Inform the Anesthesia Department.

875
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,240
Hello, Anesthesia Department.

876
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,130
I'm Bai Jun from neurosurgery.

877
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,650
Dr. Ruan,

878
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,810
we're going to do a relay now.

879
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,050
I know you'll pull through.

880
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,280
Sterilize.

881
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,480
Scalpel.

882
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,720
Cerebrospinal fluid is draining.

883
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,240
The pressure is too high.

884
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,370
Dr. Ruan, nice.

885
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,170
The intracranial pressure is decreasing.

886
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:47,760
Thread.

887
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
What's the update?

888
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,410
Good.

889
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,610
I'll be there soon.

890
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,480
Wait for me.

891
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,370
Mister,

892
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,440
please drop me off by the roadside.

893
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,410
How much?

894
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,090
It's 72 yuan.

895
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,440
I'll stop by the side.

896
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,520
Okay, I've paid the fee.

897
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,440
Okay.

898
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,410
How is it going?

899
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,720
Ventriculocentesis is a success.

900
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,410
His pupil is back to normal.

901
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,280
Brain herniation is gone too.

902
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,000
I knew you could do it, Dr. Ruan.

903
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,810
Vital signs?

904
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,240
Blood pressure and heart rate
have increased.

905
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,170
Great job, guys.

906
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,000
Prepare for surgery.

907
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,610
This hematoma

908
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,200
is bigger than the one captured

909
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,480
by the CT scan.

910
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,610
Remove the blood clots first.

911
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,050
Only clamp

912
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,920
the hemorrhaging branch vessels

913
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,200
to protect the main trunk.

914
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,200
In this scenario,

915
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,650
don't clear the clots from the wall
of the hematoma first.

916
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,440
Why?

917
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,000
You see.

918
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,650
The boundary between the vascular tumor

919
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,520
and cerebral edema

920
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
is not very clear.

921
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,330
So as we remove the tumor,

922
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,650
we have to protect brain tissue

923
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,200
from vascular damage.

924
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,760
Got it.

925
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,440
Brain cotton pad.

926
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,050
Absorbable gelatin sponge.

927
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,960
How big?

928
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:04,960
Just one.

929
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,410
Dr. Ruan, come and take a look.

930
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,000
When you encounter this in the future,

931
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,370
don't remove the tumor first.

932
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,720
Because the brain tissue

933
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,610
has edema

934
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,960
and the boundary
between the tumor is not clear.

935
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,570
So to protect the brain tissue,

936
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,200
don't clear the blood
in the hematoma first.

937
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,570
Is there anything you don't understand?

938
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,130
No.

939
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,890
The blood pressure
and heart rate have improved.

940
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,520
Prepare the brain spatula.

941
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,920
Hematoma is cleared.

942
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
We can start cutting the tumor.

943
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
Bipolar coagulation

944
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,410
and microscopic dissecting knife.

945
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,240
The tumor is fully exposed now.

946
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
Isn't it the same as you expected?

947
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,440
We'll begin removing
the tumor in chunks.

948
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,570
Be gentle, Dr. Ruan.

949
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,180
(Chest Pain Center, Emergency Dept.)

950
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,890
Dr. Liu.

951
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,610
Oh, Mr. Xue.

952
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,960
We've found the patient's family.

953
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,810
You found them?

954
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,480
That's great.

955
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,960
The patient's name is Fu Ming.

956
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,890
Fu Ming?

957
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,200
His name sounds familiar.

958
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,090
He's the former mayor who retired.

959
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,960
Dr. Ning,

960
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
they've found the patient's family.

961
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,920
They'll be here soon.

962
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,960
The patient is the former mayor
who has recently retired.

963
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,200
Got it.

964
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,810
He's bleeding again.

965
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,480
Absorbable gelatin sponge.

966
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,960
How big?

967
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,760
Give me the bipolar.

968
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,720
Just half.

969
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,200
The bleeding stopped.

970
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,060
(Beiya Hospital)

971
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Suction.

972
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,650
Remove the brain spatula.

973
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,920
Forceps.

974
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,410
We have one last chunk.

975
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,410
It's too close to the large vessel.

976
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,090
It's okay.

977
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm here.

978
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,240
Success.

979
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,090
Great work, guys.

980
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,170
Bai, close him up.

981
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay.

982
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,330
Forceps,  needle, and thread.

983
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,280
Dr. Ruan,

984
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
do you dare to come

985
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,810
and meet the retired mayor's family
with me?

986
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,050
Why not?

987
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,650
Let's go.

988
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,380
(Operating Room)

989
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,760
So how did it go?

990
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,330
It went smoothly.

991
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,810
Thank you, doctor.

992
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,720
Thank you so much.

993
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,240
It's our job.

994
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,720
Thank you for saving his life.

995
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:51,920
Thank you.

996
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:53,920
Mrs. Fu,

997
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
let me introduce you.

998
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,810
This is our hospital's

999
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,810
Dr. Qian
from the Neurosurgery Ward 3.

1000
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,650
Dr. Qian,

1001
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,570
thank you so much.

1002
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,200
This is Dr. Ning.

1003
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,570
Dr. Ning.

1004
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,090
Dr. Ning took

1005
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,130
a flight back here to join the rescue.

1006
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,850
These two ladies

1007
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,520
are our hospital's young doctors.

1008
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,330
This team has young doctors.

1009
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,410
I should say

1010
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
the mayor's surgery

1011
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,050
is the best test for this team.

1012
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,520
Mr. Ding, you're right.

1013
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,920
Thank you so much.

1014
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,960
It's also an honor for us as doctors

1015
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,850
to save the mayor's life.

1016
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,570
Mr. Ding,

1017
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,410
the mayor

1018
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,330
has been transferred to the ward.

1019
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,610
Okay.

1020
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,890
I'll check on the other patients first.

1021
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, you can get back to work.

1022
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,100
Mrs. Fu.

1023
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:41,420
Excuse me.

1024
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,300
Mayor

1025
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,260
- has been transferred to the ward.
- You little brat.

1026
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,280
I'll take you to see him.

1027
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,920
Now it depends on the recovery
after the surgery.

1028
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,610
You did well.

1029
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,480
You did better.

1030
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,680
You bought precious time
for the patient.

1031
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,610
Your contribution
should be acknowledged.

1032
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,890
We should wait
until the patient wakes up.

1033
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,810
You look tired.

1034
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,280
Are you tired?

1035
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,890
I guess so.

1036
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,570
I was a little nervous

1037
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,960
when I did the ventriculocentesis.

1038
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,810
But it went smoothly.

1039
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,200
Keep it up.

1040
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,480
I'll get going then.

1041
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,130
By the way,

1042
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,410
I asked Xue Weilin

1043
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,810
to send Ning Xiang back to Juan.

1044
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,050
She called me.

1045
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,810
See you tomorrow.

1046
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,920
See you tomorrow.

1047
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:18,760
I'm hungry too.

1048
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,170
Ruan Liuzheng.

1049
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,570
I'm really impressed today.

1050
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,440
Mr. Ning did the surgery.

1051
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,130
I only assisted him.

1052
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,170
I always thought you were a weak woman.

1053
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,890
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1054
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,410
Back then,

1055
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,650
I had some misconceptions about you.

1056
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,570
But the truth has proved
that I was wrong.

1057
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,850
I'm willing to be your friend.

1058
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,720
Let's do the introduction again.

1059
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,130
My hand is greasy.

1060
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,000
Do you want some water?

1061
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,440
Hold this for me.
