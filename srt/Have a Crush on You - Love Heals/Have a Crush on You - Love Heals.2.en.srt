=Episode 2=

3
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,350
Zhiqian, I bought some fruits.

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,270
You're here.

5
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,590
Liuzheng, you're here too.

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,520
Hello, Dong.

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,440
Do you want some grapes?

8
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,520
No, thank you.

9
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,990
I'll have some, thank you.

10
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,800
Have you washed them?

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll go and wash them now.

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,950
You can leave your handbag.

13
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,320
Is something troubling you lately?

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,910
No.

15
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,190
You always look distracted

16
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,160
in class.

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
The topic of your thesis
is very original.

18
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,520
Exploring the problems of medicine
from an ethical point of view.

19
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,320
It's indeed worth researching.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Go back and write

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,830
your outline again.

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,470
Are you worried

23
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,990
about your future?

24
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,160
I heard you're not applying
for a postgraduate degree.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,550
Are you going to work

26
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,550
after graduation?

27
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,910
I have a piece of advice.

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,990
If you really want to be a doctor,

29
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,750
you should continue
taking advanced studies.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
Liuzheng knows what she's doing.

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,600
Stop forcing your ideas

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
on someone else, okay?

33
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,550
Have some grapes.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,190
Thank you, Dong.

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,750
Hello?

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,440
Sorry about that.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,470
I'll be right over.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,160
What's wrong?

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,830
I parked my car in the back alley

40
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,240
and blocked someone's car.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Give me the key. I'll take care of it.

42
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,880
Come back soon.

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
He likes to study medicine.

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,160
So he would force others to like it too.

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,910
I study art.

46
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
Sometimes,

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,710
I can't understand him at all.

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,440
Really?

49
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,440
Those majoring in arts love freedom.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,470
while medical students

51
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,600
pursue self-discipline.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,110
But I don't think

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,910
freedom and self-discipline
conflict with each other.

54
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,320
It's only the true freedom

55
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
if it's built on self-discipline.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,190
You like him, don't you?

57
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,040
I must have scared you.

58
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm pretty frank with my words.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
So don't be offended by it.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
Sorry, Dong.

61
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,350
You don't have to apologize.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Everyone

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
has the freedom to like someone.

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,630
Back then,

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,310
I got annoyed
when other girls fancied him.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
But I don't feel

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,350
that way anymore.

68
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,590
Why?

69
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,520
Are you getting married?

70
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,470
Congratulations.

71
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,430
I wish you

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,870
long and blissful matrimony.

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,470
I swear

74
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,280
it comes from the bottom of my heart.

75
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
Liuzheng.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
You're a lovely person.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Ruan Liuzheng,

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,840
what are you doing?

79
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,150
Doing my thesis.

80
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,400
Put it aside.

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,520
Our school is holding
a fancy costume party

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,750
with the old movie theme tonight.

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,680
Come with me.

84
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,680
I don't feel like going.

85
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,750
What will you do if you don't go?

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,030
Do my thesis.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Do your thesis?

88
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,470
Let me see how much you've done.

89
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
(An Ethical Approach to Medical Issues)
You haven't even started.

90
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,190
Put your thesis aside

91
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,190
and go with me.
Take it as the time to relax.

92
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,630
But I don't want to go.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,750
Ruan Liuzheng,

94
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,960
you're a complete nerd.

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,310
We're about to graduate.

96
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,120
Don't you want

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
to have a wonderful moment

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,350
of highlight
in your undergraduate years?

99
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,400
I don't know what to wear.

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,240
Just leave it to me.

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,910
I've already prepared them for you.

102
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,750
I'll see you tonight.

103
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
Are you postponing our wedding

104
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
because of an art exhibition?

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,030
I've told you that

106
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,680
Amy is holding
an art exhibition in Beijing.

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,590
As her only friend,

108
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,910
I must go.

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,000
Besides, we're only putting it off
for half a month.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,080
Did you say half a month?

111
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,590
Yes, only half a month.

112
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,030
Can't we put our wedding off
for half a month?

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,840
We've already booked the reception venue

114
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,520
and scheduled the wedding photo session.

115
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
If you cancel the reservation
and appointment now,

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,680
we don't know
when we'll be able to reschedule them.

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,630
Above all things, my mom

118
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,120
is leaving for Africa in half a month.

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,150
I want my mom to be at the wedding.

120
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,630
But I must be
at Amy's art exhibition too.

121
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,680
Must you go?

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,870
I promised her.

123
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,910
So I must go.

124
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,470
Yeah, why bother?

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,190
After dating for so long,

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
when have you ever changed for me?

127
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,630
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,520
Sorry, Dong.

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,470
Can't you change for me just once?

130
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,910
Bear in mind.

131
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,680
Never date an art student.

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
Don't you think this is too revealing?

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,960
No, it's not.

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Stop covering yourself up.

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,280
Be more confident and professional.

136
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
I think we're the prettiest ones here.

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,150
Come on. Smile.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,910
Hi.

139
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,030
Is that Maoshan Taoist?

140
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,590
They dressed up pretty weirdly.

141
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,230
Hey, Cheng.

142
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,190
Hello, Ning.

143
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,600
Hello, guys.

144
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,550
Come on. Let's have fun together.

145
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,520
Come on. Join us.

146
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,430
Wait,

147
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,990
don't you think

148
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,110
we're being a little
too conservative today?

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Yes, you're right.

150
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,080
How about this? You can strip down

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
to your waist and head inside.

152
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,030
I guess it's better to be conservative.

153
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,040
Listen.

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm the main character for tonight.

155
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,790
You better don't steal my thunder.

156
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,870
Later, if you see...

157
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,190
Ning is here.

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,520
Do you know
the girl standing next to my grandma?

159
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,400
- Which one is your grandma?
- The one wearing a tight yellow dress.

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,230
Can you check

161
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,280
if Ning Zhiqian is standing next to him?

162
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,400
I think so.

163
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,160
What now?

164
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Oh, that's Ruan Liuzheng.

165
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,920
Stop it.

166
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
See? It's worth coming tonight.

167
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,040
Ning Zhiqian is also here.

168
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,670
Who is he dressing up as?

169
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,480
Good evening!

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
Welcome

171
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,960
to our old movie theme event!

172
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,790
So

173
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,720
let's travel through time and space

174
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,630
and disco dancing

175
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,280
to disco music!

176
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,990
-Okay!
-Okay!

177
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,110
Hey, introduce me to her.

178
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
Okay, but behave yourself.

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,310
I know. Come on.

180
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,790
Move your body along with the rhythm.

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Let me introduce you.

182
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,190
The talent of our department,
Cheng Zhouyu.

183
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,600
This is Ruan Liuzheng,

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,110
a junior from our department.

185
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,040
She's my student now.

186
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,600
Hello, Ruan.

187
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Hello, Cheng.

188
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Hi, I'm Tan Ya.

189
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,480
Hi.

190
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,600
Hello, Ruan.

191
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,480
- Hello.
- Ning,

192
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
I think someone's calling you.

193
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,990
You should go now.

194
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,750
Go now.

195
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,360
Wait a minute.

196
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,160
So Ruan.

197
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,310
What do you normally like to do?

198
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm not particularly interested
in anything.

199
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,870
I would normally spend my time studying.

200
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,990
Study?

201
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,280
That's really good.

202
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,990
I like studying too.

203
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,310
If you have any problems
with your studies,

204
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,550
you can ask me anytime.

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
Hey, my friend complimented you earlier.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,430
Why did he say?

207
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,160
He said you look like his grandma.

208
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
He must be blind.

209
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,280
I'm playing Marilyn Monroe today.

210
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
Ah, Grandma Monroe.

211
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,310
Unbelievable.

212
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,670
Ruan,

213
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,990
do you have a boyfriend?

214
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,110
No.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,230
That's great.

216
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,080
We should focus on our studies
as students. Am I right?

217
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,190
We're not in a rush to date.

218
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
It's time for ballroom dancing.

219
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Please find your partner quickly.

220
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,870
Your friend

221
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,990
in that tight jumpsuit

222
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,160
keeps holding Liuzheng's hands.

223
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,400
He's making Liuzheng embarrassed.

224
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,160
We should go and save her.

225
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,190
- Come on.
- Leave it to me.

226
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I think our sense of rhythm

227
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,990
is quite consistent.

228
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,110
Why don't we keep dancing?

229
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,230
Hey, Zhouyu.

230
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,310
Your grandma is looking for you.

231
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,750
My grandson.

232
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,400
Come and dance with me.

233
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,960
What are you doing?

234
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Do you know how to dance?

235
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,870
Cheng Zhouyu likes making new friends.

236
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,840
So don't mind him.

237
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,520
I didn't know my grandson could dance.

238
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,670
Why are you so stiff?

239
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm scared of stepping on your feet.

240
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,160
It's okay.

241
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,750
Not bad.

242
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,870
I have to take this call.

243
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,280
Zhiqian,

244
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,430
- I...
- Don't say anything.

245
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,430
It's my fault.

246
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
I should be more considerate.

248
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,190
After all, she's your best friend.

249
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,720
You're such a loyal friend.

250
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,480
We'll get married
sooner or later anyway.

251
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,990
We can wait until my mom comes back.

252
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,980
(2019 Dahl Chinese Hospital, Africa)

253
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,430
Okay.

254
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,040
Mr. Zhao is here.

255
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,480
Mr. Zhao.

256
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,190
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

257
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,630
This is Dr. Ruan
who came here to pick you up.

258
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,960
Hello, Dr. Ruan.

259
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,720
I'm sorry about this.

260
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
You see,

261
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,080
you came to Africa

262
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
for the sake of me.

263
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,110
Wu told me

264
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,630
what happened to you yesterday.

265
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,550
I'm glad you're all right.

266
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,480
Or else

267
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,750
I would feel

268
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,230
really guilty.

269
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,750
Don't say that.

270
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,160
You have made such a great contribution
to the China-Africa friendship.

271
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,630
I can't thank you enough for that.

272
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,310
You're flattering me.

273
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,960
How are you feeling now?

274
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,750
Hey, Jeff. How are you today?

275
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,110
I'm good.

276
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,670
Do you feel any pain?

277
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,230
Yeah, a little bit.

278
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,720
Mr. Ning, his temperature is 36.7°C.

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,870
I see.

280
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,190
In this case, he can be discharged
in the next two days.

281
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,870
Mr. Ning,

282
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,110
he suffered from a gunshot wound.

283
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,160
It's only the third day.

284
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,990
We gave him antibiotics for three days.

285
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,920
Prescribe oral medication
for another week.

286
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,720
He should be fine physically.

287
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,310
What if he gets infected after that?

288
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,400
This odds is small.

289
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,750
We'll discharge him tomorrow afternoon.

290
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,720
Okay.

291
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,040
Hey, Jeff.

292
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,630
Hi, Dr. Ruan.

293
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,630
How are you?

294
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,790
Are you feeling better?

295
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,670
Lie down.

296
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,280
(He has a slight fever.)

297
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,920
(So it's not really a serious issue.)

298
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
(Keep observing.)

299
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,310
It's okay.

300
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,630
Dr. Ning.

301
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,230
Yes?

302
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,080
Don't you think it's appropriate
to discharge a gunshot wound patient

303
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,870
after three days?

304
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,630
What's wrong with that?

305
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
A case like his

306
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
is usually prescribed
antibiotics intravenously

307
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,750
for at least a week.

308
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,840
After a week,

309
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,480
we can only determine the next treatment

310
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,990
based on the patient's recovery.

311
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,040
Dr. Ruan,

312
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,630
I hope you get a grasp
of the situation here.

313
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,750
Can't you see many patients
in the hallway

314
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,790
waiting to be admitted?

315
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,550
And I'm the attending physician here.

316
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,960
If you have nothing to do,

317
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,550
practice your suturing skills.

318
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,920
Did you see the work you did on Jeff?

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,960
There's no aesthetic feeling at all.

320
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,990
In that situation, how can I...

321
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,670
Stop looking for excuses, okay?

322
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,480
Mr. Zhao,

323
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,630
how are you feeling today?

324
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,920
Dr. Ning,

325
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,480
my head is spinning,

326
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
and my hand is numb.

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,430
Okay, use some strength

328
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,230
and grab my hand.

329
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,960
Your grip is still pretty weak.

330
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
I can't use much strength.

331
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,280
Get some rest.

332
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,790
Thank you.

333
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,920
These are the patients
that were sent here today.

334
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Their conditions are quite critical.

335
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,230
What about this one?

336
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,430
This one too.

337
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm here to discuss
the takeover of Mr. Zhao.

338
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,280
Please wait for a moment.

339
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,230
We can't delay treatment
for these patients anymore.

340
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,550
Arrange the surgery for tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

341
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,870
Yes, Mr. Ning.

342
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,790
I'll make the arrangement.

343
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,750
Let's go.

344
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,190
Okay.

345
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,160
There is a flight back to China tonight.

346
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,360
Please prepare a car
to send us to the airport immediately.

347
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,840
I don't agree
sending Mr. Zhao back to China.

348
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,790
Why?

349
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,310
I did an MRI on him yesterday.

350
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,400
The tumor's location is obvious.

351
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,400
It would be an ordeal for him
to go home now.

352
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,280
It's risky.

353
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,790
We have consulted

354
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,750
several experts regarding his scans.

355
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
The experts unanimously agreed

356
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,280
that it was safe for him to travel.

357
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,080
Besides, his family hopes

358
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,430
he can return as soon as possible,
including himself.

359
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,960
Experts?

360
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,230
I'm also an expert.

361
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,400
You should know one thing.

362
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,720
Hope and reality

363
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
are two different things.

364
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,840
If anything goes wrong

365
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,160
on that long flight,

366
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,400
can those experts do anything to help?

367
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,600
Okay.

368
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,480
Give me the scan you took yesterday.

369
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,840
I'll send it back
and let the experts check it again.

370
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
Wu has it.

371
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,600
Get it from him.

372
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,310
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)
Ning, your house is huge.

373
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,670
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)
The renovation looks nice too.

374
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,020
My mother prepared this

375
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,430
for me to get married.

376
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,190
I had it renovated again.

377
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,960
Ning,

378
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,040
you're getting married?

379
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
When's the wedding?

380
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,430
I'll let you guys know
when it's confirmed.

381
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,520
Didn't you say you wanted to thank me?

382
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,040
You guys can help me clean up the house.

383
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,360
If I'm happy with your work,

384
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll buy you guys a meal.

385
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,870
Okay.

386
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,230
You can just invite us
to your wedding reception.

387
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,040
It's a deal.

388
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,630
Okay.

389
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,080
Dong will come at four later.

390
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,960
I need to go and pick her up.

391
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,840
If you finish cleaning up

392
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,670
before I return,

393
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,150
remember to lock the door
before you leave.

394
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,720
Okay.

395
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,670
I'll leave the cleaning to you guys.

396
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,190
The gloves

398
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,720
and the aprons

399
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,390
are in the kitchen.

400
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,880
Got it.

401
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,080
The rags are on the tea table.

402
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,790
-Okay, leave this to us.
-Just go.

403
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,640
You can go now.

404
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,840
Remember to lock up before you leave.

405
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,760
-Okay.
-Okay.

406
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,310
Look at this view!

407
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,790
Heaven! This kitchen

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,480
is my dream kitchen.

409
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,480
Ning is so handsome

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,550
and comes from a rich family.

411
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,480
This sofa is so comfortable.

412
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,640
Whoever can marry him

413
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,550
will be so happy.

414
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,910
This speaker is not bad.

415
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,310
The button is here.

416
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,390
If you look at these paintings,

417
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,360
you'll know it was Dong who chose them.

418
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,390
She sure has great taste.

419
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,360
Ning and Dong

420
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,960
are really compatible.

421
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,150
I envy them.

422
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,840
Enough of that.

423
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
Stop being envious
because you'll never have it.

424
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,390
So wake up.

425
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm so envious.

426
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,480
We should clean up quickly.

427
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Or else
we won't finish cleaning in time.

428
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
- Let's start cleaning.
- That's right.

429
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,600
I almost forgot about it.

430
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,150
The windows are clean,
and the furniture is spotless.

431
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,880
Mission accomplished.

432
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,480
See?

433
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,550
Ning.

434
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,670
I'm starving.

435
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,600
Let's go.

436
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,190
Come on.

437
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,030
Let's go.

438
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,150
I've been wanting to eat
at the barbecue restaurant downstairs.

439
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,150
- Hurry up.
- We're eating there.

440
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,310
- Hurry up.
- Let's eat.

441
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,360
I haven't ordered it yet.

442
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,880
(The door is open)

443
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,190
I'll get an access card for you later.

444
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,600
What do you think?

445
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,790
My students came over

446
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,030
to clean up the house just now.

447
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,910
It's pretty clean.

448
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,080
What do you think?

449
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,150
Miaomiao, come here.

450
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,150
Check the bedroom.

451
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Look.

452
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,720
We get enough sunlight.

453
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
You can enjoy it every morning.

454
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,960
Later someday,

455
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,840
we should really thank mom

456
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,390
for giving us such a nice house.

457
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,080
Miaomiao,

458
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,760
what's wrong?

459
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,600
Come and check out the room.

460
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,550
Come on.

461
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,080
Zhiqian,

462
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,510
let's break up.

463
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
What are you talking about?

464
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,760
I fell in love with someone else.

465
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Who's that guy?

466
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,430
When I was in France,

467
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,880
a curator said

468
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,080
he truly admires me.

469
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,790
He wants to hold
an art exhibition for me.

470
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,670
How long has it been?

471
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,550
Does it matter?

472
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,030
Actually, I've given this

473
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,760
a long thought.

474
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
I think I should be honest

475
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,390
with myself and you

476
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,960
before we get married.

477
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,080
When did it happen?

478
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,670
I have no idea either.

479
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,790
Maybe

480
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,120
it happened when we started

481
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,760
to contact and meet each other less

482
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,960
after you got busier.

483
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,960
Miaomiao,

484
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,910
I can spare more time
to accompany you after this.

485
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,670
You will be a resident soon.

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,960
You won't be able to do it.

487
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,150
To you,

488
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,000
career

489
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,430
matters more than love. Doesn't it?

490
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,480
I'll get going.

491
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,840
Who's there?

492
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,760
I just finished cleaning.

493
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,150
I'm sorry.

494
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,510
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,020
(2019 Dahl Chinese Hospital, Africa)

496
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,430
Mr. Ning.

497
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,480
Mr. Ning.

498
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,480
Coming.

499
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,080
Mr. Ning.

500
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,640
Mr. Ning,
we have an emergency at the ward.

501
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,430
What happened?

502
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,760
Mr. Zhao is suffering
from intracranial hemorrhage.

503
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,120
Let's go.

504
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,000
Wu,

505
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
get Dr. Ruan in the OR.

506
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,360
Dr. Ruan.

507
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,670
Who's there?

508
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,270
Mr. Ning wants you in the OR.

509
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,760
Why?

510
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,120
Without the result of
the consultation with experts,

511
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,670
why did you perform the surgery
on Mr. Zhao?

512
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,270
We're in the OR.

513
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,390
Please keep quiet.

514
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,510
Why did you call me here then?

515
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
The surgery will be over soon.

516
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,960
You'll cover him up.

517
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,030
Me?

518
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,310
Yes.

519
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,510
Didn't you say

520
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,510
you're the chief resident
of the Neurology Department

521
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,080
and assisted in surgery?

522
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,240
What are you waiting for?

523
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,510
The surgery is almost over.

524
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,270
Are you ready, Dr. Ruan?

525
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,270
He's all yours.

526
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,430
Thanks.

527
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,000
Too slow.

528
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,310
You can stop now.

529
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,360
I'll do it.

530
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,430
Stop acting tough.

531
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,600
So why did you operate on Mr. Zhao

532
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,430
without an authorization?

533
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,480
What do you mean
without an authorization?

534
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Mr. Zhao signed
the operation consent form himself.

535
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,550
Then why didn't you inform me
before the operation?

536
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,760
And we haven't heard anything

537
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
from the experts yet.

538
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,640
The patient can't wait.

539
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,760
I didn't have the time to inform you.

540
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,310
You just don't want him
to go back, do you?

541
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,430
Tell me.

542
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,190
If the tumor suddenly burst

543
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,480
when you and Mr. Zhao
were on the plane,

544
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
what would you do?

545
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,910
But the result
from the consultation of the experts...

546
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,150
Can you stop bringing up those experts?

547
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,360
Remember this.

548
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm the best expert here.

549
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,000
Those faraway experts

550
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,480
don't know the specific condition
of the patient at all.

551
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,190
You should trust my judgment
rather than listen

552
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,910
to the command of those experts.

553
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,270
Am I right, Wu?

554
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,080
Even so,

555
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,720
you shouldn't have kept this from me.

556
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,640
I never kept you in the dark.

557
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,550
You participated in this surgery.

558
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,080
You're also one of the assistants.

559
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,910
You...

560
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,720
Ning Zhiqian,

561
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,190
I can't believe you set me up.

562
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,150
How is this setting you up?

563
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,760
I became your accomplice

564
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,310
because of one stitch.

565
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,000
How are you an accomplice?

566
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
We're obviously allies.

567
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,310
Am I right, Wu?

568
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,720
By the way,

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,760
I'll need your favor to explain it

570
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
to those experts.

571
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Explain what?

572
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,480
You witnessed such an exquisite surgery.

573
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,790
Don't you know

574
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,150
what you should explain?

575
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,030
Wu,

576
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,430
I'll leave the rest to you.

577
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,080
Okay.

578
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,580
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

579
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Sorry.

580
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you drinking by yourself?

581
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,390
Can you buy me a drink?

582
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,190
Is something troubling you?

583
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,030
No.

584
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,150
I can feel you're not very happy.

585
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,640
This drink is making me drunk.

586
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,120
Let's drink somewhere else.

587
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,000
Come with me.

588
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,080
Where are we going?

589
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,760
I'll take you somewhere nice.

590
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:09,960
Come on.

591
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm not going.

592
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,960
Quickly now.

593
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,790
Don't touch me.

594
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,240
Get lost.

595
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,390
Ning.

596
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,310
Ning.

597
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,310
I thought you left.

598
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,080
It's me.

599
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,150
You came back again?

600
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,120
It's me.

601
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,790
Just leave if you want.

602
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,880
Why did you come back?

603
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,840
Time to go home.

604
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,120
- You're drunk.
- I don't want to go home.

605
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,600
Can I have the bill, please?

606
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,150
It's 430 yuan.

607
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,480
Why is it so expensive?

608
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,670
What are you doing?

609
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Get up!

610
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,390
Why did you drink so much?

611
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,840
Where are we going?

612
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,360
Home.

613
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,270
♪It was love that filled this heart
with sweetness♪

614

616
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,080

620
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
Ning, which place
are you going back to tonight?

621
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,960
Xingfu Residence.

622
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Mister, drive us to Xingfu Residence.

623
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,360
(The door is open.)

624
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,430
Zhiqian?

625
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,640
What happened to him?

626
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,510
He drank too much.

627
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,480
Jeez, get up.

628
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Come on now.

629
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,120
Thank you.

630
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,390
It's okay, Madam.

631
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,510
What's your name?

632
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,030
Good evening.

633
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm Ruan Liuzheng.

634
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm Ning's junior.

635
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,430
Thank you.

636
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,080
- It's okay.
- Thank you for sending him back

637
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,270
at this late hour.

638
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,760
It's all right.

639
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,120
Take a seat.

640
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Well, it's late.

641
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,390
I should head back now.

642
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,790
Wait. Well,

643
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,910
I have something to ask you.

644
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,510
Please take a seat.

645
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,120
Sure.

646
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,880
I'm his mother.

647
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,600
But we don't usually stay together.

648
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
I called him all night.

649
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,080
But his phone was switched off.

650
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,640
I was feeling anxious

651
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,880
because I'll be away for work tomorrow.

652
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,150
At first, I thought...

653
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,360
I thought I could carry out relief
in Africa without worries.

654
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,960
Are you leaving for Africa
for medical relief?

655
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,240
Yes, I'm going to Africa.

656
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,550
I'm a doctor.

657
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,790
A gynecologist.

658
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,000
I guess Ning wants to be a doctor

659
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,670
because of you.

660
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,390
I wanted him

661
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,190
to be a gynecologist.

662
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,310
But he refused.

663
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,910
He chose neurosurgery,

664
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,030
because he thought general surgeons
have to stand during surgery.

665
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,030
Only neurosurgeons

666
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,670
get to sit during surgery.

667
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,390
Ning's way of thinking

668
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,310
sure is different from ordinary people.

669
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,150
If I didn't have to leave tomorrow,

670
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,480
we could have enjoyed
a long conversation.

671
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,760
How long will you be away?

672
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,600
Two years.

673
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,120
We built a hospital there.

674
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,030
I'll be retiring after two years.

675
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,720
You can say it'll be the end
of my medical career.

676
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,760
I'm sure it'll be wonderful.

677
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm envious of you.

678
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,310
Then I'm going to work harder.

679
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,000
After I graduate,
I would like to go there.

680
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
Sure, come.

681
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,910
You're welcome to go there.

682
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,510
Really?

683
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
That's great.

684
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,640
Then I hope everything
goes smoothly for you.

685
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,960
I can rest assured now.

686
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,880
I don't have to worry

687
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
since my son is together with you.

688
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,840
It's great too.

689
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,880
Together...

690
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,240
I mean, studying together

691
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,310
and working together.

692
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,600
You're cheerful
and have a great personality.

693
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm really happy.

694
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,030
Me too.

695
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,390
Please help me look after him.

696
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:37,880
Okay.

697
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,640
Please take more interest in him.

698
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,310
Of course.

699
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,600
That's great.

700
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,910
Zhiqian,

701
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm heading out soon.

702
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,150
Come and have a chat with me.

703
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,790
What is it?

704
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,680
I know you're trying
to get over a heartbreak.

705
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,640
It's a blessing
that Dong Miaomiao left you.

706
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Enough, Mom.

707
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,270
Just let the past go.

708
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,470
Time to move on
and stop talking about it.

709
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,840
If you want to find someone,

710
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,990
I think someone like Ruan

711
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,790
is pretty nice.

712
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,920
I can see she has a very kind heart.

713
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,990
She's pretty friendly too.

714
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,230
Mom,

715
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,510
stop talking about my sore spot.

716
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,840
I've always felt guilty.

717
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,920
I only concentrated on my work.

718
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,920
I didn't give you enough love

719
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,160
and a complete family.

720
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
You didn't receive

721
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,550
a lot of love.

722
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,080
As a mother,

723
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,710
I... I didn't do a good job as a mother.

724
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,640
Mom,

725
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
why are you saying all this?

726
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,990
It wasn't easy for you.

727
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,840
I only want you to learn

728
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,120
how to love others.

729
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,160
That's how you can have true love.

730
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,600
Understand?

731
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,840
Yes.

732
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,230
(2019 Dahl Chinese Hospital, Africa)

733
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,780
(Wen Yi, To Cure Sometime,
To Relieve Often, To Comfort Always)

734
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,310
I only met your mom once.

735
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,200
Yeah, she told me.

736
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,680
How did she die?

737
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,920
Car accident.

738
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,600
Dahl has rough terrain.

739
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
So the journey was pretty bumpy.

740
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,080
She went to a village
to deliver a baby that day.

741
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,750
She met with an accident
on her way back.

742
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,950
So what did you guys talk about?

743
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,230
About you.

744
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,440
She was beaming
when she talked about you.

745
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,200
She told me how naughty
you were as a kid

746
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,920
and how hard you worked
to prove yourself as an adult.

747
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,920
She said she wanted you
to be a gynecologist.

748
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
But you chose to be a neurosurgeon

749
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,840
just so you can sit during surgery.

750
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,470
She even told you this?

751
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,270
I didn't expect

752
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,230
doing surgeries
while sitting down is hard too.

753
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,880
You suffered too much
and are too exhausted

754
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,440
that you became this way.

755
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,600
What way?

756
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,080
A little unreasonable.

757
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,840
I'm leaving tomorrow.

758
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,440
So soon?

759
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,230
Mr. Zhao just had his surgery.

760
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,470
He'll need to stay in Dahl
for some time.

761
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,470
His family is here to accompany him.

762
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,640
So I'll go back first.

763
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,600
Dr. Ruan,

764
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,840
don't worry too much

765
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,640
about Mr. Zhao's condition.

766
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,750
Mr. Ning will watch him.

767
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,640
Mr. Ning is really skillful.

768
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,600
And the experts
of the international hospitals here

769
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,440
also approve of him.

770
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,080
I know

771
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,160
he's really skilled.

772
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,160
Do you want to say goodbye to him?

773
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,990
It's okay.

774
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,710
We can just leave.

775
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,270
Okay, I'll send you off.

776
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,310
Why are you here?

777
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,360
Why?

778
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,750
Didn't you perform surgery all night?

779
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,680
Can you still drive?

780
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,200
Of course.

781
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,750
You can barely open your eyes.

782
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,080
Let Dr. Wu do this.

783
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,710
You came all the way here.

784
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,030
How can I not send you off?

785
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,710
Why didn't you let Dr. Wu do this
when you're sleepy?

786
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,640
It's dangerous in Dahl now.

787
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,710
If anything happens on the way...

788
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,790
You'll bear a huge responsibility.

789
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,230
So you know.

790
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
Here, we have enough bottles today.

791
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,750
Thanks.

792
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
I called President Wang

793
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,360
and explained Mr. Zhao's condition.

794
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,950
She won't blame you.

795
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,550
And she's giving you an opportunity.

796
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,550
What did you say to her?

797
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,120
By the way,

798
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,310
can you stop doing all the work

799
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,550
you can get from now on?

800
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,030
I'm sure everyone else

801
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,160
at the hospital avoided
picking up Mr. Zhao.

802
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,990
How did you know?

803
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:33,920
After not seeing you for many years,

804
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,550
I thought you should have
smartened up a little.

805
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,400
Unexpectedly, you're still so silly.

806
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,750
Who are you calling silly?

807
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
Can you still drive?

808
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,270
Yeah, why not?

809
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,950
Stop the car.

810
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,120
Why?

811
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,550
I said, stop the car.

812
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
What's the matter?

813
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,270
Fatigue driving can kill people.

814
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,710
Let me drive.

815
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,310
Buckle up.

816
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,790
When did you get your driver's license?

817
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,640
I had it a long time ago.

818
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,790
Did you just get your license?
