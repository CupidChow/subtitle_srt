(Operating Room)

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,690
It's more tricky than I expected.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
There is a blood vessel near the tumor.

6
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,970
They are too close.

7
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,000
It'll bleed if I cut it.

8
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,290
I'm unable to separate it

9
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,930
to remove the tumor.

10
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,770
Stop the bleeding.

11
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,290
Absorbable gelatin sponge.

12
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,640
Is there any other way?

13
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,130
We don't have other options anymore.

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,520
We can only stop the surgery

15
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,970
and close up.

16
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,240
Close up?

17
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,360
Why are you closing up?

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
Dr. Ning,

19
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,970
you're finally here.

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,570
What's the situation now?

21
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
Well, we have a situation

22
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,880
where one major blood vessel

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
is very close to the tumor.

24
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,490
I can't separate it.

25
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,800
It'll bleed if I cut it.

26
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,570
To completely remove the tumor

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,690
and protect the blood vessel,

28
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,330
there's no way to do both.

29
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
That's why I suggested we
stop the surgery.

30
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,210
Only when we remove the tumor,

31
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,130
can the patient benefits the most.

32
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me take a look.

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,570
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Sun.

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,770
You can leave the rest to me.

35
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,570
Bipolar coagulation forceps.

36
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,800
Hemostatic gel.

37
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,570
Dr. Ning,

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,720
won't it be too risky

39
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,290
if we continue with the surgery?

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,330
Even if it's risky,

41
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,600
it's worth a try.

42
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,970
Periosteal elevator.

43
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,450
Periosteal elevator.

44
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,970
Tumor forceps.

(Operating Room)

46
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,690
Send the tumor
to the Pathology Department.

47
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,080
Dr. Sun,

48
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,450
I'll leave the closing to you.

49
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,040
Dr. Ning,

50
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
thank you.

51
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,380
(Operating Room)

52
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,640
The surgery went well.

53
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,690
Don't worry.

54
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,610
Madam Liu is still in the recovery room.

55
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
Please wait here for a while.

56
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,080
Okay.

57
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,080

58
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,610
Thank you.

(Outpatient Building)

60
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,920
I want coffee out of a sudden.

61
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Ning.

62
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,610
You came too suddenly.

63
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,080
I didn't have time
to prepare it for you.

64
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,130
I know.

65
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,690
I was just testing you.

66
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,890
How about I go and buy one for you?

67
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,760
No need to go through the trouble.

68
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,080
I only said it casually.

69
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,450
Why did you change your mind

70
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,800
and perform this surgery?

71
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Wasn't it you who deliberately planned
everything to make me do it?

72
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
Are you someone who would yield

73
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,290
even when people force you?

74
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,080
You can

75
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,170
take this back.

76
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,640
No need.

77
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,730
You can keep it.

78
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,680
I've already made a copy.

79
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,850
I'm curious.

80
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,290
I went to school
to look for it many times.

81
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,440
But I couldn't find it.

82
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,490
How did you find it?

83
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,290
When there's a will, there's a way.

84
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,730
You even used my mom for Madam Liu.

85
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,880
I think it wasn't necessary.

86
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,410
I'd do it if it's necessary.

87
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,290
I don't need your opinion.

88
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,490
Who's driving?

89
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,170
Since you asked,

90
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,610
I'm sure you want me to drive.

91
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,370
You're tired from the surgery.

92
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,520
I don't think it's right.

93
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,080
I'd drive if I wanted to.

94
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
I don't need your opinion.

95
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,520
I'll keep this.

96
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,520
Thanks.

97
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,520
I don't need to open
the door for you, right?

98
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,760
You've done well, Mr. Ning.

101
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,320
Did I fall asleep just now?

102
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,610
Yeah, for a while.

103
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,680
You even snored.

104
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Impossible.

105
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,930
You did snore.

106
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,290
I never snored.

107
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,320
Don't I have

108
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
the right to speak
about you snoring in your sleep?

109
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,370
Say,

110
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,520
would Uncle Ning be happy

111
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,850
if he chose to remarry back then?

112
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
It'll be hard.

113
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,880
It's easy to love each other.

114
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,290
It'll be hard to live together.

115
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,970
Doctors in particular

116
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
are more difficult.

117
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,730
My dad's choice

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,290
is right

119
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,970
from his perspective.

120

Through this matter,

121
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,760
I now understand

122
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,490
why you chose not to remarry.

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,680
Ning Xiang is already asleep.

176
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,640
Your Aunt Liu is recovering pretty well.

177
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,850
She wants me to thank you.

178
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,610
I'll go home then.

179
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,640
Zhiqian.

180
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,120
When

181
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,970
I left you and your mom that day,

182
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,050
I knew you were crying
and chasing me from behind.

183
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,520
It's not that I didn't want
to look back.

184
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,850
I didn't dare to look back.

185
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,850
Why are you here?

186
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,530
I want to see Yaya.

187
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,920
Yaya is at my mother's place.

188
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,890
Please inform me in advance

189
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,200
if you want to see your daughter.

190
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Give me another chance.

191
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,770
Just one chance.

192
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,250
Give me one more chance.

193
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,560
What's the use of living

194
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,730
without you and a family?

195
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,970
Stop acting.

196
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,650
Give the knife to me.

197
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,650
I'm not acting.

198
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm being sincere.

199
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,610
Really?

200
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,730
I am. I...

201
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,800
Then I'll get you a cleaver.

202
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,280
But...

203
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,320
Enough.

204
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,770
Stop wasting your time here.

205
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,730
Go back now.

206
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,400
I came here...

207
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,130
Ya,

208
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,610
you had a long day at work.

209
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,400
I'll help you cook.

210
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,370
You can get some rest.

211
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,200
I'll cook for you.

212
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,650
What are you doing?

213
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,650
Don't touch me.

214
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,440
What are you doing?

215
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,200
Put the knife away!

216
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,770
Let her go.

217
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,800
Let go of my wife.

218
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I said, drop the knife!

219
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
I said, let go of my wife!

220
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,320
Stop it!

221
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,970
Jiang Cheng,

222
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,890
we're

223
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
already over.

224
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,730
But to Yaya,

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,650
you've always been a good father.

226
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,180
(Beiya Hospital)

227
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,920
Mr. Ning,

228
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,370
this is the content
I organized yesterday.

229
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,970
Are you sure
about sitting position surgery?

230
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,530
This case

231
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,560
shows the advantage
of sitting position surgery.

232
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,130
Did deep vein thrombosis
and postural hypotension

233
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,040
come across your mind?

234
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,890
You're trying

235
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,800
to have it published in SCI.

236
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,650
Everything must be meticulous
at the highest level.

237
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,560
During the craniotomy,

238
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,850
avoid exposing the torcular.

239
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,400
I'll make a slight improvement for you,

240
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,530
and you can refer to it.

241
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,800
It's 1.5...

242
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,370
Hold this.

243
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,970
Mark the torcular's position.

244
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,440
Don't laugh.

245
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,490
It's ticklish.

246
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,040
Hurry.

247
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,010
Good.

248
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,650
We need to open

249
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,370
the central line by 1.5cm
to avoid exposing the torcular.

250
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,850
Lateralized reduction of the angle

251
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,490
may reduce the damage
to the sinus venous

252
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,010
and air embolism.

253
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,920
Understand?

254
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,080
Yes.

255
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,010
You should wash your hair more often.

256
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,130
What happened to your neck?

257
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,970
Did you go for a scrapping treatment?

258
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,010
Mr. Ning drew a road map for me.

259
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,530
Snap a photo of it for me.

260
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,320
Why did he draw the road map here?

261
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,440
You don't say.

262
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,280
Mr. Ning's way of teaching

263
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
sure is original.

264
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,160
I need to take one for myself

265
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,530
and study it properly.

266
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
I'll share it in the group chat.

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,890
So everyone can study it

268
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,680
and share it.

269
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,080
All right.

270
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,250
Snap it quickly.

271
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
After that, help me wipe it off.

272
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,010
Okay, I'm done.

273
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,250
I need to do my rounds later.

274
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,200
I have tissue here.

275
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,040
I will help you wipe it off.

276
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,530
It's ticklish.

277
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,890
It's not coming off.

278
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,490
Do you think he regretted it?

279
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,890
About what?

280
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,560
For not remarrying you.

281
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,650
I don't think so.

282
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,250
A bystander is usually more objective.

283
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,850
I think

284
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,850
he still can't forget you.

285
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:43,970
All clean.

286
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,370
It's too late to regret now.

287
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm not going to say yes.

288
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,730
I'm leaving now.

289
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,680
Bye.

290
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,560
Of all places,
you had to rent this place.

291
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,800
It's not even a good location.

292
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,530
The entrance is even facing barren land.

293
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,160
It won't be convenient
for Yaya to go to school.

294
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,610
I think it's okay.

295
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,160
It's not as bad as you say.

296
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,080
It is bad.

297
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,610
He came looking for you
to reconcile the other day.

298
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,680
I'm sure he's up to no good.

299
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,850
I know.

300
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,610
Why did you let him stay
at the house then?

301
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,920
You sure have a big heart.

302
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,610
You saw what he did that day.

303
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,560
He'd put up an act
every two to three days.

304
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,200
I need to study for my exam.

305
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,650
It's better to move out
for my peace of mind.

306
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,800
Don't tell your sister this.

307
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
She's already busy with her thesis.

308
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,400
I don't want her to worry about me.

309
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,010
She wouldn't let you move here
if she knew.

310
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,040
I wouldn't either.

311
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,530
I've finally found it.

312
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,440
These are

313
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,730
all the precious notes I took

314
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,530
back at the university.

315
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,970
What's this?

316
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,040
You looked like this
when I first met you.

317
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,490
A captain in school.

318
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,280
When I first met you,

319
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,890
you were just a little kid.

320
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,040
Short and greedy for food.

321
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
You only reached my shoulder.

322
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,650
But it's the other way around now.

323
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,200
See how tall I am now?

324
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,250
Look at you.

325
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,920
You're shorter than me now.

326
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,160
Don't press down my head!

327
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,610
It wasn't easy to grow as tall as 1.65m.

328
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,850
You're making me shorter
if you press it down.

329
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,320
Help me take care of that.

330
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,200
Hey, this one.

331
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm confiscating it.

332
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,850
Brat.

333
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,130
Books.

334
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,040
Okay.

335
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,940
(Police)

336
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,660
(Outpatient)

337
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,180
(Police)

338
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,890
This patient is a criminal suspect.

339
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,530
He's currently being detained
at the detention center.

340
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,650
He developed dizziness, headaches,

341
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,040
and projectile vomiting
while in custody.

342
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,200
After he was diagnosed,

343
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,250
they found a brain tumor.

344
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,080
It's likely to be life-threatening

345
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,250
because of the tumor's location.

346
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,890
So we need to perform the surgery
as soon as possible.

347
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,610
All personnel of Neurosurgery Ward 3

348
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,400
was ordered to give full cooperation

349
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,320
to complete this surgery
without problems.

350
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,040
The patient is currently being placed
in a special ward.

351
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
There will be a dedicated police force

352
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,650
to work with us.

353
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,800
All we need to do

354
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,160
is to arrange our roles

355
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,280
and prepare for the surgery.

356
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,250
Mr. Ning,

357
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,850
I need you to sign this.

358
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,560
Have you read my thesis?

359
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,320
Yes.

360
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,490
There are still some minor problems.

361
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,610
But I've left my comments.

362
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,610
You can take the rest this weekend.

363
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,730
Great.

364
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,730
Ning Xiang wants me to ask you

365
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,970
if you're free.

366
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,530
He's leaving in a few days.

367
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,320
Didn't you just approve my off days?

368
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,440
I asked just in case you're busy.

369
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,770
Maybe you have a date or something.

370
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,850
If you're busy,

371
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,160
you don't have to force yourself.

372
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,730
I've already promised Ning Xiang.

373
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,850
Cheng,

374
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,560
have you decided

375
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,730
if you want to join my research group?

376
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,490
Dr. Qian,

377
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,800
I never really touched

378
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,650
on the research topic before.

379
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,680
I guess...

380
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,250
It's okay.

381
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,650
Several days ago,
Bai said he wanted to join.

382
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,250
I mean.

383
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,010
I wanted to say

384
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,730
I can try.

385
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,370
You may have not really touched on it.
But you're a fast learner.

386
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,850
I've always thought highly of you.

387
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,440
Welcome to the research group.

388
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,250
If you follow me,

389
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,080
I'll give you a lot of opportunities.

390
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,770
Get back to work.

391
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,650
What did Dr. Qian tell you?

392
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,250
Nothing much.

393
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,160
I saw you hold his hands.

394
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,160
Both of you were tugging at each other.

395
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,610
I wasn't holding his hands.

396
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,040
He was the one who held my hands.

397
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
Why would he do that?

398
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,650
He held my hands because...

399
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,920
Well, he wasn't really doing it.

400
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,200
He was thanking me

401
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,130
for yesterday's surgery.

402
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,850
You're so nosy.

403
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,370
Dad,

404
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,650
Mom is taking me out tomorrow.

405
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,130
Why don't you come along?

406
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,320
She said she's taking you, not me.

407
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,890
Then I'll ask if she's taking you.

408
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,770
Don't ask. I'm not going.

409
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,770
You guys can go ahead.

410
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,560
Then I'll ask Xue Weilin to join us.

411
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,560
Come.

412
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,280
Mom!

413
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,370
Where are you taking me today?

414
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,280
I'll take you out for something yummy.

415
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,080
Come.

416
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,650
Dad, come with us.

417
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,080
I'm not going. You guys can go ahead.

418
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,770
Xue Weilin!

419
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,250
Ning Xiang, do you miss me?

420
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,010
Yes.

421
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,250
Why are you here?

422
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,970
I called him.

423
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,490
Ning Xiang called me last night.

424
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,530
We promised to go out today.

425
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,530
I'll buy anything you want to eat.

426
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,920
- I want corn.
- Let's go.

427
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,280
Let's go.

428
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,200
Okay.

429
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,650
No problem.

430
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,680
Mr. Xue is buying?

431
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll mooch him off since I'm hungry now.

432
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,970
Why do you want to mooch him off?

433
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,680
Get in.

434
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,850
Why do you care?

435
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,890
Mr. Xue,

436
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,970
what food are you planning
to buy for our family of three?

437
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,440
What do you want to eat?

438
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,650
I want a hamburger,

439
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,440
potatoes, and corn.

440
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,730
Can you finish them?

441
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:52,680
Okay.

442
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,490
- I'll take you to have some.
- Of course, I can.

443
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,010
Walk properly.

444
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
Ning Xiang, are you hungry?

445
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,440
Yes.

446
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,160
There are many yummy foods
and many things to play with

447
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,530
at this restaurant.

448
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,920
Hello.

449
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,080
Mister, Ma'am.

450
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,370
We've just launched a new set meal.

451
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,080
Please take a look.

452
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,800
Okay, we'll take a look at it later.

453
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,440
- A table for three, right?
- Mom. Dad.

454
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,280
You can sit here.

455
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,130
Let's sit over there.

456
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,010
- Okay.
- A table for four.

457
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm sorry, mister.

458
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,730
Please take a seat.

459
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,650
Liuzheng, sit.

460
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,160
Okay.

461
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,010
Give it to me.

462
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,280
Let's hang your sweater.

463
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,250
Can you give me the menu?

464
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,610
Okay.

465
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,400
Ning Xiang, what do you want to order?

466
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,530
Chicken wings,

467
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,130
corn,

468
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,130
and prawn.

469
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,320
Okay.

470
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,370
Chicken wings,

471
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,280
and lemonade.

472
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,250
It's my treat today.

473
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,200
Just order anything you want.

474
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,400
You're buying?

475
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,560
Son, what do you want to eat?

476
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,730
I'll order for you.

477
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,400
Chicken wings and corn.

478
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,560
Two servings.

479
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:01,890
Okay.

480
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,560
Let's play a game.

481
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,250
Lemonade.

482
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,080
What do you want to eat?

483
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,650
Well, let me see the menu
to order what to eat.

484
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Stir-fried shredded potato with vinegar.

485
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,280
She'll have one.

486
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:13,970
Okay.

487
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,200
Add more vinegar.
[*Vinegar: rhymes with jealousy]

488
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,010
Okay, no problem.

489
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
What game are you guys playing?

490
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,160
Look at this one.

491
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,920
Chicken chop.

492
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,890
Ning Xiang, stop playing with the phone.

493
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,730
It's bad for your eyesight.

494
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,610
This one too.

495
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
I'll have this one.

496
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,770
Ning Xiang, look at me.

497
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,130
Ning Xiang, your dad said
to stop playing.

498
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,920
Dad is so mean.

499
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,280
He said you're mean.

500
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Ning Xiang,

501
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,080
how about we go and play the slide?

502
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,920
Okay.

503
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,560
Let's go.

504
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,800
Be careful.

505
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,490
Mom, come and play with us.

506
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,890
Okay.

507
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,680
Okay, Mom is joining us.

508
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,680
This salmon.

509
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,010
Okay.

510
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,320
And another bowl of noodles.

511
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,890
That's all.

512
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,680
Thank you.

513
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,530
Please wait while we prepare your food.

514
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,770
Look at Mom!

515
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,890
Catch it.

516
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,680
Okay, get down.

517
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,650
Ride this.

518
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,890
Come here.

519
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,010
Snap a picture.

520
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,650
Come.

521
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,040
Come, Ning Xiang.

522
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,490
Come here.

523
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,130
Come over here.

524
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:25,890
Come.

525
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,130
Let's play with this, okay?

526
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,680
Come. Okay, jump.

527
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,080
You wanted to take pictures, right?

528
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,560
Do you want to take pictures with me?

529
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,280
Yes.

530
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,010
Dad,

531
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,650
take a photo of the three of us.

532
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,160
Yeah, snap a photo of the three of us.

533
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
Look at the camera.

534
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,490
That's right. Smile.

535
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,920
Make sure it's a big smile.

536
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,680
Smile.

537
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,200
That's it.

538
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm still taking pictures.

539
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,970
Mr. Xue sure looks handsome.

540
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,320
Perfect.

541
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,160
Come in.

542
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,440
Look how much better this place is.

543
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,250
It's near your workplace

544
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,850
and even closer to Yaya's school.

545
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,200
That doesn't mean
you can take the liberty

546
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,320
to cancel the tenancy.

547
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,560
I have to pay liquidated damages.

548
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,040
I've already paid them

549
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,920
and the rental for this place too.

550
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,200
Just stay here.

551
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,920
It has a huge kitchen.

552
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,850
It comes with a steam oven

553
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,610
and other electrical appliances.

554
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,440
Do you like the balcony?

555
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,440
The rent can't be so cheap

556
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,400
for a place like this.

557
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,080
This is my friend's house.

558
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,560
They just finished the renovation.

559
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,680
But they went overseas.

560
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,530
They won't be back in a short time,

561
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,850
but they were unwilling
to rent it to strangers.

562
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,370
So they said they'll rent it to us

563
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,250
and make some money from rent.

564
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,440
So we're paying less.

565
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:17,770
Really?

566
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,560
Yes.

567
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Who's that friend of yours?

568
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,440
I don't feel comfortable about this.

569
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,010
We can't take advantage of them.

570
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,490
How is this taking advantage?

571
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,680
Both parties are benefiting
from this deal.

572
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,610
Two baths,

573
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,850
a kitchen,

574
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,970
and master bedroom.

575
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,850
Oh, yeah.

576
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,040
Look at this.

577
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,400
Kid's room.

578
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,650
Yaya will surely like it.

579
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,610
Yaya can paint here.

580
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,130
What do you think?

581
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,970
Do you think

582
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:10,920
this place is okay?

583
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,840
If you have any concerns,

584
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,840
I'll talk to my friends again.

585
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,400
I

586
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,970
can ask them

587
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,970
to increase the rent.

588
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,120
That'd do.

589
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,290
I'll take this place.

590
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,010
I'll pay you for the money you've paid.

591
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,090
No rush.

592
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,250
Why do you keep talking about money?

593
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,120
Did the money fall from the sky for you?

594
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,770
You work graveyard shift hours
all the time

595
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,970
to earn that money.

596
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,090
If you don't agree,

597
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,250
I won't rent this place.

598
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,600
Just move in for now.

599
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,530
We'll talk about this later.

600
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,810
It's a deal, so you must take the money.

601
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,250
Okay, fine.

602
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,360
So

603
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,090
don't waste time
and move in here with Yaya.

604
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:52,810
Okay?

605
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,920
Thank you, Ruan Lang.

606
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,490
Stop thanking me.

607
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,010
You need to thank
that friend of yours for me.

608
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
Tell him I'll take good care

609
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,770
of his house.

610
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,680
Let's check out the study room.

611
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,400
Okay.

612
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,730
Don't forget your water bottle.

613
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,250
Water bottle.

614
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,730
Bye, Ning Xiang.

615
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,970
Bye!

616
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,840
Okay, watch your head.

617
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,530
- Bye!
- Bye!

618
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,330
I'll send you home.

619
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,810
I need to go to the hospital
to pick up the medical case studies.

620
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,250
Then I'll send you to the hospital.

621
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,330
Bye.

622
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,600
Dad,

623
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,440
can you win Mom back?

624
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,400
We'll go and catch her back.

625
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,640
I feel a sense of vocation

626
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,970
for doing the night shift today.

627
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,200
Are you scared?

628
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,120
Don't be afraid.

629
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,880
I'll be here.

630
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm not afraid.

631
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,360
Besides, it's just one prisoner.

632
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,840
The police officers are here.

633
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
But I heard

634
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,880
this prisoner was on the run
for many years.

635
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,490
They caught him when he was
at the pharmacy to buy medicine

636
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,490
for his headache.

637
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,680
He's involved in several homicide cases.

638
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:40,970
Hello.

639
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:41,840
Hello,

640
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,680
Sir.

641
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,810
Come.

642
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,570
Sir,

643
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,010
we need to give him an infusion.

644
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,330
Okay.

645
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,330
Li Jianqiang,

646
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,810
they need to give you an infusion.

647
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,920
You better behave and stay still.

648
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,730
You can start now.

649
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:21,840
Li Jianqiang,

650
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,010
I'm the doctor in charge of your case.

651
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,200
A few of your test results
are still pending.

652
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,290
Once all the results are available,
we can schedule the surgery.

653
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,360
Sir,

654
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,330
the infusion will take
around 40 minutes to finish.

655
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,050
We'll come back after it's finished.

656
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,050
Okay.

657
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,640
There is nothing else for us to do
at the moment.

658
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay.

659
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,440
Look how scared you were.

660
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,290
What a scaredy-cat.

661
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,120
It's really scary to see it up close.

662
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,330
What are you afraid of
when I'm here with you?

663
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,920
Can you protect me?

664
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,330
Okay.

665
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,200
(Outpatient)

666
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,400
I'll head up to pick up some things.

667
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,250
You should go back first.

668
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
I'll go with you.

669
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,600
I'll send you back home later.

670
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,730
(Fifth Floor)
Wait.

671
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,120
I left my phone in the toilet
on the first floor.

672
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,250
I'll go and get it. Wait here.

673
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:53,920
I'll be back quickly.

674
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,730
I'll be here right away.

675
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,160
Hello.

676
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,880
The infusion is almost finished.

677
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,050
I need to go in and check.

678
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,730
Okay.

679
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,010
Open the door.

680
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:15,970
Drop the weapon!

681
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,570
Don't come any closer!

682
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,970
What are you doing here
at this late hour, Dr. Ruan?

683
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,920
I'm here to check the medical record.

684
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,090
Then Mr. Xue is here for...

685
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,250
I'm accompanying Liuzheng.

686
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,330
Accompany Liuzheng?

687
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,360
That's good.

688
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,160
I'll go and accompany Dr. Ding
for the night shift.

689
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:31,730
Take a step back!

690
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,680
Don't move!

691
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,680
Drop the weapon!

692
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,600
Back away, all of you!

693
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:35,920
Step back!

694
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,530
Calm down!

695
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:39,840
Stay still!

696
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,600
Put down the weapon!

697
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
All of you back off!

698
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,120
Ding Yiyuan, are you okay?

699
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,600
If you come any closer, I'll kill her!

700
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,530
Drop the weapon!

701
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,920
Ding Yiyuan!

702
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,090
Step back!

703
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,360
- Step closer, or she'll die!
- Ding Yiyuan!

704
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,330
Back off!

705
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,290
Everyone, calm down.

706
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,770
Please calm down.

707
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,440
You have a tumor in your brain.

708
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,050
If the rumor ruptures,
it'll cause bleeding in your brain.

709
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:58,970
It's life-threatening.

710
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,970
Put the scissors down first.

711
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,920
Stop wasting my time with your nonsense!

712
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,600
Step back!

713
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,160
Okay.

714
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,090
Let's talk it out calmly.

715
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,360
Let her go first.

716
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,120
Step back!

717
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,440
Remain calm.

718
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,530
Stay calm.

719
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:07,880
Take a step back!

720
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,400
Don't do anything hasty.

721
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,050
Step back!

722
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,090
Don't make a move!

723
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,160
Ding Yiyuan!

724
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,880
Liuzheng!

725
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,530
Don't move!

726
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,330
Stay still!

727
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,940
(Operating Room)

728
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,680
Everyone can hear you shouting.

729
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,160
A grown man shouldn't make a fuss
over a flesh injury.

730
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,050
Why did you throw yourself
on the criminal?

731
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,090
Are you trying to show off?

732
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,400
I wasn't trying to show off.

733
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,250
I acted

734
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,400
on instinct.

735
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,360
You can only use it

736
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,050
to deal with me.

737
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,770
Next time, don't try
to take on other criminals.

738
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,680
You're too weak.

739
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,360
His kick almost broke my rib.

740
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,120
Does it hurt?

741
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,570
Why don't I take you
to the Orthopedic Department

742
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,330
for a CT scan later?

743
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,600
Lest you lose your kidneys.

744
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,570
That's not necessary.

745
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,640
Since I've met you,

746
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,290
I always run to the orthopedics.

747
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,090
All done.

748
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,330
Cheng Zhouyu.

749
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,120
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

750
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,880
Enough.

751
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,970
This is the only time

752
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,530
I've been brave in my life.

753
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,090
Ouch! Be gentle.

754
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,140
(During The Operation)

755
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,920
Dr. Ruan,

756
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,360
are you nervous
about operating on the criminal

757
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,160
who attacked you last night?

758
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,490
I'm okay.

759
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,400
Are you sure?

760
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,400
