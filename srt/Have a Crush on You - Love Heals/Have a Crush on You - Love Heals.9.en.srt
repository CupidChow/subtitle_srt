=Episode 9=

3
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,680
She's just using work as an excuse.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,400
But actually,

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
she's just trying
to spend more time with you.

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,890
No. What nonsense

7
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,170
are you talking about?

8
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,640
You

9
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,090
think too much.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
I think too much?

11
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
Why should I?

12
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,920
What is it? Are you jealous?

13
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,450
Why should I be jealous?

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
But Ning Xiang

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
has already thought of me as his mother.

16
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,170
What if I go on a blind date after this?

17
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,130
How can I explain to my date

18
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,000
that I have a son?

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,640
You want to go on a blind date?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,850
Of course.

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,760
Why can't I go on a blind date?

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,610
Okay. If you go on a blind date,

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,450
I can explain the situation to them.

24
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,000
So, if I go on a blind date,

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,250
I have to introduce

26
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,560
my ex-husband to my date?

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,890
Should I bring you along?

28
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,760
What do you want then?

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
If you want to go on a blind date,

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,120
I can help you explain
the situation to them.

31
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,250
Let's not talk about that.

32
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,640
That's not the point.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
What's the point then?

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,970
The point is,

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,640
he calls me mom

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,360
every day now.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,890
He wants me to eat with him

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,920
and play with him

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,560
every week.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
What should I do?

41
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,450
That's your fault,

42
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,200
right?

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
My fault?

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,970
It was because

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,560
you brought me

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,530
to his Parent-child Sports Meet.

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,610
During the acceptance speech that day,

48
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,200
I wanted to clear up
the situation for you.

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,970
But you took away the microphone

50
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,640
and told everyone

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,890
that you were his mother.

52
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,250
He was standing right there.

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,170
I couldn't make it awkward for him.

54
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,610
What should we do then?

55
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
You can wake him up,

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,360
tell him

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,410
that you are not his mother,
and apologise to him then.

58
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,640
Dad, Mom.

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,360
Are you fighting?

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,170
We are not fighting.

61
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,690
Why are you out here like this?

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Go back to your room to sleep.

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,530
No.

64
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you doing?

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
I want to sleep here.

66
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,810
You are a big boy now.

67
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,890
You have to be independent, okay?

68
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,250
Get up.

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:07,810
Why do you want

70
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,840
to sleep here
when you have your own room?

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,740
He'll catch a cold if you do this.

72
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,640
Just let him sleep here for once.

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,810
Pull up the blanket.

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,330
Mom.

75
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,690
Can you not leave today?

76
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,200
Stay with me.

77
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,920
I can't do that today.

78
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,760
If you can't do it today,
how about tomorrow?

79
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,330
She can't do it today or tomorrow.

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
Sleep now.

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
You still have to go to school tomorrow.

82
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,360
Hurry up.

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
- What are you doing? It's so cold.
- Stop this.

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,050
Go to sleep right now.

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,250
Okay now.

86
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,280
I'll stay with you here

87
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,450
until you fall asleep, okay?

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,810
Can you sleep now?

89
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,530
Dad.

90
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,200
Come and sleep with me too.

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Why should I?

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,090
You have your mom, right?

93
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,560
Dad!

94
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,200
No, you...

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,890
What are you doing so late at night?

96
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,690
Sleep now.

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,560
I never get

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,640
to sleep together

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,410
with you and mom.

100
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,690
Hurry up.

101
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,700
Hurry up.

102
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,820
He still has to go to school tomorrow.

103
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,090
- Stop being stubborn.
- You'll catch a cold.

104
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,040
So naughty.

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,570
Can you sleep now?

106
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,480
- Here.
- Yes.

107
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
You'll catch a cold.

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,640
Great.

109
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,810
Finally, my dad and mom

110
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,290
are sleeping together with me.

111
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Hurry up and go to sleep.

112
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,570
Mom.

113
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,090
I want to listen to a song.

114
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,920
What song do you want?

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,730
I want to listen
to "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".

116
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,530
Can you change to another song?

117
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,920
I want to listen to this one.

118
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,410

Dad, sing the song for me too.

121
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,360
You know how to sing it, right?

122
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,880
Close your eyes and sleep now.

123
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,970
Then, I'll sing.

124
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,160
Sing first and I'll sleep.

125
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,810

You must be missing
your girlfriend very much.

175
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,320
Actually, it's my wife.

176
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Your wife?

177
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,640
Yes.

178
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,410
Well. She's the lucky one.

179
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,530
Alright. Good luck.

180
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,490
See you.

181
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,540
(Beiya Hospital)

182
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,100
(Operating Room)

183
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,730
Ruan Liuzheng.

184
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,170
What happened to you?

185
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,120
You've improved.

186
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,090
You went through surgery alone.

187
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,120
That day, I saw a post online

188
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,240
saying that going through surgery alone

189
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
is the highest level of a loner.

190
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,970
I never thought
that I would experience it myself.

191
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,370
Am I dead to you?

192
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,760
You could've called me.

193
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
You are always busy.

194
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
It's quicker to call an ambulance.

195
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,970
Have you told Ning Zhiqian about it?

196
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
I called him.

197
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,930
But he didn't pick up.

198
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,880
He must be busy.

199
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
An appendectomy
is not a major surgery anyway.

200
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,370
Yes.

201
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,050
It's not a major surgery.

202
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,610
But you should still tell him about it

203
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,170
so that he can comfort you.

204
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,410
Even if I tell him about it,

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,880
he can't do anything to help.

206
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,050
I'll just distract him.

207
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,200
Are you sure

208
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,850
you know

209
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,320
how to be a woman?

210
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,760
As a woman,

211
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,240
you need to ask for attention
when you are supposed to.

212
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,880
A woman who knows how to do that
will have the best life.

213
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,490
Why are you acting tough?

214
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,420
You don't have

215
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,760
to carry all the burdens by yourself.

216
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,240
How about this?

217
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,610
If you miss him,

218
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,090
I'll call him

219
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,530
and ask him to come back
to take care of you.

220
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,440
Do you know?

221
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,170
How others see your marriage

222
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,100
is different

223
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
from how you see it.

224
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,640
By the way,

225
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,730
how is it with you and Jiang Cheng?

226
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,970
When are you going to get married?

227
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,370
Soon.

228
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,880
We plan

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,440
to have a kid right after
we get married.

230
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,610
We want to settle everything in one go.

231
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,490
Tan Ya, I need a hand.

232
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,200
Okay. I'll be there soon.

233
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Go now.

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,370
I'll go to work first.
I'll visit you later.

235
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,490
Here. Eat this.

236
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,530
Is it sweet?

237
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,370
Yes.

238
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,410
Let me cut more for you then.

239
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,530
Okay.

240
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,090
You should eat some too.

241
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,920
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

242
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,770
You've slimmed down lately.

243
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,800
You too.

244
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm fine.

245
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,650
I can get fatter rather easily.

246
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,040
It's good, right?

247
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,680
Yes.

248
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,160
Hello.

249
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,520
Are you okay?

250
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,770
I'm fine.

251
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,400
You didn't pick up
when I called you in the last few days.

252
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you okay?

253
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,010
Maybe I didn't hear it

254
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,920
because I was asleep.

255
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,800
And I didn't call you back

256
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,040
because you might be busy.

257
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,280
Take care of yourself.

258
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,280
You have to take the postgraduate
entrance examination soon.

259
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,370
Remember to have
a work-life balance, okay?

260
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,970
Okay.

261
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,090
If you are bored at home alone,

262
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,130
you can visit your parents
for a few days.

263
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,090
Okay.

264
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,650
I can't talk to you any longer.

265
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,680
I have a class later.

266
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,490
Bye.

267
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,250
Eat it slowly.

268
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,610
Is it good?

269
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,680
Yes.

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,800
The doctor says
that you have to eat more fruits.

271
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,320
It'll be good for your condition.

272
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,400
Here, wipe your mouth.

273
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,560
Do you want to drink some water?

274
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,090
No.

275
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,490
Take another bite.

276
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,820
(2019 Jiangzhou, China)

277
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,250
You are awake.

278
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,730
How did I fall asleep here last night?

279
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,200
You were putting the kid to sleep.

280
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,490
Then, you fell asleep yourself.

281
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,010
Why didn't you wake me up?

282
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,890
I tried.

283
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,650
You didn't wake up.

284
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,130
Where's Ning Xiang?

285
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
He's in the toilet.

286
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,730
Last night, you...

287
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,490
Last night,

288
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,890
I slept together with you.

289
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,610
I slept on the sofa.

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,800
This is bad.

291
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,370
I didn't tell my family about this.

292
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,010
I already called them for you.

293
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
What did you tell them?

294
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,130
I told them the truth.

295
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,370
You told them that I slept here?

296
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,370
What else should I say?

297
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,130
Mr. Ning.

298
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,770
Next time, can you do your best

299
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,400
to wake me up?

300
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,130
Okay. Next time.

301
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,770
Next time, I'll wake you up.

302
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,370
No.

303
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,040
No next time.

304
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,010
This will be the last time.

305
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,920
No. You...

306
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
Are you going to get up or not?

307
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,370
Yes.

308
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,850
I've gotten a toothbrush for you.

309
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,610
It's new.

310
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,780
(Beiya Hospital)

311
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,400
Ding Yiyuan's car is here.

312
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,890
Do you want to get off first
or do I get off first?

313
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,680
Anything.

314
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,650
I'll get going now.

315
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,200
Ruan Liuzheng?

316
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,130
Why did you come
in Mr. Ning's car again?

317
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,680
I ran into Dr. Ruan on my way here.

318
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,770
So, I gave her a ride.

319
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,010
Where did you run into her?

320
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,200
- At the entrance.
- At the subway.

321
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
Can you synchronise your answers?

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,320
Where did you run into each other?

323
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,520
I haven't finished talking yet.

324
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,200
We met at the entrance of the subway.

325
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,440
Let's go. It's time to work.

326
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,490
No, Ruan Liuzheng.

327
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,370
Ruan Liuzheng, you wore

328
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,610
this outfit yesterday, right?

329
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,920
Yes.

330
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,400
I remember that you wore this

331
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
yesterday.

332
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,320
Really?

333
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,130
Ruan Liuzheng, don't tell me that you...

334
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,650
You think too much.

335
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,650
Definitely not.

336
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,890
I haven't say anything yet.
Why did you say "definitely not"?

337
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm sure it's a yes.

338
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,420
(Nurse Station)

339
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,890
Last night, Huang Qian from
the Department of Internal Medicine

340
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,440
called to thank me profusely.

341
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
She's very satisfied with Ning Zhiqian.

342
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,010
I was worried about
how to tell you this.

343
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,970
But looks like you've made your move.

344
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,440
It's really not what you think it is.

345
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,650
I just took care of Ning Xiang
for him for two days.

346
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,850
- Really?
- Head Nurse.

347
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,890
Madam Cai's son
and daughter-in-law are here.

348
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,400
Finally, they are here.

349
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,200
Come. Let's go and take a look.

350
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,520
Mom.

351
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,440
Let's go back.

352
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,490
What are you doing?

353
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,200
Taking my mother home.

354
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,680
With Madam Cai's condition now,

355
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,730
she can't leave the hospital.

356
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,730
The result of her vital signs

357
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,650
will be out soon.

358
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,970
Then, she'll be ready for the surgery.

359
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,490
We are not going to let her
go under the knife.

360
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,280
If she doesn't undergo the surgery,

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,920
she can't

362
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
restore her eyesight.

363
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,970
And she'll have

364
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,280
more serious complications
in the future.

365
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,560
Listen to me.

366
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,040
- Doctors are good at creating fear.
- Deputy Manager Ning.

367
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,520
I think you better come.

368
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,250
Come.

369
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,490
- There's a situation in ward 8.
- Let me ask you.

370
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,010
Will my mom recover

371
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,680
after the surgery?

372
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,090
We can't promise that.

373
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,250
But we'll do our best.

374
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,520
You can't promise
that it'll be a success.

375
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,490
But you still want us to spend
so much money on the surgery.

376
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,320
Isn't this fraud?

377
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,440
Mom, let's go.

378
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,090
You are not young.

379
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,440
You can't handle something
as serious as craniotomy.

380
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,730
Let's go back and treat it at home.

381
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,040
Madam Cai has stayed
in the hospital for two weeks, right?

382
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
If I remember correctly,

383
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,770
this is my second time seeing you.

384
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,370
She can't see clearly.

385
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
As her son and daughter-in-law,

386
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,560
shouldn't you take care of her

387
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,520
and care for her?

388
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,320
The commission

389
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
for surgery is very high, right?

390
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,730
Enough.

391
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,130
We don't want to stay
in this hospital anymore.

392
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,680
Madam Cai.

393
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,130
You really can't leave the hospital now.

394
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,730
- Head Nurse, what is it?
- Madam Cai.

395
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,370
Let's go home.

396
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,520
The patient's family
insists on discharging her.

397
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,610
But Dr. Ruan disagrees.

398
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,490
Are you sure you want to leave?

399
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,250
Come. Let's go.

400
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,490
Sure.

401
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,920
But you need to settle the fees first.

402
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,090
I'll give you the discharge form.

403
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,490
Mr. Ning.

404
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,610
With Madam Cai's condition now,
she can't be discharged.

405
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,770
The patient has the final say
in this matter.

406
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,040
It's not for you to decide.

407
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,010
Mom, take off your shirt.

408
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,010
Please go

409
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,040
and settle the bills then.

410
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,250
Come, Madam Cai.

411
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,320
Listen to me.

412
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,400
Lie down.

413
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,440
Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.

414
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,040
Come.

415
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,800
Be careful.

416
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,320
Hurry up.

417
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,490
Have you heard that a fight
almost happened

418
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,370
in this ward?

419
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,280
Yes.

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,490
Let me tell you.

421
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,160
When you run into this kind
of situation, keep quiet.

422
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,010
Especially for a family like that.

423
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,730
Stay away from them as far as possible.

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Understand?

425
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,490
Yes.

426
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,490
Mr. Qian, good morning.

427
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,730
If you can't run away, come to me.

428
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,370
Don't be afraid.

429
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,650
Okay, Mr. Qian.

430
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,730
We are a team.

431
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,680
Don't be shy with me.

432
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,200
After you, Mr. Qian.

433
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,040
Ding!

434
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,140
(2013 Jiangzhou, China)

435
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,780
(Ning Zhiqian's 13th Month in America)

436
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,970
(Dear.)

437
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,400
(Why didn't you reply to me?)

438
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,180
(Switch Off)

439
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,700
(My Husband's Return)

440
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,610
(I know)

441
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,280
(that Zhiqian is a good man.)

442
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,850
But Liuzheng,

443
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,560
you are not bad too.

444
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,400
A perfect love

445
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,890
is where you love each other

446
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,400
deeply and equally.

447
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,650
Hello.

448
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,610
Please book a flight ticket for me.

449
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,090
Yes. As soon as possible.

450
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,010
Hello?

451
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,200
I want to go and find you.

452
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,250
You want to come and find me?

453
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,770
I want to go to America to find you.

454
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,280
I'll be going back in a week.

455
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,800
Yes. Then, we can come back

456
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,730
together.

457
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,320
You've been studying for your
postgraduate entrance exam, right?

458
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,610
I don't want you to be too tired.

459
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:44,890
Besides,

460
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,520
I'm preparing for an assessment lately.

461
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,280
Even if you come,

462
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,130
I won't have the time to accompany you.

463
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,850
- But we haven't seen...
- I have a class soon.

464
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,800
I have to hang up.

465
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,210
Hello.

466
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,460
Where are you?

467
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm in the laboratory.

468
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,200
Why are you up so early?

469
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,490
Take a guess.

470
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,970
Are you busy today?

471
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm waiting for the result
of the assessment.

472
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,440
I think I'll be busy
in the next few days.

473
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,730
What's wrong?

474
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,970
Actually, I...

475
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,280
Hello?

476
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,680
Hello?

477
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,890
This place's signal is not good.

478
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,130
Attention, everybody.

479
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,650
Hello.

480
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,970
The assessment's results have come out.

481
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,320
And you all passed.

482
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,370
Thank you.

483
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,440
Why don't we all go out and celebrate?

484
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,610

Perfect.

552

Hello, Tan Ya.

553
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,400
Has Liuzheng reached America already?

554
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,520
She didn't call me back.

555
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm a little bit worried about her.

556
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,130
Liuzheng?

557
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,010
Yes.

558
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,970
Her flight was two days ago.

559
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,130
She should have been there already.

560
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,560
(Happy Graduation, dear.)

561
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,480

565
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,210
Liuzheng.

566
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,930
Are you okay?

567
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:14,960
Stop worrying.

568
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
I can't do it anymore.

569
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,170
I have to put her down.

570
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,040
I can't carry her anymore.

571
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,170
Come. Hurry up.

572
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,650
We have to put her down.

573
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,090
Hold her.

574
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,090
Mom.

575
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,320
Mom, be careful.

576
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,510
- Mom.
- Mom.

577
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,370
Mom, wake up.

578
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,000
Mom.

579
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,690
Mom.

580
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,720
She has lost her consciousness again.

581
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,610
How about we carry her back?

582
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,850
Are you kidding me?

583
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,410
How can I carry her
all the way up there?

584
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,850
We can't take her back.

585
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,130
What if something happens to her?

586
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,170
Let's call the doctor then.

587
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,450
Are you crazy?

588
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,560
Why should you?

589
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,320
Okay.

590
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,720
We'll leave first.

591
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,130
Nothing will happen to her

592
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,890
in the hospital.

593
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,000
If something happens,
they'll have to save her.

594
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Are you sure this will work?

595
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,370
Do you want to save her or not?

596
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,930
If you want to save her, do as I say.

597
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,410
Let's go and call the doctor.

598
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,450
Come on.

599
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,210
Hurry up.

600
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,480
Nurse.

601
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,130
What is it?

602
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,130
Nurse.

603
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,170
I think there's an unconscious old lady
over there.

604
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,370
Old lady? Where is she?

605
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,720
At the stairwell.

606
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,930
The stairwell?

607
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,960
Let's go.

608
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,720
Where did they find her?

609
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,800
A nurse from the Emergency Department

610
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,130
found her at the stairwell
of the third floor.

611
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,930
Why was she there?

612
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,930
Not sure.

613
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,520
We still can't reach her family.

614
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Get her ready for surgery at once.

615
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,450
I'll try to contact

616
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,480
her family again.

617
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,130
Don't waste your time.

618
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,130
They've planned this all along.

619
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,140
Get the signature from Deputy Manager.

620
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,280
- We'll do the surgery first.
- Okay.

621
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,890
Okay.

622
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,370
I really pity Madam Cai

623
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,210
for having a son like him.

624
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,520
Don't worry, Madam Cai.

625
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,450
I'll make sure to clean

626
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,850
the tumor in your brain well.

627
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,820
(2013 Jiangzhou, China)

628
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,240
You came all the way here to pick me up.

629
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,800
You must have gotten up pretty early.

630
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:55,890
When you left,

631
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,960
I didn't get to send you off.

632
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,560
So, I'm making up for it now.

633
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,650
Besides,

634
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,130
picking someone up

635
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
is not as sad as sending someone off.

636
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,690
You haven't eaten anything, right?

637
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,040
Let's go and eat something.

638
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,130
Let's go to
the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

639
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,650
The Ministry of Civil Affairs?

640
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,930
Let's file for a divorce.

641
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,610
I've brought everything that we need.

642
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,480
Can I explain?

643
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,210
I really didn't know
that you went to America.

644
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,170
It wasn't your fault.

645
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,210
And I didn't go there for nothing.

646
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,410
I've thought it through.

647
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,930
Do you know

648
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,450
why I was late

649
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,170
during our wedding?

650
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,890
I went to find Dong.

651
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,240
I told her

652
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,210
that we would be happy

653
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,610
and I would make you
fall in love with me.

654
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,320
I hope

655
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,930
that I'll be able to find someone

656
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,210
