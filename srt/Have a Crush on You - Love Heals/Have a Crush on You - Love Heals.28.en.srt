=Episode 28=

3
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,370
What is his blood pressure like?

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
All is normal.

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,280
I'm measuring his body temperature.

6
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,560
Let me do it. Go back to your work.

7
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,690
All right, Dr. Ruan.

8
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,520
Give me the lid.

9
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
Liuzheng.

10
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,410
I'm dying.

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,010
Keep me company, will you?

12
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,690
I have many things to tell you.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,130
Oh, geez.

14
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,090
I was just

15
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,920
about to buy you some BBQ skewers

16
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,250
and several bottles of beer.

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,400
I guess you can't have them now.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,450
You're going to order BBQ skewers?

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Order some lamb kidneys for me.

20
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,330
- BBQ skewers can't help you recover.
- The liver is just right further in.

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,330
You get all excited when BBQ skewers
are brought up.

22
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,840
I don't want to starve.

23
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,560
What's the situation now?

24
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,250
Easy.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
All is well.

26
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,680
Although he lost a lot of blood,

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,890
it happened in the hospital

28
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,840
so we treated him right in time.

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
Just convalesce here.

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,760
He's young.
He'll make a speedy recovery.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,400
Doctor.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,530
I feel languish.

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,610
You're not going to recover
in an instant.

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,970
It's a process.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,170
Is his body temperature looking good?

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,610
Let me have a look.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,920
36.6.

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,730
Normal.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,760
Good.

40
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,640
Rest well now.

41
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,530
Thanks, Dr. Chen.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,890
No need to thank me.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,120
He is the hero

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,760
of our hospital.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,730
Take good care of him.

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
I count on you.

47
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,330
Oh, I bought you

48
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,610
some toothpicks and straws.

49
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,200
I'll place them in the drawer.

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,760
Okay.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,730
You can cut the fruit
into smaller chunks

52
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,400
before eating them with a toothpick.

53
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,480
Mr. Xue.

54
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,920
Your injury isn't serious.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
You will be discharged after two days.

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,090
Open your mouth.

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,890
Is it too hot?

58
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,010
On behalf of Beiya Hospital

59
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,010
Neurosurgery Department's

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,970
staff members,

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I would like to express

62
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,120
my gratitude

63
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,330
to you.

64
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,840
Thank god you were there.

65
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,250
It wasn't that noble anyway.

66
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,760
I just wanted to save Liuzheng.

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Just rest now.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,760
You lost too much blood.

69
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,280
Don't speak too much.

70
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,760
It hurts here.

71
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,120
Let me see.

72
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,890
It's swollen.

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,970
Mr. Ning, get me an ice pack.

74
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,560
The dosage is too much.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,730
Do you feel better now?

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,170
Much better.

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
- Mr. and Mrs. Xue.
- Liuzheng.

78
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,080
Have a seat.

79
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,770
Okay.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
How are you, Weilin?

81
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,050
Are you all right?

82
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,650
I'm fine.

83
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,120
Are you in pain?

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,730
No.

85
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,450
But where?

86
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,080
Where is the wound?

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,330
They stitched it up.

88
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,280
I was worried sick.

89
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,930
Xue.

90
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,890
Are you okay?

91
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,730
I'm all good, Mr. Ruan.

92
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,770
Don't worry.

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,840
Liuzheng, are you hurt then?

94
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,050
Not at all, Mrs. Xue.

95
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,610
Mr. Xue was quick to react

96
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,490
and he saved me.

97
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,330
Good.

98
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,170
He's a big man.

99
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,360
What good do all those muscles do

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,960
if he can't even protect you?

101
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,240
Xue, you did a great job

102
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,490
raising your son.

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,010
Mr. Xue,

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
please accept this bouquet

105
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
on my family's behalf.

106
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,010
I'm not dead yet.

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,170
Right.

108
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,120
You dummy.

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,450
You should put it in a vase.

110
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll go find one.

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,050
Give it to Liuzheng.

112
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,560
Xue.

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,330
You intervened in time.

114
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,770
Otherwise...

115
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't need to thank me.

116
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,560
For all we know, we might become
a family soon.

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Thanks.

118
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,050
That's right.

119
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,490
Indeed.

120
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,240
Yes.

121
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't move your hand.

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Liuzheng is pampering you here.

123
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,650
Are you an actor now?

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,170
Your legs aren't wounded.

125
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,330
No need to stagger like that.

126
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,010
Wow.

127
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,650
Your words

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,120
healed me.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
My words can make you stop

130
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,080
feeling pain now?

131
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
What am I? Your pain receptor?

132
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,280
Maybe.

133
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Feeling better?

134
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,330
Careful.

135
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,730
Okay.

136
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,560
Dr. Ruan.

137
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,120
Ms. Tan is looking for you.

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,330
I'll go to her later.

139
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,680
Go now.

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
What about me?

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,330
You have me.

142
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,450
You?

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,210
Yes.

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Mr. Xue is our hero.

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,210
I have to thank him

146
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,050
on Beiya Hospital's behalf.

147
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,170
What an honor

148
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,930
to have Deputy Manager Ning
attend to me personally.

149
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,450
It's my duty.

150
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,960
Go now. Ms. Tan seems urgent.

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Careful now.

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,050
Steady.

153
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,210
Liuzheng, come back when you're done.

154
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,330
Okay.

155
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,730
Ouch.

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,170
No need to act all vulnerable.

157
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,280
Sit.

158
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,360
I can't

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,770
lift my leg.

160
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,960
Let me help you.

161
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,800
Come.

162
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,400
I feel cold.

163
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,080
Warm now?

164
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,890
You're

165
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,890
suffocating me here.

166
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:57,960
It's too stuffy.

167
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,330
I'm thirsty.

168
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,650
Thirsty?

169
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,010
Have a banana.

170
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,330
Liuzheng just fed me a banana.

171
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,650
I want water.

172
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,610
I can't reach it.

173
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,400
How am I supposed to drink like this?

174
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,360
You're trying to burn my tongue here.

175
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,280
Last afternoon, he said

176
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
he was nauseous and he vomited.

177
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,240
You might need to check on him.

178
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,280
Okay. I'll give him

179
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,170
a stronger dose.

180
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,560
Okay.

181
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,770
Should I arrange a CT scan

182
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,360
for him tomorrow afternoon?

183
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,210
Can do.

184
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,210
Mr. Ning said you were looking for me?

185
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,450
No, not at all.

186
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,560
Just leave a reminder here.

187
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,650
Okay.

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,650
Look, he's tired.

189
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,400
Yes, leave a reminder.

190
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,930
Go back to sleep.

191
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,660
Mr. Ding.

192
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,860
- Mr. Ding.
- Mr. Ding.

193
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,530
Dr. Ruan.

194
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,210
I have a good news

195
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
for you.

196
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,560
Do tell.

197
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,600
We

198
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,410
had a special meeting.

199
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,890
Everyone agreed

200
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,920
to keep you here

201
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,090
in Beiya

202
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,650
once your secondment is over.

203
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,850
That's wonderful.

204
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,410
Yay!

205
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,090
Dr. Ruan.

206
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
We'll be colleagues from now on.

207
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,210
I appreciate it, Mr. Ding.

208
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
But I already gave my word
to President Wang

209
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,290
that I'll return
to West District Hospital.

210
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,330
I can talk to him personally.

211
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,290
But of course,

212
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,720
the decision is on you.

213
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,850
Come have dinner at my place tonight.

214
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,680
Thanks, Mr. Ding.

215
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,770
No, you should come
to my place instead.

216
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,970
My dad is a great cook.

217
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,800
My mom isn't home today

218
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,410
so we can...

219
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,160
Ding...

220
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,160
Dad?

221
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,770
Ding... Ding...

222
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,560
Ding, ding, ding.

223
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,850
Dong, dong, dong?

224
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,010
Dad, why are you here today?

225
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm here to discuss with Dr. Ruan

226
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,970
about her tenure.

227
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,450
Oh, congratulations, Dr. Ruan.

228
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,330
Thank you.

229
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,160
I should leave you be.

230
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,530
I should go now.

231
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,240
Go to my place for dinner tonight.

232
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
What are you cooking tonight?

233
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,890
President Ding, safe travels.

234
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,970
Go to his place for dinner?

235
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,600
His place?

236
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,560
You guys are that close?

237
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,360
Hush.

238
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,120
Hush.

239
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Dr. Ning.

240
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,360
What time is it now?

241
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,240
12:30 PM.

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,850
Liuzheng told me

243
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,770
I should have fruit

244
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,290
at this time.

245
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
I just fed you a banana.

246
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,010
You refused it.

247
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,330
I want an apple.

248
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,450
I just had a banana.

249
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,800
Dr. Ning.

250
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,480
Aren't you busy?

251
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,290
I just came out of an operation.

252
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,890
It's my break now.

253
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,800
You don't peel apples?

254
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,530
Apple skin is nutritious. Eat it.

255
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,410
Wait.

256
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,890
Can you peel it for me?

257
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,600
Hurry.

258
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,010
Don't swallow too fast.

259
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,010
Dr. Ning.

260
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,720
Liuzheng can take care of me, you know?

261
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,450
This must be tiring.

262
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,970
I can't do this to you.

263
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,530
Don't push it too far.

264
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,650
Hurry up.

265
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,330
This is payback, isn't it?

266
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,240
Ask Liuzheng to come here.

267
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
Listen.

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,680
Ruan Liuzheng is a doctor. Not a nurse.

269
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,800
Are you jealous?

270
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,360
We are competing fair and square here.

271
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,600
I like that you hate to see me

272
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
but you can't do anything about it.

273
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,770
We're on the same starting line.

274
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,090
If you want to impress her too,

275
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,120
we'll see who can reach
the finishing line first.

276
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,890
If you don't plan to impress her,

277
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,330
make way, please.

278
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
You have made a swift recovery.

279
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
You can be discharged in a few days.

280
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,560
Yes.

281
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,330
I'm about to be discharged.

282
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,970
But Liuzheng's secondment
is about to be over too.

283
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,650
And she will leave Beiya.

284
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,680
Hello?

285
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
Hi, Mr. Fan.

286
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,040
Don't worry.

287
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,360
It's just a small injury.

288
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,800
I'll be back in a few days.

289
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes,

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,010
I've been looking

291
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,800
at

292
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,210
your case every day.

293
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,650
Don't worry.

294
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,210
The hearing will not be delayed.

295
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,010
Okay.

296
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,330
All right, Mr. Fan.

297
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,360
Bye.

298
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,090
Have you filled out the form I gave you?

299
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,090
Yes.

300
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
How many patients
will be discharged today?

301
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,160
Bed 6, 9,

302
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,920
11, and 14.

303
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,920
Do you think my face can be fixed?

304
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,090
It's hard to say.

305
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,040
It depends on your recovery.

306
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,410
Bed 7 will begin a liquid diet
from now on.

307
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Go back to your work now.

308
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,090
Okay.

309
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,120
I will get going.

310
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,060
(Nurse Station)

311
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,650
You scared me.

312
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,850
When did you come?

313
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,650
I just came.

314
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
You are very focused.

315
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,040
You.

316
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,560
Go out.

317
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,290
Stand right there.

318
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,210
This is my work desk.

319
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,090
You can't come in.

320
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,600
I...

321
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,290
I was just looking.

322
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,650
Why did you come to the hospital?

323
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,410
I miss you.

324
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,120
Stop joking around.

325
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,120
No one heard it anyway.

326
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,720
Stupid brat.

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,800
My friend's

328
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,560
father

329
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,530
is in the neurosurgery ward.

330
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,600
What's his family name?

331
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,560
Liao.

332
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,650
Found him. He came this morning.

333
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,530
Please take good care of him.

334
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,210
In the neurosurgery department, we

335
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,010
take good care of every patient.

336
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,530
The dedication.

337
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,160
Don't just stand there.

338
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,290
Go home.

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
You

340
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,920
look beautiful today.

341
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,680
Brat.

342
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,210
Go away.

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,680
Bye.

344
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,010
Liuzheng.

345
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
You're finally here.

346
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,040
Take him away.

347
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
He's torturing me.

348
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,560
When I said I was thirsty,

349
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,600
he burned my tongue with hot water.

350
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,920
When I said I wanted an apple,

351
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,920
he pointed the knife at me.

352
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,890
Look, he's asleep now.

353
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,040
Who's taking care

354
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,920
of who now?

355
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,770
Talking bad behind someone's back?

356
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,680
I heard everything.

357
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,360
Mr. Ning.

358
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
Go back to eat and sleep.

359
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,560
Get some rest.

360
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,120
I can take care of him.

361
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,600
Liuzheng is the best.

362
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Even my parents don't care about me.

363
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,040
They just entrusted me

364
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,210
into your hands.

365
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,800
Dr. Ruan, how is your thesis doing?

366
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm still working on it.

367
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,770
Don't you have
several operations tomorrow?

368
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,210
You should get ready.

369
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,770
I'll get you some water.

370
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,240
You should hire a caregiver.

371
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,920
What's going on?

372
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,210
Headache.

373
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,530
What are you doing?

374
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,770
Is he burning up?

375
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,970
Maybe.

376
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,410
He's fine.

377
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,770
Headache, is it?

378
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,850
You were sucking your teeth.

379
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,890
It hurts on both sides?

380
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,240
Yes.

381
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,210
- Don't worry about it.
- My head is splitting.

382
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,290
Come.

383
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,680
Rest here.

384
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,890
Are you burning up? Let me take
your temperature.

385
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,240
What burning up?

386
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
Do I have a fever?

387
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,360
Not at all.

388
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,010
Come. Let me massage your head.

389
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,010
Relax.

390
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,800
- Be gentle.
- Be gentle.

391
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,920
I can't believe this.

392
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,850
Relax.

393
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,410
Relax your neck too.

394
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,680
Mr. Xue.

395
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,120
You should really hire a caregiver.

396
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,680
You can't just order

397
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,920
Dr. Ruan around every day.

398
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,970
I don't know any caregivers.

399
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,770
And if I have to go
to the toilet at night,

400
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,850
it'll be awkward.

401
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,850
So it isn't awkward

402
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,290
with Dr. Ruan?

403
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,410
We're close.

404
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,680
Very close.

405
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,290
Do you feel better now?

406
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,530
Ning.

407
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,290
Mr. Ning.

408
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,170
I have been looking for you.

409
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,650
You didn't pick up my call.

410
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,170
I knew I could find you here.

411
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,410
Do you have time?

412
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,810
I want to tell you something.

413
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,770
Go.

414
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,810
I'm busy.

415
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,840
Your duty calls.

416
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,720
I have to massage your skull.

417
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,570
You're in pain.

418
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,240
You're not busy.

419
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,530
Dr. Ruan is here.

420
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,360
It's important.

421
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,290
Go.

422
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,440
It's lunchtime now.

423
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,240
I'll wait for you in the cafeteria.

424
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,890
We'll speak while we eat.

425
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,720
Go.

426
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,530
Go attend to it.

427
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,600
Wait for me, Mr. Xue.

428
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,290
I'll give you a massage.

429
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,480
Want some?

430
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,200
No, thanks.

431
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Liuzheng.

432
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,810
How are you going to repay me

433
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,050
for the assistance I provided you?

434
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,080
What are you on about?

435
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,720
Just brace yourself.

436
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,530
He's green with jealousy now.

437
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,770
Ning.

438
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,240
We haven't talked in a while.

439
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,930
Manager Liu.

440
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,010
What do you want to tell me?

441
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,410
After this yogurt drink,
I have to go back to work.

442
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,120
You and your attitude.

443
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,890
I came with good news.

444
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,010
What good news?

445
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,410
Upon careful consideration,

446
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,600
the higher-up decides to give

447
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,050
Dr. Ruan a spot

448
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,290
here.

449
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,840
That's great news.

450
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
Thanks, Manager Liu.

451
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,320
It's so hard to get a thank you

452
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
from you.

453
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,170
However, don't thank me.

454
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,480
Dr. Ruan got the spot

455
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,240
all on her own.

456
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,840
Indeed. She deserves it.

457
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,840
Do consume in moderation.

458
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,960
See you.

459
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,810
Mr. Ning.

460
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,440
You're back.

461
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,290
Let's review the operation we'll perform

462
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,240
tomorrow.

463
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay.

464
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
Open the analysis report.

465
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
Okay.

466
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Dr. Ning.

467
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,720
Is Dr. Ning here?

468
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,600
It's me.

469
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,840
Hi, Dr. Ning.

470
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm Liao.

471
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,930
Ruan Lang is my friend.

472
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,360
I told you earlier

473
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,530
that the father of Ruan Lang's friend

474
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,840
would be operated by us.

475
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,930
Liao? The patient from Bed 12 then.

476
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,690
That's right.

477
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,770
That's my dad.

478
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,600
Are you free now?

479
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,010
Let's grab dinner together.

480
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,720
No need.

481
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,890
We have an operation tomorrow.

482
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,530
Oh, you see.

483
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,320
These are the local specialty
of my hometown.

484
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,360
It's nothing.

485
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,410
Please accept it.

486
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,410
We can't take it.

487
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
You...

488
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
Please take it back. We are forbidden
to accept gifts.

489
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,050
Take it back.

490
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Okay.

491
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,050
Then

492
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
after the operation,

493
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,530
I'll buy you all a meal.

494
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,440
No need for that too.

495
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,600
This is the staff office.

496
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,410
Not everyone is allowed in.

497
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,650
Perhaps you can go home first?

498
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,530
Just go back.

499
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,810
All right then.

500
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,890
I'll count on you two.

501
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,530
See you.

502
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,170
Let's hang out again next time.

503
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,010
Next time!

504
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,440
Ruan Lang has weird friends.

505
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,050
Here.

506
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,170
Here.

507
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,690
What are you doing after work?

508
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,530
I'll go home.

509
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,930
Done. Here's the file.

510
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,960
Hello?

511
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,200
All right. I'm coming over.

512
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,050
What's wrong?

513
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,440
I need to head to the neurosurgery ward.

514
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,240
Xue Weilin needs me.

515
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,240
Tell me. Are all lawyers

516
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,770
like thugs?

517
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,290
That's a sweeping generalization.

518
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,530
You are talking
about a specific person here.

519
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes.

520
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,930
Don't push yourself too far.

521
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,200
Your hands might be shaky
during the operation.

522
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,890
He

523
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,770
plays dirty.

524
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,410
He uses dirty tricks.

525
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,080
I'm not surprised.

526
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,320
We do plot and scheme

527
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,720
in our line of work.

528
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,690
Oh, come on.

529
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,170
He shouldn't use those tricks

530
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
on Liuzheng.

531
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,690
Speaking of which,

532
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,410
even though we grew up together,

533
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,480
I

534
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,200
have to defend Xue here.

535
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,410
I know

536
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,600
he used to flirt around.

537
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,650
But this time,

538
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,810
he's in love for real.

539
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,200
What makes you think that?

540
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,690
Because he risked his life
to save Liuzheng.

541
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,050
Whatever.

542
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,840
I have warned you.

543
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,360
They are getting back together.

544
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,960
Three words.

545
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,240
Serve you right.

546
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,410
Enough.

547
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,360
Serve me right?

548
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,170
You can

549
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,170
still give it a shot.

550
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,480
After all,
they haven't registered it yet

551
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,360
and you are not the lover boy.

552
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:25,930
Don't glare at me.

553
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
I'm just telling the truth.

554
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,890
You are the lover boy.

555
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,690
What's wrong with you?

556
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,650
I have a question for you.

557
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,650
Do you

558
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,290
want Liuzheng back?

559
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,120
Yes.

560
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,890
What?

561
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,120
Why are you staring at me?

562
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm surprised.

563
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,650
I have known you throughout my life

564
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,650
and you have never
been this determined before.

565
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,530
She is supposed to be my wife.

566
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,650
How are you going to woo her?

567
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,440
We're going back this soon?

568
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,650
Mommy Liuzheng.

569
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,080
I haven't even played chess
with Grandpa.

570
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,890
I'll ask him to teach you next time.

571
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,720
All right?

572
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,010
I want to have Grandma's dumplings too.

573
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,720
All right. I promise.

574
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,530
Next time, I'll ask

575
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,080
her to make dumplings for you.

576
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,720
It's a deal.

577
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,650
Pinky promise.

578
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,290
Whoever tells a lie

579
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,810
will sink to a bad place.

580
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,360
Daddy.

581
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,720
I need to tell you something.

582
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
You have to make sure you do it.

583
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,810
What?

584
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,720
Don't make me worry about you again.

585
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,120
Okay.

586
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,050
The adults always

587
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,650
make me worry.

588
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
You're just nosy.

589
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,650
I won't make you worry again.

590
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,930
If Daddy is misbehaving,

591
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,120
you call me.

592
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,650
Okay.

593
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,530
If you miss me,

594
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,600
you call me.

595
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,080
Mister, can you wait for a while?

596
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,700
Okay.

597
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,960
Mommy!

598
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,770
My baby!

599
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,050
Thanks.

600
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,050
Daddy bought many things for me.

601
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,840
Did you thank him then?

602
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,010
I did.

603
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,840
Good.

604
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,170
Thanks.

605
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
No worries.

606
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm so lucky.

607
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,200
I have two mommies.

608
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,170
Good.

609
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,930
Sure.

610
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
All right.

611
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
We have to go now.

612
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
Come.

613
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,930
Say goodbye to Mommy Liuzheng.

614
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,170
Bye, Mommy Liuzheng.

615
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,320
Hop in. Careful.

616
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,840
Watch your head.

617
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,890
Don't forget the dates of his follow-up.

618
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,690
He's getting naughtier now.

619
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,650
Make sure he doesn't bruise himself.

620
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,690
Okay.

621
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
We'll leave then.

622
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,840
Bye, Ning Xiang.

623
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

624
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,120
Bye, Daddy, Mommy Liuzheng.

625
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,080
Bye.

626
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,570
Call me when you're home.

627
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,840
Bye.

628
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,570
I should go now.

629
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,200
Let me give you a ride.

630
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,010
No need.

631
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,720
Yes, Liang?

632
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,120
(When are you paying the rent?)

633
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,290
Soon.

634
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,810
(Stop it.)

635
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,200
(Don't "soon" me.)

636
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,840
(I found out already.)

637
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,410
(God knows what happened to you.)

638
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,930
(You'll have three days.)

639
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,650
(If you don't pay the rent
within three days,)

640
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,360
(I'll take the apartment back.)

641
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,050
(All right?)

642
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,960
- I told you I...
- (Well, I'll hang up.)

643
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,120
Hello?

644
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,530
Hi, Director Hu.

645
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,890
I'm Ruan Lang.

646
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,080
Yes.

647
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,320
So I just want to know

648
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,320
if we are shooting the TV series
anytime soon?

649
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,010
When are we signing the contract?

650
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,890
(What contract?)

651
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,480
(That TV series has been shelved.)

652
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,890
It has?

653
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,690
Then, I...

654
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,050
(I'm busy. Talk to you later.)

655
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,120
Liuzheng.

656
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:05,650
What's the matter?

657
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,480
I made breakfast for you.

658
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,410
I don't have time. You can have it.

659
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,320
Drink the milk, at least.

660
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,840
What's the matter?

661
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,010
Remember my friend called Liao Jie?

662
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,010
Why?

663
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,080
His dad will have surgery
in your hospital today.

664
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,120
So?

665
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,810
Please take care of him.

666
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,240
Sure.

667
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,240
Liuzheng.

668
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,650
I mean is it possible to let Zhiqian

669
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,120
operate on him?

670
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,240
That, I'm not so sure.

671
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,930
It depends on the arrangement.

672
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,360
Also, if I'm

673
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
not mistaken, Mr. Liao's surgery

674
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,240
isn't a tough one.

675
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,320
Anyone can handle it.

676
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,770
Liuzheng.

677
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,290
Please take care of him.

678
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes, I know.

679
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,220
(Beiya Hospital)

680
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,360
Lights out.

681
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,650
What are you doing?

682
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,960
Lights out.

683
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,170
Go to sleep.

684
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,320
Who are you?

685
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,480
The doctor in charge of you.

686
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,290
My name is Ai Fei.

687
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,960
I have never seen you before.

688
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,890
You're new here?

689
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,720
Stop looking at your phone.

690
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,080
Why can't I look at my phone?

691
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,890
It's not allowed.

692
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,960
What are you doing?

693
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,290
Go to sleep.

694
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,240
What on earth...

695
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,930
Why so many candles?

696
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,890
Very well-decorated too.

697
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,810
Someone's birthday?

698
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,810
Is it your birthday?

699
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,170
No.

700
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:50,930
It isn't mine today.

701
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,890
Who did this?

702
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,200
I wonder who.

703
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,410
You're back.

704
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,410
Depute Manager Ning.

705
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,600
Who made the mess here?

706
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,240
It's very disrespectful.

707
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,410
It must be Dr. Ding.

708
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,720
As you know, women like
romantic stunts like this.

709
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,010
Yes, it must be Dr. Ding.

710
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,720
Let's tidy it up.

711
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,200
Tidy it up.

712
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,320
You decorated this?

713
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,480
Deputy Manager Ning.

714
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,410
What did we do wrong this time?

715
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,960
Just tell us already.

716
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,240
Deputy Manager Ning,

717
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
this romantic stunt...

718
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,530
I'm feeling uneasy.

719
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,320
You're sending

720
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,770
chill down my spine.

721
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,600
Who said the neurology department can't

722
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,650
have something romantic after work?

723
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
You guys have been working very hard

724
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,890
so I bought you

725
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,440
some coffee

726
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,890
and cakes.

727
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,170
How sweet of you.

728
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,410
Dr. Ruan.

729
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,530
I see it now.

730
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,890
We are just the collaterals.

731
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,770
Collaterals.

732
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,720
Come. Let's go.

733
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,360
Jesus.

734
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,600
What about Tan Ya's?

735
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,960
You can have mine.

736
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,010
It's okay. I'm unimportant.

737
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,410
Unimportant.

738
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:43,690
Have a slice.

739
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,360
I can't take this.

740
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
Thanks, Deputy Manager Ning.

741
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,440
A party?

742
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,410
Come join us.

743
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,480
No, thanks.

744
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,530
Liuzheng.

745
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,290
Can I change to another ward?

746
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,650
Let me stay
under the neurosurgery department.

747
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,320
Our department

748
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,170
cannot meddle with affairs

749
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,170
from another department.

750
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,530
You have to help me this time.

751
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,480
I need to move out today.

752
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,600
I will file a complaint
against that female doctor.

753
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
She violated my privacy

754
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,290
and seized my property illegally.

755
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Who?

756
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
The doctor in charge of you?

757
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,320
Ai Fei.

758
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,240
Dr. Ai Fei?

759
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,170
I know her.

760
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,440
I'll talk to her.

761
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,770
Can you?

762
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,650
She's unreasonable.

763
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,010
Unreasonable?

764
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,890
If I'm mad,

765
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,170
I'll even expel her.

766
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,570
Who is expelling me?

767
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,360
Do you want some?

768
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,650
Patient from Bed 14.

769
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,080
Thanks.

770
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,290
Two options.

771
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,080
Option A. You come with me.

772
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,530
Option B. You go back yourself.

773
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,930
Liuzheng.

774
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,530
Help me out.

775
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,320
This is coercion, I tell you.

776
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,050
I can sue you.

777
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,600
Sorry, Dr. Ning.

778
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,960
You don't want to have some?

779
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,600
See you, Dr. Ai.

780
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
Dr. Ai is hot

781
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,200
but she's too tall.

782
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,690
I don't like that.

783
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,840
Dr. Ruan.

784
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,360
Come.

785
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,410
Sit here, Dr. Ruan.

786
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,810
This is unusual, coming from you.

787
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,440
Try this.

788
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,360
- Let's scoot.
- Let's go.

789
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,810
Let me try.

790
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,530
Not bad, isn't it?

791
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,570
Quite good.

792
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,240
Come.

793
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,570
Hurry.

794
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,200
Is it delicious?

795
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,240
How is the apartment
Ruan Lang found you?

796
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,240
Seeing that both you and Yaya
have a roof above your head

797
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,240
sure puts my mind to rest.

798
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,410
It's quite good.

799
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,530
It's all thanks to Ruan Lang.

800
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,570
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to focus on my exam to earn

801
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,290
the qualification to be
the chief nursing officer.

802
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,170
He did something good for once.

803
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,530
Miss, your cryotherapy facial treatment

804
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,240
is over.

805
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,080
You can now rest here.

806
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,440
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

807
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
Are you satisfied?

808
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,200
Let me have a look at my face.

809
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,570
You know,

810
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,810
Ms. Pei told you
to get some facial treatment.

811
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,360
You don't need to drag me along.

812
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,690
I quite like it though.

813
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,650
I noticed that Ning Zhiqian
has changed a lot.

814
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,200
I was so done

815
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,650
with you two

816
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,320
because I've been talking about it
for many years.

817
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,320
But I have a question for you

818
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,960
and I need an answer.

819
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,320
You two love each other.

820
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,720
So why are you two always hesitant
about taking the leap of faith?

821
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,890
Answer me.

822
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,010
Tell me then.

823
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,170
How can a good doctor

824
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,480
balance work and family together?

825
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,720
Now that's a complicated question.

826
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,170
I don't have an answer.

827
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
I've been thinking a lot too.

828
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,170
Why did my marriage

829
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,720
become a joke?

830
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,360
Is it that hard for people

831
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,290
who work in the healthcare industry

832
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,690
to have a proper family?

833
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,650
I believe everyone has a weakness.

834
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,720
No one can remain invincible
all the time.

835
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,640
Doctors are humans too.

836
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,720
We have what it takes to do our job

837
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,610
so we also have what it takes
to build a proper family.

838
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,480
Do you like to hear that?

839
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,440
I do.

840
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,200
Tell me.

841
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,960
When can my father move his arms?

842
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,480
Did you find an intern

843
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,440
to treat him?

844
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,370
I understand your eagerness, mister.

845
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,720
I can assure you that our surgeons

846
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
are carefully selected by the hospital.

847
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,530
Don't give me that.

848
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,130
Just tell me.

849
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,570
How are my father's arms now?

850
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,960
They lost all their functions.

851
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,160
Your father's arms can regain

852
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,850
their functions via exercises.

853
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,400
This is very normal after surgery.

854
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,010
He just needs physiotherapy.

855
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,720
Calm down. Let me have a look.

856
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,810
Lift your left arm.

857
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,090
Okay.

858
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,200
Right arm?

859
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,570
Okay.

860
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,240
I agree with Ms. Tan here.

861
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,160
The recovery process
will take some time.

862
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,290
We will continue to observe.

863
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Wait. Don't you go.

864
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,400
Don't go.

865
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,810
No need to get violent.

866
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,920
- What are you doing?
- Come back.

867
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,810
- Stop dragging me.
- Don't go anywhere.

868
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,880
- Let me go first and we'll speak.
- You stay.

869
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,290
- Let go of him.
- Let go.

870
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,090
Let go.

871
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,680
Didn't we

872
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,010
agree that you

873
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,920
would operate on my father?

874
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,640
What is this then?

875
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,570
A medical accident?

876
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,130
Mind your language here.

877
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,810
One,

878
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,680
a medical accident can only

879
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,050
be determined
after a rigorous investigation.

880
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,010
Two,

881
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,920
the hospital decides
who operates on the patient.

882
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,200
We do not allow anyone to select

883
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,240
which surgeon they want here.

884
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,090
Also,

885
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,530
I have explained to you very clearly

886
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,720
that the recovery process
will take some time.

887
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,770
You can't leave.

888
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,610
Don't you play dumb before me.

889
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,530
What do you mean?

890
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,570
- You need to calm down now.
- Don't

891
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,050
give me all those excuses now.

892
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,720
Answer me now.

893
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,880
What is responsible for my father now?

894
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,680
Besides, Ning Zhiqian, you know

895
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,200
very well

896
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,160
what you did.

897
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,090
Deputy Manager Ning.

898
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,640
You have no idea, huh?

899
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,200
Don't you have a meeting?

900
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,920
Just go first.

901
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,920
Who do you think you are?

902
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,330
You're just a deputy manager.

903
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:56,680
Sir.

904
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,720
Ning Zhiqian, it's not over

905
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,680
between us.

906
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,530
Just you wait.

907
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,720
Please control your temper.

908
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,530
If you continue to yell,
I'll call security.

909
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,160
He didn't say why.

910
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
Time to do the rounds.

911
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:15,130
Okay.

912
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,850
That's not like him at all.

913
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,570
Okay.

914
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,160
Thanks.

915
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,530
I just received the news

916
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,610
that Ning was summoned to the
Management Office this morning.

917
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
Not sure why.

918
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,810
Where did he go again?

919
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,530
He was summoned
to the Management Office.

920
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,290
Someone said he received bribery.

921
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,370
Impossible.

922
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,880
That's ridiculous.

923
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,290
Anyone here could be bribed

924
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,130
but Mr. Ning? No way.

925
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,200
Who told you that?

926
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,400
My father.

927
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,920
Someone reported him,

928
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,330
saying that he received

929
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,680
a six-figure bribery.

930
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,810
Who reported him then?

931
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,810
I don't know.

932
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,090
He must be framed.

933
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,160
It must be that.

934
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,960
Let's stop guessing.

935
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,240
I'm sure the truth will reveal itself.

936
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,530
Ning Zhiqian is occupied.

937
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,680
Cheng Zhouyu,

938
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,370
do the rounds for him.

939
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,370
I'll have someone else

940
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,570
perform the operations for him too.

941
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,330
Go back to your work now.

942
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,480
It's no use gossiping.

943
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,770
Let's do the rounds first.

944
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,050
Everything will be all right.

945
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:24,220
(Beiya Hospital)

946
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,900
(Beiya Hospital)

947
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
What happened?

948
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,240
You knew?

949
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,850
What do you mean?

950
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,960
Did someone frame you?

951
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,160
If you have guessed it,

952
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,330
then you shouldn't worry about it.

953
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,370
Who reported you?

954
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,880
I don't know.

955
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,200
It was anonymous.

956
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,640
Is it serious?

957
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,850
Tell me the truth.

958
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,090
The truth is, it's fine.

959
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,640
You sure?

960
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,920
Yes.

961
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,480
I should go then.

962
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,140
(Beiya Hospital)

963
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,400
Why are you still here?

964
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
Want to come to my place instead?

965
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,610
Is it possible to not involve Liuzheng

966
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,810
in this case? I can handle it alone.

967
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
How?

968
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,720
Have you thought about the consequences?

969
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,920
One,

970
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,370
I did not take the money myself.

971
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,850
Two, that money has been returned.

972
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,920
It can be explained.

973
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,050
Yes, Ruan Lang took the bribery

974
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,400
so you weren't aware of it at all.

975
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
But there's no evidence saying

976
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,680
that you didn't collude with him either.

977
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,130
After all, you are also close to him
by extension.

978
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,240
That's why we can't involve

979
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Liuzheng in this.

980
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,570
The hospital still doesn't know

981
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,570
that they are siblings

982
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,770
so let's settle it now.

983
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,050
It's not as simple as that.

984
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,200
If we mishandle it

985
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,290
and blow it out of proportion,

986
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,400
your career

987
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,570
is done for.

988
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,010
I can always resign from Beiya.

989
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,010
But if this affects Liuzheng,
all her hard work

990
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,370
will have been for nothing.

991
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,130
Is Liuzheng aware of this?

992
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,050
No, not yet.

993
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,160
Don't tell her.

994
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,400
And when she learns of it, will she

995
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,720
agree to your action?

996
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,640
Everything will have
been solved by then.

997
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,480
It doesn't matter if she knows or not.

998
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,720
It's Liuzheng.

999
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,050
Don't tell her

1000
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,880
we're together.

1001
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,500
Okay.

1002
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,570
(Ruan Liuzheng)

1003
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,570
Yes, Liuzheng?

1004
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,530
Are you with Zhiqian now?

1005
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,130
No, why?

1006
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,010
Something happened to him.

1007
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,330
We'll speak later.

1008
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,370
Something bad?

1009
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,160
Calm down.

1010
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,240
Let me call him first.

1011
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,530
Okay. Noted.

1012
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,240
Bye.

1013
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,290
So? What did your father say?

1014
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,440
He won't tell me.

1015
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,200
Any news?

1016
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,850
I just called my dad.

1017
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,330
He said
the investigation is confidential

1018
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,160
and wouldn't tell me.

1019
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,610
There must be more to this debacle.

1020
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,570
Mr. Ning must have hidden
something from me.

1021
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,440
Liuzheng.

1022
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,370
Calm down.

1023
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,090
Hasn't he reassured you?

1024
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,960
We just have to wait
for the investigation result.

1025
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,680
Q... Qian.

1026
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,440
Running away from me?

1027
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,400
N... Not at all.

1028
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,880
I came to apologize to you.

1029
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:51,850
Sorry, Qian.

1030
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,240
You're a talented doctor

1031
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,480
so I thought

1032
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,160
nothing would go wrong.

1033
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,480
I took the money.

1034
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,640
But that Liao Jie...

1035
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,850
Just use me as your punching bag.

1036
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,050
I would love to.

1037
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,720
But not now.

1038
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,610
Are you and Liuzheng being punished
by the hospital now?

1039
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,770
She isn't aware of it.

1040
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,810
Liao Jie only reported me.

1041
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I have been suspended for the moment.

1042
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,850
What?

1043
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,130
This is my fault.

1044
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,400
I'll talk to the hospital.

1045
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,850
And what good will that do?

1046
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,610
Can you explain everything?

1047
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,530
Do you have evidence to back you up?

1048
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,720
You're just going to implicate Liuzheng
like this.

1049
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,050
I didn't know it could be this serious.

1050
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,200
I thought no one cares.

1051
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,440
Just punch me.

1052
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,610
I can't forgive myself.

1053
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,130
I'm not in the mood to punch you.

1054
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:40,400
Tell me.

1055
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,640
Why did you need that money?

1056
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,480
I am currently sub-letting
an apartment to Tan Ya.

1057
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,160
I signed a three-year tenancy agreement.

1058
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,370
Then I lied to her that it belonged
to my friend

1059
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,880
and let her live there for cheap rent.

1060
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,010
I then used the bribe money
to cover the rent margin.

1061
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,850
Wait.

1062
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,610
To whom do you sub-let the apartment?

1063
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,160
T... Tan Ya.

1064
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,240
I still have more than 10,000 yuan
in this account.

1065
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,720
I'll try to find the rest.

1066
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,130
Stop.

1067
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,770
We already gave Liao Jie his money back.

1068
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,850
Can you think before you act

1069
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,770
next time?

1070
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,130
Zhiqian.

1071
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,880
Zhiqian.

1072
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,010
Thank you.

1073
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,960
I will pay you back.

1074
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,240
Wait.

1075
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,640
One more thing.

1076
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,610
What?

1077
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,920
Please don't tell Tan Ya and Liuzheng.

1078
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
Why?

1079
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,400
What if Tan Ya doesn't want
to live here anymore?

1080
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,050
Wait.

1081
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,200
Why do you have to sub-let
an apartment to her?

1082
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,010
Why, you ask?

1083
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,570
Don't play dumb.
Or I'll call Liuzheng right away.

1084
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,400
Don't.

1085
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,090
I just want to prove to Tan Ya
that I'm a reliable man.

1086
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,720
But why?

1087
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,720
Because I like Tan Ya.

1088
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,720
What?

1089
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,640
I like Tan Ya.
