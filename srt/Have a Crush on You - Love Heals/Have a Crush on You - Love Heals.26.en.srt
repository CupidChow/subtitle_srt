00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 26=

3
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,110
I won't see you off then.

4
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,830
Close the door for me.

5
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,910
Then get some rest, Mr. Ning.

6
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,470
(You can be frank with me.)

7
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,830
(Can I recover?)

8
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,080
(You mean)

9
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,270
(my illness)

10
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,040
(is beyond hope?)

11
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Eat more greens.

12
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,110
It's good for your blood glucose level.

13
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,110
Have you taken your diabetic medication?

14
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,400
I forgot.

15
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,270
For heaven's sake,

16
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,110
you should've taken it before meals.

17
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,910
How can you forget?

18
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,520
It'll be useless to eat it
after your meal.

19
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
Why can't you remember?

20
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,150
Dear,

21
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
don't be mad, okay?

22
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,120
I'll definitely remember after this.

23
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
I'll take my medication on time.

24
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
Let's eat.

25
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,310
I'm not hungry.

26
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Eat more, okay?

27
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
What's wrong?

28
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,750
Nothing.

29
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,680
I'm fine.

30
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,190
My leg is a little numb.

31
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,000
The other day,

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,560
you went for a medical checkup.

33
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,310
Is it time to get the medical report?

34
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Not yet.

35
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,470
It'll only be ready after a week.

36
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,280
Didn't they say it'll be ready
in three days?

37
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,750
You remembered incorrectly.

38
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
I'll be okay.

39
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,310
I'll feel better
if I go rest inside for a bit.

40
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,150
Don't worry.

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,470
I'm fine.

42
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,470
Are you sure you'll be fine?

43
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,430
Where's the gastrodia elata
I bought for you the other day?

44
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll boil some water with it for you.

45
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,840
It's okay. I don't need it.

46
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,420
(Imaging File)

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,000
Right frontal lobe lesion.

48
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,400
Malignant tumor.

49
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,960
Xinran!

50
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,350
Come out here!

51
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,840
Isn't this your medical report?

52
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,400
How long do you plan
to keep this from me?

53
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,350
I never wanted to hide it from you.

54
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,590
I don't want you to worry.

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Listen.

56
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,840
You have to be in the hospital
for surgery.

57
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,150
I'm calling Zhiqian now.

58
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,430
Shouzheng,

59
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,750
don't call and give Zhiqian trouble.

60
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,430
He's my son.

61
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,280
Who else can I call about this matter?

62
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't call him.

63
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,120
Dear!

64
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
Are you feeling dizzy again?

65
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Come.

66
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Sit down.

67
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,310
I just blacked out for a moment.

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
The doctor
at West District Hospital said

69
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
my tumor

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
is aggressive

71
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,430
with a low chance of survival.

72
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,590
That's why

73
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,000
we need to turn to Zhiqian
for help even more.

74
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,430
We'll do the surgery.

75
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,240
Don't trouble Zhiqian.

76
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,000
He still hasn't forgiven you

77
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,590
because of me.

78
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,630
Why would you think that?

79
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,280
When his mom and I divorced,

80
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,630
we haven't even met.

81
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,560
I did hurt Zhiqian
because of the divorce.

82
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,030
But it has nothing
to do with you at all.

83
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,520
You chose

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,310
not to have a child because of him.

85
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,840
You're not wrong,
both logically and emotionally.

86
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,470
I must call him.

87
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,240
Shouzheng,

88
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,150
don't tell him.

89
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,030
I've made up my mind.

90
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,350
I don't want to treat it.

91
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,310
Let's just

92
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,750
take things naturally.

93
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,750
Xinran,

94
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,150
I've always listened to you.

95
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
But this time,

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,870
you must listen to me.

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,800
Please.

98
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,560
Come.

99
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,430
(Door's open.)

100
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,800
Thanks, Grandpa.

101
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,190
Dad, you're home.

102
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,790
See? Grandpa prepared

103
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,160
a lot of dishes for you.

104
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,310
I've already eaten at the cafeteria.

105
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,310
You can enjoy them yourself.

106
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,790
Here.

107
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,870
Take your time eating.

108
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,040
Ning Xiang,

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,630
tell me.

110
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,430
Do you like the dishes

111
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,630
I made for you?

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,790
Do you want the truth or a lie?

113
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,720
How about a lie first?

114
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,190
This food is absolutely amazing!

115
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,040
What about the truth?

116
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,040
I couldn't eat another bite

117
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,870
if I wanted to!

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Oh, then stop eating if you're stuffed.

119
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,520
You can go and play.

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,430
Okay.

121
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,430
Maybe

122
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,190
you can have some.

123
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,400
It's okay.

124
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm already full.

125
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,960
Why are you here today?

126
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,190
I was thinking

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,670
since Ning Xiang
hasn't been home for so long,

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
I'd drop by to visit.

129
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,190
I also have a favor

130
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,520
to ask of you too.

131
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,960
Can you help me

132
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,230
look at this CT film?

133
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,310
Whose CT film is this?

134
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,480
An old friend.

135
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,630
From the film,

136
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,310
there's more gray matter in the brain.

137
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
This is a woman's CT film.

138
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,280
Just tell me

139
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,110
what's the situation like.

140
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,160
Whose CT film is this?

141
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Your stepmom.

142
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,160
So is there hope?

143
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,400
The West District Hospital said

144
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,600
they couldn't do the surgery.

145
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
I thought

146
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,600
since you're

147
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,480
an influential neurosurgeon nationwide,

148
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,630
Zhiqian,

149
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I'm begging you.

150
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
Please help your stepmom.

151
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
I know

152
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,430
I've done you wrong in the past.

153
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,160
That's why I've never asked anything

154
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,160
from you all this while.

155
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,720
But now...

156
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,230
Zhiqian,

157
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,720
I'm begging you.

158
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,600
Please save Xinran.

159
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,430
I thought you came

160
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,870
because you missed your grandson.

161
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,520
I though you prepared a meal for us

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
because you were concerned about us.

163
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,080
I didn't think it was for this.

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,430
I can't do this surgery.

165
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,720
Find someone else.

166
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,110
Dad,

167
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,360
Grandpa left.

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,670
Hello? Yes, Uncle Ning.

169
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,990
What's the matter?

170
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,840
Calm down. I'll be right over.

171
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,990
How's her condition?

172
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,720
It doesn't look optimistic.

173
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
What did Mr. Ning say?

174
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
He didn't say anything.

175
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,360
You know how estranged he is from us.

176
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,630
I came to you

177
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,720
because I had no choice.

178
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,230
You can give Madam Liu's
complete medical record

179
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,160
to me.

180
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,600
Okay.

181
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,280
All right.

182
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,520
They're all here.

183
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,430
Uncle Ning, I'll see you off.

184
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,840
No, it's okay.

185
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,430
You should get back to work.

186
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,550
It's okay. It won't take too much time.

187
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,300
(Liu Xinran)

188
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,750
Look at Cheng,

189
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,790
acting lovey-dovey every day.

190
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,430
Why must you make me feed you?

191
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,750
He may be too much.

192
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,430
But we should keep a distance.

193
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,670
Don't get in their way.

194
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,990
Why should he torture us
with such a display?

195
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,550
I don't care.
I'm going to interrupt them.

196
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,990
Can I join?

197
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,080
Mr. Ding,

198
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,920
you're here.

199
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,670
Hello, Mr. Ding.

200
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,550
Where is he?

201
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,280
I just saw Mr. Ding.

202
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,280
But where did he go?

203
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,550
Yeah, he's right.

204
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,400
He was heading that way.

205
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,230
So you two tried

206
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,230
to scare me, huh?

207
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,360
All right. I'll remember this.

208
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,920
You dropped it on my clothes.

209
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,550
Who says you can sit here?

211
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,630
Oh, come on. Let's eat together.

212
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,190
We can cover for you.

213
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,960
What if Mr. Ding really comes?

214
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,280
Even if he's here,

215
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,430
I'm not scared.

216
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,990
Are you really not scared
if my dad is here?

218
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,790
No.

219
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,920
Why should I be scared?

220
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,600
My pants are stained with oil.

221
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll wipe it off for you.

222
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll wipe it off you too.

223
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,310
I...

224
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,310
Okay, you got it.

225
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,160
My lips.

226
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,430
Stop being annoying.

227
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
We're not trying to annoy you.

228
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,480
You have some on your thigh too.

229
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,600
Wipe off the oil stain.

230
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,720
Mr. Ding.

231
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,310
Hello, Mr. Ding.

232
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,870
Wipe it off quickly.

233
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,600
Don't worry.

234
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,080
It's greasy.

235
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,790
It's okay.

236
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,230
Hi, Dad.

237
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,480
Don't scare me.

238
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,990
Mr. Ding.

239
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,790
I'm not scared if the mayor is here.

240
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,080
Let alone your dad.

241
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,550
My dad is really here.

242
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,110
Oh, Mr. Ding.

243
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,630
Dad,

244
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,480
why don't you sit down

245
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
and join us?

246
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
I had my lunch.

247
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm heading back to the office.

248
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,160
You had your lunch?

249
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,360
See you, Mr. Ding.

250
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,790
-Take care, Mr. Ding.
-Take care, Mr. Ding.

251
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
You and your big mouths.

252
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
Sit down. It's okay.

253
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,360
We won't be in your way anymore.

254
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,360
We're leaving.

255
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,040
You guys are so ridiculous.

256
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,550
Don't waste your food.

257
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,160
Mr. Qian.

258
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,400
Hello, Mr. Qian.

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,670
I'm done with lunch.

260
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Are you leaving me here?

261
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,080
Remember to wash the lunchbox.

262
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,880
Okay.

263
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,760
What's the matter, Mr. Qian?

264
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,510
Cheng,

265
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,270
you were not scheduled
with a lot of surgeries lately.

266
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,960
Are you spending more time
on the outpatient duty?

267
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,120
Ning made the arrangement.

268
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,390
Four days a week.

269
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,670
Four days?

270
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,390
I can't believe

271
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,640
Dr. Ning.

272
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,240
Ah, yes.

273
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,030
Are you in Dr. Ning's research group?

274
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,880
No.

275
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,120
I have to go for the outpatient duty.

276
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,270
I'll get going first, Mr. Qian.

277
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,080
Cheng,

278
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,760
I'll let you join my research group

279
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,640
if you're willing to.

280
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,760
Thank you for inviting me.

281
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,000
But I truly don't have any spare time.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,080
But I'll think about it.

283
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,150
Brat.

284
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,310
You should be busy
with performing surgeries,

285
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,030
get it?

286
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,080
I'm only saying this to you.

287
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,190
I think highly of you.

288
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,760
You have more opportunities
if you join me.

289
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,360
I'll think about it.

290
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,960
I'll get going first.

291
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,960
Cheng,

292
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
you have a great future.

293
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,030
This brat doesn't even clean the table.

294
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,190
Enjoy your meal.

295
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,910
Did my dad come and see you?

296
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,270
Is Madam Liu's condition

297
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,720
very serious?

298
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,000
This is her medical record.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can take a look at it.

300
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,510
Why did you put these on my desk?

301
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,960
So it's more convenient
for you to grasp the situation.

302
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,000
Who says I'm performing surgery on her?

303
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,720
Why did you look at her film
if you're not?

304
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,360
You took her medical record,
so you'll be responsible.

305
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,820
(Outpatient Building)

306
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,720
Dr. Sun is an expert in neurosurgery
at the 3rd People's Hospital.

307
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,240
Let's hear what he has to say.

308
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,030
Liuzheng,

309
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,790
sorry for troubling you.

310
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,190
By reason,

311
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,150
we shouldn't have come to you.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Madam Liu, don't say that.

313
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,080
It doesn't matter if I'm with Zhiqian,

314
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,550
I've already treated both of you

315
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,840
as my family.

316
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,120
Let's go.

317
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
It does look

318
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,000
like glioblastoma multiforme.

319
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,720
Ruan,

320
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I'm sure you know

321
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
from clinical studies

322
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,150
that it's difficult
to treat malignant tumors like this.

323
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,910
It's highly invasive,

324
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,910
and the boundary between
healthy brain tissues is unclear.

325
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,640
It's almost impossible

326
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
to remove the tumor

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,480
through surgery

328
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,430
without causing complications.

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,670
Glioblastoma grows rapidly.

330
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,150
The patient's condition may be worse

331
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,720
than what's shown on the film.

332
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,030
I'm sure you also know

333
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,190
the best way

334
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,480
is to do the surgery
as soon as possible.

335
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,030
But honestly speaking,

336
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,310
our hospital has never accepted
such a case.

337
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,080
I'm not confident either.

338
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,000
Is there any other way?

339
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,480
As I said,

340
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,240
she may have a chance

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
if Ning Zhiqian performs the surgery.

342
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,510
I remember

343
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,360
he performed a similar case before.

344
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,840
The surgery was a success.

345
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,190
There was no relapse after the surgery.

346
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,790
I understand.

347
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,360
You should go

348
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,910
to Ning Zhiqian

349
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,670
and discuss this with him.

350
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,760
Thank you, Dr. Sun.

351
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't mention it.

352
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,060
(Beiya Hospital)

353
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,000
Vital signs?

354
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,960
Normal.

355
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,880
Let's begin.

356
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,190
It looks like glioblastoma.

357
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,600
It should be the same
as Madam Liu's case.

358
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,480
Periosteal elevator.

359
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,550
Patient's vital signs?

360
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,600
Normal.

361
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,240
Patient's vital signs?

362
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,880
Normal.

363
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,480
Use the umbrella.

364
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,120
Mr. Ning,

365
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,390
the glioblastoma surgery

366
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,270
you just did

367
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,120
was really incredible.

368
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,430
I have a question

369
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,270
to ask you.

370
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,550
Well,

371
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,360
what's the difference
between glioblastoma multiforme

372
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,670
and glioblastoma?

373
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,840
The conditions of the patient in the OR

374
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,550
and hers are different.

375
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,480
What's the difference?

376
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,790
I find it similar.

377
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,790
Can you tell me more specifically?

378
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,720
Just go back
and watch the video of the surgery.

379
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,760
Is she admitted
to the 3rd People's Hospital?

380
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,670
Did you admit her?

381
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,550
She's in Ward 2...

382
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,000
You don't have to tell me
where she's at.

383
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,480
I'm not performing the surgery anyway.

384
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,600
Don't walk in the rain.

385
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
Mr. Ning, why are you eating spicy food?

386
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
Aren't you afraid of suffering
from gastrospasm?

387
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,640
If you're here to persuade me,

388
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,430
you can give it up.

389
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,430
I think it's not easy for Uncle Ning.

390
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,550
No one has it easy.

391
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,720
I know you feel bad.

392
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,600
I understand how you feel.

393
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
What do you understand?

394
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,030
What am I feeling?

395
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,000
I know what Uncle Ning did

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,120
hurt you a lot.

397
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,240
Stop. Don't try to persuade me.

398
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,360
I'm not performing the surgery.

399
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,430
Sun Guodong
from the 3rd People's Hospital

400
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,030
and Dr. Wu from Jiangnan University

401
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,190
are the best candidates.

402
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm sure you know what it's like
between Zhiqian and his dad.

403
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,840
It has always been like this.

404
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,240
But I didn't expect

405
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,310
he would be stuck in this situation.

406
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,080
Me too.

407
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,510
He used to say

408
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,150
everyone was equal
on the operating table.

409
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,030
I didn't expect him to be so resistant.

410
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,880
When Uncle Ning refused

411
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,030
to get back with Zhiqian's mom,

412
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,640
he was indeed heartbroken.

413
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,270
I know.

414
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,120
I think

415
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,760
he was about Ning Xiang's age.

416
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,190
But it's been so many years.

417
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,790
I don't think
he would still act out until this day.

418
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,430
Do you know

419
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,150
why Madam Wen suggested to remarry?

420
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,360
After his parents divorced,

421
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,030
Zhiqian followed his mom.

422
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,760
But Aunt Wen was so busy with her work

423
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,960
that she often neglected him.

424
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,190
That's why he always hung out with us.

425
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,480
One day, when Aunt Wen came back
after her night shift,

426
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,910
she found him missing.

427
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,030
And she found out

428
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,360
Zhiqian woke up
in the middle of the night

429
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,430
and went to look for his dad.

430
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,360
He walked several kilometers on foot.

431
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,430
I guess this matter

432
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,550
affected her a lot.

433
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,760
So she decided

434
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,550
to give Zhiqian a complete home

435
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,360
by

436
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,670
remarrying Uncle Ning.

437
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,600
But no one expected

438
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,840
that Uncle Ning

439
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,030
already has Aunt Liu.

440
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,150
I think

441
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,840
he couldn't let it go
because of this, right?

442
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,030
Maybe.

443
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,550
But knowing him,

444
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,790
the more you try
to talk to him about it,

445
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,120
the more it'll backfire.

446
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,550
I know.

447
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,600
So I'm really out of ideas now.

448
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,120
That's why I came to see you for ideas.

449
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,550
Does it have to be Zhiqian

450
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,910
to perform this surgery?

451
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,240
He recommended a couple of doctors.

452
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,600
But honestly speaking,

453
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,190
Madam Liu's tumor is extremely tricky.

454
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,310
We can't afford to wait anymore.

455
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:31,910
Besides,

456
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,240
Uncle Ning

457
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,360
really wants Zhiqian
to perform the surgery.

458
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,430
In that case,

459
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
we can only try other ways.

460
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,960
Dad,

461
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,510
why didn't Grandpa come today?

462
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,640
(Wen Yi)

463
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,390
Grandpa is busy lately.

464
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,430
So he won't be coming.

465
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,390
Is Grandma sick?

466
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,910
That's not your grandma.

467
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,150
I think she's my grandma.

468
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,430
Look carefully.

469
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,310
This is your grandma.

470
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,360
Have you memorized her look yet?

471
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,190
Actually, both of them are my grandma.

472
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,600
Zheng,

473
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,640
Zhiqian asked me out for a workout.

474
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,910
I'll talk to him.

475
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,510
Don't worry.

476
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,790
Okay.

477
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,030
He's coming.

478
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,840
I'll hang up now.

479
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,960
Are you still working out?

480
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,760
Well, you're early.

481
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,510
I've been here for an hour.

482
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,910
Do you know one hour
of my time is expensive?

483
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,720
Well, yours concerns money.

484
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,150
But mine concerns a life.

485
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,030
Whose is more expensive?

486
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,150
Yours.

487
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,720
I just finished a surgery.

488
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,600
Why are you waiting for me?

489
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,080
Are you okay?

490
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,910
You never drink Cola.

491
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,310
Why can't I indulge myself

492
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,270
with soft drinks?

493
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,270
Were you struck by thunder?

494
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,000
You're the one struck by thunder.

495
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,910
I heard after humans are struck
by thunder,

496
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,080
the brain circuit

497
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,910
will be different
from normal people's brains.

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,670
That's an abnormality
in the cerebral cortex.

499
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,640
I don't care what you said.

500
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Something is up with you.

501
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,670
Someone is living

502
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,960
like that person

503
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,240
because they are lovesick

504
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,430
and miss each other too much.

505
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,030
I'm sure I'm not
in the situation you just said.

506
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,790
I just think

507
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,240
Cola is not that bad.

508
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,190
Are you sure you're okay?

509
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,430
Yeah.

510
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,840
Are you sure

511
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,430
you don't have anything to tell me?

512
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,880
I have nothing to tell you.

513
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,480
Did Ruan Liuzheng come to see you?

514
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,910
No.

515
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,080
Why would she?

516
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,910
Stop lying.

517
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,270
I know what you guys

518
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:35,880
are thinking about.

519
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,150
About that,

520
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,760
you can just give it up.

521
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,720
I know you can't let it go.

522
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,030
Then why are you trying
to talk me into it?

523
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:45,840
I just think

524
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
it's okay if you can't get over it
when you were a kid.

525
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
But you're not a kid anymore.

526
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,910
After all, he's your dad,

527
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,080
and he's not young anymore.

528
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,430
Then tell me.

529
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,030
If you were in my shoes,

530
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
would you perform the surgery?

531
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,670
I can't.

532
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
But I know you can.

533
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,480
Why can you not do it, but I have to?

534
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,030
Because you're Zhiqian.

535
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,510
You can do it, you know?

536
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,910
Adjust speed.

537
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,760
Liuzheng, you're here.

538
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,550
What did Zhiqian say?

539
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,360
Why don't

540
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,840
I go and beg him again?

541
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,600
Worse comes to worst,
I can trade my life

542
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,390
for hers.

543
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,080
Uncle Ning,

544
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,270
calm down.

545
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,310
I'm sure we have other ways.

546
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,480
Let's figure this out together.

547
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,390
Is that Liuzheng?

548
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,720
Madam Liu.

549
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,550
Be careful.

550
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,600
Don't move.

551
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,080
Just lie down.

552
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,310
Shouzheng,

553
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,550
go and take a breath.

554
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,270
I'd like to talk

555
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,880
to Liuzheng.

556
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,390
Liuzheng.

557
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,640
Come and sit down.

558
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
Madam Liu,

559
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,510
feel free to say what you want.

560
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,960
It's not about my illness.

561
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,840
I want to talk to you

562
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,790
about you and Zhiqian.

563
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,640
Zhiqian

564
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,310
didn't remarry you.

565
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,360
At first,

566
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,760
I didn't understand.

567
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,640
I've been thinking about it these days.

568
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
Maybe

569
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,030
it's because Zhiqian
couldn't get over it.

570
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,790
Madam Liu,

571
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,360
you don't have to worry about us.

572
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,960
You should focus on recovering.

573
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,240
Listen to me.

574
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,880
Actually,

575
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,360
the woman

576
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,790
Zhiqian's dad loves the most

577
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
is still Zhiqian's mom.

578
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,030
At that time,

579
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,430
Zhiqian's dad just divorced.

580
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
He needed someone to take care of him

581
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
and comfort him.

582
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,760
I was his secretary.

583
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,790
So I happened

584
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,910
to be doing all these.

585
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,270
But after that,

586
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,430
- It's already in the past.
- it was really...

587
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,840
So stop thinking about it.

588
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,390
Actually, what I wanted to say is,

589
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,720
it's hard

590
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,720
to manage a family

591
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,880
for doctors.

592
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,550
Zhiqian

593
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,150
grew up

594
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,960
in a single-parent family.

595
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,240
He lacked a lot of love.

596
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,480
He doesn't know
how to express it either.

597
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,840
I hope

598
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,720
you can understand him.

599
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,030
I can see

600
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,910
that

601
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,480
he really loves you.

602
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,240
He just doesn't want

603
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,670
to hurt you.

604
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,390
Madam Liu,

605
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,360
thank you for telling me all this.

606
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,640
I don't have

607
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,360
a child in this life.

608
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,760
It doesn't matter

609
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,670
how you two end up.

610
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,270
I treat you two

611
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,270
like my children.

612
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,790
I've already considered you
as my family.

613
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,200
I hope you

614
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,790
would stop worrying about us.

615
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,470
As for your illness,

616
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,030
we'll find a way to get it treated.

617
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,120
Liuzheng,

618
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,230
I know it's not easy for you.

619
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,160
Thank you.

620
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,230
You're a kind person.

621
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,230
Hello?

622
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
Hello, Xiao'er.

623
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,200
How did it go with him?

624
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,640
I don't even want to talk about it.

625
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,310
He's too stubborn to deal with.

626
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,550
He even called me out.

627
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,750
Zheng,

628
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,550
why not

629
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,120
let Dr. Sun do it?

630
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,270
I just asked him.

631
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,360
He said Ning Zhiqian
has the best chance for success.

632
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,600
I'll think of something again.

633
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,470
Okay.

634
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,470
Bye.

635
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,260
(Outpatient Building)

636
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,790
Do you have something to say?

637
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,510
You'll have to say it anyway. So shoot.

638
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,840
Did you go and see her
during the day?

639
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,160
Yes.

640
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,680
Sun Guodong called me.

641
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,080
You really

642
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,840
put a lot of effort into this.

643
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,640
You even talked
to Sun Guodong and Xiao'er.

644
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,400
What do they want to say?

645
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,550
Why didn't they come
and see me themselves?

646
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
Why did they insist on asking you
to talk to me?

647
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,880
They didn't tell me to come.

648
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,400
That means you acted on your own accord.

649
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,400
Why do you think

650
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,600
I must perform this surgery?

651
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,030
Do I have the right
to choose not to do it?

652
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,270
You still hate Uncle Ning,

653
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,950
right?

654
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,160
Well, I don't hate him.

655
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,360
I just don't feel anything anymore.

656
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,400
We both go our separate ways.

657
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,600
You said you don't feel anything

658
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,030
and you don't care anymore.

659
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,710
Do you really not care at all?

660
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,440
I know

661
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,880
it was a huge blow to you

662
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,160
when Uncle Ning married Madam Liu

663
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,400
instead of remarrying back then.

664
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,510
You were just a child back then.

665
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,880
So I can understand how you felt.

666
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,200
But now,

667
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
you were married and divorced too.

668
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,790
You should know

669
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,230
it's not easy

670
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,640
for things to go back to how it was.

671
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,600
Besides, didn't you also refuse
to remarry me?

672
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,840
You're right.

673
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,510
Many years later,

674
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,470
I learned that my father

675
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,440
only made a normal choice

676
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,440
as an adult.

677
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,200
But what you didn't know was,

678
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,710
the day my dad walked out

679
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,840
of the house with his luggage,

680
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,080
I went after him from behind.

681
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,470
I ran after him over a long distance.

682
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,990
But he

683
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,710
never looked back at all.

684
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,120
My mom asked for a divorce.

685
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
But my dad doesn't know

686
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,990
how sad and tormented my mom was

687
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,950
after the divorce.

688
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,470
After they divorced,

689
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,200
my mom often looked

690
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,470
at old photos and cried by herself.

691
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,310
I know

692
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,990
she never forgot

693
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,710
my dad.

694
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,510
So one night,

695
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,030
I went out alone

696
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,640
to get my dad back.

697
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,230
But I got lost.

698
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,680
I was terrified at the time.

699
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,400
The next morning,

700
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,550
my mom brought me home
after she found me.

701
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,840
After that, my mom went to see my dad

702
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
and suggested to remarry.

703
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,270
But my dad

704
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,950
rejected her.

705
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,270
Uncle Ning

706
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,990
had told me all these.

707
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,640
I think

708
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,990
he must have felt sad and conflicted

709
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,990
when he made these decisions.

710
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,160
And I don't think he knows

711
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,600
that Aunt Wen loved him so much.

712
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,880
My dad always thought
my mom suggested to remarry

713
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,990
because of me.

714
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,470
But he didn't know

715
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,200
how deep my mom's love was

716
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,550
for him.

717
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,950
He married Liu

718
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,270
only half a year after their divorce.

719
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,440
I'll never forget that day.

720
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,920
My mom told me

721
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,550
they couldn't remarry anymore.

722
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,920
She cried as she hugged me.

723
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,710
It was the first time

724
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,470
my mom cried in front of me.

725
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,600
- I didn't know you experienced...
- Liuzheng.

727
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,600
If we look at this objectively,

728
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,790
what you said

729
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,270
is well-reasoned.

730
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,950
But I'm also a human being.

731
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,550
I have feelings too.

732
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,880
I'm not a surgical machine.

733
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,470
As a doctor,

734
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,120
I can't bring my personal feelings

735
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,680
to the operating table.

736
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,680
Do you understand this?

737
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,950
I'm sorry.

738
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,160
But Uncle Ning is really desperate now.

739
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,790
I apologize

740
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,030
for troubling you
with my family matters.

741
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,510
I'll tell them

742
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,680
that we're co-workers now

743
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,120
and not

744
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,200
to trouble you in the future.

745
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,990
I'm heading home now.

746
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,990
You should go home too.

747
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,600
Hello?

748
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,550
Hello,

749
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,710
Liuzheng.

750
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,080
My wife is not doing well now.

751
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,880
Can you come here?

752
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,510
Okay, Uncle Ning. I'll be right there.

753
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,710
How is she?

754
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,200
It was bad just now.

755
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,950
The intracranial pressure was high.

756
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,680
But I've reduced the pressure.

757
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,160
I'm worried

758
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,990
about slight bleeding in her brain.

759
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,080
We can't delay anymore.

760
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,030
We'll perform the surgery tomorrow.

761
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
If Ning Zhiqian can't be

762
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,840
the main surgeon,

763
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,440
I can only take the risk.

764
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,120
By the way,

765
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,950
remember to sign the consent form.

766
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,160
Okay.

767
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,990
Uncle Ning, I'm going out for a while.

768
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,470
Please stay and watch Madam Liu.

769
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,030
Liuzheng,

770
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,950
are you going to see Zhiqian?

771
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,360
I'll go with you.

772
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,880
Just stay here

773
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,270
and wait for my news.

774
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,990
Liuzheng,

775
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
you haven't been visiting
since you graduated.

776
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,880
I've been busy.

777
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,600
So what can I help you with today?

778
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,880
Do you still remember
the speech Professor Wen Yi gave

779
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,790
at our school?

780
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,680
Yeah, I do recall.

781
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,600
I want to find that video.

782
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,680
It's been quite a while.

783
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,400
How about this?

784
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,160
We'll check the database.

785
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,360
Okay, thank you.

786
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,950
Let's go.

787
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,100
(Information Center)

788
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,380
(Low Warning)

789
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,440
Coming.

790
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,310
Come in.

791
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,750
I'll get you a glass of water.

792
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:08,160
This is for you.

793
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,750
Mom!

794
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,640
What's this?

795
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,790
This is the CD
of your grandma's previous speech.

796
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,840
Why are you giving this to me?

797
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,920
You missed the speech

798
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,310
because it was on the day you became
the main surgeon for the first time.

799
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,680
It was a surgery that no one
was confident in performing.

800
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,230
Yet, you stood firmly
by the operating table.

801
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,840
Do you think saying that

802
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,750
will change my mind?

803
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,750
I'll get going then.

804
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,400
(Hello, everyone.)

805
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,310
(I'm Wen Yi,)

806
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,160
(a gynecologist.)

807
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,230
(Do you know)

808
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:52,920
(medicine)

809
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,400
(is against natural science?)

810
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,950
(Darwin's theory of evolution
emphasizes natural selection)

811
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,080
- (and survival of the fittest.)
- Dad,

812
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,920
isn't this my grandma?

813
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,030
Do you know

814
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,550
your grandma

815
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,400
was an extremely good, amazing,

816
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,950
and outstanding doctor?

817
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,880
(Dr. Werner Forssmann)

818
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,950
(anesthetized his elbow)

819
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,550
(and inserted a catheter)

820
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,360
- (into his vein.)
- Dad,

821
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,550
you're also

822
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,270
an extremely good, amazing,

823
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,360
and outstanding doctor.

824
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:25,990
(And he proved)

825
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,640
(that the heart can be treated)

826
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,600
(by injecting drugs through a catheter.)

827
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,360
(As doctors,)

828
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,710
(we have to sacrifice our health,)

829
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,270
(and our families,)

830
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,310
(and devote all our energy
and time to our work.)

831
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,310
