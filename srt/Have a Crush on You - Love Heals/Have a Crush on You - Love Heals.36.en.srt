00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 36=

3
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,630
Mr. Ning?

4
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,590
Madam Liu?

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,190
Don't bother.

6
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,110
They haven't come home in some time.

7
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,110
You're back.

8
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,520
Eat up.

9
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,830
I don't feel like eating. Carry on.

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,190
Come here.

11
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,080
Have you found him?

12
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
We searched everywhere we could.

13
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,910
No sign of him yet.

14
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,910
Well.

15
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
What are they doing?

16
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,080
I think they are

17
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
avoiding Liuzheng.

18
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,830
According to Tan Ya,

19
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,630
they took Ning Zhiqian away
without a word.

20
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,550
They didn't even contact her.

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
But why would they do that?

22
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
(Hello?)

23
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,550
(Is this the Neurosurgery Department
of Xiehe Hospital?)

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,960
(May I know if there is
a patient by the name)

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,110
(Ning Zhiqian?)

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,830
Thank you.

27
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,240
(Beijing: No. 14 Xiehe Hospital)

28
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
Hello? Dr. Cheng.

29
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,470
(I asked the higher-up about this.)

30
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,560
(Ning Zhiqian was brought back here)

31
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,800
(and transferred to
the international medical organization)

32
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,750
(Simeone used to work at)

33
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,630
(to receive a new treatment.)

34
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
(But considering the patient's privacy)

35
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,190
(and condition,
this had to be kept a secret.)

36
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,750
(His family signed
the NDA with the organization.)

37
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,630
(That is why they can't contact you.)

38
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,840
She's here.

39
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,190
How are the things with Mr. Ning?

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,310
We still can't
get in touch with his family.

41
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,870
The organization

42
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
hasn't disclosed any information.

43
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,350
Is he even recovering?

44
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,680
They can at least tell me that.

45
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,800
Liuzheng.

46
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,910
Don't worry.

47
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,400
How can I not worry?

48
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,960
I must see him, dead or alive.

49
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,190
They won't let me see him at all.

50
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,840
Is he already dead?

51
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,910
Please be honest with me.

52
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,750
Stop lying to me.

53
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,800
We never lied to you.

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
The truth is we don't know anything

55
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,430
about Mr. Ning's condition.

56
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
But there is one thing we know for sure.

57
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,280
He's been receiving treatment.

58
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,400
When can I hear from him?

59
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,940
(Wedding Invitation)

60
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,800
You're getting married?

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,720
We thought it'd be the
bad timing to tell you now.

62
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,350
But...

63
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,470
But if we didn't tell you,

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,150
you could be upset when you find out.

65
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
We are getting married next month.

66
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,720
If you have the time,

67
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,350
feel free to drop by.

68
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,720
If you can't make it, it's okay.

69
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Congratulations.

70
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,350
Congratulations to both of you.

71
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,590
I must go.

72
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,630
(One hour of workout a day)

73
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,080
(helps you go a long way!)

74
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
(It helps you go all the way!)

75
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,870
(Happy forever!)

76
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,910
(Happy forever!)

77
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,720
(Keep it up!)

78
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,240
(Mr. Ning, all the best!)

79
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,480
Your classmates
are having hot pot tonight.

80
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Why didn't you join them?

81
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,750
I'm on a diet.

82
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,230
You're already so skinny.

83
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you trying to be a skeleton?

84
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,040
No.

85
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,360
Are you in love with someone?

86
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,790
No.

87
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,110
Pay attention to my class tomorrow.

88
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,720
Sure.

89
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,790
(2007, China,
Jiangzhou University Medical School)

90
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,080
The main topic of this class

91
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
(Note: the abdomen faces up)
are the skeletal structure,

92
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
blood vessels,
and muscles of a bullfrog.

93
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,790
For the muscles,
please refer to the whiteboard.

94
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,080
Pay attention to the screen.

95
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,310
Check this section.

96
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,920
That is the artery
at the bullfrog's leg.

97
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,280
Is that clear?

98
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
Let's begin.

99
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,400
I prepare some slides for everyone.

100
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,040
Refer to the screen
if you aren't clear about it.

101
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,670
Sir.

102
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,670
I feel a little unwell.

103
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,550
What's wrong?

104
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,280
I ate a bullfrog yesterday.

105
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,920
Put on your mask and gloves.

106
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,870
You may begin.

107
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,750
Are you having fun

108
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,790
talking to the animal?

109
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Are you dissecting it

110
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,870
or the other way around?

111
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,430
Open the case.

112
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,430
Come back here.

113
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,480
I can't do this.

114
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,310
Sit down.

115
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,870
Take out the bullfrog.

116
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,960
Take out the bullfrog.

117
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,750
Open your palm.

118
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,190
Don't be afraid of it.

119
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,360
Open your palm.

120
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,750
Open your palm.

121
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,990
Li Yi, help me out.

122
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,630
Okay.

123
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,230
Ruan Liuzheng, don't be scared.

124
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,040
No!

125
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,480
Li Yi!

126
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,430
Why are you grabbing her?

127
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,840
Liuzheng, calm down.

128
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,870
Can't you see she's scared?

129
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,990
It's nothing. See?

130
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,840
It's cute.

131
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,670
Don't be scared!

132
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,520
Give me the bullfrog.

133
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,790
Bring it here.

134
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,110
Liu Zheng!

135
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,990
- Liuzheng?
- Are you alright?

136
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:24,870
Ruan Liuzheng!

137
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,080
Liuzheng!

138
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,600
Well?

139
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,190
I'll send her to the infirmary.

140
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,920
Give me a hand.

141
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,520
- Sure.
- Sure.

142
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,230
Is she going to be alright?

143
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,600
Isn't our bride gorgeous?

144
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,110
You two look good too.

145
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm marrying Cheng Zhouyu.

146
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Is he even worthy?

147
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,750
If you want to back out now,

148
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,960
I can take you away.

149
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,520
Forget it.

150
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,190
Congratulations.

151
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Thank you.

152
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
Do you know who the groomsman is?

153
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,280
Who?

154
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,720
You'll find out soon.

155
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,430
It's a surprise.

156
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,670
What are you looking for?

157
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,110
The groomsman.

158
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,840
Who could it be?

159
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,040
It's the man who will deliver

160
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,870
the wedding ring.

161
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,430
I should get going.

162
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,430
You two can take it from here.

163
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,080
Leave it to us.

164
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,840
Look over here.
The view is great.

165
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,480
Liuzheng?

166
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:21,990
Come.

167
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah.

168
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,480
It's not bad.

169
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,750
Ai Fei.

170
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,280
Liuzheng.

171
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Tan Ya, Liuzheng.

172
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,790
Ai Fei, Mr. Xue.

173
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,960
Well?

174
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,230
Any news on him?

175
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,040
Liuzheng.

176
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,230
Everything will be alright.

177
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,430
It will.

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,670
Mr. Xue.

179
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,520
Ai Fei.

180
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,550
You look great today.

181
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,040
Good taste.

182
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,790
Of course.

183
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,110
The ceremony has begun.

184
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,870
Get to your seats.

185
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,160
Okay.

186
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,630
Sure.

187
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,480
Let's go.

188
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,480
Talk to you later.

189
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,920
Tan Ya.

190
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,230
Carry on without me.

191
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,550
Ou Xiaoming?

192
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,840
Long time no see, Dr. Ruan.

193
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,870
You are looking very well.

194
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,480
Certainly. I don't stay up late now.

195
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,480
Where's Dr. Ning?

196
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,310
Why isn't he with you?

197
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,480
Have you designed any new games lately?

198
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,670
Yeah.

199
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,080
"Master Detective",
have you heard of it?

200
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,870
What is the game about?

201
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,670
A detective game.

202
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,630
Have you heard the slogan?

203
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,920
Even the most complicated mystery

204
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,430
leaves tracks.

205
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,720
Trace it back to the beginning

206
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,790
and you will find
the details and clues.

207
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,640
That is the game I designed.

208
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,960
What did you say?

209
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,120
Even the most complicated mystery

210
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,390
leaves tracks.

211
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,720
Trace it back to the beginning

212
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,670
and you will find
the details and clues.

213
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,430
That is the game I designed.

214
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,480
Groomsman!

215
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,240
What?

216
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,640
We're waiting for you.

217
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,120
You're the groomsman?

218
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,720
Yeah, I am.

219
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,360
See you later.

220
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,000
Hurry up!

221
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,760
We were waiting for you.

222
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,880
They are here.

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Gorgeous!

224
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,760
She looks stunning.

225
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,310
Yeah.

226
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,600
Yu.

227
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,430
Today is the day

228
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
I entrust my precious daughter

229
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
to you.

230
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,270
Promise me

231
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,880
you'll give her a happy life.

232
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,240
Yuan.

233
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,080
He's the man you love the most.

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,790
Promise me one thing.

235
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,270
Give him

236
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,000
a happy life.

237
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,840
I have a piece of advice

238
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,190
for both of you.

239
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,790
In marriage,

240
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,640
one plus one doesn't always
equal to two.

241
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,430
But two halves make one.

242
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,510
What does it mean?

243
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,840
In your married life,

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,790
you must each shed away
half of your stubbornness

245
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,390
to form

246
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,550
one happy family.

247
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,000
Zhouyu.

248
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm leaving Yuan

249
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,790
in your care.

250
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,510
If you run into any trouble,

251
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,430
make sure you get help.

252
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,310
Do not try to solve it on your own.

253
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,640
Is that clear?

254
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't worry,

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,190
Dad.

256
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,840
Good.

257
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,000
May you have a blessed and happy life.

258
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,360
(Even the most complicated mystery)

259
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,670
(leaves tracks.)

260
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,030
(Trace it back to the beginning)

261
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,310
(and you will find
the details and clues.)

262
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,880
When my mom left,

263
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,360
I couldn't be with her.

264
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
So I thought I should come here

265
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,910
and pay her a visit more often.

266
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,420
(Passport)

267
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,390
Liuzheng.

268
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
Where are you going?

269
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,510
I'll be away for a couple of days.

270
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,310
For some fresh air.

271
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,960
Sure.

272
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,600
Stay safe out there.

273
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,480
Be careful.

274
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,550
Bye, Mom.

275
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,790
Don't skip your meals.

276
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,510
Yes.

277
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,310
It's good to have some fresh air.

278
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,270
Do you know Dr. Ning?

279
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,720
No. I don't know him.

280
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,030
But I heard about him.

281
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,390
I never meet him.

282
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,860
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

283
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,790
Dr. Ruan?

284
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,270
Dr. Ruan.

285
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,760
Long time no see.

286
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah. How have you been?

287
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,150
How are you?

288
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,430
Dr. Ning?

289
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,390
Dr. Ruan.

290
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,390
Welcome to Dahl Chinese Hospital.

291
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,790
Nice to meet you.

292
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,480
Where are you from?

293
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,430
Are you Chinese?

294
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,550
Hello.

295
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,150
I'm Ning Zhiqian.

296
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,120
What's your name?

297
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,310
Dr. Ning, we need help!

298
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,760
Coming.

299
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,790
See you.

300
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,670
Jeff.

301
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,670
Yes?

302
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,430
What happened?

303
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,270
Why does he act like this?

304
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,640
I think...

305
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,670
I think you should go and talk to

306
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,720
Dr. Simeone.

307
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,760
Simeone?

308
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,840
What's going on?

309
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,150
Dr. Ning was lucky.

310
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,080
He woke up after one month of treatment.

311
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,360
But unfortunately,

312
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,670
he suffers amnesia,

313
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,790
which includes you.

314
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,360
Amnesia?

315
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,080
You're a brain surgeon.

316
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
You know

317
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,310
these kinds of complications

318
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,550
are very common.

319
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,360
Besides, he was in a coma for so long.

320
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,270
They tried. They mentioned you to him.

321
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,670
But, he couldn't remember you.

322
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,190
He only remembers his mother.

323
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,310
Because she passed away in this place.

324
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,840
And he chose to
come here to be with her.

325
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
How long has he been here?

326
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,640
Less than a month.

327
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,310
If I didn't come to you,

328
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,840
would you keep
hiding him from me forever?

329
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,480
Dr. Ning's family

330
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,270
set off to return to China yesterday.

331
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,550
I think they went back

332
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,190
to explain the story to you.

333
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,880
Dr. Ruan.

334
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,480
I know it is very hard
to accept the truth.

335
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,360
I can accept it,

336
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,270
as long as he's still alive.

337
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,510
Hi, Simeone.

338
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,880
Hi, Ning.

339
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,480
Hi.

340
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,000
Would you like to talk to her?

341
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,720
No.

342
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,790
Am I interfering?

343
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,910
You go on.

344
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,500
(Beiya Hospital)

345
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,510
You're saying

346
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,510
he still remembers how to be a surgeon

347
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,840
but doesn't remember you?

348
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,240
Simeone told me

349
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,600
he couldn't remember anything at first.

350
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,430
He even forgot how to be a surgeon.

351
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,480
Then, he went to the
operating room a few times.

352
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
He watched.

353
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,000
Then, he recalled everything.

354
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,360
He's as good of a surgeon

355
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
as he was.

356
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,030
He really was

357
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,760
born to be a doctor.

358
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,910
That means if you
talk to him more often,

359
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,240
he might remember you too.

360
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,380
I'll talk to you later.

361
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,620
Go! Go!

362
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,900
Stop him.

363
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,660
Yeah!

364
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,020
We won!

365
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,340
Yes!

366
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,660
Give me the ball!

367
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,550
Hello, Jeff.

368
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,820
Over here!

369
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,000
See? Dr. Ning.

370
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
Hey! Here!

371
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,550
Right!

372
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:58,760
This way!

373
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,310
Pass the ball!

374
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,150
Guard him!

375
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,910
Ruan Liuzheng?

376
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,190
Simeone told me

377
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,720
we used to know each other.

378
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,390
Your name is Ruan Liuzheng,

379
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,360
right?

380
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,720
Not only did we know each other,

381
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,240
we were close.

382
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,030
Is that right?

383
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,310
How close were we?

384
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,760
Ruan Liuzheng.

385
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,150
Do you

386
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,790
remember anything?

387
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
You have a weird name.

388
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,840
How did you get that name?

389
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,760
What's the story

390
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
behind your name?

391
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
My mom had a dream

392
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,270
before I was born.

393
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,240
She dreamed of a drifting kite.

394
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,270
Hence the name, "Drifting Kite".

395
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,880
How poetic.

396
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
Sorry, I was in an accident.

397
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,390
I forgot so many things.

398
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,480
You are different from before.

399
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,310
Really? How different?

400
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,310
You apologized.

401
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,910
You smile a lot more too.

402
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,720
Is that so?

403
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,000
It sounds like I was cold

404
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,030
and scary.

405
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,000
You were insufferable.

406
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
You may not

407
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,840
remember who I am,

408
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,120
but thank you for being alive.

409
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
It's good to be alive.

410
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,030
Are you free this weekend?

411
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,760
What is it?

412
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,030
Our hiking club

413
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,480
is organizing a hiking trip.

414
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,790
Care to join us?

415
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,080
You really are different now.

416
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,030
What?

417
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,270
You play basketball

418
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,310
and you go hiking.

419
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,360
I also join the fishing club.

420
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,190
You really like
outdoor activities nowadays.

421
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
What's wrong?

422
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,310
You only

423
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,310
spent your time in the Outpatient
Department, wards, and operating room.

424
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,240
You never joined any group activities.

425
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,670
That sounds like a boring life.

426
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,600
Do you know
what your favorite pastime was?

427
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,760
What was it?

428
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,360
Spending time alone.

429
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,360
That sounds so boring.

430
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,270
Well?

431
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,760
Are you free this weekend?

432
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,150
Are you coming?

433
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,840
Quick! We're falling behind!

434
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,550
Help me up.

435
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Quick! Get moving.

436
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,030
We're falling behind!

437
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,120
Dr. Ruan.

438
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,990
Why did you become a doctor?

439
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:17,790
I'm not telling you.

440
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,400
Share it with me.

441
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,470
It's a secret.

442
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,550
A secret?

443
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,790
Let's play a game.

444
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,510
If I win,

445
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,710
you must tell me the secret.

446
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,270
What game?

447
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,600
Let's see who reaches the top first.

448
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,030
That's so childish.

449
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,880
Start!

450
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,920
Don't just stand there!

451
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,790
Come on!

452
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,200
Quick!

453
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,880
I can't outrun you anyway.

454
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,160
The view here is great. Come on.

455
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,510
Come on.

456
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,160
I will only help you here!

457

459
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,840
Tell me your secret.

460
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,640
What secret?

461
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,400
Why did you become a doctor?

Ruan Liuzheng!

528

of seawater in front of me

(The bonus scene is coming…)

532
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:35,530
(Jiangzhou, China)
Honey, why did you fall asleep

533
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,533
(Jiangzhou, China)
during the movie again?

534
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:37,853
(Jiangzhou, China)
And your snoring was so loud.

535
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:40,053
You could've woken me up.

536
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:42,653
People were looking at us.

537
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:43,693
It was so embarrassing.

538
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,373
You should've woken me up.

539
00:42:44,373 --> 00:42:46,133
You made me look like a selfish jerk.

540
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:49,293
I want a doll.

541
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:50,493
From the claw machine?

542
00:42:52,493 --> 00:42:53,333
I'll get you some tokens.

543
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:13,853
(I'll grab a Dr. Ning.)

544
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,453
I almost got it.

545
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,013
Dr. Ning, listen up.

546
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:50,893
Don't snore so loud
when you fall asleep!

547
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:53,533
Do as I say or be sent to the ENT.

548
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:54,893
Fine. Let's go there now.

549
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:56,773
I want to get a Dr. Ruan.

550
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:57,613
What are you talking about?

551
00:43:57,613 --> 00:43:58,533
I want a Dr. Ruan!

552
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:00,333
There's no Dr. Ruan in there.

553
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:01,613
I'll grab the blue one.

554
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:02,773
There, grab it.

555
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:03,573
You do it.

556
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:04,333
Me?

557
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:05,373
Get me Dr. Ruan.

558
00:44:06,893 --> 00:44:07,733
The blue one, right?

559
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:13,013
The blue one!

560
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:13,813
That's a blue doll.

561
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:15,133
Isn't that Dr. Ruan?

562
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:21,933
I want this.

563
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:22,853
See? It's so squishy.

564
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:24,133
See?

565
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,640
- I don't want it.
- Look alike.

566
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,520
Exactly the same.

567
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,600
Dr. Ruan.

568
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,680
Let's go.

569
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,440
Stop. I want to grab one
that looks like you.

570
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,640
Looks great.

571
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,000
How is it? Not bad?

572
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,040
