=Episode 14=

3
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,450
Here by yourself?

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
I'll drink with you.

5
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,450
You came to a place like this.

6
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,640
Don't bother playing innocent.

7
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,250
Beat it.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You've got an attitude.

9
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,610
The night is still young.

10
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,170
It's too early to sleep.

11
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's have a nice chat.

12
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,170
Don't touch me!

13
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,920
You're really feisty.

14
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,050
Good.

15
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,330
I like a woman with an attitude.

16
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you know him?

17
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,890
You have a boyfriend?

18
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,250
Why are you here

19
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,760
if you already have a boyfriend?

20
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,450
That's enough.

21
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,970
What? Do you want to beat him up?

22
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,000
Well.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
Do you think you're invincible

24
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
just because you know a few moves?

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
That guy was asking for it.

26
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,330
I was about to throw him
over the shoulder

27
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,530
on the counter.

28
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,450
Sure.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
Stop drinking.

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,000
It's 58 yuan a bottle.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,530
How many bottles have you already had?

32
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,610
174 yuan.

33
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,640
232 yuan...

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,050
I'm not making you pay the bill.

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,050
No?

36
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,170
Cheers.

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,330
Come on. Let's dance.

38
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,250
Dancing is free.

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't want to dance.

40
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
Dr. Ding,

41
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,170
getting drunk

42
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,840
because your love
is unrequited is immature.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,810
You're a doctor.

44
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,920
Do you really believe
that alcohol can numb you?

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,280
By the time it actually does,

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,720
you could have got alcohol poisoning.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,530
If you get too drunk,

48
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll need to carry you home.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,090
I've never got drunk

50
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,410
in my life.

51
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,120
You're so drunk

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,200
that you're talking nonsense.

53
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,890
Listen.

54
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,450
I love

55
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,000
the taste of alcohol.

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
The smell of alcohol

57
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
gets me excited.

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,720
Do you know what my dad told me?

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
That I was born for this job.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,450
You've got a gift.

61
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,360
Well,

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,410
you and Ning are a good match.

63
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,560
Will it kill you not to bring him up?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,010
If I don't say that,

65
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,850
will you be able to get over it?

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,730
Yes.

67
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,970
Ning is talented,

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,010
and his skills are excellent.

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
But Dr. Ding,

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,810
have you considered

71
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,730
that maybe you don't actually like him?

72
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,290
Maybe you just want to conquer him?

73
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,010
What do you mean?

74
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,810
You're talented,

75
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,480
and you're used

76
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,250
to being better
than everyone around you.

77
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,690
Ning Zhiqian is one of the best men

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,640
around you except me.

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,530
So you want to conquer him

80
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,040
to prove your capability.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,410
Why else would you want

82
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,530
to be with an ice block?

83
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,600
What are you after?

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,130
I'm on fire.

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
I have a fire in me

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,920
that I can't put out.

87
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,530
I need some ice

88
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,570
to cool me down.

89
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,410
Excuse me,

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,880
two cold drinks.

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,090
Here.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,920
It's Liuzheng.

93
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,290
(Hello? Liuzheng?)

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,530
I'm being held up outside.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,130
You guys eat first.

96
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,090
Don't wait for me.

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,410
(All right. Okay.)

98
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,290
(Your parents are hungry too.)

99
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,010
Sorry.

100
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,290
It's fine.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll play the chess
with Mr. Ruan after dinner.

102
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,920
I'll wait for you.

103
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,600
I might be home really late tonight.

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,730
You really don't have to wait for me.

105
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,920
It's fine.

106
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,920
I'll wait however long you need.

107
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,250
Liuzheng,

108
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,970
we haven't seen each other

109
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,040
in almost a week.

110
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,040
Here. Put this on.

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,920
Ning Xiang,

112
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,360
go get your mother.

113
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,690
It's time to blow out the candles.

114
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,730
Mom.

115
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,600
Dad is waiting for you
to blow out the candles.

116
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,920
Okay. I'll be right there.

117
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,130
I'm hanging up.

118
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,730
Bye.

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Let's not wait for her anymore.

120
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,640
Let's eat first.

121
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,410
Yes.

122
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,160
Let's eat.

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,250
Here, Mr. Ruan.

124
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,540
(Happy Birthday)

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,530
Make a wish.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,850
Dad,

127
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,690
make a wish.

128
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,290
I'm not a kid.

129
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,970
I don't need to make a wish.

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,920
Just make a wish.

131
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,090
Dad, wait.

132
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,850
Since you don't want to make a wish,

133
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,320
let's play a game.

134
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,640
A game? What game?

135
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,530
Truth or dare.

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
How do you play that game?

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
Rock, paper, scissors.

138
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,850
The loser gets punished.

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Okay.

140
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,600
Come on.

141
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,090
Rock, paper, scissors.

142
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,880
You lost, Dad.

143
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,480
Choose.

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Truth or dare?

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
Dare.

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay.

147
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Your dare

148
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,160
is to kiss Mom.

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,090
Change it.

150
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,320
Can I do something else?

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,130
I'll pick truth instead.

152
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,970
Okay.

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,410
Mom,

154
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,880
is there anything you want to ask Dad?

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,690
Mr. Ning.

156
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,410
Do you think

157
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,530
I'm a qualified doctor?

158
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Yes.

159
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Mom, Dad,

160
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,040
let's play another round.

161
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,090
Okay.

162
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,090
Come on.

163
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

164
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,690
Mom, you lost.

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,250
Truth or dare?

166
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,290
Truth.

167
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,320
I'll ask the question.

168
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,090
Do you still like Dad?

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,850
You have to answer truthfully.

170
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,800
Lying is wrong.

171
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,240
Hurry up and blow out the candles.

172
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,370
They're going to burn the cake.

173
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,410
No, Dad.

174
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,560
Mom agreed to play.

175
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,850
So she has to follow the rules.

176
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,680
Mom,

177
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,930
do you still like Dad?

178
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,850
Hello?

179
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,320
I...

180
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,320
I don't dare to anymore.

181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,050
What do we do?

182
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,290
Do you have any other ideas?

183
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,730
No.

184
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,930
Dr. Ding,

185
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,610
I think I'm getting alcohol poisoning.

186
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,240
Let's stop drinking and go home.

187
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,800
Go home by yourself.

188
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,410
Can you not be so stubborn?

189
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,530
Ning Zhiqian

190
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,000
is basically Mount Everest.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
He's so high.

192
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Why do you want to hike him?

193
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
He's not the only mountain

194
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,970
in the world.

195
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,370
Why can't you climb another mountain?

196
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,320
Climb...

197
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,120
Climb me instead.

198
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,850
Just one day.

199
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,880
No.

200
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,290
I'll let you climb to my peak right now.

201
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,880
Come on.

202
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,170
I'm not interested in a mound

203
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,730
like you.

204
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,780
(Chunyan)

205
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,560
I need to take this call.

206
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,530
Don't drink too much.

207
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,170
Buddy!

208
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,320
Are you okay?

209
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,850
Buddy!

210
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,050
What's going on?

211
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,000
Is there a doctor in the house?

212
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,200
Buddy!

213
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,120
Is there a doctor here?

214
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,410
Do we have a doctor?

215
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,170
Let me through.

216
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,050
Is there a doctor?

217
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm a doctor. What happened?

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,970
He was fine just now.

219
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,850
Then, he collapsed all of a sudden.

220
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,530
Wake up.

221
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,370
Did he show any symptoms
before he collapsed?

222
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,930
He coughed a few times violently.

223
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,410
Did he have any lung problems?

224
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,560
He had ﻿emphysema.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,370
I visited him
in the hospital last month.

226
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,050
Did anyone call ambulance?

227
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

228
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,530
What's the ETA?

229
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,050
The emergency lane
was blocked by a private vehicle.

230
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,050
The ambulance can't pass through.

231
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,410
Doctor,

232
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,610
what do we do?

233
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,050
Doctor,

234
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,370
you have to save my friend!

235
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
I need a few items.

236
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,730
Liquor with high alcohol content,
disposable gloves,

237
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,200
a straw, and a fruit knife.

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,800
Okay.

239
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,290
Doctor,

240
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,370
you have to save my friend.

241
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,370
He's only 35.

242
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,120
Calm down.

243
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,170
It's most likely a pneumothorax attack.

244
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,880
He has the heartbeat,

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,850
but he isn't breathing.

246
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,530
I'll think of something.

247
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,490
Okay.

248
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,370
The items you requested.

249
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,120
What's your name?

250
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,680
What's your name?

251
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,530
Qiu Yifei.

252
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,880
Thank you.

253
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,640
Thank you, Doctor.

254
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,730
Thank you, Doctor.

255
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,850
Thank you, Doctor.

256
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,490
Great!

257
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Wonderful!

258
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,410
Amazing!

259
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,440
Impressive!

260
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Great!

261
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,900
That was incredible.

262
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,970
Dad,

263
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,090
does Mom

264
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,930
have a boyfriend?

265
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,760
Don't worry about adult matters.

266
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,000
Focus on your studies.

267
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,240
So

268
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,410
she does have a boyfriend?

269
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,170
How would I know?

270
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,970
Go back to your room.

271
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:36,560
Go.

272
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,880
I've never seen Ning Xiang so happy

273
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
as he is today.

274
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,410
It's different

275
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,930
when a child has a mother.

276
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,680
Well.

277
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,930
How far have Liuzheng and that man

278
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,120
got?

279
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,000
Do you know?

280
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,120
I really don't.

281
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,490
It's late.

282
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Go home.

283
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,290
I'm just concerned for your sake.

284
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,420
Liuzheng is a good woman.

285
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,000
Seven years ago,

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
you drove her away.

287
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,240
Now, she's finally back.

288
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,680
As your father,

289
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
I should support you

290
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,440
and cheer you on,

291
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,120
right?

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
She said

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,050
she didn't dare to like you anymore.

294
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,320
That means

295
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,610
she does like you,

296
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,930
but she's afraid.

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,090
What do you think she's afraid of?

298
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Ning Xiang!

299
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,290
Grandpa is leaving.

300
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,290
See him out.

301
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,850
Is Grandpa leaving?

302
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,610
Yes.

303
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,090
I'll see you this weekend.

304
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,200
I'll make you delicious food.

305
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,530
I'm taking him out this weekend.

306
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,120
Also, please call me

307
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,320
before you come over next time.

308
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,730
Let's go.

309
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,760
Grandpa.

310
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,200
I want to enjoy your cooking
this weekend.

311
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,970
Next time.

312
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,680
I'll prepare delicious food for you.

313
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,120
Take care on your way home.

314
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,090
Grandpa,

315
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,490
when will you come again?

316
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,240
If you miss me,

317
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
just give me a call,

318
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,170
and I'll come right over.

319
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,490
Oh, right.

320
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Remember

321
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,730
to tell your father

322
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,090
what

323
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,730
I told you.

324
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,930
Okay.

325
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,490
Goodbye.

326
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,850
Take care on your way home.

327
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,490
Bye.

328
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,970
Bye. Take care on your way home.

329
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,730
Okay.

330
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,120
Bye.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,730
Son,

332
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,240
happy birthday.

333
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,200
Who are you calling "son"?

334
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,530
Grandpa told me to say that.

335
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
He said

336
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,240
he didn't get to say that to you today.

337
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,610
So he wanted me to say it for him.

338
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,640
Son,

339
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
happy birthday.

340
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,050
Come here. Sit down.

341
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,930
Sit.

342
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,680
Dad,

343
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,400
I have something important to tell you.

344
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,440
Go ahead.

345
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,130
Can you not be

346
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,090
so mean to Grandpa?

347
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,890
You're so mean.

348
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,130
Grandpa, Mom,

349
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,400
and I

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,040
are afraid of you.

351
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
We dare not like you anymore.

352
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,680
Was I mean to your mother?

353
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
Yes.

354
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,250
Was I mean to you and your grandfather?

355
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,090
Yes.

356
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,560
Was I?

357
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,770
Yes!

358
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,320
Really?

359
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,560
One day, you...

360
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,520
Okay.

361
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,730
I'll be nicer to you from now on,

362
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,440
okay?

363
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,090
Okay.

364
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,160
Will you be a good boy?

365
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,090
Yes.

366
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,970
Liuzheng.

367
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,130
Mr. Xue.

368
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,920
Why are you...

369
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,920
I was waiting for you.

370
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,200
Let's take a walk.

371
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,890
Okay.

372
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,650
From what you're saying,

373
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,800
Mr. Ning is a good man.

374
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,920
No wonder you've been going
to his place lately.

375
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
It was for his son.

376
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,010
I'm really sorry

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,970
for missing our arrangement.

378
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,850
It's fine.

379
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,010
No need to be sorry.

380
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,850
I'm a surgeon.

381
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,850
I need to work overtime often.

382
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,650
If something comes up at the hospital,

383
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,730
I'll need to be there right away.

384
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,560
Most people find that hard to accept.

385
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,610
Well, as you said,
it's just most people.

386
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,560
Ever since I spent
the Mid-Autumn Festival with you

387
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,040
at the hospital,

388
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,730
I've been captivated

389
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,800
by your image

390
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,610
as an angel in white.

391
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,130
It's just my job.

392
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,490
Don't put me on such a high pedestal.

393
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,490
You're a good catch.

394
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,370
I'm sure you have a lot

395
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,200
of female admirers.

396
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,250
But you're the only one I have eyes for.

397
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,730
I'm busy with work every day.

398
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,890
And I'm at the stage where
I'm moving up the ladder in my career.

399
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,130
I don't want

400
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,250
to be distracted by a relationship.

401
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,130
I know.

402
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,250
I know
you're on the rise in your career.

403
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,610
Don't worry.

404
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,040
I won't hold you back.

405
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,130
It's late.

406
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,730
Why don't I walk you home?

407
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,320
Let's go.

408
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,040
Oh, right.

409
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,440
The lawsuit

410
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,520
is going to trial soon.

411
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,580
(Beiya Hospital)

412
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,660
(First-aid Room, Emergency Department)

413
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,730
Your vitals look fine,

414
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,440
mister.

415
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,130
Everything is normal.

416
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,440
You're out of the woods.

417
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,130
Take him to the observation room later.

418
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,200
If everything's fine here, we can go.

419
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,320
Let's go.

420
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,160
I heard you guys rescued him.

421
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,770
Did you two insert that straw?

422
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,850
I did it.

423
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,370
That was very professional

424
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,400
and timely.

425
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,160
Did you know this?

426
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
He was lucky to have you guys there.

427
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Any later,

428
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,280
he would've lost his life.

429
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,010
Are you two doctors too?

430
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,320
Yes, we're from
the Neurosurgery Department.

431
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Beiya as well?

432
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Yes.

433
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,250
I'm a resident, Ding Yiyuan.

434
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,320
I just returned from overseas.

435
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,850
He is the famous Cheng Zhouyu

436
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,920
of the Neurosurgery Department.

437
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,130
Don't you know him?

438
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,160
I just got back from overseas too.

439
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,890
I'm new at Beiya as well.

440
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,040
Let's introduce ourselves.

441
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,400
I'm Xie Haojie.

442
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm the attending doctor
of the Thoracic Surgery Department.

443
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,370
Dr. Xie.

444
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,010
Nice to meet you.

445
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,010
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

446
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,370
I'll go get busy.

447
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,730
Let's meet up another day.

448
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,440
- Okay.
- All right.

449
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,160
- Goodbye, Dr. Xie.
- Thanks.

450
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,650
Bye.

451
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,090
Let's go.

452
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,970
Did you hear him?

453
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,010
Dr. Xie said I saved that man.

454
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,370
(Emergency)
Yes. You did.

455
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,560
Good work, Dr. Ding.

456
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,490
It feels great
to be a doctor and save lives.

457
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,440
Come on.

458
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,850
Let's find another place for round two.

459
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,890
No, I'm done.

460
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm not upset anymore.

461
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,130
I realized that unrequited love

462
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,970
is such a trivial matter.

463
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,920
So you're done

464
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,010
moping over Ning?

465
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,890
What else can I do?

466
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,730
I can't crack open his head

467
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,250
and check what's wrong with him

468
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,400
for not returning my feelings, right?

469
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,490
Actually, you were right.

470
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,560
I don't know anything about him.

471
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,800
I like him

472
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,090
because

473
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,010
he is the best man

474
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,010
within a 50-meter radius

475
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,650
of me.

476
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,370
Yes.

477
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,040
But don't you think

478
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
you got over him a little too fast?

479
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,130
I was cured by that guy I saved.

480
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Who's the doctor,

481
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,650
and who's the patient here?

482
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,890
Who saved whom?

483
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,370
We healed each other.

484
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,160
Let's go.

485
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,770
We need to perform outpatient duty
early morning tomorrow.

486
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,610
Thanks for today.

487
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,440
Don't say things like that.

488
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm not used to it.

489
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,010
I'll treat you to a meal next time,

490
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,920
Mr. Cheng.

491
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
Talk properly.

492
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,970
Don't mock me.

493
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,280
Who is mocking you?

494
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,440
Good morning.

495
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,850
Good morning.

496
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,250
Good morning.

497
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,320
Good morning, Mr. Ning.

498
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,970
Good morning.

499
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,970
I have an announcement to make.

500
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,280
From today onwards,

501
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,130
I no longer have feelings for Mr. Ning.

502
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,160
Is she changing the male lead?

503
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,560
Dr. Cheng,

504
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,370
you might be moving up.

505
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,850
Time to make the rounds.

506
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,200
Let's go.

507
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,010
Let's make the rounds.

508
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,890
Why did you need to see me so urgently?

509
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,090
I have a meeting later.

510
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,090
Your father asked me
to drink with him two days ago.

511
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,440
He cried.

512
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,490
How embarrassing for a man of his age.

513
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,610
What was he crying about?

514
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,770
Well, he regretted what he did.

515
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,490
He thinks the way you treat him now

516
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,650
is as good as you've disowned him.

517
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,770
Xiao'er,

518
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,730
if you're here
to put in a good word for him,

519
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,010
don't bother.

520
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,400
- Hello, Mr. Xue.
- I won't forgive him.

521
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Why are you like this

522
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,650
whenever your father is brought up?

523
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:38,890
Have a seat.

524
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,280
Thanks.

525
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,200
Why is Liuzheng here?

526
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,560
Did you call her here?

527
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,400
I deliberately

528
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,490
found a restaurant

529
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,440
closer to your hospital.

530
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,160
Be discreet.

531
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,610
Isn't that Xue Weilin from Zhanying?

532
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,440
Take a look at this.

533
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,890
Why is Liuzheng with Xue Weilin?

534
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
No wonder

535
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,610
you asked me about that guy.

536
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,920
So it had to do with Liuzheng.

537
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,130
The result of the case is out so soon?

538
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,770
If we followed the legal process,

539
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,800
certainly it's not so soon.

540
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,090
But Zhang Lei didn't want
to continue the lawsuit.

541
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,320
She looks happy.

542
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,520
He agreed to issue a public apology.

543
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,680
And...

544
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,440
Is she?

545
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,730
Looking at it again,
I think that smile looks forced.

546
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,090
This is

547
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,250
the most he could afford.

548
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,520
If we continue,

549
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,890
how much will the court award?

550
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,490
There is no clear legal standard

551
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,200
for damage for loss of reputation.

552
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,010
But from my experience,

553
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,850
it won't be more than this amount.

554
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,490
All right.

555
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,130
Why is Xue Weilin giving Liuzheng money?

556
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,160
He's helping her with a case

557
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,440
that concerns damage to her reputation.

558
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,730
I'm a lawyer too.

559
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,490
Why didn't she ask me for help?

560
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,610
Lie low.

561
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,200
She probably thinks
you're not good enough.

562
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,730
Not good enough?

563
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,970
Xue Weilin and I

564
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,400
are equally matched.

565
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,010
I'm not better than him,

566
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,440
but we're evenly matched,
at the very least.

567
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,770
Then, you're probably too garrulous.

568
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,010
What was that?

569
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,400
Watch your tone.

570
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,320
And you say you're not garrulous.

571
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,180
(Beiya Hospital)

572
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,740
(Self-payment, Cai Jinrong,
Remaining amount to be paid: RMB18,563)

573
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,180
(Pay with card)

574
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,650
I still need to pay so much?

575
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,980
(Insufficient balance,
please try another card)

576
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,680
Not enough.

577
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,090
This.

578
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,320
(Insufficient balance,
please try another card)

579
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,800
Ma'am,

580
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,730
can you hurry up?

581
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh, okay.

582
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,090
You go first.

583
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,560
What do I do?

584
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,890
Juan,

585
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,800
what's wrong?

586
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,610
I... I don't have enough money.

587
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,090
Use it to pay the medical bill.

588
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,520
Dr. Ruan,

589
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,850
I can't take your money.

590
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,770
This isn't from me.

591
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,890
This is from Lei.

592
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,560
It's the compensation he paid me

593
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
for damaging my reputation.

594
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,280
From Lei?

595
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,560
So you sued him

596
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,010
for this.

597
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,280
That's all the more reason
I can't accept this.

598
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,730
This is the money he gave you.

599
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,250
Take it.

600
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,400
This money should be used
where it's meant.

601
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,370
If he isn't taught a lesson,

602
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,890
how can he change his ways?

603
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,650
Thank you.

604
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,250
Come on.

605
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,040
Let's deposit that money.

606
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,900
(Beiya Hospital)

607
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,850
Dr. Ruan,

608
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
thank you

609
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,850
for your help.

610
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,400
Go back. No need to see me off.

611
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,800
It's all right. Let's go.

612
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,090
Thank you.

613
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,130
Oh, you're discharged, Madam Cai?

614
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,320
Dr. Ning.

615
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,160
Rest well when you get home.

616
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,040
If anything is wrong,

617
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,920
come to the hospital right away.

618
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,890
Dr. Ning,

619
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,850
I've troubled you.

620
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,800
Don't mention it.

621
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,280
Thank you, Dr. Ning.

622
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:35,890
You guys go ahead.

623
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,920
Dad!

624
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,770
Why are you here?

625
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,010
I'm here to pick up
the medicine with Grandpa.

626
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,040
Where's your grandfather?

627
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,850
He's lining up over there.

628
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:46,920
You go first.

629
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,730
I'll be there after this.

630
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,680
I'll be leaving first.

631
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,320
Let's go.

632
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,490
Who is that boy?

633
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,440
That's Mr. Ning's son.

634
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,250
Let's go.

635
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,970
I want to stay a little longer.

636
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:58,770
No.

637
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,770
(Please put away your phone
after entering the classroom)

638
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,160
Ning Xiang really likes to draw.

639
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,770
The teacher says
he has a talent for drawing.

640
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,090
It must've been hard raising him

641
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,440
on your own.

642
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,160
The boy had a hard life.

643
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,400
He was abandoned

644
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,770
at the entrance of the hospital
when he was only three months old.

645
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,800
And he had a tumor in his brain
from birth too.

646
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,920
I took a risk

647
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,040
performing that operation.

648
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,610
But he survived

649
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,970
because he was strong enough.

650
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,680
Did you ever try
to look for his parents?

651
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,850
They left him in the hospital corridor
right after he was born.

652
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,520
Where will I find them?

653
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,770
But this is good too.

654
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,370
Ning Xiang is lucky

655
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,370
that he met a good father like you.

656
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,730
Thank you for your encouragement.

657
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,280
It's my first time being a father.

658
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,370
I don't have much experience.

659
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,860
(Madam Cai's daughter)

660
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,130
Hello?

661
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,320
(Hello?)

662
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,320
(Dr. Ruan?)

663
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,250
Is something wrong with Madam Cai?

664
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,130
(No, my mother is fine.)

665
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,730
(That's good to hear.)

666
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,920
Thank you.

667
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,730
Um...

668
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,610
I wanted to ask you something.

669
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,920
How old

670
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,970
is Dr. Ning's son?

671
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,970
Six, maybe?

672
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,010
(Why do you ask?)

673
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,040
It's nothing.

674
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,920
I used to make clothes in Guangzhou.

675
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,890
I bought some clothes for the boy.

676
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,130
Don't.

677
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,320
He won't accept them.

678
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,680
(It's fine.)

679
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,040
It's not anything expensive.

680
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,200
(I'll bring them over when I can.)

681
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
What was that about?

682
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,560
It was Juan.

683
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,090
She said she wanted
to give Ning Xiang some clothes.

684
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,970
How could you give a patient

685
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,920
your personal number?

686
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,400
I didn't give them your number.

687
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,320
Why are you making a fuss?

688
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,370
You can't accept those clothes.

689
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,440
I know.

690
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,440
You have so much free time
on your hands doing all these things.

691
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,280
I see you don't have enough
on your plate.

692
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,370
We'll go on a business trip next week.

693
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,200
To where?

694
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,250
Xinzhou.

695
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,320
There's a nationwide symposium

696
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,010
next Monday.

697
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,010
You can represent

698
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,970
our research group

699
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,280
and report the results of our research.

700
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,650
Me?

701
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,520
Yes.

702
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,920
But I don't have time to prepare.

703
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,800
It's next Monday.

704
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
You still have five days.

705
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,180
(Beiya Hospital)

706
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,850
Dr. Ding.

707
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,400
Dr. Xie.

708
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160
- Morning.
- Good morning.

709
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,490
Have you had breakfast?

710
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,200
Not yet.

711
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
No? Perfect.

712
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,890
I bought two portions.

713
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,730
Thanks.

714
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,370
You're welcome.

715
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,370
I know you'd like this.

716
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,440
Are you busy today?

717
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,010
(Beiya Hospital)
Dr. Cheng.

718
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,920
What are you looking at?

719
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,250
Isn't that the new attending doctor

720
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,770
in the Thoracic Surgery Department,
Xie Haojie?

721
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,680
What?

722
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,890
You know him too?

723
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,850
His academic qualifications
are too hard not to be impressed by.

724
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,770
Dr. Xie graduated

725
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,440
from the Mayo Clinic College
of Medicine and Science.

726
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,370
He has a PhD.

727
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,040
A western doctor.

728
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,200
Oh, Dr. Cheng,
you brought breakfast too?

729
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,400
None of your business.

730
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,890
Is that for Dr. Ding?

731
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,770
Don't eat that western junk food
in the morning.

732
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,850
Eat this.

733
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,560
A national breakfast.

734
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,010
Did you forget to take your medicine

735
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,920
this morning?

736
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,890
Get that back.

737
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,160
What? Are you still going to eat it?

738
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,970
No. You'll eat it.

739
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,400
I'll go take my medicine now.

740
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,100
(Outpatient)

741
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,560
Dr. Ding.

742
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,280
Dr. Xie.

743
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,160
Dr. Cheng.

744
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,770
Heading to the outpatient clinic?

745
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,920
Yes. You?

746
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,040
Same here.

747
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,400
Dr. Ding,

748
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,610
let's have lunch together.

749
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,320
My treat.

750
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,160
Dr. Cheng,

751
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,610
why don't you join us too?

752
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:31,920
Dr. Xie,

753
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
it's Monday.

754
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,090
It's the day we get the most patients
at the outpatient clinic.

755
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,250
Who knows

756
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,280
how long we'll be there?

757
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,610
That's true.

758
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,250
I'll be leaving now.

759
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,320
Dr. Ding,

760
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,320
I'll wait for you for lunch.

761
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,010
Okay.

762
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,370
See you.

763
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,130
See you.

764
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,160
Excuse me, what time is the clinic open?

765
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,490
It might still take a while.

766
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,040
Please have a seat over there first.

767
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
He wants to get lunch with you?

768
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,250
His department sure is free.

769
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,400
Unlike ours.

770
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,490
Dr. Cheng,

771
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,800
(Neurosurgery Department)
we have a lot of patients today.

772
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,160
Should we register more patients?

773
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,800
More patients?

774
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,610
Today,

775
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,160
we'll do everything we can

776
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,520
to meet our patients' needs.

777
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,770
Register as many as possible.

778
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,490
The more, the better.

779
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,280
All right.

780
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,580
(Respect doctors' and patients' privacy,
maintain order and keep quiet)

781
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,610
Are you crazy, Cheng Zhouyu?

782
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,730
50 patients this morning?

783
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,680
Bring in the first patient.

784
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,420
(Cheng Zhouyu)

785
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,560
Give me the film.

786
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,920
You're fine.

787
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,560
No tumor, see?

788
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,850
It's clear.

789
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,680
Don't worry.

790
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,400
Just go home and get some rest.

791
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,970
What's your problem?

792
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,850
I have a headache,
and I feel a little nauseous.

793
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,920
Here.

794
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,010
Cross your arms.

795
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,560
Hold my hands.

796
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,320
Use some strength.

797
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,760
Hello.

798
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,280
Hello.

799
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,380
(Cheng Zhouyu)

800
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,460
(Cheng Zhouyu)

801
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,500
(Cheng Zhouyu)

802
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,720
Dr. Ding,

803
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,890
where are you going?

804
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,690
You've attended

805
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,370
to over 40 patients this morning.

806
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,690
I need to use the washroom.

807
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,800
Hurry back.

808
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,520
We've still got work to do.

809
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,560
Who are you?

810
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,930
Why did you lock the door?

811
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,850
Doctor,

812
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm ill.

813
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,520
Why would anyone come to the hospital
if they weren't?

814
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,040
The consultation
for this morning is over.

815
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,960
Come again in the afternoon.

816
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,170
No.

817
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,610
I came to queue at midnight last night.

818
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,370
Early this morning,

819
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,450
I got the first ticket to see you.

820
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,760
Look.

821
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,130
Patient 001?

822
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,480
Where were you?

823
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,890
I waited all morning

824
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,560
for that female doctor
to take a toilet break.

825
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,280
I say, you doctors

826
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,450
have powerful urinary system.

827
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,130
Why were you waiting for her to leave?

828
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,930
Come on. Tell me what's wrong with you.

829
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,890
Hold on.

830
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
You don't normally need
to take your clothes off

831
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
in this department.

832
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,760
My condition is special.

833
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,650
You really need to examine it.

834
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,800
You really don't need
to remove your clothes.

835
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,000
No, look.

836
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:23,850
Don't come so close.

837
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,480
- No...
- Look.

838
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:26,890
I really...

839
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,210
What's going on?

840
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,650
We're doctors.

841
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,930
There's nothing we haven't seen.

842
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,520
There's no need to feel embarrassed.

843
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,090
Describe

844
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,130
your condition.

845
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,720
Dr. Ding, take notes.

846
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
How old are you?

847
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,760
I...

848
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,410
My real age

849
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:02,890
is 32.

850
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,850
What problems do you have?

851
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,560
Well...

852
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,320
In the last six months...

853
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,130
I...

854
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,690
It hasn't been working.

855
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,480
It hasn't been working?

856
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,450
What hasn't been working?

857
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,690
Sexual dysfunction.

858
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,890
Partial

859
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,040
or complete?

860
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,800
I...

861
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,720
Dr. Ding,

862
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,760
note it down.

863
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,280
Complete loss of sexual function.

864
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,370
When did your breasts

865
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,760
start to increase

866
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,480
in size?

867
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,450
Around...

868
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,650
Three months ago.

869
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,690
Have you been
to the Andrology Department?

870
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,930
Yes.

871
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,210
But they couldn't find
anything wrong with me.

872
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,040
They told me

873
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,090
to try neurosurgery.

874
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,130
Let's get you a CT scan first.

875
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,650
Doctor,

876
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,170
do you think

877
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,890
this could be neurological?

878
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,650
It is possible.

879
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,090
This could be caused

880
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,280
by a ﻿pituitary tumor.

881
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,850
We'll be able to confirm it
once we get the CT result.

882
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,320
Dr. Ding, schedule him the checks.

883
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,040
Hurry.

884
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,610
I will have the checks.

885
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,280
Let me remind you again.

886
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,040
Do not be afraid to seek treatment.

887
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,130
If you're ill, you need to be treated.

888
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Don't miss the best time for treatment.

889
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,170
All parts

890
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,280
of the human body

891
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,560
are organs to doctors.

892
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,410
They're all the same to us.

893
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,690
Okay. I understand.

894
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,610
Thank you, Doctor.

895
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,240
Take care.

896
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,560
I'll go get the CT scan done now.

897
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,410
Your medical records.

898
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,690
Thank you.

899
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,170
Any patients left
for the morning session?

900
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,480
No.

901
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,560
No?

902
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,130
Oh, it's afternoon.

903
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,170
I guess someone won't get
to have lunch with you.

904
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,410
Settle lunch

905
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,040
by yourself, Dr. Ding.

906
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,410
Thank you for your hard work.

907
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,620
(Beiya Hospital)

908
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,170
What's wrong, Mr. Ning?

909
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,690
Driving restriction again?

910
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,890
Ruan Lang invited me over for dinner.

911
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,410
It's not a festive season or anything.

912
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,410
Why would he invite you over?

913
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,520
How would I know?

914
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,210
Am I not welcome?

915
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,850
I wouldn't dare.

916
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,760
It's good timing.

917
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,210
We'll be leaving for Xinzhou next week.

918
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,560
I can check on your progress.

919
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,620
(Beiya Hospital)

920
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,450
Checkmate.

921
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,090
Then, I'll...

922
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,410
- Mom, Dad, I'm home.
- I'll stack.

923
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,320
You're here, my brother-in-law.

924
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,210
Zhiqian is here.

925
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,410
Liuzheng.

926
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,520
You're home.

927
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,410
Perfect timing.

928
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,480
Mr. Xue,

929
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,370
you don't know him, right?

930
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,410
I do.

931
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,890
Liuzheng's mentor,

932
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,930
Mr. Ning.

933
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,280
Yes.

934
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,240
Not only is he my sister's mentor,

935
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,320
but he's also...

936
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,960
I know.

937
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,800
He's your sister's ex-husband.

938
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,210
Yes.

939
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,240
You're here, Zhiqian.

940
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,000
I didn't know

941
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,890
you had a guest.

942
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,320
I'll come again next time.

943
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,480
I'll take my leave now.

944
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,610
Don't, Zhiqian.

945
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,170
Come in. Sit.

946
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,850
Even if anyone should leave,
it's not you.

947
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,760
Mr. Ning,

948
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,850
why not stay for dinner?

949
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,800
Liuzheng's future

950
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,890
depends on you.

951
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,210
Have a seat.

952
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,280
My sister's future

953
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,000
is in your hands, Zhiqian.

954
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,560
I heard you and my sister
will be going to Xinzhou

955
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,320
for a business trip next week
just by yourselves.

956
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,130
And you need to tutor her.

957
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,240
Perfect.

958
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,520
You can tutor her

959
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
after dinner.

960
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,090
Come.

961
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,610
Let's continue our game.

962
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,560
Mrs. Ruan,

963
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
we have a lot of mouths to feed tonight.

964
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,760
Why don't I cook us a few dishes?

965
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,240
No.

966
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,800
No need.

967
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,960
I can handle it.

968
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,800
That's right.

969
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,450
Come. Let's continue our game.

970
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,040
Come.

971
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,760
Liuzheng,

972
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,210
come out and attend to our guests.

973
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,240
Ruan Lang.

974
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:28,960
Come here

975
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,690
and give me a hand.

976
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,130
Mom, I don't know how to cook.

977
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,090
Well.

978
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,960
I'm keeping my brother-in-law company.

979
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,560
I'll help you.

980
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,240
- Come, Mr. Ruan.
- Come.

981
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,000
Let's continue.

982
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,850
Come.

983
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,210
What's going on?

984
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,370
It's Ruan Lang's doing.

985
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,890
He knew Xue Weilin was here,

986
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,130
but he still told Ning Zhiqian
to come over.

987
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,480
Xue looks perfectly fine.

988
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,450
But Zhiqian

989
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,690
looks as awkward

990
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,690
as a cow on a crutch.

991
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,760
Where did you learn that?

992
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,320
I'm not a language teacher

993
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,480
for nothing.

994
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,000
I think

995
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,650
both of them are good choices.

996
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,040
What are you talking about?

997
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,520
Go here.

998
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,320
Zhiqian,

999
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,650
have a fruit.

1000
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,280
All right.

1001
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,850
Here.

1002
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,800
Have some soup, Mrs. Ruan.

1003
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,240
Liuzheng.

1004
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,720
I'll do it.

1005
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,520
Drink some soup too.

1006
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,930
You've lost weight.

1007
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,450
Zhiqian,

1008
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:50,650
have some fish.

1009
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,450
- Thank you. I'll do it.
- My mom made this just for you.

1010
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,320
Zhiqian,

1011
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,650
eat more.

1012
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,280
Xue,

1013
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,370
let's have a toast.

1014
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,210
Sure.

1015
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,170
Here. I'll pour the drinks.

1016
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,170
But Mr. Ruan,

1017
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,000
I can't hold my liquor well.

1018
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,960
What if I drink too much

1019
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
and can't go home?

1020
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:06,930
Don't worry.

1021
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,280
Drink as much as you like.

1022
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,450
I'll send you home if you need.

1023
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,450
Zhiqian,

1024
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,170
drink more.

1025
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,040
If you get drunk, you can stay here.

1026
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,320
It won't be your first time anyway.

1027
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Drink your soup.

1028
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,610
Then...

1029
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,090
I won't drink tonight.

1030
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,040
Mr. Ruan,

1031
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,930
I'll give you and Mrs. Ruan a toast

1032
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,090
with juice instead.

1033
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,720
I wish you both good health.

1034
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,930
All right.

1035
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,930
Dad.

1036
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:30,800
Put that down.

1037
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,960
Put that down.

1038
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,040
Eat first.

1039
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,090
It's bad to drink on an empty stomach.

1040
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,720
Isn't that right, Zhiqian?

1041
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,320
Dad knows his body.

1042
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,800
Stop picking a fight.

1043
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,090
What's the matter with you, Liuzheng?

1044
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,320
Why do you keep lecturing me?

1045
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,800
We have an outsider here.

1046
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,130
Ruan Lang.

1047
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,610
Xue is my guest.

1048
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,370
He's a family friend.

1049
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:53,800
Mind your manners.

1050
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,690
It's fine, Mr. Ruan.

1051
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,370
I wish you victory

1052
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,690
in every game.

1053
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,760
All right.

1054
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:04,610
Dad, I think Ruan Lang is right.

1055
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,850
It is bad

1056
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,800
to drink on an empty stomach.

1057
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,130
And you're up in your years.

1058
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,850
You should drink in moderation.

1059
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,280
And others shouldn't encourage you

1060
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,170
to drink.

1061
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,370
It is not good
to drink on an empty stomach.

1062
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,760
Let's have soup instead.

1063
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,930
Come. We'll have soup.

1064
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,410
All right. Come.

1065
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,170
Let's have a toast with soup.

1066
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,890
Here. Cheers.

1067
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,240
Good.
