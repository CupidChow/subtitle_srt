3
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,540
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

4
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,080
Any news?

5
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,490
We have some information

6
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,650
about Dr. Ning.

7
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,210
Jeff, go get Dr. Ruan now.

8
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,960
Okay.

9
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,320
Two bodies were found.

10
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,720
Dr. Ruan.

11
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,080
Dr. Ruan!

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Any news about Dr. Ning?

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
The people from the military

14
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,520
were sent to search for Bablu's house.

15
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,210
Have they found him?

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,930
Bablu already left in advance, but...

17
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,210
But what?

18
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,210
They found a male corpse.

19
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,010
It... Is it him?

20
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,680
No, no, it's not clear at the moment.

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,650
The body has been charred.

22
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,490
But according
to the height and body shape,

23
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,210
it looks like Dr. Ning.

24
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,050
Liuzheng,
nothing has been confirmed yet.

25
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,570
Hang in there.

26
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,770
The DNA of the corpse

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
has been sent back
to China for comparison.

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,290
And the result
will be available in two days.

29
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,850
Dr. Ruan,

30
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,490
you should get mentally ready.

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,720
No.

32
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,490
I've seen Bablu.

33
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,130
He loves his son so much.

34
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,650
If he kills Dr. Ning,

35
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,290
no one can save Alfa's life.

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
We believe that Alfa might have died

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
on the way.

38
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,880
On the one hand, they might
kill Dr. Ning to vent their anger.

39
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,720
On the other hand,
we might just kill him

40
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,770
to reduce the pressure of rescuing him.

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,290
If that's the case,

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
why did they burn the corpse?

43
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,520
People's bodies are being burned.

44
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,370
That's just the way he does things.
It's his style.

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,570
Keep it together.

46
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,420
(Beiya Hospital)

47
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,280
Still no call
from the DNA testing facility?

48
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,000
It won't do any good
for you to sit here alone.

49
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,400
My dad says he wants you
to join a meeting.

50
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,490
Did he say why?

51
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,210
Keep me informed

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
as soon as you have any news.

54
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,880
Come in.

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,280
Come.

56
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,440
Have a seat.

57
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,250
Do you know Shen Su?

58
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,440
No.

59
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,490
He's a cyclist as well.

60
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,160
He was also seriously injured

61
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,440
in the Ruining race.

62
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,370
Take a look at his medical record.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
(Ruining Hospital Admission Record)
Although

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,960
(Shen Su, unconsciousness, vomiting)
the injury was to his head,

65
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,000
his condition isn't
as serious as Nie Xing's.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,560
However, treatment
at Ruining's local hospital

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
was not very effective.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,000
They want to transfer him
to our hospital for treatment.

69
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,000
I would like to hear your opinion.

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,810
Can I ask

71
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,970
you all for your thoughts first?

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,050
Dr. Shi.

73
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,440
I dare not say anything.

74
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,930
It's all at your discretion,

75
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,560
Vice President Ding.

76
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, you.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,840
Professionally,

78
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,970
we will respect

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
your opinion.

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,700
(Progress Note)

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
I need to study

82
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,210
the medical record carefully

83
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,440
and discuss this

84
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
with my colleagues
in the Neurosurgery Department.

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,320
All right.

86
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,320
I await your response.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Are the results out?

88
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,370
No.

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,490
I spoke to the lab tech.

90
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,090
I told them to let me know
as soon as the results are available.

91
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,280
All right.

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,400
Who would like to go first?

93
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,810
Initially,

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
Shen Su's condition

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,370
wasn't as bad as Nie Xing's.

96
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,490
But after all this delay,

97
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,320
it's about the same as Nie Xing's now.

98
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,690
Look.

99
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,320
He has the lung infection,

100
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
the intracranial hematoma,

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,690
and intracranial hypertension.

102
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,650
He has all of those.

103
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,280
So I suggest we don't take any risks.

104
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,880
Dr. Wu?

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,440
I share Dr. Bai's opinion.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,650
Nie Xing is number one in the country.

107
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,210
Shen Su is number two.

108
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,400
If we accept this case,

109
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,370
the media will swarm us again.

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
We got such a bad rap
for failing last time.

111
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,650
While it's true that we shouldn't
be bothered by those people,

112
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,840
getting criticized

113
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,120
never feels good.

114
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Dr. Qin?

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,440
I agree with Dr. Bai.

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,650
We should play it safe.

117
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,490
What about you?

118
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:44,930
I agree as well.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,770
No one wants to try again?

120
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,880
In any case, I won't be taking part

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,000
in Shen Su's surgery.

122
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,320
I need to work on my skills too.

123
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
The meeting ran late today.

125
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,440
Let's all go home.

126
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,720
Good work.

127
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,810
Bye.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,210
Let's go.

129
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,280
Get up and have some water.

130
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,720
Thanks.

131
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,520
Do you want me

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
to call Ruining Hospital back?

133
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
No need.

134
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
I have to make that call myself.

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,840
All right.

136
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
I'm just reluctant to give up.

137
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,250
Then, let's give it another try.

138
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,400
No.

139
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,840
Neither Beiya nor I
can afford another failure.

140
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll do it with you.

141
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,890
Forget it.

142
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
This is really not a wise decision.

143
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,760
Are the results of Ning's DNA test out?

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,640
Hello? Cheng Zhouyu speaking.

145
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,010
(Dr. Cheng?)

146
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,640
(This is Nie Xing's father.)

147
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,930
Mr. Nie?

148
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,130
(Hello.)

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,490
(I haven't thanked you properly
for what you did.)

150
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,930
You're too kind.

151
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,010
I let you down.

152
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,890
(You did your best.)

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,250
(I suggested Shen Su's parents)

154
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,130
(transfer him to Beiya Hospital.)

155
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,810
Can I ask why?

156
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,930
(Shen Su and Nie Xing
had similar conditions.)

157
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,890
(You gained experience)

158
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,720
(when you treated Nie Xing.)

159
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,520
(It would be a waste for you)

160
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,810
(not to put that experience to use.)

161
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,370
(Can you try again?)

162
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,960
Thank you.

163
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,570
(Thank you, Dr. Cheng.)

164
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,890
Let's try again.

165
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll be with you.

166
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,060
(Come back soon!)

167
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,370
Hello?

168
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,520
Liuzheng,

169
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
it's not him. It's not Mr. Ning.

170
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,840
Got it.

171
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,160
Thank you.

172
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,560
Well?

173
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,890
It's not him.

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
Mr. Ning is still alive.

175
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,840
Dr. Ning is still alive!

176
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,010
This is great.

177
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,370
It's from Ruan Lang.

178
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,760
Go on.

179
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,160
Hello?

180
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,130
(You finally picked up.)

181
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,570
(What are you doing?)

182
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,130
I miss you.

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,760
Remember to thank your sister.

184
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,570
Stop.

185
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,640
Don't touch him.

186
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,130
Keep your distance, please.

187
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,010
When will my son wake up?

188
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,890
It has been three days.

189
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,890
I think you better send him

190
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,400
to the hospital as soon as possible.

191
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,810
Stop talking.

192
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,130
If you can't save Alfa's life,

193
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,810
I'll kill you.

194
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,010
But if you save his life,

195
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,050
I'll reward you.

196
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,520
His life is in your hands.

197
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,370
Not me.

198
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,570
Bacteria from your body

199
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,640
will infect Alfa.

200
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,370
You know?

201
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,050
So please go out.

202
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,140
(OUTPATIENT)

203
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
Sorry, Dr. Ruan.

204
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,330
We haven't received any news
about Dr. Ning from the military.

205
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,890
They're searching
for Bablu's secret base.

206
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,200
They say it may take some time.

207
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,960
But it has been ten days.

208
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,010
Don't worry.

209
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,490
If there is no news about Dr. Ning,

210
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,160
it means Alfa is still alive.

211
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,280
Thank you.

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,050
I have to go back to work.

213
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
How are you feeling today?

214
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,890
Not bad.

215
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,690
I'll call your father in.

216
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,010
Wait.

217
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,810
What's wrong?

218
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,050
Are you scared of him?

219
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,280
But he loves you so much.

220
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,690
Doctor,

221
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,570
do you know Spider-Man?

222
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,450
Yes, of course.

223
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,050
Can you tell me his story?

224
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,280
Okay.

225
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,640
Spider-Man used to be a normal boy.

226
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,050
But one day,

227
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,890
he got bitten
by a genetic-engineered spider.

228
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,080
And then, he possesses superpowers.

229
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,810
Go and tell the doctor
I'm looking for him.

230
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,610
Dr. Ning,

231
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,480
Bablu wants to see you.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,690
Okay.

233
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,450
You need to take a rest.

234
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,360
Go to sleep.

235
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,330
Okay.

236
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,120
How's Alfa doing?

237
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,120
His condition remains stable,

238
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,970
and he is out of danger.

239
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,240
But the operation
cannot offer complete recovery.

240
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,160
He still needs

241
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,520
radiochemical treatment.

242
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,160
So I suggest you

243
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,120
let me take him back

244
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,330
to the hospital.

245
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,930
Impossible.

246
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,450
The government troops
will not let him go.

247
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,050
So I will not let you go.

248
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,280
Bablu, have mercy.

249
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,360
Bablu, please.

250
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,520
Stop!

251
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,730
Doctor, you seem to mind too much.

252
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,280
This is my business.

253
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,090
I'm a doctor!

254
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,640
You can't kill people

255
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,450
in front of me!

256
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,280
Please.

257
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,690
They have my sister.

258
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,330
I had to tell them

259
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,360
where the base is.

260
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,730
And I have to inform you

261
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,850
to leave in advance, please.

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He did all this for his family.

263
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,280
For Alfa's sake,

264
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
can't you understand him?

265
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,400
I never pay attention to reason.

266
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
All I want is results.

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,880
In fact, Dahl doesn't become
a better country because of you!

268
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,450
Doctor, leave us. Leave us alone.

269
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,730
What Alfa needs

270
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,160
is not a cold-blooded father!

271
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,880
He doesn't want

272
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,640
a weak father more than a cruel one.

273
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,850
You make everyone scared of you!

274
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,090
Why don't you make everyone respect you?

275
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,330
Bablu.

276
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,400
Bablu, please.

277
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,000
Bablu, please.

278
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,640
Have mercy...

279
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,090
Everybody must pay

280
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,240
for their actions,

281
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,050
so that the world will be nice.

282
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,210
Hey, Bablu!

283
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,930
If I bring him back to life,

284
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,690
will you let him go?

285
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,160
Help me.

286
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,730
Help me!

287
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,100
(Beiya Hospital)

288
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:48,810
The doctor is here.

289
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,000
Shen Su!

290
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,050
- Keep fighting, Shen Su!
- Keep fighting, Shen Su!

291
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,690
You can do it!

292
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,880
Shen Su!

293
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,280
Doctor!

294
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,480
Doctor!

295
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,450
(Keep fighting!)
Doctor!

296
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,730
You can do it!

297
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,690
Prepare to close the skull.

298
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,280
Okay.

299
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,880
How are the patient's vitals?

300
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,450
Some indicators are going down.

301
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,970
Is what happened to Nie Xing
happening again?

302
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,330
Speed up.

303
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,050
Tasan is okay, sir.

304
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,810
Go and bring that doctor to me.

305
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,400
Yes, sir.

306
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,690
Want to have some?

307
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,520
No, thanks.

308
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,160
I heard Tasan got to live.

309
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,090
I hope you can keep your word

310
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,210
and let him go.

311
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,640
Why did you save Tasan?

312
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,930
I'm a doctor.

313
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,610
Why do you want to be a doctor?

314
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,090
That's my dream.

315
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,160
And what's your dream?

316
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,850
My dream is to safeguard my country.

317
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,730
Wars take your loved ones from you.

318
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,210
And you make more people
lose their loved ones.

319
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,050
Don't forget

320
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,240
that the person in front of you

321
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,610
is the monster feared by his people.

322
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,810
Then, why did you aim off

323
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,760
for five centimeters?

324
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,810
Here.

325
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,360
What's this?

326
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,280
Have a sip,
and then you'll know the answer.

327
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,160
I really like to see you embarrassed.

328
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,690
It's too strong. I don't like it.

329
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,090
I like seeing you embarrassed.

330
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,980
(Inpatient Building)

331
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,000
They're coming out.

332
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
How did it go?

333
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,450
What's the situation?

334
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,400
Tell us.

335
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,520
(Keep fighting, Shen Su!)

336
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,120
How is he?

337
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,050
Shen Su's operation

338
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,480
is a success.

339
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,090
Yes!

340
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,090
This is great!

341
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,480
Wonderful!

342
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,160
Thank you, Doctor!

343
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,880
This is great!

344
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Thank you, Doctor!

345
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,120
Bablu,

346
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,400
thank you.

347
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,050
Dr. Ning,

348
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,610
thank you for saving my life.

349
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,120
I will never forget you.

350
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,090
Take care of yourself.

351
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
I would never like to see you again.

352
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,000
Hey, Bablu,

353
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,360
I think it's time for me to go.

354
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,090
Alfa doesn't need me anymore.

355
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,400
But I still need you.

356
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,330
I will never work for you.

357
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,570
This is my principle.

358
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,400
Principles or death. Choose one.

359
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,050
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

360
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,120
We haven't received any news
about Dr. Ning from the military.

361
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,050
They doubt that Bablu

362
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,930
has hidden in a secret base.

363
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,120
But it has been months.

364
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,850
Bablu has threatened Dr. Ning.

365
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,280
He has no choice

366
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,640
but to give medical assistance to him.

367
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,090
If what you said is true,
the situation will be very tricky.

368
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't think he would do it.

369
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,210
Relax, Dr. Ruan.

370
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,930
Dr. Ning is a very good person.

371
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,730
I think he'll make it.

372
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,120
Nice painting.

373
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,330
Have you ever met the real Spider-Man?

374
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Yes, I have. I also want to be him.

375
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,240
Alfa,

376
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,090
I'll leave here today.

377
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,480
No, I don't want you to leave.

378
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,240
But my family and friends
are waiting for me.

379
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,090
Okay.

380
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,120
Gift?

381
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
Yes, it's for you.

382
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,520
That's you.

383
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,730
Me?

384
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
This is so fat.

385
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,850
Hey, Alfa,

386
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
keep this in mind.

387
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Spider-Man can be a superhero

388
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,760
not because

389
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,160
he has superpower like a spider,

390
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,000
but because

391
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,360
of his heart.

392
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,970
That's important.

393
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,880
Okay.

394
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,120
Come here.

395
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,210
I'm going to miss you.

396
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,330
I'll miss you too.

397
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,570
Doctor, get in the car immediately
before I change my mind.

398
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,050
Dr. Ning,

399
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,160
if you want to throw off,
we can pull over.

400
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,730
No thanks.

401
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,930
All right.

402
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,330
Dr. Ning,

403
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,240
I can only take you here.

404
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,970
Just walk to the east five miles,
and you'll arrive at the hospital.

405
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,810
Thank you.

406
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,640
Dr. Ning,

407
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,880
thank you and Dr. Ruan,
for saving my son.

408
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,050
She is the bravest woman I've ever met.

409
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,240
Please say hello to her for me.

410
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,810
I will.

411
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,610
One thing I must remind you.

412
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,850
Alfa hasn't recovered yet.

413
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,330
And there's a high possibility
of future relapse.

414
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,240
Don't worry.

415
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
I will take good care of him.

416
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,480
Why did the Chinese doctors
come to Dahl?

417
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,640
And why did you save my son?

418
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,360
If you are capable of helping others,

419
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,360
you have a moral obligation
to do these things.

420
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,520
That's the meaning of your life.

421
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,050
Not a choice.

422
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,690
But a responsibility.

423
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,210
Who said that?

424
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,360
Spider-Man.

425
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,520
The Chinese philosopher
Mencius once said

426
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,970
when you're poor, just help yourself.

427
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,880
When you're prosperous,
you should help the world.

428
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,930
This sentence is for you.

429
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,760
Good luck.

430
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,900
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

431
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,330
Dr. Ning! Dr. Ning is coming back!

432
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,810
Dr. Ning is coming back!

433
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,050
Dr. Ning!

434
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,930
Dr. Ning is coming back!

435
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,050
Liuzheng, Ning Zhiqian is back.

436
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
Ning Zhiqian is back!

437
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,060
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

438
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,450
Let's celebrate! Dr. Ning is back!

439
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,280
How's Alfa?

440
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,610
He still needs

441
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,850
to undergo radiochemical therapy,

442
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,280
or he might have a relapse.

443
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,130
Oh, right.

444
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,000
They wanted me

445
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
to send you their regards.

446
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,280
I see you and Bablu are getting along.

447
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,680
That's now.

448
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
When I just got there,
he threatened me every day,

449
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,890
saying that he would kill me.

450
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,890
Afraid?

451
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,650
Everyone's afraid of death.

452
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
But I know how to put up a front.

453
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,610
I was at a disadvantage, but I didn't
let him think he got the upper hand.

454
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,850
Wait here.

455
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,330
Go and dance.

456
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,090
Liuzheng! Come here!

457
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,890
What's up?

458
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,610
For me?

459
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,520
Do you like it?

460
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,280
Let me guess
where this necklace came from.

461
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,440
Six years ago,

462
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,130
on a sunny afternoon,

463
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,240
you chose this

464
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,520
with a beautiful lady.

465
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,240
You even wore out her feet.

466
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,050
Simeone

467
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,680
is just like Tan Ya.

468
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,170
They can't keep any secrets.

469
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,240
Do you like it?

470
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,330
It's all right.

471
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,570
Just all right?

472
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,810
Does it look good?

473
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes.

474
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,570
Which looks better? Me or the necklace?

475
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,650
The necklace, of course.

476
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Are you happy?

477
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,000
I hate you.

478
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,410
You hate me? Why?

479
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,410
You made us waste six years.

480
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,410
Why didn't you oppose me

481
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,240
when I brought up divorce six years ago?

482
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,370
I was too young.

483
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,370
I kept doubting myself,

484
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,200
wondering if I didn't love you enough.

485
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,170
Now, I've figured it out.

486
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,440
I was afraid

487
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,000
that I couldn't bring you happiness.

488
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,850
Don't you know?

489
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,810
I'm the happiest when I'm with you.

490
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,810
Do you love me enough now?

491
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,280
Let's never be apart again.

492
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,650
You're going to be fine.

493
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

494
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,410
Next one.

495
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,610
Dr. Ruan,
it's time to get off work.

496
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,410
Are there no other patients left?

497
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm the last one.

498
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,920
Give me a second to tidy up.

499
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,850
See that?

500
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,680
The government troops are watching me.

501
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,720
They want to find out where Bablu is

502
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,130
from me.

503
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,520
What do you plan to do?

504
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,170
I won't work for Bablu,

505
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,680
but I won't sell him out.

506
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,130
I was busy
with surgeries this afternoon.

507
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,330
I had a missed call.

508
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,760
I suspect it's from Bablu.

509
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Why would he call you?

510
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,960
I think Alfa might've had a relapse.

511
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,170
I told him to send an email

512
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,330
if he couldn't reach me.

513
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,330
I left him your email address.

514
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,330
Could you check for me?

515
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,370
I did receive a new email.

516
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,090
Really?

517
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
His brain tumor recurred.

518
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,240
The more you fear it,
the more likely it is to happen.

519
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,520
He wants you to go to him.

520
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,760
This is the map.

521
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,480
What should we do?

522
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,890
Delete it.

523
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,050
Delete it?

524
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,700
(Delete email)

525
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,850
Chris.

526
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,720
Yes, sir.

527
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,610
What's going on?

528
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,090
The file has been deleted.

529
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,090
Can you restore it?

530
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,130
Let me try my best.

531
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,860
(Success)

532
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,260
(Lose)

533
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,890
No way.

534
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,090
darn it.

535
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,720
Please. There are patients here.

536
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,890
Dr. Ning.

537
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,050
Nice to finally meet you.

538
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,170
Who are you?

539
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,280
My name is Abu,

540
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,090
and I'm the head
of the government security forces.

541
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,680
We're here to ask you a few questions

542
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,760
about Bablu.

543
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,090
Bablu?

544
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,330
Where is he?

545
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,050
What are you talking about?

546
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,170
Don't play tricks with us.

547
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,280
We know you deleted that email.

548
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,000
Where is he?

549
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,200
I don't know.

550
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,330
Where is he?

551
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,130
Do not test my patience.

552
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,280
Guards!

553
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,410
Please don't.

554
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,520
Get out of the way now.

555
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,920
Who gives you the right to arrest us?

556
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,850
This is Dahl,

557
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,680
and Dr. Ning has been assisting

558
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,240
Bablu's armed forces.

559
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,610
We are here to arrest him.

560
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,850
Are you his accomplice?

561
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,720
You want to go to jail with him?

562
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,850
Right. This is Dahl.

563
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,920
But we're Chinese citizens.

564
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,760
And you don't have the right
to arrest us.

565
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,330
You said Dr. Ning worked
for the armed forces.

566
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,170
Do you have any evidence?

567
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,680
Calm down, everyone.

568
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,520
Lieutenant Officer.

569
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,810
Dr. Ning.

570
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,890
Don't get me wrong.

571
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,000
Our colonel has a headache,

572
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
and we're here to ask you
to do our colonel a favor.

573
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,330
And he wants to have
a cup of coffee with you.

574
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,240
Please.

575
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,650
This way.

576
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,570
I'll go with you.

577
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,650
What's going on, Liuzheng?

578
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,000
Why did they take Ning Zhiqian away?

579
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,240
I'm going to the Chinese Embassy.

580
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,370
Where's Jeff?

581
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,170
Yes.

582
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,960
Please take me to the Chinese Embassy.

583
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,200
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

584
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,920
I'll go and take a look.

585
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,650
Don't worry. It's going to be fine.

586
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,330
Everything is okay.

587
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,000
Dr. Ning.

588
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,960
Have a seat.

589
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:47,850
Thanks,

590
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,000
but I never drink coffee.

591
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,000
Have a try.

592
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I don't like it.

593
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,650
Dr. Ning,

594
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,000
you better tell us

595
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,050
where Bablu is sooner than later.

596
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,720
What would you do if I tell you

597
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,960
where Bablu is?

598
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,650
Kill him.

599
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,370
And then?

600
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,090
You kill this one.

601
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,200
But another will be born.

602
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,280
Bablu is the biggest enemy of us.

603
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,370
He must disappear.
