=Episode 8=

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,770
Today,

4
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,680
there is a family

5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
who insisted on reaching the finish line

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,810
even though they met numerous obstacles.

7
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,170
Their spirit deserves
to be acknowledged.

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,850
That's why our school has decided
to award them with a special award.

9
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,320
They're

10
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,000
Ning Xiang and his parents from K2!

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Let us clap for them!

12
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,250
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

13
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
We have a medal now!

14
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,450
We finally have a medal!

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,980
(Parent-Child Sports Meet)

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,090
We held

17
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,450
this Parent-child Sports Meet

18
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,890
mainly to improve
the harmonious relationship

19
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,330
between parents and their children.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,090
Your family

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,090
has done very well today.

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,810
We should learn from you all.

23
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,920
And, your effort is worth commending.

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,970
Here is your

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,760
Best Family Award.

26
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,720
Thank you.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,690
Go and take it.

28
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,560
Let us welcome Ning Xiang's parents

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,890
to give a speech.

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,280
Regarding the Best Family Award,

31
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,530
actually, we aren't...

32
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,360
Pass me the microphone.

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,920
Hello, everyone.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm Ning Xiang's mother.

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
First, I'm delighted

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,530
that I was able to attend

37
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,560
the Parent-child Sports Meet,

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
and win a medal here.

39
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,120
But actually, I feel quite
ashamed after receiving this medal.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm busy with work usually.

41
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,480
That's why I had no time
to keep my son company.

42
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,280
That's why I would like
to thank the school

43
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,920
for organizing this
Parent-child Sports Meet.

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
This event is very meaningful.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Thank you, everyone.

46
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,090
-Nice!
-Nice!

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
That's all from me.

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,610
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,660
(Best Family Award)

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,720
Dad, Mom,

51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,330
give me a kiss.

52
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,640
My medal fell.

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,810
Stand straight.

54
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,320
You acknowledged that
you're Ning Xiang's mother

55
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,850
in front of him today.

56
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,090
How do you plan to explain
the truth to him?

57
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,810
Will you be his mother
for the rest of his life?

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,040
I had no choice.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,010
Don't tell me you intended to announce
that I'm not his mother

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,410
in front of everyone?

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,760
How will he face his friends
and teachers in the future?

62
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,440
He has to face it sooner or later.

63
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,880
How will you salvage the situation

64
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,160
if you say something like that?

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Why don't you

66
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,040
go and find his biological mother then?

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,290
Everything will be resolved by then.

68
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,970
I would've done so long ago

69
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,690
if it was viable.

70
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,200
Why don't you find a replacement
for her then?

71
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,130
What do you mean?

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
You want me to find a stepmother
for him?

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,130
That's easy.

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,040
I just need to attend blind dates.

75
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,200
That's your freedom.

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,360
You don't need to discuss it with me.

77
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,530
You should hurry up.

78
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,880
If not, your son will be heartbroken

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,250
that he doesn't have a mother.

80
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,250
Goodbye.

81
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,290
What's wrong?

82
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,290
Gastric attack.

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,220
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

84
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,290
What's wrong?

85
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,880
Did Ning Zhiqian mistreat you?

86
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,090
That's not it.

87
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,440
What's wrong with you then?

88
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,050
I don't know how to explain.

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,240
He'll buy presents and cakes for me

90
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,800
during my birthdays,

91
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,930
our anniversaries,

92
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,680
and

93
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
other occasions.

94
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,120
He always remembers the birthdays

95
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
of my parents' and younger brother's.

96
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,530
Isn't that great?

97
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,440
Isn't that considerate of him?

98
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,370
But I feel like something's missing.

99
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,850
I feel like he's only trying his best
to maintain the marriage.

100
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,560
How could that be?

101
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,970
You're so nice to him

102
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,000
that even I'm touched by your actions,

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,370
let alone Ning Zhiqian.

104
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,760
Maybe he's only

105
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,320
touched by my actions.

106
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
The better I treat him,

107
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,170
the more pressure he gets.

108
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,050
I don't think that's the case.

109
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,490
However, he's under
huge pressure lately.

110
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,640
He needs to modify his thesis

111
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
and prepare for an assessment.

112
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,370
And, the hospital submitted
Ning Zhiqian's name

113
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,090
to the national outstanding
neurosurgeon selection.

114
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,370
He's joining the selection as a

115
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,800
representative of Beiya's youth team.

116
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,120
You see,

117
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
everyone in the hospital
is keeping an eye on him.

118
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,560
Wait,

119
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
why didn't I know about that?

120
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,170
Didn't he tell you when he went home?

121
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,440
He never told me anything.

122
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,050
I realize that you two
lack communication.

123
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,320
When you go back,
have an open conversation with him.

124
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,560
Everything will be fine by then.

125
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,610
I wish to.

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
But he's always tired and sleepy

127
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,090
when he reaches home.

128
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,120
He ignores me.

129
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,880
He ignores you?

130
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,440
If so, just give him a hug.

131
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,610
After that...

132
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,640
Do you need me to teach you
what to do after that?

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Stop it! You're doing this again.

134
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,410
Let's be honest here.
Do you know how to give a hug?

135
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,930
Everything can be resolved with a hug!

136
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,760
What are you doing here?

137
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,000
It's pouring out here.

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
Why didn't you go home?

139
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,850
You want to have some time alone again?

140
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,050
Are you troubled by something?

141
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,490
Why didn't you share them with me?

142
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,000
What's wrong?

143
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,490
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

144
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,410
I met up with Tan Ya today.

145
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
She said you were
under huge pressure lately.

146
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,760
Is she telling the truth?

147
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,730
I didn't tell you

148
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,760
because I was afraid
that you might be distracted.

149
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,410
I wanted you to focus
on your postgraduate exam.

150
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,440
We've been living together
for quite some time.

151
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,000
But I think you never told me

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,240
what was on your mind.

153
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,290
I thought I understood you well.

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,050
But I realized

155
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,930
that I didn't understand you at all.

156
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
Was I too busy lately?

157
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,200
Was my care for you not enough?

158
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,800
If

159
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,440
you think you're maintaining
this marriage

160
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,640
out of responsibility,

161
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,410
you can tell me directly.

162
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,680
Or,

163
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,490
if you think
I'm not doing well in certain areas,

164
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,730
you can tell me directly.

165
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,000
I can change for the better.

166
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,170
You just need to express

167
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,730
your true feelings and thoughts.

168
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,970
I have nothing to express.

169
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,490
And, it's not like you're doing badly

170
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,090
in certain areas.

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,640
You don't need to change anything.

172
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,970
In the past,

173
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
I'm sure you would share
your joy and sorrow

174
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,120
with Dong Miaomiao, right?

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
But you won't share them with me.

176
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,050
Sometimes,

177
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,610
I felt like I could forsake anything
just so you could argue with me.

178
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,800
But you don't even argue with me.

179
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,200
Why should I argue with you?

180
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,560
Where are you going?

181
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,490
I want to return to my parents' house.

182
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,850
Let me send you there.

183
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,120
That's unnecessary.

184
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,800
Why are you acting like this then?

185
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,660

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120

I'm back.

203
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,890
Why are you back?

204
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,250
Where's Zhiqian?

205
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,010
He's working overtime.

206
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,730
Did you two argue with each other?

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,440
I just want to stay home

208
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,800
and enjoy your cooking.

209
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,400
Come here.

210
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,380
- Hurry.
- This is...

211
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,680
- What's going on?
- Stop asking her questions.

212
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,680
Just make her some food.

213
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,560
Go and prepare the beef. Hurry.

214
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,520
Fine.

215
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,800
I'll go and prepare it.

216
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,090
Here.

217
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,520
I made this especially for you.

218
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,280
What's the matter?

219
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You guys can go ahead.

220
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,200
Don't tell me it's...

221
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,090
Don't spout nonsense.

222
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,490
I have something to tell you.

223
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,250
I...

224
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,770
I think I'm pregnant.

225
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,770
That's great.

226
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,440
Congratulations.

227
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,970
I haven't confirmed it yet.

228
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,920
Don't tell him first.

229
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
I know.

230
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,320
You want to surprise him, right?

231
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,770
(You're something else.)

232
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,130
But I heard

233
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,160
that the manager
spoke with Ning Zhiqian today.

234
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,250
He intended to allocate
the study slot in the US to him.

235
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,200
He's going to study in the US?

236
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,320
That's right.

237
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,090
But you're pregnant.

238
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,400
I don't think
it's appropriate for him to go.

239
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,680
(You two can discuss it yourselves.)

240
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,560
Anyway, this chance will come again.

241
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,400
(I have to go.)

242
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,680
Go ahead.

243
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,370
(Eat up.)

244
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,130
Eat up.

245
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,970
Have some vegetables.

246
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,200
What's the matter?

247
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,560
Are you unhappy?

248
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,610
Did you two argue?

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,680
That's not a big deal.

250
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,160
Just talk it over with him.

251
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,010
Mom.

252
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,730
I would never believe

253
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,650
that Zhiqian mistreated you.

254
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,730
At most, it's just

255
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,320
trifle affairs.

256
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,730
There's no overnight grudge
between husband and wife.

257
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:01,920
Dad.

258
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,400
Zhiqian, you're here?

259
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,130
Wait a second.

260
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,610
Sufen.

261
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,010
Zhiqian is here.

262
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,730
Zhiqian, you're here?

263
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,320
Mom.

264
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,920
Where are you going?

265
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,520
I'm going to cook.

266
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,920
Alright.

267
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,440
Go inside.

268
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I bought movie tickets for us.

269
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,400
You don't want to go?

270
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,890
We can go home then.

271
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,970
Of course I want to.

272
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,200
Let's go.

273
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,890
This is the first we are
watching a movie together, right?

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,920
Wait, this isn't the first time.

275
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,400
It's the second time.

276
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,090
You fell asleep during the first time.

277
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,730
I was so tired back then.

278
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,370
I would've forgotten about it
if you didn't remind me.

279
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,890
Are you tired today?

280
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,890
You can rest on my shoulder.

281
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,320
What are you doing?

282
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,400
Rest on my shoulder.

283
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm not tired.

284
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,650
Let's enjoy the movie together.

285
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,650
You can rest on my shoulder
if you're tired.

286
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
Can you guys stop talking?

287
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,280
What's wrong?

288
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,250
Is your tummy aching?

289
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
You should stop taking cold drinks then.

290
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,130
I think I'm pregnant.

291
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,650
Wait, what about your postgraduate exam?

292
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,090
Aren't you happy that we have a baby?

293
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm so happy.

294
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,280
But it's too sudden for me.

295
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,490
I've already decided.

296
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,040
If we do have a baby,

297
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,730
I'll postpone the exam.

298
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,320
Huh? You want to postpone it
after so long?

299
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,130
After all, I cannot over-exhaust myself
during the first three months.

300
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,320
What about this?

301
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,040
I'll apply
for a half-day leave tomorrow.

302
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,130
I'll bring you for a checkup.

303
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,680
Let's head to the baby store first.

304
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,090
Stop jumping around.

305
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,160
We're buying baby products already?

306
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,770
It's rare for you to be free, you know?

307
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,650
Let me see.

308
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,130
What's wrong?

309
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,650
Is the baby reacting already?

310
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,850
That's not it.

311
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,800
What's the matter then?

312
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,890
Are you okay?

313
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,650
My tummy hurts.

314
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,850
Your tummy hurts?

315
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,130
Why don't we head to the hospital?

316
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,250
No need for that.

317
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm on my period now.

318
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,560
I am not pregnant.

319
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,970
I think I felt nauseous because

320
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,610
I took too much cold food.

321
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,160
Have some warm water. I just poured it.

322
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,280
Put this on.

323
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,770
(Ning,)

324
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,320
(getting a study slot in the US)

325
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,400
(is a rare opportunity.)

326
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,200
(I'll give you three days
to consider it.)

327
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,850
(Think about it.)

328
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,520
Ning.

329
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,200
Don't you have anything to tell me?

330
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,490
What do you mean?

331
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,250
Like your opportunity
to study in the US.

332
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,090
How did you find out?

333
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,320
Tan Ya told me about it.

334
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,850
Tan Ya is such a blabbermouth.

335
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
When will you go there?

336
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,850
How long will you be staying there?

337
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,090
Initially, I didn't want
to tell you about it.

338
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
I've already rejected the offer.

339
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,490
Why did you reject it?

340
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,320
It's a great opportunity.

341
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,200
Why aren't you going there?

342
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,650
I thought you were pregnant.

343
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm not pregnant now.

344
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,040
It's all my fault.

345
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,250
Call your superior right now

346
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,130
and see if you still stand a chance.

347
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,090
You have to go.

348
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,890
It's fine. This chance will come again.

349
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,370
Is it because you're
not willing to part with me?

350
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,650
I applied for a visa

351
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,850
when I applied for my study overseas.

352
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,560
I can join you.

353
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,440
If both of us go there together,

354
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,160
people in the hospital will say

355
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,090
that we're abusing public resources

356
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,370
and taking advantage of the hospital.

357
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,400
You have a point.

358
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,980
I will definitely feel regretful

359
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,850
if you reject the offer

360
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,130
for my sake.

361
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,040
You should go.

362
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,800
You don't need to.

363
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,970
Didn't I tell you already?

364
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,090
The chance will come again.

365
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,130
I still have a chance
to go in the future.

366
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,400
Okay then.

367
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,730
If so, I think I'll refund

368
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,800
all of the baby products we bought.

369
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,770
Don't do that.

370
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm sure we'll use them in the future.

371
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,730
Okay.

372
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,250
We can keep them for now.

373
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,770
Where are you going?

374
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,440
I'll pour some water for you.

375
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,040
You don't need to take care of me.

376
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,650
Just take good care of yourself.

377
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:10,890
Thank you.

378
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,280
Just put it on.

379
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,850
I'll go and lie down for a second.

380
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,680
Call me anytime if you need anything.

381
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,280
What's wrong?

382
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,920
Why are you sitting here alone?

383
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,850
I can't sleep.

384
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,130
I'm just relaxing here.

385
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,040
Why can't you sleep?

386
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,400
Is it because your work
is stressing you out?

387
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,850
Maybe.

388
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,160
You have a surgery
to do tomorrow, right?

389
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Tomorrow I have three surgeries.

390
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,610
If so, you have to sleep.

391
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,200
Let's go.

392
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,400
Look at the time.

393
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,800
I can't sleep.

394
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,610
I just want to sit here.

395
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I know now.

396
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,730
Are you hungry?

397
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,040
I'll warm some milk for you.

398
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,890
I'll cook you an egg as well.

399
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,650
It'll be quick.

400
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm not hungry.

401
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,160
Don't trouble yourself.

402
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,800
Are you troubled by something?

403
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,970
Tell me. I can share
your burden with you.

404
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,090
Don't just keep it to yourself.

405
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,610
It's fine.

406
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,010
I just want to be alone for now.

407
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,280
You should go to sleep.

408
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,560
I'll join you in a second.

409
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,900
(2019 Jiangzhou Beiya Hospital, China)

410
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,680
Hello, Dr. Ning.

411
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,400
Nice to meet you.

412
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,890
Hello.

413
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,730
I just joined the Department
of Internal Medicine.

414
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,890
How should I address you?

415
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm Huang Qian.

416
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,560
Nice to meet you.

417
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,320
I saw you during

418
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,280
the hospital's sports event last time.

419
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,090
Is that so?

420
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,010
You're so tall and handsome.

421
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,970
Thank you.

422
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,850
Are you only having an apple

423
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,610
for lunch?

424
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,090
Yeah. I'm on a diet.

425
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,440
Although you eat a lot,

426
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,040
you still have a great figure.

427
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,970
It's because I'm busy.

428
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,920
You'll be just like me when you're busy.

429
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,040
I have a drink here. You can have it.

430
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,200
Chi Forest?

431
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,970
Ladies love it.

432
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,970
Thank you.

433
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,280
Here you go.

434
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,320
It's fine. You can have it.

435
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,680
I'll grab a drink myself.

436
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,610
Can you open it for me?

437
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,090
It's spraying everywhere.

438
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,040
Do you have tissue paper?

439
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,090
I do.

440
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,140
I think the soft drink is bubbling
because of your good look.

441
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,440
Thank you.

442
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,280
Dr. Ruan,

443
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,920
have you prepared
the medical records I requested?

444
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,650
Dr. Ruan.

445
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,520
I'm busy tonight.

446
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,720
Can you pick Ning Xiang up for me?

447
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,650
The pick-up pass.

448
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,450
Thanks.

449
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,930
This will be my last time
doing it anyway.

450
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,800
Dr. Ruan, get me some water.

451
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,040
Mr. Ning,

452
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,890
here you go.

453
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,610
(Door's open.).

454
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,320
Mom,

455
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,650
these are the new slippers
Dad bought for you.

456
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,800
You can change into them.

457
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,480
Thank you.

458
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,130
Mom.

459
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
Dad said we need to wash our hands

460
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,450
when we come back from outside.

461
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,760
Okay.

462
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,450
Mom.

463
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,320
The burger and fries you bought for me

464
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
were so delicious.

465
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,090
You should bring me there
once a week.

466
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,410
After that, we should
go to the amusement park.

467
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,890
Okay?

468
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,320
Promise me.

469
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,040
Okay.

470
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,210
Let's go and draw something together.

471
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,650
Okay.

472
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,090
Mom,

473
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,000
sit here.

474
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,210
Okay.

475
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,480
This is great.

476
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,720
Mom, I can finally draw you now.

477
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,000
Mom, you're so beautiful.

478
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
(I'll be late.)

479
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,650
(Tell Ning Xiang to rest early.)

480
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,690
(Seems like you enjoy your date.)

481
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
(Please hurry up.)

482
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,850
(Is Ning Xiang okay?)

483
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,960
How did you get the color on your face?

484
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,410
You look so messy now.

485
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,130
Now, you look messy too.

486
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,850
You're so mischievous!

487
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:02,890
Come on.

488
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,210
Go and wash your hands.

489
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,320
Alright.

490
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,410
Wash your face.

491
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,850
You little devil.

492
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,650
The sky will darken soon.

493
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,000
And, it'll turn cold.

494
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,720
But Qi knows

495
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,000
that the sun will rise again

496
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,760
and bring warmth and light to the Earth.

497
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,620
(Little Prince's Room.
Please knock before going in)

498
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,170
(Door's open.).

499
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,520
Is Ning Xiang asleep?

500
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,760
Why have you only returned now?

501
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,000
Didn't you tell me to hurry up?

502
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,690
I texted you in the afternoon.

503
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,850
I didn't tell you to hurry back now.

504
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,560
What's with your outfit?

505
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,240
He splashed some colors on my shirt.

506
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,090
I had to scrub it off.

507
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:53,930
Hey, you're a grown-up.

508
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,800
It's not like
there is only one shirt here.

509
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,240
Just take any of them.

510
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,210
You'll catch a cold like this.

511
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,450
Wear this.

512
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,560
Thank you.

513
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,320
Since you're back, I'll be leaving.

514
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,850
Are you sure you want
to head outside like this?

515
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,930
I'm not trying to criticize you here.

516
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,040
But can you be more responsible
as a father?

517
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,690
Can you spend more time with your child?

518
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,850
You want to talk about the kid?

519
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,690
Here. Sit down.

520
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,040
- Have a seat.
- What are you doing?

521
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,210
Have a seat.

522
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,090
I can sit by myself.

523
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,720
Well.

524
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,410
I have two consultations
to complete in the next few days.

525
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,480
And, I have several surgeries
to handle too.

526
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,090
I will be quite busy.

527
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,850
Can you please take care of my son

528
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,450
for a few more days?

529
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,610
Do you think you're
the only busy person here?

530
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,650
I have an assessment, you know?

531
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,000
If I fail my assessment,

532
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,850
your reputation as my mentor
will be affected.

533
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,850
Yeah, you're right.

534
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,930
You just need to take care of him
until this weekend.

535
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,960
I'm busy during the weekend.

536
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,960
Until Friday?

537
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,480
Three days.

538
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,130
Just three days. Is that okay with you?

539
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,520
Fine.

540
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,930
You agreed to it, right?

541
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,040
Thank you so much.

542
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I'm sure Dr. Huang is a nice lady.

543
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,090
Yeah,

544
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:50,850
she's pretty chubby.

545
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,280
The Department of
Internal Medicine is pretty good.

546
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,040
They get off work early,

547
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,850
and they don't need to handle surgeries.

548
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,410
She can take care of your son for you.

549
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,210
You should hurry up.

550
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,480
Actually, you are pretty quick.

551
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,760
You just met her during lunch,

552
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,890
but you're already dating her at night.

553
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,210
What date?

554
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,480
I had a consultation to complete.

555
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,090
You're using work as an excuse

556
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,800
to spend more time with her.

557
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,560
Wait. What nonsense
are you talking about?

558
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,410
You're imagining things.

559
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,000
