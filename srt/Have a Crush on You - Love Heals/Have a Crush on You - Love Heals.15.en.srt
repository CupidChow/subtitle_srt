=Episode 15=

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,961
Study well from my brother-in-law.

4
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,880
Ruan Lang.

5
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,240
Come and help me wash the dishes.

6
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,039
(Ning Zhiqian)

7
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,640
What is this?
Why does it have my name on it?

8
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,520
It is my punching bag.

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,439
This part is torn.

10
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,759
Why didn't you sew it?

11
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,640
This one.

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,479
Check it.

13
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,360
Close the door.

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,239
It's your turn.

15
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,599
Don't space out.

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,360
I'll put comments

17
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,479
if there are any issues.

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Later, I'll explain them to you
one by one.

19
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,519
Mr. Ning.

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
What do you think?

21
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
Don't you know that? You wrote it.

22
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
Move.

23
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,319
It's your turn.

24
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,920
Where was my last move?

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,399
Your "Horse" moved here.

26
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,280
Who is this guy?

27
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,119
He is a lawyer.

28
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,640
A great one.

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,479
He lives in a huge mansion

30
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,479
and drives an expensive car.

31
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,479
Lawyers like him

32
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,280
cannot be compared to my brother-in-law

33
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,479
who is a noble doctor.

34
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,080
Xue is nice.

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,519
Don't say that.

36
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,720
He is nice towards me and your dad.

37
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
What's so nice about it?

38
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,440
You should stand firm

39
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,560
and pressure my sister.

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,880
I like Zhiqian too

41
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,720
but your dad likes Xue.

42
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,600
Dad fell for his tricks.

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,919
That guy is quite smart.

44
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,639
He doesn't go to work

45
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,239
and comes here to play chess with Dad.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
Don't say that.

47
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,639
I still approve

48
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,000
of Xue.

49
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,560
Of course.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,799
I also want

51
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,119
your sister to reconcile with Zhiqian.

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,480
However, I'm sure you saw

53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,639
her attitude that day.

54
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,840
If we are forcing her,

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
she will be rebellious.

56
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,239
If she doesn't reconcile

57
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
with Zhiqian,

58
00:04:59,359 --> 00:04:59,799
then

59
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Xue Weilin can become the substitute.

60
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,399
What are you talking about,

61
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,440
Madam Pei Sufen.

62
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,639
You are a teacher.

63
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,399
What are you doing?

64
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,679
Preparing a rebound guy?

65
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,440
Don't say that.

66
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,280
Your dad always has a backup plan

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,840
when he plays chess.

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
Backup plan?

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,119
You should kill all of my sister's

70
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:16,919
backup plans

71
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,040
and leave only my brother-in-law.

72
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,199
It also

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
sounds quite reasonable.

74
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,959
That's it, Mom.

75
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,399
Let me tell you.

76
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,959
My sister and
Brother-in-law's remarriage

77
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,160
requires the right time,
the right place and good support.

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
Where does good support come from?

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,600
From our firm stand.

80
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,519
Do your best.

81
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,639
I understand.

82
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,639
Check.

83
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,000
Your move.

84
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,600
I admit defeat today.

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,919
I can't beat you at all.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,760
No. Let's play another game.

87
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,600
Let's play another game.

88
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,399
I know your level.

89
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,440
What's wrong with you today?

90
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,919
It's getting late.

91
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,440
Let's finish up for today.

92
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,639
It's already 11?

93
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,959
Well, that's...

95
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,239
Yes.

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
Why haven't

97
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,119
Liuzheng and Zhiqian come out yet?

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,760
Dad.

99
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,440
Mr. Xue.

100
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,760
It's getting late.

101
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,040
Why don't you go back first?

102
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,679
My brother-in-law and my sister

103
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,639
might only come out

104
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,959
tomorrow morning.

105
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:26,959
Mr. Ruan.

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll be...

107
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,840
Where's my sister?

108
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,600
She fell asleep.

109
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,559
She's asleep?

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,999
Yes.

111
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,840
She has been busy

112
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,559
until midnight recently.

113
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,800
It was tough.

114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,559
Yes.

115
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,920
She has been working overtime
in the last few days.

116
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,600
Night shifts.

117
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,959
It's late. I'll be leaving.

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,879
Brother-in-law.

119
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,040
Let me send you off.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,639
Sure.

121
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,480
Mr. Ruan.

122
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,720
If there's nothing else,

123
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,759
I'll also be leaving.

124
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:11,480
Xue.

125
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm sorry

126
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
for not taking good care of you.

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,920
It's fine.

128
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,240
It's lively here
with so many people around.

129
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,600
When I'm free,

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,439
I'll visit again.

131
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,519
Yes.

132
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,840
Come and play with me again.

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,480
Sure.

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Take care.

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,079
Mr. Ruan and Mrs. Ruan.

136
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:28,559
Goodbye.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,800
What's going on?

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,840
Are you leaving?

139
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,040
Go on.

140
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,199
Ruan Lang.

141
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,399
Do you

142
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,199
not know me well?

143
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,959
I don't want to know more.

144
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,559
Do you know

145
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,639
what your sister is thinking about?

146
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,999
I don't care what she's thinking about.

147
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,160
I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

148
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,439
Don't pursue my sister.

149
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,639
It's impossible.

150
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,079
Let me put it this way.

151
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Mr. Xue,

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,959
I think

153
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,319
you are great.

154
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,439
Many girls will pursue you.

155
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
My sister and Brother-in-law

156
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,399
are a couple
manufactured from the same batch.

157
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Even if you have great packaging,

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,160
you don't belong to the same batch.

159
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
Don't try to fit in.

160
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,079
Do you want to become her lover?

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
Go back if you have nothing else to do.

162
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,360
Stop coming here.

163
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,920
Mr. Ning.

164
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,120
It's hard to get a taxi at this time.

165
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,959
Let me send you.

166
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,800
You've been busy for the whole day.

167
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm sure you are exhausted.

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,240
I'm fine.

169
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,160
I heard from Liuzheng

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,759
that both of you will be

171
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,680
working in Xinzhou.

172
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,959
Yes.

173
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:40,959
I have a friend

174
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,639
in Xinzhou

175
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,639
in the travel industry.

176
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,319
I can arrange for him

177
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,639
to take you around the place.

178
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,519
It's not necessary.

179
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
Mr. Ning, you are a quiet person.

180
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,800
It depends.

181
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,680
I think Mr. Ning

182
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,639
has some misunderstanding towards me.

183
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
If you are interested to know me better,

184
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,199
you will realise

185
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,600
that the rumours

186
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,920
are baseless

187
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,079
and exaggerated.

188
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,120
No.

189
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,800
It's best that you don't have
any misunderstandings.

190
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm not interested to know you better.

191
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,759
I like how straightforward

192
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,840
you are, Mr. Ning.

193
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,840
I'll be honest with you then.

194
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:23,920
I like Liuzheng.

195
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,280
I like her a lot.

196
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,199
In terms of our age,

197
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,280
star sign and personality,

198
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,999
we are also
very suitable for each other.

199
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,519
First of all,

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
our parents are friends.

201
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,519
They know each other well.

202
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,079
Next,

203
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,199
she is a doctor.

204
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:38,800
I am a lawyer.

205
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,680
I have enough time to accompany her.

206
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,999
I like gardening.

207
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,439
I love art.

208
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,160
We also share

209
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,639
a common hobby.

210
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:52,680
We love to watch movies.

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,199
I can let her enjoy the joy in life.

212
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
You like Liuzheng.

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,920
Does she like you?

214
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,240
This is between us.

215
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,920
It's not as simple as you think.

216
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,559
Keep your eyes on the road
and drive safely.

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,800
Excuse me.

218
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,959
Do you have a blanket?

219
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,439
Sure. Please wait for a while.

220
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,879
Your blanket.

221
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Thank you.

222
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,600
Sleep for a while longer.

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,519
We'll land soon.

224
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,120
You're so serious.

225
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,040
I want to memorise it well.

226
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,120
Am I too strict towards you?

227
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,680
A strict teacher
produces excellent disciples.

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Why did you choose

229
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,559
neurosurgery?

230
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,120
There are only
a handful of female neurosurgeons

231
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,519
in the country.

232
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,199
What you can do,

233
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,559
I can do it as well.

234
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,240
There's no need for you
to turn into me.

235
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,879
I'm not trying to turn into you.

236
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:51,680
I want to surpass you.

237
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,519
It's good to have dreams.

238
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,860
(Beiya Hospital)

239
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:12,800
Doctors.

240
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,759
Do you still remember me?

241
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,800
Wu Youwei.

242
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,480
Quick. Take a look at this for me.

243
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:22,879
How is it?

244
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,319
See this?

245
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,439
It is confirmed.

246
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,280
It's a pituitary tumour indeed.

247
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,399
So...

248
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,840
Is this what caused

249
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,759
that part of me to not work?

250
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
If the pituitary tumour

251
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,079
is pressing on organs and tissues,

252
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,959
it will cause

253
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,559
gonadotrophin secretion disorder

254
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,240
which affects your reproductive ability.

255
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:44,879
Then...

256
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,319
Is there a cure for me?

257
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:48,079
No.

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,240
I mean...

259
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,199
As long as I remove
the pituitary tumour,

260
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:52,959
I will be

261
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,559
able to use "it" again?

262
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,439
Doing a microsurgery

263
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,600
from the nasal cavity

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,079
to remove the tumour

265
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,280
will probably relieve

266
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,079
all your symptoms.

267
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,800
That's too amazing.

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,680
It's so simple.

269
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,800
It's just that simple.

270
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,680
What do you think?

271
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,600
Go to the neurosurgery department
to get an appointment.

272
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,680
-Create the appointment.
-Sure.

273
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,280
All right.

274
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:11,800
Then...

275
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,280
I'll be going.

276
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,959
Go on.

277
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,959
Thank you so much.

278
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,519
The pituitary tumour

279
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,959
is really big.

280
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,559
Sure.

281
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,160
It's great.

282
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,959
I'll be leaving then.

283
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,480
Sure.

284
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,800
Thank you.

285
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,879
I understand his feelings actually.

286
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,439
Sir. Miss. Please take a look.

287
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,399
This is our latest collection.

288
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,199
Come and have a look.

289
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,999
What's wrong?

290
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,120
I think you need a new look.

291
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,999
I don't plan to buy clothes here.

292
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,360
It's all right. I'll buy it for you.

293
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,360
This looks nice.

294
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,040
How much is this?

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
This is the latest piece.

296
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,439
This set costs 999 yuan.

297
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:03,160
This suits you.

298
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,679
This is a clearance item.

299
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,559
We only have it in large.

300
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,279
Whatever.

301
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,199
Come here.

302
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,520
Are you serious?

303
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,000
It fits her like a glove.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,919
Put it in a bag. I'll pay for it.

305
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,520
Here.

306
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,480
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

307
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,760
It's all right.

308
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,400
You are representing my research group.

309
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,559
You must be presentable.

310
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,159
I'm sorry
that you have to spend so much.

311
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,760
Does someone think

312
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
I look too beautiful

313
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,439
and you don't want
other people to notice my beauty?

314
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,559
That is exactly

315
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,480
what I'm trying to do.

316
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:47,199
I hope

317
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,720
they can see your professionalism.

318
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,279
Thank you.

319
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,079
Take care.

320
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,679
Thank you.

321
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,559
Come and do your hair.

322
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,400
(Muming Studio)
I'll just go back

323
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,880
and wash it myself.

324
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,720
It's all right. This is on me.

325
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry
for making you spend so much money.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,919
Mr. Ning.

327
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:13,559
Hello.

328
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,000
Give me the things.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Who is getting their hair done?

330
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,279
Her.

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Please take a seat.

332
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,840
I'm going to the glasses shop.

333
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,000
Sure.

334
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,919
Let's invite Dr. Ruan Liuzheng

335
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:28,959
from Beiya Hospital's

336
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,199
neurosurgery department
to give her speech.

337
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,380
(2019 Meeting Background)

338
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
Everyone here

339
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
is an expert in neurosurgery.

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,439
I'm sure all of you know

341
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,919
how complicated and meticulous it is

342
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
(Brain GPS System)
to carry out surgery on the brain

343
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,439
compared to other surgeries.

344
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,559
In recent years,

345
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,199
through the
rapid technological advancements

346
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,039
in medical imaging
and computer technology...

347
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,159
So,

348
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,279
the computer navigation system

349
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,240
is a new leap

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
in the neurosurgery technology field.

351
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,079
It unites accuracy, flexibility,

352
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,199
minimally invasive surgery and speed.

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,480
That's all for my speech today.

354
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,439
Thank you, everyone.

355
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,000
Why don't we

356
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,240
go to another restaurant?

357
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:01,720
No, Tan Ya.

358
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,000
I said it's my treat.

359
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,559
I'm acting as a domineering CEO
in my next job.

360
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
Think of it as
experiencing life with me.

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,079
Can you claim it from production?

362
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,439
Don't care about that.

363
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,439
Just place your order.

364
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,720
It's claimable.

365
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:17,880
You can order.

366
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,919
I don't really...

367
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,799
S set meal.

368
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,039
Sure.

369
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
Which wine do you want?

370
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,240
We don't drink. Thank you.

371
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,079
Sure.

372
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,240
Let me get the glasses for you.

373
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,640
Why are you looking at me?

374
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,919
Tan Ya, if you like this place,

375
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:46,880
we can come here often.

376
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
No.

377
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,600
Once is enough

378
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,480
for experiencing life.

379
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Tell me.

380
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:52,799
Why are you

381
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,680
treating me so well today?

382
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,279
I missed you.

383
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,840
You missed me?

384
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,240
Are you using me

385
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,720
now that your sister isn't around?

386
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:03,880
In my heart,

387
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,039
you are just the same as my sister.

388
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
Seriously...

389
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,159
You are so naughty

390
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:09,880
since young

391
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,679
except for your sweet mouth.

392
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,679
Right?

393
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,220
Is it easy to act as a domineering CEO?

394
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
I think so.

395
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,580
I just need the right attitude.

396
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,439
He has OCD

397
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,959
and doesn't care about others
when he does things.

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,240
His words...

399
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,000
Enjoy.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,559
Always has that energy

401
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,400
that makes you want to slap him.

402
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,640
Why do I feel like the person

403
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,439
is similar to Ning Zhiqian?

404
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,360
Since you are a domineering CEO

405
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,760
in this act,

406
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,199
you must be the male lead.

407
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,720
Second male lead? That's great.

408
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,079
I only have two lines.

409
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,039
Lady.

410
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,720
You have successfully
attracted my attention.

411
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,039
I want everyone to know.

412
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,240
This restaurant

413
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
belongs to you now.

414
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,480
No.

415
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,400
I can't keep the act going anymore.

416
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:15,360
It's very good.

417
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,799
Very domineering.

418
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,439
It feels real, right?

419
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
Indeed.

420
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,720
Jiang Cheng?

421
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,919
Wait for me outside.

422
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,760
I'll come out later.

423
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,520
Why are you here?

424
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,799
Who is that?

425
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,039
A client.

426
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,199
Client?

427
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,340
Why would a client run away
after she saw me?

428
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:01,760
Who is he?

429
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:02,959
Ruan Lang.

430
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,079
Liuzheng's brother.

431
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,559
You are Ruan Lang?

432
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,159
Jiang Cheng, right?

433
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:08,919
Yes.

434
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,400
Jiang Cheng.

435
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,520
Yes. I am Ruan Lang.

436
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,240
What's wrong?

437
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,159
It's nothing.

438
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,120
A few days ago at midnight,

439
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,559
you sent my wife home.

440
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,199
Today at midnight,

441
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,679
you are dating my wife.

442
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:19,959
It's nothing.

443
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,039
I thank you.

444
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,640
Trying to accuse me instead?

445
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,079
That was your mistress, right?

446
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,679
You are an adult.

447
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,679
Aren't you ashamed?

448
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,400
You're just a toy boy.

449
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,120
Why are you acting arrogant?

450
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,000
Who are you calling a toy boy?

451
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:30,720
You.

452
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,520
Do you think

453
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,319
I dare not hit you?

454
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,919
Hit me. Come on.

455
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:35,360
How dare you
seduce your sister's best friend.

456
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,199
Aren't you ashamed?

457
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,079
Cut the nonsense!

458
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,439
Fine.

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880
I saw everything

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,679
and remember everything today.

461
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,439
Even my client got scared.

462
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
You shouldn't have stopped me.

463
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,199
I should

464
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,199
teach that scumbag a lesson!

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Tan Ya.

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Are you all right?

467
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,880
Actually, I had a premonition.

468
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,279
I just didn't expect

469
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,760
to meet them here tonight.

470
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,120
It's not worth it

471
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,360
to feel sad over a man like this.

472
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm not sad.

473
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,959
This is what makes the whole thing sad.

474
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,279
All right.

475
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,880
Go home.

476
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm leaving.

477
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,480
Tan Ya.

478
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,039
Why don't you stay here tonight?

479
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,439
I'll get a room here for you.

480
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
Rest well.

481
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,240
That's not right!

482
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,799
Yaya is still at home.

483
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,029
I have to

484
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,440
bring her to kindergarten
tomorrow morning.

485
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,400
Tan Ya.

486
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,039
Don't argue with him when you go back.

487
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,199
I don't want you to be angry.

488
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Will you forgive him?

489
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't know.

490
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,319
I only know

491
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,720
that my life still goes on.

492
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,000
Ruan Lang.

493
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:37,360
Thank you for the meal today.

494
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:39,959
It has been many years

495
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,199
since I had a meal

496
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,120
at a fancy place.

497
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,600
Don't say that.

498
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,679
I want to make you happy

499
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,760
because you are

500
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
very important to me.

501
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,279
When I said

502
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,319
I wanted to become an actor,

503
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,679
everyone in my family objected to it.

504
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,799
You are the only one
who supports and motivates me.

505
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:56,880
Because I'm your fan.

506
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,559
I will always support you.

507
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,480
Tan Ya.

508
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,720
If you think

509
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,959
I was too reckless today,

510
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,720
I'll change.

511
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,799
Ruan Lang.

512
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,120
Do your best.

513
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,880
Become a male lead soon.

514
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:12,799
I have high hopes for you.

515
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Liuzheng!

516
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,959
It's you?

517
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Liuzheng, why do you look like this?

518
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,120
Your speech today

519
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,199
was so good.

520
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:45,039
No.

521
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,799
It's a collective effort
from our research group.

522
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,480
(2019 Meeting Background)
Liuzheng, for you.

523
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,199
Hello, Dr. Ning.

524
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:48,880
Thank you.

525
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,079
My former classmate.

526
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,679
Shu Ran?

527
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,240
Yes.

528
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,600
When did you come back?

529
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,720
I just came back.

530
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,720
Give me a second.

531
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,679
I'll tell Mr. Ning.

532
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,039
Sure.

533
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,240
Did you hear

534
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,919
our research results?

535
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,039
Yes, it was incredible.

536
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,600
Mr. Ning.

537
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:00,880
-Mr. Ning.
-Hello, Mr. Ning.

538
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:01,880
Hello.

539
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,880
You are tanned.

540
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:04,880
Well,

541
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,600
I won't be eating with you tonight.

542
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,959
I'm eating with my friends.

543
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Help me hold this.

544
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,000
When are you coming back?

545
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,279
I think I'll be back before midnight.

546
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's go.

547
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,039
Drink less.

548
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,039
We are leaving.

549
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:15,720
Mr. Ning.

550
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:17,720
Your shoelace is untied.

551
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,319
I don't have a shoelace.

552
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,480
Are you joking with me?

553
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,319
You're playing a prank again.

554
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
Why are you still the same?

555
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,559
Ruan Liuzheng, hurry up.

556
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,919
I'm here.

557
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:33,319
Sure.

558
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,400
Let's meet again next time.

559
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,199
Why are you in my room?

560
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,000
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

561
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,679
What's wrong?

562
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,799
I drank too much today.

563
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,919
My stomach is feeling unwell.

564
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,520
Whom did you

565
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
drink so much with?

566
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:13,880
I thought

567
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,199
someone don't drink usually.

568
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,000
I wonder who is so important.

569
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,799
Get dressed. Let's go to the hospital.

570
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:24,880
No.

571
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,679
I'll call an ambulance for you.

572
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,919
I'll buy medicine for you.

573
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
There isn't a pharmacy around the hotel.

574
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,439
Don't trouble yourself.

575
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,400
It hurts.

576
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,480
I'm fine.

577
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
I'll boil water for you.

578
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:52,799
I'm not drinking.

579
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:55,000
Hot water doesn't cure everything.

580
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,400
Whatever.

581
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,000
Turn around.

582
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,520
What is it?

583
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,319
Let me rub your belly for you.

584
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,640
My stomach is over here.

585
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,760
How old do you think you are?

586
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,319
You are past 30

587
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,919
yet you still
can't take care of yourself.

588
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,199
I really pity Ning Xiang.

589
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
No wonder he left biscuits in your car.

590
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,279
He still needs to worry about you
at such a young age.

591
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,799
Do you feel better?

592
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,279
Much better.
Thank you.

593
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,840
Thank you.

594
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,880
It feels so comfortable.

595
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,720
You're so annoying!

596
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Lie on top.

597
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,439
Are you fine now?

598
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,559
I'm leaving then.

599
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,120
Are you just going to leave,

600
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,199
Dr. Ruan?

601
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,240
Sleep well.

602
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:20,400
You'll be fine tomorrow.

603
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm leaving.

604
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,319
I just arrived at Entrance 2.

605
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,840
Dr. Ning!

606
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:03,919
Dr. Ning!

607
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:05,679
Dr. Ning.

608
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,520
Shu Ran, why are you here?

609
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,159
I agreed to send you off.

610
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,159
How can I break my promise?

611
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,199
Some Xinzhou specialities.

612
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,279
Don't reject it.

613
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,319
Why are you

614
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,439
bringing me gifts besides coming here?

615
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,959
Let me introduce you.

616
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,959
Shu Ran. Lucy.

617
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,120
My classmate in the United States.

618
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,959
Dr. Ruan, Ruan Liuzheng.

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,439
Hello.

620
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,079
Dr. Ruan.

621
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,760
Your speech was very successful.

622
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,400
Congratulations.

623
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,600
Thank you.

624
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,799
It's all the hard work

625
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,159
of Mr. Ning and our research group.

626
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,600
Dr. Ruan.

627
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,039
Having a mentor like Dr. Ning

628
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,400
is so enviable.

629
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,760
During yesterday's dinner,

630
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,039
Mr. Ning especially

631
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,199
introduced you

632
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,439
to the country's experts
in the neurosurgery field.

633
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,199
What a pity you weren't there.

634
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,559
Oh.

635
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,679
How were you last night?

636
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,400
I was fine.

637
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,880
What are you talking about?

638
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,520
You would've slept on the streets

639
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,679
if I didn't carry you back.

640
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,319
Did I meet you

641
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,400
in the hotel corridor?

642
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,360
Shu Ran, we have a flight to catch.

643
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
I'll call you later.

644
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,840
Safe flight.

645
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,439
Sure.

646
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,360
Safe flight.

647
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,919
Take care.

648
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,720
Bye.

649
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,120
Sure.

650
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,959
Go back.

651
00:33:58,959 --> 00:33:59,520
Leave.

652
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

653
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,640
Leave first.

654
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,799
Go back first. Hurry.

655
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,760
Bye.

656
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,600
Hurry.

657
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,400
Bye.

658
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,600
Actually, you don't have to

659
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,479
drink so much for me.

660
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,319
What do you want?

661
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,840
I wanted to drink.

662
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,559
You have always been proud.

663
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
You will never

664
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,840
spend too much effort on drinking.

665
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,319
I know.

666
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,759
You did it for my future.

667
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,079
Dr. Ruan.

668
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,840
You are not the only person
with friends and classmates.

669
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,680
I do as well.

670
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,400
I was happy to meet my classmate

671
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,640
and drank more.

672
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:49,999
You are overthinking.

673
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,400
Fine. Regardless,

674
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,479
I still have to thank you.

675
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,960
I learned a lot from this trip.

676
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,840
Did you see my classmate

677
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
coming out of my room last night

678
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,759
so you are having some weird thoughts?

679
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:12,880
Not at all.

680
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,319
Wu Youwei.

681
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:31,360
Why do you need to talk to me
on the rooftop

682
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,680
instead of the ward?

683
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,079
Also, Dr. Ding asked you

684
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,319
to sign the surgery agreement.

685
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,360
Why didn't you sign it?

686
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,319
You don't want to do it anymore?

687
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,559
Well...

688
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,120
Can Dr. Ding

689
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,479
leave us alone for a moment?

690
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,680
Why should I go away?

691
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,719
I only want to tell

692
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,200
a male doctor.

693
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,400
I told you.

694
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:52,880
We are doctors.

695
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,479
Our genders shouldn't be your concern.

696
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,120
Yes.

697
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,479
By the way,

698
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,200
Dr. Ding

699
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,440
will be my assistant for your surgery.

700
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,640
What?

701
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,400
I am a doctor.

702
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,920
Tell me.

703
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Why didn't you sign the agreement?

704
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,479
I saw the agreement

705
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,360
and saw that one of the complications

706
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,799
is to forever lose my...

707
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:13,960
That...

708
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,960
Right now, it's only temporary.

709
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,999
If it is permanent, I...

710
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,239
I will jump down.

711
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Come down!

712
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,360
Not so harsh.

713
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,600
You've done this before.

714
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,719
Let me explain it to you.

715
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:30,759
There is indeed

716
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,079
a possibility
for the complication to happen.

717
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,519
As doctors,

718
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,600
we have the obligation

719
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,440
to tell patients

720
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,360
the worst-case scenario before surgery.

721
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:38,519
However, it doesn't mean

722
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,319
that it will definitely happen.

723
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,160
The rate of success

724
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,079
for your surgery is high.

725
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,759
There's no need to feel too worried.

726
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,559
You said the rate of success

727
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,600
is very high.

728
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,400
That means it's not 100%.

729
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,440
No doctors

730
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,039
will give you a total guarantee.

731
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,079
Yes. Then,

732
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,440
what if it fails?

733
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,319
I'm not jumping right now.

734
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,079
Please...

735
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,079
Let go of him.

736
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,559
Consider it again then.

737
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,759
No.

738
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:05,160
This...

739
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,960
This is not about considering.

740
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:08,479
I considered it for one whole night.

741
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,319
Dr. Cheng.

742
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,799
We are both men.

743
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:15,680
Right?

744
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,319
Try to step in my shoe.

745
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,440
Will you do this surgery?

746
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,079
Feel it.

747
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,279
Will you do this surgery?

748
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,440
Regarding that,

749
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,759
I can't answer you.

750
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,559
After all,
I don't experience this situation.

751
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,600
See?

752
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,960
You won't do it too, right?

753
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,479
He will definitely do it.

754
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,160
Dr. Cheng has done more than 100

755
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,440
pituitary tumour surgeries.

756
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,799
He has never failed.

757
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,120
Don't worry.

758
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,559
You did more than 100 surgeries?

759
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,719
Thank you, Dr. Cheng.

760
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:49,559
If you said that earlier,

761
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,120
I would've signed.

762
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:51,719
You're welcome.

763
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,479
I am Dr. Ding. A female.

764
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,200
Let's go.

765
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,719
Dr. Ding.

766
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:56,360
Female doctors

767
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,600
are more reliable in key moments.

768
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,680
Dr. Ding.

769
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm not criticising you

770
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,479
but how could you

771
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,559
make a guarantee to the patient?

772
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,120
If any accidents happen

773
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,559
during the surgery,

774
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,239
we won't be able
to take responsibility for it.

775
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,920
Saying that just now

776
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,759
would have

777
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,360
transferred the risk borne by patients

778
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,160
to us doctors.

779
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,239
I don't think so.

780
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,640
I remember my father used to tell me

781
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,840
that doctors

782
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,079
are people
who ferry patients across the river.

783
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
I think we have to stick together

784
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,239
since we are all in the same boat.

785
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:36,039
Another idealist.

786
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,559
I like people with ideals.

787
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,239
Dad. Mom. I'm back.

788
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,239
You're back?

789
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,039
Where are Dad and Ruan Lang?

790
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:51,719
Your father went out to take a walk.

791
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,400
Oh.

792
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,200
Ruan Lang has been
acting strange in the last few days.

793
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,840
He went inside the whole day

794
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,519
and hasn't come out yet.

795
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,479
Something must be wrong.

796
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,239
I'll go and take a look.

797
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,160
Hello.

798
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,840
The user you are calling

799
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,200
is not picking up.

800
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,200
Please try again later.

801
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,200
Who is it?

802
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,479
It's me.

803
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,719
What are you doing?

804
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,680
Working out.

805
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,640
What's wrong?

806
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,840
I heard from Mom

807
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,519
that you are acting strange recently.

808
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,079
I'm only staying in my room
for the whole day.

809
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:44,120
What's wrong?

810
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
You are making a fuss.

811
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,920
Can't I become a shut-in?

812
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,799
Do you think I don't know you well?

813
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,079
What happened?

814
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,759
I can't tell you.

815
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,840
Say it.

816
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:58,880
Two days ago,

817
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,759
I took Tan Ya to dinner.

818
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,920
I saw her husband with his mistress.

819
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,759
Are you sure she was his mistress?

820
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,039
Both of them were holding hands?

821
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,799
What next?

822
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:09,920
I went up

823
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,160
to beat that guy.

824
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,799
In the end, Tan Ya stopped me.

825
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:14,239
What about Tan Ya?

826
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,360
She's fine.

827
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,120
I called her the whole day

828
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,079
and she didn't pick up.

829
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,680
Do you think something happened to her?

830
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,719
I don't think so.

831
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,719
She sent a text to the work group chat.

832
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,799
Don't be too worried.

833
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,200
Also,

834
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,840
don't call her for no reason.

835
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,200
She's probably feeling annoyed as well.

836
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,559
Sister, do you think
she can get a divorce

837
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,519
just like you?

838
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,039
Getting a divorce
is the end of a problem

839
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,239
and a start to another.

840
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
It's not as easy as you think.

841
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,479
Quick. I'll watch you work out.

842
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,840
I need to memorise my lines.

843
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,079
I feel nervous with you sitting here.

844
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,160
Train well.

845
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:21,860
(Beiya Hospital)

846
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,200
Yes. Full turn.

847
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:28,519
Keep going.

848
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,400
Reverse in a straight line.

849
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,440
Don't turn your steering.

850
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:36,479
Slowly.

851
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,279
A little bit more.

852
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:38,600
Okay. This is good.

853
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,519
Good morning, Ding.

854
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,160
What did you call me?

855
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:53,960
Ding.

856
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,360
It sounds nice.

857
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,880
You don't like it?

858
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,999
I'll call you

859
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,840
Dingding then.

860
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Ding is better.

861
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,920
Ding.

862
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,799
Ding, have you had breakfast?

863
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:04,400
No.

864
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,039
You haven't?

865
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:05,799
That's great.

866
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,680
New sunglasses?

867
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,319
I haven't seen it before. It looks nice.

868
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,559
Why do you keep running your mouth?

869
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:35,640
You're here?

870
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,519
This is...

871
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:41,880
Try it.

872
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,039
What is this?

873
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,440
I bought them in front of my house
this morning.

874
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,160
If you hold it,

875
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,880
you can still feel the heat.

876
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,999
Do you need garlic and vinegar?

877
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,840
No.

878
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:18,680
It's very flavourful.

879
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,300
(Nurse Station)

880
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,759
Head Nurse, it's time to eat.

881
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,039
Great timing.

882
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,039
There's more.

883
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:36,999
What?

884
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,759
After you went to work with Mr. Ning,

885
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:40,999
Juan brought these here.

886
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,400
She said it was for Ning Xiang.

887
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,079
Why did you accept it?

888
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,680
She ran away
after she dropped them here.

889
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:47,440
I couldn't even stop her.

890
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,319
Come here.

891
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,920
Juan even asked me a lot

892
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,960
about Ning Xiang.

893
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,120
What did she ask about?

894
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,440
His age,

895
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:00,120
his height,

896
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,519
and his birthday.

897
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:02,600
She also asked me

898
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,360
whether Ning Xiang's biological father
is Mr. Ning.

899
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:06,319
Why did she ask that?

900
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,279
What did you tell her?

901
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,239
I tell her

902
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,600
that he isn't adopted at least.
