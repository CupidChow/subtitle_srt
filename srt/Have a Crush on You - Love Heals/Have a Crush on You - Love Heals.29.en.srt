00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,860
Zhiqian, please don't tell

4
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,900
Liuzheng and Tan Ya about that.

5
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:45,970
Wait.

6
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,330
Since when did you
start calling me Zhiqian?

7
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,540
Liuzheng doesn't allow me
to address you as Brother-in-law.

8
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,010
Wait.

9
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,620
Don't be sad, Zhiqian.

10
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,690
If you're willing,

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,690
I'll call you
Brother-in-law immediately.

12
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,330
Brother-in-law.

13
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,140
You should listen to your sister.

14
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,580
Have you experienced
such a feeling before?

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,540
Let's say that you like a girl.

16
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,690
When you see her,

17
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,380
your

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,250
legs will go soft,

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,050
and you will feel timid.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,940
When you try to say something,

21
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,140
you always feel like you're saying

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,100
the wrong thing.

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,580
You'll feel especially dumb.

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,140
When you're drunk,

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,100
you wish to call her.

26
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,140
After that, you're afraid that
you might have said things

27
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,860
you will regret when you sober up.

28
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,220
Do you understand what I mean?

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,500
It's like being drunk.

30
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,810
It goes up to your head.

31
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,250
She's here.

32
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,860
How did it go?

33
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,580
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

34
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,170
Manager Liu called Cheng Zhouyu
to his office.

35
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,770
I guess we'll know

36
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,170
when he comes back.

37
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,250
How did it go?

38
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,810
Manager Liu said the case
is still under investigation.

39
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,300
He didn't say anything else.

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,890
Ning is resting today.

41
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,460
He said he was resting,

42
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,380
but it sounded to me like
he's temporarily suspended.

43
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,460
Is it that serious?

44
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,330
Maybe things are more serious
than what we've imagined.

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,580
I had the feeling yesterday that the
matter wasn't as simple as it seemed.

46
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,050
Mainly, we don't know what happened.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,530
We have no way to help him out.

48
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Do the rounds first.

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:41,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

50
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,050
(Hello, everyone.)

51
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,460
(Take on challenging medicine in armour)
(I'm Wen Yi.)

52
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,100
(I'm a gynaecologist.)

53
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,860
(Do you know this?)

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,860
(The field of medicine is a field)

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,770
(Lecture Series)
(that goes against natural science.)

56
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,020
(Darwin's Evolution Theory)

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,050
(talks about
the survival of the fittest.)

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,660
(However, the field of medicine)

59
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,140
(Ruan Liuzheng)
(is doing the opposite.)

60
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,810
(In 1929)

61
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,340
(Ruan Liuzheng)
(a doctor named Werner Forssmann)

62
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,650
(anaesthetized his elbow)

63
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,810
(and plugged a tube)

64
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,780
(into his vein.)

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,060
(He plugged it into his hear)

66
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,860
(and took an X-ray scan.)

67
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,930
(With that, he proved)

68
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,580
(that medicine could be injected)

69
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,020
(into the heart with a tube.)

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
(Today,)

71
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,970
(the number of patients
who were saved by such operations)

72
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,650
(have exceeded the total number
of casualties)

73
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,580
(during World War 2.)

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,620
(As a doctor,)

75
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,690
(we need to sacrifice our health)

76
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,210
(and kinship.)

77
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,250
(We need to pour all of our energy
and time into our work.)

78
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,900
(What are we trying to protect?)

79
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,490
Coming.

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,740
Why didn't you answer

81
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,690
all the calls I made?

82
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,210
Today's my rest day.

83
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,580
I put my phone on silent.

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,810
What are you doing?

85
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,210
We can talk here.

86
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,370
Is someone inside?

87
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,780
Is that why I can't go in?

88
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,860
Come in then.

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
What happened?

90
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,370
Tell me.

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,930
Wait. Why must I tell you?

92
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,900
Why should I?

93
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,810
If you tell us,
we can think of a solution together.

94
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,210
I can resolve it by myself.

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,490
Why must you bear everything alone

96
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,930
even when you're in trouble?

97
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,060
Who do you think you are?

98
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,970
I won't leave this place

99
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,530
unless you explain everything to me.

100
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,370
Leave now.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,090
I can handle my own affairs.

102
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,900
Besides, your letter of appointment
will be here soon.

103
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,020
Focus on your work.

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Stay out of such messy affairs.

105
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,340
Moreover,

106
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,140
what has my affair
got to do with you?

107
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,930
Do you have too much free time
on your hands?

108
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,530
Yes.

109
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,900
We're unrelated now.

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm being nosy here.

111
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,460
Sorry for bothering you.

112
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:29,930
Dr. Cheng.

113
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,530
Deputy Manager Qian?

114
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,210
Sit down.

115
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,180
You don't need to stand up.

116
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,340
Morning, Deputy Manager Qian.

117
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,250
Morning.

118
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,250
You've been busy lately.

119
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,930
It's been a long time
since we spoke heart-to-heart.

120
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,090
Here's a deal.

121
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,300
I didn't give this
to any of my male colleagues.

122
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,810
This is the dark chocolate

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,300
I bought for you in the US.

124
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,650
Here you go.

125
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,490
Deputy Manager Qian,

126
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,780
you're being too courteous here.

127
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,620
Do you need anything?

128
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,140
I heard that Dr. Ning
is going to resign soon.

129
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,490
Join my group after this.

130
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,780
I expect great things from you.

131
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,250
Deputy Manager Qian,

132
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,090
who said Ning was going to resign?

133
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,340
The result of the investigation
isn't out yet.

134
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,810
What gives them the right
to force Ning to resign?

135
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,580
Why are you so agitated?

136
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,210
It was just hearsay.

137
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,780
You shouldn't

138
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,810
take hearsay seriously.

139
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,210
Just forget that I mentioned it.

140
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,090
You brat.

141
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,300
Besides,

142
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,410
this chocolate of yours

143
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,580
is going to expire soon.

144
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,660
That's impossible.

145
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,170
I checked yesterday.
It said it'd expire two days later.

146
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,220
Liuzheng.

147
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,810
Congratulations, Liuzheng.

148
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,850
Deputy Manager Qian.

149
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,690
Your letter of appointment just arrived.

150
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,340
(Beiya Hospital, Letter of Appointment)
Sign it, hand to the hospital's office.

151
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,170
After that, it will take effect.

152
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,490
You have a bright future ahead of you.

153
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,980
Keep up the good work.
I expect great things from you.

154

(Resignation letter)

This is your resignation letter.

159

Once you sign this,

160
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,580
I'll deliver this to the higher-ups.

As your superior,

167
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,850
I feel heartbroken for losing a talent.

(I believe your character)

171
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,170
(and your ethics as a doctor.)

172
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,850
(If you have)

173
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,540
(reasons behind your action,)

174
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,580
(I'm willing)

175
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,690
(to make an appeal for you.)

176
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,170
(If you wish)

177
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,900
(to work for a certain hospital,)

178
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,170
I can write you

179
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,850
a letter of recommendation.

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,460
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

181
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,850
I will still work as a doctor.

182
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,420
Please take care.

183
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,660
Liuzheng,

184
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,050
Mr. Ning had signed
the resignation letter.

185
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,460
He signed it already?

186
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,020
I wanted to inquire about
the situation from Mr. Ding.

187
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,930
Why did he resign so suddenly?

188
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,780
Don't.

189
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,690
I went there just now.

190
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,250
My dad said Mr. Ning
resigned of his own accord.

191
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,940
(Parking)

192
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,290
Mr. Ning!

193
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,300
(Beiya Hospital)

194
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,020
Are you dumb?
How could you chase after a car?

195
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,730
I'll ask you one last thing.

196
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,020
Did you resign because of me?

197
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,850
You're overthinking it.

198
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,140
I'm just tired of the environment.

199
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,170
I need a new environment.

200
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,020
Fine.

201
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,930
Since you've resigned,

202
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,810
I won't accept
the letter of appointment.

203
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,340
Have you lost your mind?

204
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,690
My resignation has
nothing to do with you.

205
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,370
Zhiqian,

206
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,610
why don't we take a break?

207
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,050
You can take a break if you're tired.

208
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm jobless now.

209
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,460
I don't need to perform operations

210
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,050
or be on call 24/7.

211
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,930
You should take a break if you're tired.

212
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,580
I know you're fine.

213
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,660
But I'm exhausted.

214
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,810
You lack

215
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,140
physical training.

216
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,780
I feel especially guilty
when I see you in this state.

217
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,690
Why don't I just tell
Liuzheng the truth?

218
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,580
Don't go.

219
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,930
If you tell her,

220
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,930
her future will be ruined.

221
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,100
What about you then?

222
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,340
I can still find another job.

223
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,220
If your sister takes the blame,

224
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,690
she might not be able
to work as a doctor anymore.

225
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,140
You truly love my sister, huh?

226
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,780
Now, I'm experiencing the feeling
you described to me before.

227
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,810
What feeling?

228
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,290
It went up to my head.

229
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,220
It went up to your head!

230
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,500
(Beiya Hospital)

231
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,370
Temperature check.

232
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,900
Your body temperature is normal.

233
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
You can pack your things
and be discharged today.

234
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,020
I still feel like my body temperature

235
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,690
is pretty high.

236
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,250
Is that so?

237
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,370
I guess so.

238
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,050
So you want to be a deadbeat?

239
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,810
Please pack your belongings
and leave the hospital.

240
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,100
No, I won't.

241
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,490
I'm here to pick you up.

242
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,420
Think about what you want to eat.

243
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,730
I'll treat you to something nice.

244
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,100
Be careful.

245
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,490
Your wound just recovered.

246
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,580
Look at how concerned she is.

247
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,250
I'm just afraid

248
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,540
that he'll steal
the hospital's slot again

249
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,930
when his wound reopens.

250
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,540
Ai Fei,

251
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,290
don't worry.

252
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,050
This is the last time
we're seeing each other.

253
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,420
May we not see each other again.

254
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,810
See yourself off.

255
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,050
How's the incident with Ning Zhiqian?

256
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,980
Have a seat.

257
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,980
I don't know.

258
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,050
He's not willing to say anything.

259
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,370
He's so boring.

260
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,540
It's like he can never
warm up to people.

261
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,580
Yeah.

262
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,730
And, he's the worst.

263
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,050
Alright, let's leave it at that.

264
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,580
I don't wish to meddle
with his affair anymore.

265
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,780
You're so infuriated at him.

266
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,850
Once I've recovered,

267
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,850
I'll definitely get back at him for you

268
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
You can talk once you've recovered.

269
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,460
How do you plan to get back at him?

270
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,100
Of course I'll beat him up.

271
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,370
It's no wonder you and Ning Xiang
are best friends.

272
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,370
We're buddies.

273
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,340
However, I do somewhat understand

274
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,850
Ning Zhiqian.

275
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,460
His current behaviour

276
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,100
makes no sense at all.

277
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,100
You're speaking as if you know him well.

278
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,050
Perhaps it's a professional hunch.

279
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,900
There must be a motive

280
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,780
behind his irregular behaviour.

281
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,580
I'm sure there's something off
about the incident with Mr. Ning.

282
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,580
I was planning to look for you.

283
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,850
I heard from my father

284
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,980
that a middleman

285
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,580
took the money on his behalf.

286
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,930
A middleman?

287
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,250
That's why there's no way
for him to get out of this

288
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,290
unless Mr. Ning resigns
of his own accord.

289
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,140
It's that serious?

290
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,050
I think Mr. Ning

291
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,610
was set up by the middleman.

292
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,370
Who's the middleman?

293
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,170
Maybe it's the relative
of one of his patients.

294
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,170
No matter who it is,

295
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,020
I've known Ning for a long time,

296
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,370
and I understand his character the best.

297
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,100
If it doesn't work out,

298
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,850
I can be his guarantor.

299
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,170
I can also prove

300
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,980
that Mr. Ning was together
with me from the clinic

301
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,050
to the operation theatre.

302
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,250
It's impossible for him to do so.

303
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,580
If it doesn't work out, we can
retrieve the CCTV footage

304
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,610
and see who had been in contact
with Deputy Manager Ning in private.

305
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,290
We must prove his innocence for him.

306
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,660
I'll never believe

307
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,140
that Deputy Manager Ning
would accept money from his patient.

308
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
I have a buddy called Liao Jie.
Do you remember him?

309
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,290
What's the matter?

310
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,330
His father will be operated
at your hospital today.

311
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,210
Is Dr. Ning here?

312
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm here.

313
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,370
Hello, Dr. Ning.

314
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,300
Stop right there.

315
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,850
Liuzheng.

316
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,330
What have you been doing
for the past few days?

317
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,940
I...

318
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,370
Sit down and explain yourself.

319
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,610
Liuzheng, it's not that
I don't want to.

320
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,060
But Brother-in-law
doesn't allow me to tell you.

321
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,610
Hello?

322
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,210
(I just talked to my father about it.)

323
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,730
(He will keep Mr. Ning's
resignation letter)

324
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,450
(with him first.)

325
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,940
However, he needs to explain himself.

326
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,250
Alright, I got it.

327
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,330
I'll look for him immediately.

328
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,420
Do you need anything?

329
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,850
Follow me.

330
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,210
Go and explain yourself in the hospital.

331
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,300
What are you trying to do?

332
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,300
Do you think your so-called
"noble behaviour"

333
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,850
is good for Liuzheng?

334
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,450
Have you ever considered

335
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,570
how Liuzheng will face the truth

336
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,940
when she finds it out?

337
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,730
How did you know about this?

338
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,370
You don't need to know about that.

339
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,780
I should've sewn

340
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,300
Xiao'er's lips shut.

341
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,090
Besides, I'm not that close to you.

342
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,250
Don't be a busybody.

343
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,020
I love being nosy.

344
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,300
Ning Zhiqian!

345
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,900
Put your back into it.

346
00:18:59,330 --> 00:18:59,700
Good.

347
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
This is a public area.

348
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,210
- Do not raise your voice.
- Good.

349
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,420
You're a lawyer, you know?

350
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,540
What a brute.

351
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:06,820
Over here.

352
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,540
Come one, stand here.

353
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,210
Come nearer.

354
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,660
Come.

355
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,180
Put your back into it.

356
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,250
Ning Zhiqian,

357
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,900
you're itching for a beating.

358
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,660
- I feel like beating you up too.
- Come on.

359
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,090
I would've done so

360
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,090
if you weren't injured.

361
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,540
- Try me then.
- Use another leg.

362
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,490
I'm afraid that
you'll be hospitalized again...

363
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,330
Okay.

364
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,680
- If I punch you too hard.
- Do it like this.

365
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,850
Come on.

366
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,020
Good.

367
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:37,970
Don't worry.

368
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,700
We're not at the hospital.

369
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,180
I won't sue you...

370
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,610
Good.

371
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,570
Even if you punch me.

372
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,570
Stop trying to set me up.

373
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,330
I won't give you the chance
to extort money from me.

374
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,780
Nice.

375
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,700
Let's continue.

376
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,850
I truly wish to punch you
on Liuzheng's behalf.

377
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,970
She's so unlucky

378
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,490
to encounter you.

379
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
What gives you the right
to punch me on her behalf?

380
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,540
What does our affair
have to do with you?

381
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,250
You don't get to make the call here.

382
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,180
You two divorced each other long ago.

383
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
You two had broken up.
Everything's over.

384
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,420
Even if our relationship is over,

385
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,730
it will never be your turn.

386
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,960
Come on.

387
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
Remember what you said today.

388
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,660
If something unexpected happens,

389
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,140
you'll have to eat your own words.

390
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,250
Fine.

391
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,020
I'll tell you this once and for all.

392
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,730
You have no chance in hell.

393
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,420
Let's take a break.

394
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,610
We've just started

395
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,250
and you're quitting already?

396
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,570
Come on, stay away.

397
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,300
Stay away.

398
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,330
Stay away!

399
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,210
Stop fighting!

400
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,250
Stop fighting!

401
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,450
Stop dragging him!

402
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,060
That's a foul!

403
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:15,940
Stop fighting!

404
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,020
Stop fighting! Let go of him!

405
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,020
Liuzheng.

406
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,610
What are you doing here?

407
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,970
You two are something else.

408
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Two men are beating each other up

409
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,820
because of me.

410
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,090
I guess I didn't live in vain.

411
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,370
He punched me first.

412
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,820
He didn't follow the rule.

413
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,570
Say that again?

414
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,660
You launched a sneak attack!

415
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,850
Do you yield?

416
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,780
Tell Liuzheng

417
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,090
why I was beating you up then.

418
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,780
You were the one who provoked me first.

419
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,180
Do you yield?

420
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,060
- Do you yield?
- Liuzheng,

421
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,250
look, he is so unreasonable.

422
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,300
You're a grown man,

423
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,660
yet you're complaining to your mum?

424
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,780
Who's complaining to his mum?

425
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,020
You!

426
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,940
He said you're a mum.

427
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,820
Am I wrong?

428
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

429
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,330
You still want to fight?

430
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,210
Yeah!

431
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:52,780
Bring it on then!

432
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,300
- How is it?
- Bring it on!

433
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,570
Come on!

434
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,140
Xue Weilin, your phone is ringing.

435
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:58,850
I won't answer it!

436
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,780
I'll let you punch me
three times. Come on.

437
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,940
Come on.

438
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:03,900
Come on.

439
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,900
It's your boss.

440
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,700
I don't care!

441
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,090
Bring it on.

442
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,420
Come on.

443
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:09,970
(Mr. Liu)
Come on.

444
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,210
Bring it on.

445
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,900
Mr. Liu?

446
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm in a meeting
with two clients right now.

447
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,370
Since when did your mother
become your client?

448
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,010
Alright.

449
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Mr. Liu, please continue.

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,730
Don't go! Your mummy is here!

451
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,200
You can complain to her all you like!

452
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,250
Look at your silly son.

453
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,200
I already found out.

454
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,250
Do you think I'll be grateful to you?

455
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
I didn't want you to be grateful to me.

456
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,770
If so, are you going to attend
China's Best Ex-Husband?

457
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,650
I would join it

458
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,040
if a show like that existed.

459
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,730
If you're trying to make it up to me

460
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,610
because you feel guilty,

461
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,490
sorry, I won't accept it.

462
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,680
However, if you wish to court me,

463
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,650
I will consider it.

464
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,650
I understand now.

465
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,490
I'll explain it to Mr. Ding.

466
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,610
Ruan Liuzheng,

467
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,890
I do intend to court you.

468
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,250
For your sake,

469
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,770
I can abandon my career, my future,

470
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,490
anything.

471
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,370
Are you happy now?

472
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,440
Don't you think I sound pretentious

473
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,730
and childish?

474
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,890
That's not what I want to hear from you.

475
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,800
What do you want to hear then?

476
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,320
I want to hear your heartfelt words.

477
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,560
I think

478
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,970
you'll definitely
become an excellent doctor.

479
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,130
If we do get together,

480
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,970
we can't afford
to lose both of our jobs.

481
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,200
One of us has to keep our job.

482
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,370
Do you really think so?

483
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,250
Of course.

484
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,280
Don't tell me

485
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,130
you think I want to become

486
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,440
an emotionless operation machine?

487
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,280
Who said a good doctor

488
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,560
can't have a wonderful family?

489
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
Must I end up like my parents...

490
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,090
Stop that.

491
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,320
Let me finish my sentence.

492
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,130
Alright.

493
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,040
Mr. Liu,

494
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,770
I got it.

495
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,300
Sure.

496
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,160
Okay.

497
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,010
Okay, Mr. Liu.

498
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Don't worry.

499
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,890
I'll head there
once I'm done with my meeting.

500
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,800
Alright.

501
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,040
Goodbye.

502
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,560
Do you still remember our encounter
in the library?

503
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,560
Liuzheng,

504
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,320
what are you looking at?

505
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,200
Senior Ning!

506
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,200
Ruan Liuzheng likes you!

507
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,130
You heard that?

508
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,320
I wasn't deaf, okay?

509
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,320
If so, did you think I was silly?

510
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
No, I didn't think so.

511
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,920
I just thought you were very silly.

512
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,850
If so, do you have any

513
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,370
deep impressions of me?

514
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,560
What are you laughing about?

515
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,490
I suddenly remembered the time

516
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,680
when we dissected a frog.

517
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,770
You fainted, right?

518
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,610
I carried you to the infirmary.

519
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,890
You were so heavy.

520
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,730
I almost suspected that
you were pretending to be unconscious.

521
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,200
How did you know?

522
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,970
So you found out?

523
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,490
Wait, you were really
pretending to be unconscious?

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,770
No.

525
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,010
How dare you?

526
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,010
How dare you?

527
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,370
Are you okay?

528
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,400
Come.

529
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,200

Be honest with me.

Since when did you fall for me?

537
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,890
How should I answer you?

538
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,090
I don't know.

539
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,970
No,

540
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,770
you must answer me.

541
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,040

(Vice President's Office)

555
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,890
Mr. Ding.

556
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Dr. Ruan.

557
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,090
I'm here to discuss something with you.

558
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,320
(Letter of Appointment)
Please retract my letter of appointment.

559
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,730
Dr. Ruan,

560
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,370
I was going to discuss this
with you too.

561
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,280
Here, have a seat.

562
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,560
The hospital

563
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,490
has gotten to the bottom
of the bribery incident.

564
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,040
Both you and Dr. Ning are clean.

565
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,730
That's why

566
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,970
we still decided

567
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,610
to employ you.

568
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,440
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

569
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,010
However,

570
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,200
I still wish to return
to West District Hospital.

571
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,770
I promised President Wang

572
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,200
that I need to bring back
the techniques I've learned.

573
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,610
Alright then.

574
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,320
Since you're being so insistent,

575
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,920
we'll respect your decision.

576
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,490
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

577
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
I'll make a move first.

578
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,090
Everyone is here, right?

579
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,650
We'll hold a simple meeting now.

580
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,890
Stop playing with that.

581
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,040
Listen to me.

582
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,800
Actually, this meeting

583
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,490
isn't a huge deal.

584
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,160
New Year is arriving soon.

585
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,090
In order to spice up your lives,

586
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,850
we plan to hold a new year gala.

587
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,970
Every department
needs to prepare a performance.

588
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,090
Manager Liu,

589
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,770
- we're already tired from working.
- Prepare a performance?

590
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,730
We don't have time to prepare for that.

591
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,890
Precisely.

592
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,090
These are two different things.

593
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,770
Stop looking for excuses,

594
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,920
especially you, Bai Jun.

595
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,890
You get tired when you work.

596
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,040
But you aren't tired
when you go out on a date.

597
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,520
Everyone knows

598
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,280
that a lot had happened this year.

599
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
We can use this opportunity

600
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,400
to display

601
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,730
the great spirit of doctors.

602
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,280
That's a good thing.

603
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,610
Am I right?

604
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,850
You guys just need to focus on

605
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,130
preparing for your performance.

606
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,440
But we don't know how to perform.

607
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,920
Fan, that's a good question.

608
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,730
I thought of that long ago.

609
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,280
I hired

610
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,850
a professional

611
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,890
instructor for you guys.

612
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,650
He's Mr. Xue.

613
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,090
He's very good

614
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,200
at this.

615
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,850
Time to go on our rounds.

616
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,010
Come on.

617
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,160
Let's go.

618
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,890
Ning,

619
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,200
the voting will begin in a few days.

620
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,610
You'd better do a good job.

621
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,730
Come on.

622
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,090
Manager Liu, time to go on our rounds.

623
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,280
Let's go.

624
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,730
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

625
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,600
Let's go.

626
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,040
I heard that you can sing.

627
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,770
What's wrong?

628
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,520
Do you think I'm useless?

629
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,320
I don't think so.

630
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,440
I think so.

631
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,040
All these years,

632
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,160
you,

633
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,440
my sister, my mother,

634
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,730
all of you treat me like a kid.

635
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,280
I just wanted to be a man for once.

636
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,250
In the end, I messed up.

637
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,280
It's not too late for you
to start afresh.

638
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,490
Really?

639
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,560
Yes.

640
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,610
What will you do then?

641
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
Liuzheng wanted you and Yaya
to move into our house.

642
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,680
I'm fine.

643
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,400
Yaya and I will move
to my mother's house.

644
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,040
You two don't need to worry about me.

645
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,770
I won't be courteous with you.

646
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't just sit here.

647
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,800
You should do something a man should do.

648
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Get these luggage into your car

649
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,040
and send me home.

650
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,800
Right, now I remember.

651
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,490
Can we fit all of this
inside your Mini Cooper?

652
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,850
Who are you despising?

653
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,440
If I can't fit all of them inside,
I'll carry them while driving.

654
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,010
You're so manly.

655
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,130
Who did you guys vote for?

656
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,730
Who did you vote for?

657
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,320
Isn't it obvious?

658
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,850
Deputy Manager Ning.

659
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah, I voted for him.

660
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,730
- I voted for him too.
- That's what we should do.

661
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,200
I voted for Mr. Ning too.

662
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,130
Great.

663
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,010
Be fair in voting.

664
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,320
There aren't that many candidates,
yet you're asking them to support Ning?

665
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,850
When did I do so?

666
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,280
I just said I voted for Mr. Ning.

667
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,680
I didn't tell you to vote for him.

668
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,890
I didn't tell them to vote for him too.

669
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,650
To me, it sounded like

670
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,730
you wanted everyone to vote for Ning.

671
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,320
Was that what I did?

672
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,970
Cheng Zhouyu, are you jealous?

673
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,130
If I can make you happy
by being jealous,

674
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,010
I'm jealous then.

675
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,920
I'm jealous.

676
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm jealous.

677
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,890
I don't think you're jealous.

678
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,560
You're just sick in the head.

679
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,130
You're so troublesome.

680
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,160
Let's eat.

681
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,850
Dig in.

682
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,130
Forget about other things.
Let's just dig in.

683
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,370
Eat up.

684
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,610
Is this meatball nice?

685
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:38,560
Yeah.

686
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,280
(Dad, what are you doing?)

687
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,520
I'm resting on the bed.

688
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,520
(Where are you going later?)

689
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,920
Later?

690
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,490
I'm heading to
Mummy Liuzheng's house later.

691
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,250
If so, you should perform well.

692
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,560
(Don't be like the unhappy guy)

693
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,440
(in the comic.)

694
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,720
Do I look like the unhappy guy?

695
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,040
(Look.)

696
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,040
(Right now,)

697
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,280
(you look just like the unhappy guy.)

698
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,090
I was born with this face.
What can I do?

699
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,370
(You...)

700
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,170
(Give me a smile.)

701
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,850
Smile?

702
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,320
Cut it out. Do you need anything?

703
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,650
(Give me a big smile.)

704
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Did you

705
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,130
listen to your mother?

706
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,240
Did you sleep on time?

707
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,890
You didn't binge on snacks, did you?

708
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,760
(You asked too many questions.)

709
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
(I only have one question for you.)

710
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,320
(Did you miss me?)

711
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,280
I did.

712
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,480
I miss you so much. Give me a kiss.

713
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,410
(I missed you very much too.)

714
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,760
(I missed Mummy Liuzheng,)

715
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,800
Grandpa, Grandma,

716
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,240
Other Grandma, and Other Grandpa.

717
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,930
(Don't forget.

718
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,890
(I want to learn how to play Xiangqi)

719
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,090
(from Grandpa.)

720
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,760
Alright, I got it.

721
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,650
Is there anything else you want to say?

722
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,450
Do you have something
to tell Mummy Liuzheng?

723
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,890
(Dad,)

724
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,690
(be a good boy.)

725
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,650
(and buy Mummy Liuzheng
a bouquet of flowers.)

726
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,410
Alright.

727
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,280
I got it.

728
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:12,960
(Dad,)

729
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,320
(you can do it.)

730
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,800
(It's your time to shine.)

731
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,760
(Good luck!)

732
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,170
Flowers, huh?

733
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,480
So troublesome.

734
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,280
Mr. Ning?

735
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,650
Welcome.

736
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,040
These roses are exquisite.

737
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,930
Don't tell me you bought them for me?

738
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,760
Of course not.

739
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,130
Zhiqian, you're here?

740
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,000
Come in and have a seat.

741
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,560
Mr. Ning,

742
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,130
I just mopped the floor.

743
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,480
Change into your slippers, okay?

744
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,000
Liuzheng,

745
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,450
how will you reward me

746
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,040
if he succeeds after my assistance?

747
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,170
What are you saying?

748
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,240
Just you wait and see.

749
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,240
Mr. Ning,

750
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,320
help yourself.

751
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,410
Don't stand on ceremony.

752
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,410
What were you doing?

753
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,890
I was doing yoga.

754
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,480
Ning Xiang told me to buy them for you.

755
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
Thank Ning Xiang for me.

756
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,130
Mr. Ruan,

757
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,520
shall we play

758
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,130
Xiangqi?

759
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,560
Sure.

760
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,280
Dad,

761
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,480
you shouldn't just play
with the same opponent again and again.

762
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,040
Why don't you get yourself
a new opponent today?

763
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,930
Let me play with you.

764
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,890
Why don't you two play with each other?

765
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,130
Alright, I'll resume my chores.

766
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,130
Mr. Ning, have a seat.

767
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,760
Mum!

768
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,450
Let me do it.

769
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,610
Let me do it. Don't touch it.

770
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,480
Liuzheng,

771
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,240
let's play a few matches.

772
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,800
Coming.

773
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,480
Dad,

774
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,370
Ning Xiang kept telling me

775
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,210
that he wants you to teach him
how to play Xiangqi.

776
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,370
He said he missed you guys.

777
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,480
Now that the kid is gone, I

778
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,210
do miss him.

779
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, right?

780
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,240
How about this?

781
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,450
When he comes back,

782
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,000
I'll teach him how to play.

783
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,610
Over here.

784
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,130
Not bad.

785
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,240
Liuzheng, did you hear that?

786
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,370
Dad said he wants to teach
Ning Xiang how to play Xiangqi.

787
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,720
Since you like playing
Xiangqi that much,

788
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
you should join him
for the Xiangqi lesson next time.

789
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,170
Can someone help me
to serve these dishes?

790
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:13,850
I'll do it.

791
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,280
Coming.

792
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,520
Give them to me.

793
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:16,650
Come on.

794
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,040
I...

795
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:17,850
I'll do it.

796
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,210
Come.

797
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,040
Go and distribute the cups.

798
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,890
It smells heavenly.

799
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:31,960
I'll do it.

800
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,930
Mr. Xue, I'll do it.

801
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,130
Let go.

802
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,410
Don't be so courteous.

803
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:36,930
Let me do it.

804
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,410
Don't get it spilled.

805
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,370
I'll do it.

806
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,520
You should let go.

807
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,410
I'll do it.

808
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Mr. Xue, let go.

809
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,720
Let me do it.

810
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,960
Seems like they're at peace now.

811
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,040
Mr. and Mrs. Ruan, have a seat.

812
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,000
Have a seat.

813
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,560
Alright.

814
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,520
Alright.

815
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,040
Come.

816
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,560
Mrs. Ruan, here.

817
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,210
Mr. Ruan, have some meat.

818
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,850
Okay.

819
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,560
You guys should eat up.

820
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,890
Eat up.

821
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,690
Your father

822
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,720
has never peeled a prawn for me before.

823
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,370
What about this?

824
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,480
I'll buy you 2.5 kilograms
of prawn tomorrow.

825
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,890
You can have them
to your heart's content.

826
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,090
How could that be the same?

827
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,800
Isn't it the same?

828
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,520
Dad, you can train

829
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,720
the flexibility of your fingers

830
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,560
if you peel prawns.

831
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,280
You should peel one for Mum.

832
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,410
You should spoil Mum sometimes.

833
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,560
Peel one for her.

834
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,610
Alright.

835
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,760
I'll make it clear first.

836
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,610
I'm not peeling it to train my fingers.

837
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
I'm spoiling my wife here.

838
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,210
This is so rare.

839
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,210
Look.

840
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,410
It's pretty hard to peel.

841
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,210
Alright, it's done.

842
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,930
Okay.

843
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,760
Dad, why aren't you eating?

844
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,480
Are you sick?

845
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,240
I...

846
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm trying to be like you youngsters.

847
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,800
I'm on a diet too.

848
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,210
I don't look good when I'm fat.

849
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,040
You look good no matter what.

850
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,610
- Alright.
- Eat more.

851
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,370
Daughters are the best.

852
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,650
My baby daughter knows
how to warm my heart.

853
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,690
Am I right?

854
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,850
Your daughter knows
how to warm your heart, huh?

855
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,210
Your son is your deliveryman then.

856
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,520
Dad,

857
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,090
I got some beers.

858
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,560
Great timing.

859
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,650
Get a bowl and chopsticks
for your younger brother.

860
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,890
I'll go and get them.

861
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,560
Our family is complete today.

862
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,000
I was featured in a film lately.

863
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,890
So, which episode

864
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,650
are we watching

865
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
for our love triangle here?

866
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Who should I call Brother-in-law?

867
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,560
Who do you wish to call Brother-in-law?

868
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah. Who do you wish
to call Brother-in-law?

869
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,000
For safety's sake,

870
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,130
I'll call you guys by your name.

871
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,520
Weilin.

872
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,930
Zhiqian.

873
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,280
Where does you put?
[*Brother: rhymes with put]

874
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In my heart!

875
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,040
Dad,

876
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,560
to a...

877
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,760
Slow down.

878
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,090
To a peaceful and harmonious family.

879
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,240
Cheers.

880
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,800
Slow down.

881
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,760
Brother-in-law, you're pretty busy.

882
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,850
I have something to tell you.

883
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,090
Go ahead.

884
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,890
I was foolish for doing that.

885
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,000
I got you in huge trouble.

886
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Sorry about that.

887
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,210
It's fine as long as you know that.

888
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,610
Don't do it again.

889
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,320
And I'm keeping the money.

890
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,000
So, have you reconciled with Liuzheng?

891
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,240
If so, you guys should
get your marriage certificates again.

892
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,930
Your sister said nothing about it.

893
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,930
I'm doing my best right now.

894
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,560
I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.

895
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,610
In my opinion,

896
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,410
you just

897
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,890
lack one last step.

898
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,520
What do you mean?

899
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,690
You know Liuzheng well, don't you?

900
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,170
You should know what the last step is.

901
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,650
What do you mean?

902
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,170
You're done for.

903
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,240
What does he mean?

904
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,140
(Have you eaten?)

905
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,090
No.

906
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,280
I shouldn't ask her about
her meals again. It's risky.

907
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,760
(Have you finished
correcting your thesis?)

908
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,480
(Not yet.)

909
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,380
(Not yet.)

910
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,690
She ended the topic.

(Answer Guide For Perfect Boyfriends)

912
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,450
I'm so cold.

913
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,210
What should we do?

914
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,560
What should we do?

915
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,380
(I'm so cold. What should we do?)

916
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,820
(A. "Who told you to wear so less?")

917
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,220
(B. Let her wear your jacket)

918
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,000
Of course it's B.

919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,540
(B. Let her wear your jacket. Wrong)

920
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,800
When you and your girlfriend
are walking on the streets,

921
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,170
a beautiful girl passes by.

922
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,000
Your girlfriend says, "She's beautiful."

923
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
How will you react?

924
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,240
A, You're more beautiful.

925
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,560
B, Which girl? I didn't see her.

926
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,370
Of course it's A.

927
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,380
(A. You're more beautiful. Wrong)

928
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,170
Your girlfriend says

929
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,320
that her make-up looks ugly today.
How will you react?

930
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,240
Who said it's ugly?

931
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,090
I think you look great.
