00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 33=

3
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,450
How are his lungs doing?

4
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,410
They are not improving

5
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,000
but they are stable.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
No deterioration.

7
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,920
That's a good thing.

8
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,640
But he still has
intracranial hypertension.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,560
If we continue to give him
a heavy dosage of Mannitol,

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
it might trigger the kidney failure

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,850
or electrolyte imbalance.

12
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,560
Dr. Wu.

13
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,920
Let's continue observing.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,130
Let me know if anything happens.

15
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,090
Sure, Dr. Cheng.

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,960
Mr. Nie.

17
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,490
Nie Xing's lungs

18
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,080
are stable at the moment.

19
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,290
But we still need to observe further
for the rest.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,320
Thanks.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
Thank you.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,130
It's my job.

23
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,370
You can't stay here
for more than two minutes.

24
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,650
I know.

25
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,490
Why did you come back?

26
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,290
You left your mom there alone?

27
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,850
Have you eaten?

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,720
I haven't.

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,650
Care to join me?

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,370
Let's talk.

31
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,880
Ning used to come here at night.

32
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,960
I have always wondered

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,130
what he was looking at.

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,520
Why didn't you listen

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,010
to my advice?

36
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,320
Were you trying to prove yourself

37
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,960
when Ning Zhiqian wasn't here?

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,320
Even then,

39
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,370
you should have tackled
an easier operation.

40
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,570
In Nie Xing's case, even Ning Zhiqian

41
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,240
might not be able to save him.

42
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,720
What were you thinking?

43
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,850
So you think
if Ning Zhiqian can't do it,

44
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
I can't too?

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,680
I admit

46
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,770
I am not

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
as talented as Ning.

48
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,840
But I did one-up him in this area.

49
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,690
That is, no one has died

50
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,720
during my operation.

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,600
No one

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,440
can break my record in the department,

53
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,770
but it has nothing to do with how
skillful I am as a surgeon.

54
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,280
It's mainly because

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,810
I only treat patients that I'm sure
I can save.

56
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,970
If there is a risk,

57
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
I let others do it.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
Why didn't you do the same then?

59
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,690
You can't

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,210
hide from some things forever.

61
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,880
I already explained to you on the phone.

62
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,970
I am a doctor.

63
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,970
A patient in front of me

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,770
needs my help.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,090
I can't bring myself

66
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,490
to say no.

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,770
Let's get married if this operation

68
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,970
is a success.

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,440
If not,

70
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,050
let's break up.

71
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,250
Yuan.

72
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm very happy

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,690
that you came back.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,690
(I sent so many messages to you.)

75
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,840
(Why didn't you reply?)

76
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,440
(I know there's a war,)

77
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,370
(but do say something to reassure me.)

78
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,840
I have messaged you many times.

79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
Reply already.

80
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,000
And you didn't pick up my call either.

81
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,530
When you see my messages,

82
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,250
call me immediately.

83
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,810
Over here!

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,370
What's wrong?

85
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,160
I'm so glad you're safe.

86
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,490
I have missed you.

87
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,770
You have?

88
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,720
Dr. Ning.

89
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
See you, Simeone.

90
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,530
See you. Take care.

91
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,810
I hope to see the same old you

92
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,050
when I'm back next time.

93
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,490
I'm not old.

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
Yes, you're young forever.

95
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,970
Be careful.

96
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,880
I'll be fine.

97
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
That area is under fire.

98
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,970
It's very dangerous.

99
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,600
So please be vigilant.

100
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,370
I know.

101
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,400
You too.

102
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Come back soon.

103
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,010
Take care of yourself.

104
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,810
Call me if anything.

105
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,690
Bye.

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,280
Bye.

107
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,720
Why didn't you ask him to stay
one more night?

108
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Many people need him more than me.

109
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,760
I don't want to be selfish.

110
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,250
Dr. Ruan.

111
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,050
You must be really happy.

112
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,010
Dr. Ning is very romantic.

113
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,250
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)
Romantic? Why?

114
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,280
I once worked with him
in the United States.

115
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,450
Before leaving the US, he dragged
me to choose a gift for you.

116
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,760
A gift?

117
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,370
It took him one afternoon

118
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,760
to pick his favorite necklace.

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,720
That afternoon was a torture for me.

120
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,640
But he was so meticulous all the time.

121
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
And he had your name
engraved on the necklace.

122
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,080
Tell me. Isn't that romantic?

123
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,720
(Beiya Hospital)

124
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,330
Who knows if this hospital

125
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,370
can save Nie Xing or not.

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
(Inpatient)
Isn't that Dr. Cheng?

127
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,890
- Isn't that Dr. Cheng?
- Isn't that Dr. Cheng?

128
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,050
- Dr. Cheng.
- Dr. Cheng.

129
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,810
What's the situation now?

130
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,050
Can you tell us more?

131
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,250
How is Nie Xing now?

132
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,080
Back off.

133
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
- Back off.
- Dr. Cheng.

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Can you tell us

135
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Nie Xing's current situation?

136
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,520
Stop.

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,490
How is Nie Xing doing now?

138
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,200
Dr. Cheng.

139
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,130
Dr. Cheng.

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,600
Back off.

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,890
How are his lungs?

142
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,690
Stable

143
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,570
but his brain is still swollen.

144
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,200
We can't delay it further.

145
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,810
He is on maximum Mannitol dosage now.

146
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,050
Prepare for the operation.

147
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,520
Mr. Nie.

148
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,760
Can you sign the consent form with me?

149
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,720
Sure.

150
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,570
Nerve stripper.

151
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,930
Give me the patient's vitals.

152
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,130
Stable.

153
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,220
(Operating Room)

154
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,370
Bai.

155
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,280
Prepare to close up.

156
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,890
Okay.

157
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,130
The patient's blood pressure
and heart rate are dropping.

158
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,130
The patient is flatlining.

159
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,250
Administer 0.5mg
of adrenaline intravenously.

160
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,250
Done.

161
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,280
Update?

162
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,890
Ineffective.

163
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Another injection. 1mg.

164
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,050
Done.

165
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,690
Update?

166
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,930
Ineffective.

167
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,200
Prepare the defibrillators.

168
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,820
(Warning: Too Low)

169
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,450
Cheng.

170
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,690
Cheng!

171
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,180
(Operating Room)

172
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,130
Dr. Cheng.

173
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,250
Nie Xing is...

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,490
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,010
Sorry?

176
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,330
Sorry...

177
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,370
Cheng Zhouyu.

178
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,450
Cheng Zhouyu.

179
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,720
I know you're in there.

180
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,010
Open the door.

181
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,080
If you won't, I'll just barge in.

182
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,890
How is it going out there?

183
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,810
My dad

184
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,130
is dealing with the masses.

185
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,330
I must have caused him a lot of trouble.

186
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,130
Do you regret it now?

187
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,890
I do.

188
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,720
I regret

189
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,400
that I can't marry you anymore.

190
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,720
But I don't regret my attempt
to save Nie Xing.

191
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,370
There are things that I have to do.

192
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,760
They are not elective modules,

193
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
but compulsory modules.

194
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,050
I will go out

195
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,640
and face the press now.

196
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,840
I am the person in charge.

197
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,690
I can't let your father
handle them on my behalf.

198
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,600
So you won't

199
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,930
marry me?

200
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,250
I will marry you then.

201
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
No matter what happens in the future,

202
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,450
you are mine.

203
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,570
Forever and ever.

204
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,760
Come.

205
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,090
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

206
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,640
This child was admitted yesterday

207
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,690
but we can't locate his family members.

208
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,160
Only this paper note.

209
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,280
The CT scan is out.

210
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,690
The note is in Chinese.

211
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
Who do you think wrote it?

212
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
His parents, perhaps.

213
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,240
They wrote it in Chinese,

214
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,730
hoping that the Chinese doctors

215
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,690
can save him.

216
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,520
They even described his condition
in details.

217
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,360
If they care about their child
this much,

218
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,640
why abandon him

219
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,360
in the hospital

220
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,520
and leave?

221
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,970
We can ask the child when he's awake.

222
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,050
Let's give him an MRI scan now.

223
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,850
I'll get ready.

224
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,690
Judging from the scan result,

225
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,850
the tumor is on his cerebellum.

226
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,330
But he is so young.

227
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,450
We have many cases like that in Beiya.

228
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,090
Among all the terminal illnesses
in pediatrics,

229
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
tumor is only under leukemia.

230
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,090
Ning Xiang had that
when he was younger too.

231
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,090
Can he be saved?

232
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,930
Depends on the MRI result.

233
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,520
We have to determine the nature
of the tumor.

234
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,810
You might

235
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,970
need to give him
special care for the moment.

236
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,090
Don't worry. I'm a mother.

237
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,210
I can take good care of him.

238
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,090
I should get going.

239
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,240
I cannot agree that.

240
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,400
But Alfa's situation is very serious.

241
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,880
The tumor in his cerebellum
has to be removed immediately.

242
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Dr. Ruan.

243
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,330
I know you are eager to save people.

244
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,810
But first, we must find his parents

245
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
and get the permission.

246
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,760
What if we never find his parents?

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,450
Sorry, Dr. Ruan.

248
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I cannot greenlight this.

249
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,500
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

250
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,730
Anything I can help?

251
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,620
(Beiya Hospital)

252
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't sweat it.

253
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,450
You failed the career evaluation

254
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,880
but there's always next time.

255
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,880
I am not thinking about that.

256
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,690
I was this close

257
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,930
to a successful operation.

258
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,330
I could have saved him.

259
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,760
You did your best.

260
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,930
Don't beat yourself up for it.

261
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,360
No one will blame you.

262
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,520
You are upsetting me here.

263
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,210
Good boy.

264
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,880
Eat.

265
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,970
Eat the carrot.

266
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,760
(Beiya Hospital)

267
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,090
As I said earlier,

268
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,930
unless we were very sure of it,

269
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
we shouldn't have taken Nie Xing in.

270
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Now that he passed away in Beiya,

271
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,480
the entire society is pointing fingers
at us.

272
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,760
They say all sorts of nasty things.

273
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,610
Such as?

274
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,760
That our hospital isn't as good as a
smaller hospital like Ruining Hospital.

275
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,280
After all, his condition
was quite stable in Ruining.

276
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,000
But after he transferred here,

277
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
he died.

278
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,360
It sure begs the question whether

279
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,690
we have unskilled doctors here,

280
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,360
or someone was just too eager to perform

281
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,160
that he bit more than he could chew.

282
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,000
Dr. Shi.

283
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
Nie Xing's medical record
has been archived.

284
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,730
I will cooperate with the investigation.

285
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,330
As a doctor, I do not

286
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,330
regret my decision.

287
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,730
Taking Nie Xing in

288
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,970
is my personal decision,

289
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,450
so I am willing to bear
the consequences.

290
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,160
Mr. Ding.

291
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,690
I have to go back to work.

292
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,640
I will wait
for the higher-up's decision patiently.

293
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,090
To contain the rumors,

294
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,090
I suggest we suspend Cheng Zhouyu.

295
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,330
Anyone agrees with me?

296
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,090
Suspend?

297
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,640
I am the vice president and I
haven't said a thing.

298
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,450
Why, Mr. Ding? You're going

299
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,850
to show us the preferential treatment

300
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,610
you will give him now?

301
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,120
Knowing your relationship with him,

302
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,450
this will

303
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,280
reflect badly on us.

304
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,480
Preferential treatment?

305
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,760
Tell me then, Dr. Shi.

306
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,450
What grave mistake did Cheng Zhouyu make

307
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,970
that calls for preferential treatment?

308
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,970
Is it wrong to take in a patient

309
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,480
who was only waiting
for his impending doom

310
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,330
in his previous hospital?

311
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,810
Is it wrong

312
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,160
to perform the operation before
the patient's complication

313
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,930
acts up?

314
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,280
Is it wrong

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,450
to try your hardest

316
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,520
to save a patient?

317
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,760
Cheng Zhouyu did nothing wrong.

318
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,280
But we did.

319
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,610
All of you

320
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,610
manage this hospital.

321
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,360
You now hold a pen

322
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,970
and work on a desk.

323
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,120
You don't hold a scalpel anymore.

324
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
However, may I remind you

325
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
that we were once doctors.

326
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,360
Doctor is a noble profession.

327
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,400
We value life above

328
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,090
profit and fame.

329
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,570
I'm putting this out now.

330
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,280
If you want to remove Cheng Zhouyu,

331
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,090
you remove me first.

332
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,450
Zhouyu.

333
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,280
Don't feel guilty about it.

334
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
As a doctor,

335
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,280
you did what you could do.

336
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,760
You have no regrets.

337
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,730
Cheng, what's up?

338
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,160
Ning.

339
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,240
You're still alive.

340
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,850
Come. Spill it.

341
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,050
Mobile roaming is expensive.

342
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,880
It's nothing.

343
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,760
Why? I can't call you

344
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,400
to chat with you now?

345
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,570
Oh, by the way,

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I am gone for several months now.

347
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,760
How is Ward 3 doing?

348
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,000
You think we cease to function

349
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,610
without you?

350
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,570
Ward 3 is prospering.

351
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,050
Even more so than when you were here.

352
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,330
Good. I count on you.

353
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
All the best.

354
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,280
I have an operation to perform.
I have to go now.

355
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:27,970
Wait.

356
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,570
I have been meaning to ask you this.

357
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,450
Why do you always head to the rooftop?

358
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,210
Because it's quiet.

359
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,730
I can get tanned during summer

360
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,090
and it cools my head during winter.

361
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
That's all?

362
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,480
Why do you ask?

363
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,330
You thought I was pondering
jumping from it?

364
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,880
But you stare into the distance.

365
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,970
What are you looking at?

366
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,000
Just trying to relax my eyes

367
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
to regulate my eyes muscles.

368
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,930
In our department,
we use microscopes all the time

369
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,690
and my eyes can't stand that.

370
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,090
Staring into the distance allows
your eyes to rest.

371
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,160
I see.

372
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,520
Please take care.

373
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,050
All right. See you.

374
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,240
Anything I can help?

375
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,400
Who are you?

376
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,280
Alfa.

377
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,280
Alfa.

378
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,570
Don't move. Don't move.

379
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,930
Alfa.

380
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,640
Go.

381
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
No, stop.

382
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,210
You can't take him away.

383
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,480
Don't look back.

384
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,050
He is diagnosed with glioma.

385
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
He will die without surgery.

386
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,640
Who are you?

387
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,480
Who are you?

388
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,810
Cure my son

389
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,160
or we will blow up the hospital.

390
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,090
I will try my best.

391
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,760
Go.

392
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,570
You understand? Go.

393
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
What's your name?

394
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,400
I'm Bablu.

395
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,810
Take care.

396
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,880
Sleep.

397
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,810
Close your eyes.

398
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,810
Good boy.

399
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:57,970
Come in.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,690
Dr. Ruan.

401
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,520
Have a seat.

402
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,450
Who is Bablu?

403
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,640
Bablu?

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Who is he anyway?

405
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,880
I know a lot of Bablu.

406
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,480
But the most famous one

407
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
is the leader

408
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,160
of the armed forces in Dahl.

409
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,210
He is the man that the government troops
are looking for.

410
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,090
People say that he kills everyone
without blinking his eyes,

411
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,330
with no mercy.

412
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,970
He's Alfa's father.

413
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,090
Oh my gosh.

414
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,210
I think now,

415
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,280
we should hand over Alfa
to the government troop.

416
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,210
No, no, no. Please.

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,970
Bablu warned me that if I did this,

418
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,570
the hospital would be blown up.

419
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,610
His men are in the hospital,

420
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,050
watching everybody's moves.

421
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,240
You know?

422
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Blow up?

423
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,690
I didn't expect this kid to have
such connection,

424
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,640
which affects
the war situation of Dahl.

425
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,780
(Bablu Alantis De Nacimanto)

426
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,450
You take my place.

427
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,400
Okay.

428
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,480
What's up?

429
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,760
Mr. Ning.

430
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,880
What's the matter?

431
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,000
(The Southeastern Hospital of Dahl
Suddenly Attacked by Bablu)

432
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,520
(Government Forces Successfully
Resisted the Attack)

433
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,360
Liuzheng?

434
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,450
I'm here.

435
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
So we admitted a seven-year-old

436
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,520
patient recently.

437
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,610
Both his CT scan

438
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,330
and MRI scan show

439
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,850
that there is a tumor in his brain.

440
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
I just want to discuss with you

441
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,850
his treatment plan.

442
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,280
Let me send it to you.

443
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,520
Sure.

444
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,060
(Sent successfully)

445
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,850
Hello?

446
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,570
Liuzheng.

447
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,480
So?

448
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,570
I took a look.

449
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,450
The tumor is on his cerebellum

450
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
so he needs to be operated on now.

451
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,610
It is way too close to the brain stem,

452
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,240
so you might not be able
to remove it entirely.

453
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,000
But we can use chemotherapy after
the operation to treat it.

454
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,050
I came to the same conclusion.

455
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,970
Then operate on him now.

456
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,970
Okay.

457
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,570
You don't sound

458
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,570
okay.

459
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,520
What's wrong?

460
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,480
Nothing.

461
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,450
You can handle this operation.

462
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,610
If you have any ideas, tell me.
We can discuss it.

463
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,330
All right?

464
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,970
I'll hang up now then.

465
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,640
Okay.

466
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,400
Bye.

467
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,400
Hello.

468
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,760
What is this?

469
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
I think you need to speak
with the president.

470
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,880
What's going on?

471
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,210
It's confidential.

472
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,970
Please let us through.

473
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,610
Jeff.

474
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,160
I think they are here to get Alfa.

475
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
It's you!

476
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,760
Liuzheng, where are you going?

477
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,970
You two, stay here.

478
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,050
Stop!

479
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,090
Stop!

480
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,970
You can't do this.

481
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,400
Who are you?

482
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm his doctor.

483
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,120
He needs to stay
in the hospital for treatment.

484
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,210
I'm sorry but I have
to take him away today.

485
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,880
If you do this,

486
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,240
everyone will die.

487
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,880
I have to take him away, now.

488
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,640
- No.
- No.

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,280
Please.

490
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,400
Calm down.

491
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,570
There are women and children here.

492
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,610
If you take this child away,

493
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,760
someone will kill us all.

494
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,850
Who?

495
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,330
His father.

496
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
His father?

497
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,570
That's a bigger catch.

498
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,610
Let's go.

499
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,480
Thank you.

500
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,090
Wait.

501
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,330
Did you just say

502
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,570
Alfa's father is Bablu, the leader

503
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,450
of the armed forces here?

504
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,970
I heard he's quite
the scary figure here.

505
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:48,970
Don't cross him.

506
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,240
But Ruan Liuzheng,

507
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,330
why did you hide such a huge thing
from us?

508
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,970
I wanted to treat the child first

509
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,050
and let Bablu take him away secretly.

510
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,610
So Jeff,

511
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,930
the security of the hospital is no. 1.

512
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,760
Please keep this in mind.

513
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,160
Okay.

514
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,760
I will take care of it.

515
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,090
Come in.

516
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,280
Director.

517
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,330
Jeff, you stay here, please.

518
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,090
Sit down.

519
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

520
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,760
So I want
to clarify some situations here.

521
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,610
I didn't report
to the government troops.

522
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,240
I've been living in Dahl
for eight years.

523
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,240
And I know its stakes in it.

524
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,050
And I just asked Jeff.

525
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,720
He also doesn't know who did that.

526
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,890
I promise, guys.

527
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,130
I really don't know.

528
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,720
I'm so sorry.

529
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,960
I misunderstood you.

530
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,960
The gunfight you and Ning
encountered that day

531
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,810
may lead to this circumstance.

532
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,280
On the day of the fire exchange,

533
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,170
those men who were shot to death

534
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,370
attract
the government troops' attention.

535
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,000
Bablu had been attacking important areas

536
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,280
in the southeast.

537
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,570
His real goal

538
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,280
is the international hospital.

539
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,370
He wanted
to take control of the hospital

540
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,330
and then, Alfa can get the treatment.

541
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,000
But it failed.

542
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,130
Finally, he had to take Alfa

543
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,480
to our hospital.

544
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,810
With this analysis,

545
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,330
the logic will be stretched out.

546
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,610
Bablu seems to like his son so much.

547
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,520
Why don't we let the government troops

548
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,680
take Alfa away?

549
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,170
If Alfa was taken away
by the government troops,

550
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,440
he could have died
of his illness anytime.

551
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,410
You're right.

552
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,650
Alfa can't go.

553
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,130
So what's next?

554
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
We will do our best

555
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,570
to cure Alfa's disease.

556
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,570
But there's something
I still don't understand.

557
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,370
Why didn't the soldiers

558
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,240
take Alfa away actually?

559
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,480
Why?

560
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,610
That's a bigger catch.

561
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,130
It's a trap.

562
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,170
You're still awake this late.

563
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,130
Alfa's operation is tomorrow.

564
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,280
Is that your final decision?

565
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,720
If we drag this out,
changes might occur.

566
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,520
And I don't want to wait till
the government changes its mind.

567
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,680
You should talk to Ning Zhiqian.

568
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,520
Perhaps

569
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,610
let him perform the operation.

570
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,480
I want him to perform the operation too.

571
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,170
I called him today

572
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,330
and I can tell he is very busy.

573
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,240
He said he has faith in me.

574
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,720
I do too.

575
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,570
But as your mentor,

576
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,170
Ning Zhiqian is more experienced

577
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
in handling emergencies

578
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,330
and the operation.

579
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,440
Bablu is ruthless

580
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,720
and Alfa is his son.

581
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,890
If there is an accident
during the operation,

582
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,050
he won't let you live.

583
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,610
I am a doctor.

584
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,920
Whoever my patient is,

585
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,760
I do my best to save him.

586
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,520
All the best.

(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

589
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,090
What a decisive cut.

590
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,090
Liuzheng,

591
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,520
you look more and more
like a veteran now.

592
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:13,960

Thread.

595
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,900
(OPERATION)

596
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,090
Be quiet.

597
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
How is he?

598
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,330
Are you Bablu?

599
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,890
How is he?

600
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,440
The surgery went well.

601
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,650
What are you doing?

602

(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

603
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
You can't take him away.

604
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,680
Go back. Go back.

605
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,170
He has to be in the hospital.

606
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,920
Go back.

607
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,720
No!

608
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,410
No!

609
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,170
Please.

610
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,280
No!

611
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,130
Get back!

612
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,170
Ning Zhiqian.

613
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:00,810
Don't come here.

614
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
The child may die

615
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,000
without a doctor.

616
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,760
I can go with you.

617
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,480
Ning Zhiqian, don't go with them.

618
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,050
Take him away.

619
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,000
Move. Move.

620
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,850
Close the door.

621
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,410
Hurry up.

622
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,240
Ning Zhiqian!

(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

624
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,650
Ai Fei.

625
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,610
Why did you bring Ning Zhiqian over?

626
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,370
Why did you hide such a serious matter
from him?

627
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,050
Thank goodness Ai Fei told him.

628
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,240
Otherwise, you might have been dead.

629
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,130
Do you understand?

630
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,200
Ning Zhiqian might be in danger.

631
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,000
Alfa needs a doctor now.

632
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,130
As long as Alfa is still alive,

633
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,050
Ning Zhiqian will be safe.

634
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,240
But...

635
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,760
But what?

636
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,000
If something happens to Alfa,

637
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,480
knowing Bablu's violent tendency,

638
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,170
Ning Zhiqian will probably die.

639
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,330
Director.

640
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,890
I have some news.

641
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,850
They promised to save Dr. Ning

642
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,410
by all means.

643
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,370
Thank you.

644
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,330
Thank you very much.

645
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,480
Thank you very much.

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
Ning Zhiqian is a kind man.

648
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,610
Nothing bad will come to him.

649
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Go back to your work.

650
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,440
I want to sit here alone.

651
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,610
Go.

652
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,330
Don't stay up too late.

653
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,000
Rest early.

Let's go.

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,660
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

656
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,370
Hi, Dr. Ruan.

657
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Hey, Jeff.

658
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,680
Dr. Ning is going to be okay.

659
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,610
I'm sorry
about what happened to Dr. Ning.

660
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,810
Should I tell you a story?

661
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,520
When I first met Dr. Ning,

662
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,130
I hated him.

663
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,570
You know, he's always so serious.

664
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,440
He couldn't even smile.

665
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,000
But what he did

666
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,370
to the children and the patients...

667
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,240
That makes me respect him so much.

668
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,650
He is a good man.

669
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,330
Wherever he is, I think God...

670
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,090
God is watching over him.

671
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,610
You know,

672
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,890
when I was young,

673
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,050
my mother used to pray for me.

674
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,920
When I was in trouble,

675
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,050
when I was sick,

676
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,170
she used to pray for me.

677
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,720
And I would magically be okay.

678
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,050
So...

679
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,410
Let's pray for him.
Let's pray for Dr. Ning.

680
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,650
Okay?

681
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,280
Just for him.

682
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,440
Dear God,

683
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:24,480
we are here before you
to pray for Dr. Ning.

684
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,240
We pray that he is all right
and he is well.

685
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,440
Wherever he is,

686
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,920
whatever he is doing,

687
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
wherever they take him,

688
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,000
I pray that...

689
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,570
I pray that he is okay.
