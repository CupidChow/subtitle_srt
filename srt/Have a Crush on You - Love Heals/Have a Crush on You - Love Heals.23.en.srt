(Beiya Hospital)

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,420
Hello.

5
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,450
(Hello, can I speak to Tan Ya?)

6
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,200
Ms. Tan,

7
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,280
you have a call from home.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay.

9
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,050
Hello?

10
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,520
(Hello.)

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,180
(- Yaya has a fever.)
- Let me take a look.

12
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,490
Okay, I'll give Jiang Cheng a call.

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,490
(I tried, but I couldn't reach him.)

14
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,810
Mom, calm down. I'll call him.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,490
What's the matter, Ms. Tan?

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
Nothing. Just do your work.

17

(Head Nurse)

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
If we want to get married,

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
we need a house to live in.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,010
So

22
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,370
when is that woman moving out?

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
Don't worry about that.
I'm working on it.

24
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,610
If I divorced now,

25
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,120
that would be my fault.

26
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Then do you love me or not?

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
Of course, I do.

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,760
I'd still love you even if I'm dead.

29
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,610
Are you guys having fun
at the team building?

30
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,970
-Yes!
-Yes!

31
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,730
Team building

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,280
promotes friendship and unity.

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,920
Yes!

34
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,400
So when we go back,

35
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,560
we must

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,330
work even harder!

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
Dr. Qian is right!

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,480
All the best!

Cheers!

42
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,480
We can do it!

43
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,760
Go! Go! Go!

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,370

We can do it!

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
We can do it!

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,370
Let's get started!

48
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,540
- We can do it!
- Hello?

49
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,660
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

50
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,100
We can do it!

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,720
We can do it!

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,530
Dr. Qian.

53
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,480
- We can do it!
- Okay, I got it.

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,900
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,090
Qian!

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
There's an emergency
at the hospital. I'm leaving.

57
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,370
Can you make it alone?

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,010
Mr. Ning,

59
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,890
I'll go with you.

60
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,610
Then I'll head back too.

61
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,480
- Okay.
- Can you manage by yourself?

62
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,330
What happened?

63
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,250
Dr. Qian, do we keep drinking
since they're gone?

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,010
It was an emergency call.

65
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,770
Dr. Ning can manage it.

66
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's continue.

67
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,210
Okay.

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,020
(Beiya Hospital)

69
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,060
(Emergency)

70
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,610
Move it!

71
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,240
Excuse me.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,490
Do you know the names

73
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,400
of these two wounded people?

74
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,400
The man is called Jiang Cheng.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,360
The woman is Fu Xiaohui.

76
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,400
They seemed to be a couple.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,240
Dr. Ding,

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,840
arrange

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,610
a CT scan immediately.

80
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,800
Inform OR and the Anesthesia Department

81
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,680
to prepare for surgery.

82
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,360
Okay.

83
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,890
Have you contacted their family?

84
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,960
They're on the way here.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,650
Get the family to sign the consent form
as soon as they arrive.

86
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,960
He's Tan Ya's husband.

87
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,610
No matter who he is,
we must save them first.

88
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,180
(During The Operation)

(Beiya Hospital)

92
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,280
Dr. Ning.

93
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,360
How's patient Bed 14 doing now?

94
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,650
Her vital signs are stable.

95
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,170
Her condition took
a better turn yesterday.

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,050
She also responds to pain stimuli.

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,730
Today, her blood pressure
is at a normal level too.

98
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,930
If her condition continues to improve,

99
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,960
there's a possibility of recovery.

100
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,560
See? Signs of cerebral contusions
and lacerations.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,490
Switch mannitol to 125q8h.

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,360
Okay.

103
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,330
Patient Jiang Cheng of Bed 27
has stabilized.

104
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,120
He can be transferred
to a general ward tomorrow.

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,400
Is Yaya feeling better now?

106
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,330
You're here.

107
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,730
Her fever hasn't gone down yet.

108
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,770
Is he

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
doing fine?

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,730
His condition has stabilized.

111
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,210
What about that woman?

112
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,680
Skull fracture,

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
hematoma, and hemorrhage.

114
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,280
Her condition is no longer critical.

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,840
Mr. Ning and I saved her.

117
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,490
Are you a fool?

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,930
No matter how I resent them,

119
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,890
I can't let you two watch her die.

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,490
Even if I were there,

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,650
I would still save her.

122
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm glad you're okay now.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
It agonized me all night.

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,210
I've been mentally prepared for this.

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
What could've happened?

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,800
You just finished the surgery.

127
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,120
Don't stay here anymore.

128
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,610
Go back home and get some sleep.

129
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,600
I'm not tired.

130
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,120
Why don't you get some sleep?

131
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,970
I'll watch Yaya for you.

132
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,410
I wanted to sleep too.
But I can't sleep.

133
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,650
You still have Yaya.

134
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,360
Luckily, I have Yaya.

135
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

136
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,160
It'll be over after I get through this.

137
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,890
You know what?

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,530
If he had one bit
of conscience,

139
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
he wouldn't have met
with the accident last night.

140
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,680
I was on duty at the hospital.

141
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,330
I tried calling to tell him
our daughter is sick.

142
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,480
I wanted him to pick up Yaya
and send her to the hospital.

143
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,480
But he...

144
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,530
Yaya's fever has gone down.

145
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,920
You can go back now.

146
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Don't stay here anymore.

147
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,600
I'll go and make my rounds first.

148
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,480
How's Tan Ya?

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,480
She's okay.

150
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,560
She's with Yaya.

151
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,920
Jiang Cheng was so in love with Tan Ya.

152
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,720
But how could he betray her?

153
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,720
I still remember how Jiang Cheng looked

154
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,410
at Tan Ya at their wedding.

155
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,720
Those feelings were real.

156
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,720
No one has a clear answer to this.

157
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,010
Take us, for instance.

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,450
Why did we divorce back then?

159
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,210
I already told you that day.

160
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,010
Six years ago,

161
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,720
our feelings for each other
weren't equal.

162
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,560
The more I gave,

163
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
the more you felt pressured.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,800
I wanted equal love.

165
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,360
Until we divorced,

166
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,600
I didn't even call you "dear".

167
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,410
So in the end,

168
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,890
I couldn't keep you from leaving.

169
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,480
Liuzheng,

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,890
you're indeed different

171
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,090
compared to six years ago.

172
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,770
Yes, I've changed.

173
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,650
I studied hard,

174
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,290
got a driver's license,

175
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,800
and learned to swim.

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,680
I tried hard to change myself,

177
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,040
and to let go of the past.

178
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,600
But until I met you in Africa,

179
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,120
I realized

180
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,410
my weakness is still there.

181
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,720
Perhaps it was fate

182
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,850
that I was sick with a fever

183
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,720
the day I missed
the marriage registration.

184
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,360
If you put it that way,

185
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,450
it would mean you were subconsciously

186
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
trying to run away.

187
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,210
That's why your body
had a fight-or-flight response.

188
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,120
Are you scared

189
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,410
that history will repeat?

190
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,680
Do you still remember
the question you asked me?

191
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
What question?

192
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,010
I can answer you now.

193
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,560
I love you.

194
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,120
More than I did six years ago.

195
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm not sure
when I fell in love with you.

196
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,410
Maybe it was when we divorced

197
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,850
or

198
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,290
when we met again in Africa.

199
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
But I'm certain

200
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,920
my feelings for you now

201
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,240
are different from six years ago.

202
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,850
It would be nice
if you had said that earlier.

203
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
Next time, stop setting up
something like Package A.

204
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,240
I won't.

205
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,160
Liuzheng.

206
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,040
I think we shouldn't remarry.

207
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,160
What?

208
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,090
I said

209
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,010
we shouldn't remarry.

210
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:17,890
Why?

211
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,850
I've been resenting my dad.

212
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,290
I think he owes my mom too much.

213
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,210
But I just found out

214
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,010
that my mom wasn't perfect too.

215
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,040
She's a doctor.

216
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,290
She put everything and even her life

217
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,290
into her career in medicine.

218
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,720
But what family

219
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,360
wants

220
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,600
a statue as a display at home?

221
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,920
I understand what you're saying

222
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,600
because I'm also a doctor.

223
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,410
It's because we're doctors.

224
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,920
We'll likely

225
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,410
neglect our family

226
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,800
because of our hectic lives.

227
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,800
A doctor's working hours

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,970
aren't fixed.

229
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
Sometimes,

230
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,290
we are still thinking about the work

231
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,850
even when we are at home.

232
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
I have a lot of bad habits

233
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,240
just like you said.

234
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,680
When I'm occupied with work,

235
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
I behave like a surgical machine
without emotion.

236
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,770
But

237
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,850
if the machine is faulty

238
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
or broken down,

239
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,210
shouldn't we

240
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,970
do maintenance and repairs?

241
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,530
Liuzheng,

242
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,090
I don't think I deserve
to have a family.

243
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,530
We should end it here.

244
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,040
They say

245
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,040
a broken mirror can't be repaired
to its original state.

246
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,160
It looks like they are right.

247
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
Since you've made the decision,

248
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,770
I'll accept it.

249
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,120
Then

250
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,920
we'll continue

251
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,680
our teacher-student relationship.

252
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,920
I'll make every effort

253
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,450
to teach you

254
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,560
everything I've learned

255
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
and all my knowledge.

256
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,090
You'll be a great doctor.

257
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,930
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

258
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,930
It's a promise then.

259
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,080
It's a promise.

260

Mr. Ning.

261
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
I gave it a lot of thought these days.

262
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,010
I also made up my mind

263
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,720
to give it a shot with you.

264
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,530

after the team building last night?

289
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,290
Did you go to Zhiqian's place?

290
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,200
There was an emergency surgery

291
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,570
and it was almost dawn when it ended.

Since today is the weekend,

293
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,530
tell Zhiqian to come over for lunch.

294
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,080
He can't come.

295

Then come for dinner.

296
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,120
He can't come for dinner too.

297
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,440

302
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,570

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,720
What?

304
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,170
I thought you were registering soon.

305
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,440
We realized we were not good
for each other.

306
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,690
We broke up
to avoid getting another divorce

307
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,410
and wasting public resources.

308

If you guys aren't registering,

309
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,440
Zhiqian will be back in the market.

Why did I not

312
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,240
wake you up that day?

313
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,840
I can't believe this.

314
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,360
Stop worrying.

315
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,960
She knows what she wants.

316
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,930

are you sure
you're not marrying Zhiqian?

320
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,170
I don't want to think about this now.

321
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,720
I should

322

(for urinary retention.)

343
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,010
(Hello?)

344
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,890
Hello,

345
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,440
it's me.

346
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,530
What is it?

347
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,120
I've emailed you

348
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,360
the research group's materials.

349
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,240
Did you get it?

350
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,080
Yes, I'm looking at it now.

351
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,360
I made some comments.

352
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,930
Thanks.

353
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,480
(Are you still there?)

354
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,170
Some of your things

355
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,290
are still at my place.

356
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,360
Then send it to me when you're free.

357
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,770
Or I'll go and get them
when I have time.

358
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,600
Okay.

359
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,840
(If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.)

360
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
Xiao'er,

361
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,120
what are you doing?

362
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,890
Why aren't you checking on me?

363
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,890
I can't hold on anymore.

364
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm sick.

365
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,480
Where else?

366
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm at home.

367
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,360
Okay.

368
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,440
I'll wait for you.

369
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,570
Congratulations.

370
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,290
You should be happy.

371
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,960
Why do you look sad?

372
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,960
Look.

373
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,290
It's such a huge place.

374
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,810
Both your wife and son are gone.

375
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,200
All that's left is you.

376
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,720
I thought you liked being alone.

377
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,290
You've got what you wanted.

378
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,200
By the way,

379
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,720
what am I doing here

380
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,810
if you like being alone?

381
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,010
Just stay here yourself.

382
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,930
I'm leaving.

383
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,240
Xiao'er, can you stop

384
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,930
rubbing it in my face?

385
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,290
It's the truth.

386
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,720
Why...

387
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,080
Why do you put yourself
in such an ordeal?

388
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,530
Liuzheng gave you

389
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,930
such a huge opportunity.

390
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,890
But you ruined it.

391
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,810
Xiao'er,

392
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,650
I'll be considered

393
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,770
a bad person at most

394
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,290
if we divorce again.

395
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,170
What about her? She's a woman.

396
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,810
She can't go through this
for the second time.

397
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,320
How is she going to pull through?

398
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:32,930
That's very noble of you.

399
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,890
You're even thinking for her sake.

400
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,840
But why would you want

401
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,600
to put her through that again?

402
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,320
Why can't

403
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,010
it be hugging her tightly?

404
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,770
I thought

405
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,360
our first divorce was pretty painful.

406
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,320
But I didn't expect

407
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,690
I feel worse compared to that moment.

408
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,120
Liuzheng said

409
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
a broken mirror can't be repaired
to its original state.

410
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,050
Is it really impossible

411
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,840
to forget the pain of a broken heart
for a lifetime?

412
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,010
I think I'm doing this

413
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,690
for the sake of our best interest.

414
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,690
Keeping the pain short
is better than prolonging it.

415
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,080
It's better

416
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
to go back as co-workers and friends.

417
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,440
Since you've figured it out,

418
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,840
you can now leave her alone

419
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,480
and get on with your life.

420
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,720
By the way,

421
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,170
don't ever contact her first

422
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
if she doesn't contact you.

423
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,410
Remember this, okay?

424
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,600
Okay.

425
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,600
(Beiya Hospital)

426
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,240
Mr. Ning,

427
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,290
it's time for the ward round.

428
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,410
Let's go.

429
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,810
Dr. Ruan is not here yet.

430
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,410
We'll go first.

431
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:12,690
Let's go.

432
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,810
Sorry, I'm late.

433
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
You're not late at all.

434
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,600
Is that a new style, Dr. Ruan?

435
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,810
What does that have to do with you?

436
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,690
Hurry up.

437
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,930
What are you doing here?

438
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,410
Jiang Cheng.

439
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,080
Jiang Cheng,

440
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,690
tell me.

441
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,440
Who are these people?

442
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,570
I don't know them.

443
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Who am I?

444
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm Fu Xiaohui's mom.

445
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,690
Your husband...

446
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,050
He seduced my daughter!

447
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,570
My daughter is in the hospital

448
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,200
because she was in your husband's car.

449
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,010
You have to compensate for this.

450
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,650
Jiang Cheng,

451
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,930
the money in this card

452
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,570
is the money we saved up together
after we got married.

453
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,240
We also paid

454
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,930
the house down payment together.

455
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,200
You have an affair.

456
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,410
You should be left with nothing
after what you did.

457
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,200
But if you agree to divorce,

458
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
you can have the money in this card,

459
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,200
and the house will be mine.

460
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,720
I'll send the divorce paper to you.

461
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,600
Just sign it.

462
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,690
No!

463
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,080
You can't have the house.

464
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,080
I won't let you.

465
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,120
Who are you to decide?

466
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,960
I've recorded what you said just now.

467
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,080
If you think the distribution
is unreasonable,

468
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,320
I'll freeze the account

469
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,650
and settle this in court.

470
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,240
How can you prove my son cheated on you

471
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,960
based on what they said?

472
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,600
Hey, you can't just deny it.

473
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
Of course, not just these.

474
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,720
I made a copy of their conversation
from the dash cam.

475
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,200
(If we want to get married,)

476
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,530
(we need a house to live in.)

477
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,080
(So)

478
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,720
(when is that woman moving out?)

479
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,410
- (Don't worry about that.)
- What do we do now?

480
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,770
(I'm working on it.)

481
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,440
(If I divorced now,)

482
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,770
(that would be my fault.)

483
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,360
(Then do you love me or not?)

484
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,480
(Of course, I do.)

485
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,080
(I'd still love you even if I'm dead.)

486
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,050
I hope the recording is clear enough.

487
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,650
If you don't agree to my plan,

488
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,010
you may not even get the money.

489
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
If you agree,

490
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,010
take this money,

491
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,080
and we're even.

492
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,290
Even?

493
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,530
It's not over!

494
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,720
Ya.

495
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:47,960
What's wrong?

496
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm fine.

497
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,200
Ya.

498
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,890
It's okay. I'll do it myself, thanks.

499
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,920
Start calling the patient.

Give me your hand.

That hand too.

509

Use some strength.

510
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,160
Put in more strength.

More strength.

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,160
Give me more.

513
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:00,920
Not bad.

514
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,570
Do you feel

515
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,770
anywhere uncomfortable lately?

516
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,240
So far, so good.

517
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,400
It's just

518
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
that I have some speech impediments.

519
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,770
The surgery may be successful.

520
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,960
But the previous tumor grew

521
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,850
on the nerve in the area
of the language center.

522
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,160
So it'll affect your speech.

523
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,240
But this is normal.

524
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,160
Why don't you say something

525
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,640
for me to listen to?

526
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,850
Dr. Ruan.

527
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,050
You look radiant today.

528
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,920
You've become more beautiful.

529
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,290
The delivery seemed
to be somewhat problematic.

530
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,720
Should I keep talking?

531
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,480
Yes, keep going.

532
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,290
Dr. Ning,

533
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,400
you don't look too good today.

534
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,920
You have a dull complexion

535
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,480
and dark circles around your eyes.

536
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,610
Those who don't know you

537
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,370
would think you put on smoky eye makeup.

538
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,290
Do you have trouble sleeping lately?

539
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,330
Also,

540
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,680
you've lost a lot of weight.

541
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,400
Could it be

542
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,290
you're trapped in love,

543
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,240
and suffering from a broken heart?

544
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,680
You don't seem to have issues
with your speech.

545
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,480
Let's get you

546
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,240
a CT scan today.

547
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,480
Dr. Ruan, call the next patient.

548
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,370
I registered a special-need number.

549
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,720
Can't I say a little more?

550
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,610
Don't say anything
other than your illness.

551
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,090
Then I'll say one last thing.

552
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,810
Dr. Ning.

553
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,720
Dr. Ruan.

554
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,200
I heard you're getting married.

555
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,400
Also,

556
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,960
this

557
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,090
wedding gift is for you.

558
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,880
You must live happily.

559
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,570
I can't accept this.

560
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,880
Don't worry.

561
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,050
I won't make you violate the rules.

562
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,960
I made this myself.

563
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,290
Please accept it.

564
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,850
Xiaoyu,

565
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,570
the thing is...

566
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,400
Dr. Ning,

567
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,920
goodbye.

568
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,240
What do you mean by "goodbye"?

569
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,880
Come back here with the film
after your CT scan.

570
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
Go.

571
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,200
Next.

572
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,230
(Beiya Hospital, Jiangzhou)
Doctor,

573
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,030
this is my CT film.

574
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,050
Give me your hand.

575
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,010
Thank you, doctor.

576
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,890
Dr. Ning, this is my...

577
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,240
That was satisfying.

578
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,850
Tan Ya finally fought for herself.

579
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,050
Cheng Zhouyu,

580
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,570
take this as a lesson.

581
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,290
This is what a betrayer deserves.

582
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,570
Why would I take it as a lesson?

583
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,810
I'm not a betrayer.

584
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,370
The drumstick our mom made
is so delicious.

585
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,010
My mom didn't cook this.

586
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,290
My dad made this.

587
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,770
Mr. Ding made this?

588
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,130
I was wondering
why it could be even more delicious.

589
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
My dad cooks at home.

590
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,400
So you must learn how to cook, okay?

591
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,480
Do the dishes too.

592
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,530
Okay.

593
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,570
Wash the lunchbox
after you finish eating, okay?

594
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,440
Okay.

595
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:45,880
Eat some more.

596
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,090
Is it delicious?

597
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,680
Yes.

598
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,920
Are you washing Dr. Ding's
lunchbox again?

599
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Did she bring you delicious food again?

600
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,530
Does the food

601
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,200
from Mr. Ding's house taste better?

602
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,530
Are you envious of me?

603
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,680
You'll never get the chance.

604
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,050
Yes, I know.

605
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,200
When you marry her,

606
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,720
our whole department
will benefit from it.

607
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,880
If that happens,

608
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,960
you'll be the first I'll come after.

609
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,530
Just to come and get me, huh?

610
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,130
Then wash it clean

611
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,610
because this is your future.

612
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,200
By the way,

613
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,850
I just remembered something.

614
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,880
Several months ago,

615
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,770
didn't someone send an email

616
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,130
to report on Mr. Ding

617
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,920
for using his position

618
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,160
to help his daughter
get into our department?

619
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,290
Yes, I remember that.

620
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,920
What about it?

621
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,440
The result of the investigation
came out.

622
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,330
Mr. Ding is clean.

623
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,370
He didn't do anything.

624
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,480
But that whistle-blower was ridiculous.

625
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,770
The username was "Messenger of Justice".

626
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,610
Isn't it ridiculous
to use such a username

627
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,290
in this day and age?

628
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,400
What is he? Batman?

629
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
It does sound ridiculous.

630
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,240
How did you know?

631
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,850
Everyone knows.

632
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,920
Cheng.

633
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,610
Who do you think

634
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
the "Messenger of Justice" is?

635
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,610
How am I supposed to know?

636
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,720
Besides,

637
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,240
what if that person did it

638
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,640
out of kind intention?

639
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,090
You know, to monitor public opinion

640
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,290
to help Mr. Ding

641
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,640
prove his innocence and all.

642
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,240
Am I right?

643
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,960
Cheng.

644
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,160
I'll be honest.

645
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,090
If it weren't for your relationship
with Mr. Ding,

646
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,160
I would've suspected
you're "Messenger of Justice".

647
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,240
You're nuts.

648
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,290
What do we do with Du Xiaoyu's gift?

649
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,810
Contact him

650
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,640
and return it to him.

651
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,240
This is beyond my scope of work.

652
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,640
You can return it yourself.

653
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,480
How can I return it?

654
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,370
It looks pretty neat.

655
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,960
Why don't you take it back

656
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,290
and keep it as a souvenir?

657
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,090
This sculpture of me does look pretty.

658
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,440
I'll break my side off.

659
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,850
What are you doing?

660
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,920
Don't ruin this piece of good art.

661
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:11,920
Then you keep it.

662
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,850
What's wrong with Dr. Ruan?

663
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,370
Did anything happen again?

664
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,370
I think they had an argument.

665
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,920
They've been acting weird
since the team building.

666
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,090
Not bad.

667
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,610
Dr. Ding, your investigation skills

668
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,160
will soon surpass your medical skills.

669
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,880
And Ruan Liuzheng is different now.

670
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,530
It felt like she has completely
changed into a different person.

671
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:43,960
Yes.

672
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,680
There were two female doctors
in the department.

673
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,880
And there were two beautiful women
with different styles.

674
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,850
Now, they share the same style.

675
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,770
It lacks diversity.

676
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,480
Do you particularly like women

677
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,370
with Ruan Liuzheng's old style?

678
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,920
Not at all.

679
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,770
I've always liked someone of your style.

680
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,770
Wu Xiaofan.

681
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,530
Does he like women

682
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,090
with Ruan Liuzheng's style?

683
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,370
I have no idea.

684
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,920
You don't know?

685
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,530
Yes, I don't know.

686
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,720
Dr. Bai, what about you?

687
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,530
I'm an innocent person.

688
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,090
I'm even more clueless.

689
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,720
See?

690
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,480
He doesn't know.

691
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,960
Come on.

692
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,770
Dr. Ning tells us
to hurry back for a meeting.

693
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,880
Let's discuss patient Bed 8,
Jiang Cheng.

694
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,400
He's more stable now.

695
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,400
Do another CT scan to double-check.

696
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,200
If there's no issue,

697
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,090
he can be discharged.

698
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,770
Fu Xiaohui's condition
is more complicated.

699
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,610
She's still in a coma.

700
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,810
Monitor her for intracranial pressure.

701
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,200
Explain the risk

702
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,850
of the second surgery to her family.

703
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,090
About her family,

704
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,610
Tan Ya, you should avoid them.

705
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,720
Get someone else to do it.

706
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,810
I'll do it.

707
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,810
It's okay.

708
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,610
I don't need to avoid them.

709
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,160
I can work without being affected.
