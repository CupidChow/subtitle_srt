=Have a Crush on You=

2
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,090
You bought these?

4
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,730
No buns for today?

5
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,600
You actually splurged and ordered
delivery now?

6
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,320
I made

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
a fool of myself in public last time.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,360
This is my apology.

9
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,600
What

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,810
a generous apology then.

11
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,680
You ordered two dishes.

12
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,240
Both are veggies.

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,170
I just learned how to order
food via phone.

14
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,770
I ordered four dishes

15
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,880
but only two

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,010
came.

17
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,010
Those two meat dishes didn't come.

18
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,680
Only veggies.

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,800
That's right.

20
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,960
Veggies are healthy.

21
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,210
All right. I'll dig in then.

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,570
Go ahead.

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,800
- Eat.
- You ordered drinks too?

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Just one?

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,880
I'm not thirsty anyway. It's for you.

26
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,850
Open it for me, will you?

27
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,650
Do you want to share it?

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,290
Sure.

29
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,850
Here.

30
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,160
Thanks.

31
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,240
Eat some tomato.

32
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,600
What? Too sour?

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,960
No.

34
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,600
It's very sweet.

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Let's eat.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
The veggies are good.

37
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,880
When are you going
to get the marriage certificate?

38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,930
I feel like

39
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,050
it's largely performative now.

40
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,240
I can get it whenever I want.

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
But recently,

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,160
he has been trying really hard
to persuade me to do so.

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
Really?

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,880
I can't wait

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,080
to see how desperate he is.

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,520
Liuzheng.

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,290
I have to go.

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,320
The third wheel will excuse herself now.

49
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,960
What's your plan tonight?

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,770
Checking my patient's medical history.

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,570
I got two movie tickets online.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Are you interested?

53
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,130
Let's go.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,320
All right.

55
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,490
Smile, please.

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,440
I put on too much makeup today.

57
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,930
You did?

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,210
I thought you didn't put on any.

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,520
It's cold today.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,410
I should have worn more clothes.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
Why didn't you wear more clothes then?

62
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,440
Do you think I would lend you

63
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,880
my coat?

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,280
Stop joking. Be serious now.

65
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
This serves you right.

66
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,370
Now, I have to buy new clothes for you.

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,050
Come.

68
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,210
Can you speak like a normal person?

69
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,560
Are you proud of yourself now?

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,840
You know it's cold yet you didn't
cover your ankles.

71
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,000
Come.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,650
I'm going to overheat like that.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
You said you felt cold.

74
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,400
Still cold?

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,320
I like when you speak like that.

76
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Hurry. It will begin soon.

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,770
Here.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,770
There was a queue. Take this.

79
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,320
Coffee from the viral pop-up café.

80
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,840
Why buy this out of a sudden?

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,050
Didn't you say

82
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,120
that coffee is your lifeline
or something?

83
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,720
Usually, adrenaline will do the trick.

84
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't see how coffee is going to help.

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,320
I don't understand you at all.

86
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,490
Here. Hurry.

87
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,320
Which row?

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,560
Here.

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
Sit.

90
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,490
Take this.

91
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,930
Same cinema.

92
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,970
Same movie.

93
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,370
It's been seven years

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,400
and you still remember this movie.

95
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,930
It was released seven years ago?

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,050
We have watched it?

97
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,440
You were sleeping.

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,770
I won't sleep today.

99
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,880
I swear.

100
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,970
I thought you remember it.

101
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,770
It's been so many years.

102
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,250
How can I possibly remember
which movies I have seen?

103
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,320
Right.

104
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,490
From the moment we met
until our marriage

105
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,370
and our eventual divorce,

106
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,970
we have only watched three movies.

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,530
You forgot all of them.

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,250
I remember all of them.

109
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,840
The horror film one doesn't count?

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
As expected of you, Dr. Ruan.

111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,840
You and your superhuman memory.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,930
You know,

113
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,210
it's good not to remember something.

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,970
Look.

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Every time I watch this film,

116
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,650
I get the first-time experience.

117
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,490
Don't give me that.

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
Open it, please.

119
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,440
When are you free next week?

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Wednesday, why?

121
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,250
I will free that day up too.

122
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,770
What for?

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,930
For the civil affairs bureau.

124
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,090
Where?

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
Civil affairs bureau.

126
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,320
Have some coffee.

127
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,930
Or you'll fall asleep later.

128
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,370
Jianzhong, what's the matter?

129
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm all right.

130
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,090
Don't worry.

131
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,090
Sit down.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,090
Sit.

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,690
Should we go to the doctor?

134
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,210
No need.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,250
It's the same old pal.
My grumpy stomach.

136
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,530
I just need some medicine.

137
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,560
Drink something.

138
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,770
Don't worry about me.

139
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,840
Should we think about

140
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,970
how we should hold

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,280
Zheng's wedding?

142
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,720
You should sit too.

143
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,160
Sit.

144
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,090
Sit.

145
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay.

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,840
Look.

147
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,490
Should I wear a blazer

148
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,400
on her wedding

149
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,130
or a Chinese tunic suit?

150
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
I think

151
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,760
you wore a blazer last time.

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,370
I did.

153
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,250
Let's switch it up then.

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,200
Changpao, it is.

155
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,330
How do I look?

156
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:46,890
So handsome.

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,570
The outcome caught me off.

158
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,200
I thought Mr. Qian
would lose the election.

159
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,520
Dr. Ding.

160
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,960
What's the margin like?

161
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,640
One vote difference.

162
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,330
Did someone

163
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,490
in our team betray us?

164
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,960
God knows.

165
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Ruan Liuzheng.

166
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,370
Mr. Ning. Have you heard?

167
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Deputy Manager Qian is now
the manager of Ward 3.

168
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,130
I have.

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,250
It's so unfair to Deputy Manager Ning.

170
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,600
What do you mean by unfair?

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
It's a fair election.

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,160
I accept this outcome.

173
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,890
Ding Yiyuan.

174
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,130
Are you performing

175
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
with Cheng Zhouyu later?

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,890
You're performing, Cheng?

177
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,930
He can't sing in my key

178
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,930
so I'll perform solo.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,840
Cheng has always been off-key
when he was singing at school.

180
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,930
Even the birthday song is no exception.

181
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,400
It's almost time.

182
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,960
Let's go.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,890
Time for the New Year party.

184
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,720
Mr. Ning.

185
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,600
Will you perform?

186
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,370
Me?

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,930
No, I don't think so.

188
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,010
Let's go.

189
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,930
Let's go.

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,570
Let's go.

191
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,130
Time to watch the performance.

192
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,660
(Beiya Hospital New Year Party)

193
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,600
Now,

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,130
a round of applause

195
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,810
for Manager Liu.

196
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,720
Mr. Liu, please.

197
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,330
How did they sing just now?

198
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,050
Very well!

199
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,050
Especially the song choice from
the proctology department,

200
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,810
Chrysanthemum Terrace.
[*Similar meaning with proctology]

201
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,490
Very

202
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,810
on-brand of them.

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,450
What a great pick.

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,600
Mr. Cameraman.

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,930
Don't publish the video.

206
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,370
We'll be in great trouble

207
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,450
if they go viral.

208
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm just joking.

209
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,840
The performance just now

210
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,160
demonstrates how talented
the people in Beiya Hospital are

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,280
and it

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,160
also shows our wonderful

213
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,080
team spirit.

214
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,810
Don't you agree?

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,010
Yes!

216
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,130
Which department next?

217
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
Neurosurgery!

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,130
Ning Zhiqian.

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,810
Let's welcome him to the stage.

220
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,010
My fellow colleagues,

221
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,080
Happy New Year.

222
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,640
This is my eighth year

223
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,930
in Beiya's neurosurgery department.

224
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,130
But this year

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,200
is quite different

226
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,050
from others.

227
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,370
Because this year, Ward 3
of the neurosurgery department

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,810
has two female doctors.

229
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,570
They are Dr. Ruan Liuzheng

230
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,960
and Dr. Ding Yiyuan.

231
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,250
Woohoo!

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,720
They are the first two females

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,130
in Ward 3.

234
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,840
So please,
give them a round of applause.

235
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,080
Woohoo!

236
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,370
As you all know,

237
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,520
the neurosurgery department

238
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,960
hasn't had a female doctor in ages.

239
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,810
That's because in our field,

240
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,160
we need doctors who have patience
and endurance.

241
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,490
Therefore,

242
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,720
ever since they stepped
into our department,

243
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,490
I never plan to be lenient with them.

244
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,570
I gave them

245
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,570
the harshest demand

246
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,690
and the toughest challenge.

247
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,600
I thought that could scare them off

248
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,640
but

249
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,960
instead, they prosper.

250
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,080
They have grown
from a rookie to a veteran

251
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
and even showed all male doctors
in our department

252
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,400
what they can do better.

253
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,960
They remind me of what

254
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,130
we were like at the beginning.

255
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,370
So please,

256
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,640
all my colleagues in Beiya,

257
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760
give your loudest applause

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,080
to them.

259
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Woohoo!

260
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,760
Bravo!

261
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,570
One more thing.

262
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,520
Before I came here,

263
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,930
Xiaoxiao asked me a question.

264
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,760
She asked if I

265
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,840
was going to perform.

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,930
I said

267
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,080
no. But in fact,

268
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,930
I have something bigger

269
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,010
in mind.

270
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,250
Me?

271
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm not performing.

272
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,370
Just go.

273
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,010
Go.

274
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,250
But I...

275
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,080
Go.

276
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,490
You'll be fine.

277
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,930
That's right.

278
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,130
What are you doing?

279
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,890
Perhaps most

280
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,250
of you don't know

281
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,450
that other than my tutee,

282
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,330
Dr. Ruan also

283
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,450
has another identity.

284
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,600
What?

285
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,520
What?

286
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,840
She is my ex-wife.

287
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,960
So my performance

288
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,400
will be

289
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,890
a proposal.

290
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,640
Oh my god!

291
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
Can

292
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,720
all of you

293
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
be our

294
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,010
witnesses?

295
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,690
Yes!

296
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,080
(I love you. You are my everything.)
You can do this, Dr. Ning!

297
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,600
Yes!

298
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,400
New ring

299
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,570
but the same person.

300
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,960
Ruan Liuzheng.

301
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
Will you marry me again?

302
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,640
This is the last time, I promise.

303
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:21,890
Marry him. Marry him.

304
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,640
Yes.

305
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,010
I can't hear it. Louder, please.

306
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,280
Yes!

307
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,010
Congratulations!

308
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,640
Congratulations.

309
00:14:48,050 --> 00:15:00,890

00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,890
They are having fun down there.

348
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,250
Mr. Ning became a better person

349
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,720
and so did Ruan Liuzheng.

350
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,050
The power of love is compelling.

351
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,450
I envy them.

352
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,050
Remember

353
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,810
the election for the manager position

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,090
in our department?

355
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,360
What about it?

356
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,050
Ning lost to Qian
by a one-vote difference.

357
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,090
I actually

358
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,970
abstained.

359
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
So it was you?

360
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,850
Why did you abstain?

361
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,930
Ning is exceptional.

362
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,050
I want to be like him.

363
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,970
Or close to him, at the very least.

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,880
So when Qian told me

365
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,450
that he would
give me more opportunities,

366
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,210
I faltered.

367
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,570
I was enticed.

368
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,120
But that's normal.

369
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,450
Everyone wants to climb higher.

370
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,360
It's no big deal.

371
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,970
Besides, you have the right
to vote for who you want.

372
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,810
No one can fault you for that.

373
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,880
You are Mr. Ning's

374
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,930
classmate for many years.

375
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,210
I'm sure he will understand.

376
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,120
Don't sweat it.

377
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,760
I did this

378
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,690
because of you.

379
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,730
Because of me?

380
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,160
I think I'm not good enough for you.

381
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,930
When we're together,
I feel the pressure.

382
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,160
You live

383
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,090
in the city center,

384
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,050
in a big house.

385
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,930
You have a garage and a lift.

386
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,850
But my family?

387
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,330
We live on the outskirt.

388
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,000
When I didn't have a car,

389
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,000
I had to change

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,640
three subway lines to come here.

391
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,930
We came from two different worlds.

392
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,480
So I want to

393
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,970
become better.

394
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,400
I want to climb higher.

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,090
I don't want people

396
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,330
in the hospital to think

397
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,050
that I

398
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,760
rely on you.

399
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,280
I cannot stand that.

400
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,400
But why didn't you feel that way

401
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,690
when we started dating?

402
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Because I didn't expect us

403
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,090
to last this long.

404
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,090
I thought you weren't serious about me.

405
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,400
I don't care about all that.

406
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,570
But I do.

407
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,760
It doesn't sit well with me.

408
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,880
We can overcome it together.

409
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,450
You have brought it up now.

410
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,480
It'll be fine.

411
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,850
One more thing.

412
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,480
I have always kept it from you.

413
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,760
What thing?

414
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,090
You keep asking me

415
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,520
if I have any little secrets?

416
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,000
When you just came to the hospital,

417
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
there was an anonymous report

418
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
against your dad,

419
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,880
accusing him of nepotism.

420
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
It was me.

421
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,520
I know.

422
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,400
You do?

423
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
A very long time ago.

424
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,280
Because of this,

425
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,160
we had a family meeting.

426
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,520
They are fine with it.

427
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
I think you are a man of integrity

428
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,610
and my dad can be held accountable.

429
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
So your family knows?

430
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,970
We do.

431
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,480
How am I supposed to face
your family then?

432
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,810
I...

433
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm a scumbag

434
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,850
who has done all these harmful things.

435
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,480
Look, Cheng Zhouyu.

436
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,850
Why are you

437
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,400
telling me all that?

438
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,480
I'm not good enough for you.

439
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,570
You can do better.

440
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,610
Perhaps we can

441
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,050
call it off?

442
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,210
Let's call it off.

443
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,760
Are you breaking up with me?

444
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,280
Cheng Zhouyu, just tell me

445
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,050
that you don't like me anymore.

446
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,760
I'm serious.

447
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,850
No need to give me those excuses.

448
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,360
Because they are lame excuses.

449
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,050
Cheng Zhouyu, I like you.

450
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,120
I want to be with you

451
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,360
because when I'm with you,

452
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,570
I am happy.

453
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,640
I enjoy it.

454
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,850
But I am not happy now.

455
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
If you want us to split up,

456
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,640
go ahead.

457
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I'll head back now.

458
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,280
Really?

459
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,690
We have to work tomorrow.

460
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,810
When did you buy the ring?

461
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,570
I bought it long ago.

462
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,330
I thought you hate attention.

463
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,400
Why did you propose to me in public?

464
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,810
What if I say no?

465
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,000
Will you say no?

466
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,090
You did it in public

467
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,330
so that I will be pressured
into saying yes.

468
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,330
You got me there.

469
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,240
Mr. Ruan.

470
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,930
I should head back now.

471
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Stay safe.

472
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,090
Dad, why did you come out this late?

473
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,210
I can't sleep.

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,210
I want to take a stroll.

475
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,810
It's cold outside. Go back in.

476
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,120
You should go in.

477
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,930
You must have had a busy day.

478
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,970
Let me keep you company then.

479
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,120
Let's go.

480
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,050
All right.

481
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,880
Let me see.

482
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,160
The patient of Bed 12

483
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
can be discharged today.

484
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,520
See to it, please.

485
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,570
Zhiqian.

486
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,160
It's me.

487
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,360
Mr. Ruan.

488
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,970
Why are you dressed up like this?

489
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,610
I don't want Liuzheng to see me.

490
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,520
Let me take this.

491
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,090
Mr. Ruan,

492
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,730
let me know where it hurts.

493
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,480
How is this spot?

494
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,120
It's all right.

495
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,160
This bit hurts.

496
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,330
Bear with me.

497
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,160
Ouch.

498
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,120
What about here?

499
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,090
Ouch.

500
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,690
You may get up, Mr. Ruan.

501
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,570
It's done?

502
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,930
How long have you had this?

503
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,570
More

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,570
than six months.

505
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,450
Why didn't you come earlier?

506
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,280
After my routine check-up,
I thought nothing of it.

507
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,090
It's hard to give you a result now.

508
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,850
Let's give you a scan, shall we?

509
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,450
Here.

510
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,570
Is it serious?

511
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,360
Don't worry.
Let's have the scan first.

512
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,690
Okay.

513
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,160
Which way?

514
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,280
Here.

515
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,810
You see that?

516
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,050
It's in the lungs too.

517
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,970
Based on my experience,

518
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,850
it's stage IV liver cancer.

519
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,730
It has metastasized to the lungs.

520
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,400
I don't think surgery

521
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,520
will help.

522
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,740
(Ruan Jianzhong, Radiology File)

523
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,450
Mr. Ning.

524
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,330
Anything else?

525
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,610
If not, we'll go home now.

526
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,400
You can leave now.

527
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,760
Okay.

528
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,570
Where did you go?

529
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,570
I was looking for you.

530
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,120
I had a meeting
with the Department of Medicine.

531
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,450
I have to go now. I have a movie date.

532
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,210
Bye.

533
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,450
Let's go home

534
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,520
earlier today.

535
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,050
Whose home?

536
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,210
Yours.

537
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,520
Let's pay a visit to your parents.

538
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,450
But you just did two days ago.

539
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,610
I miss them.

540
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,450
I want to see them, can I not?

541
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,280
Pack up now.

542
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,360
Zhiqian, have this prawn.

543
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,570
I'm full, Mrs. Ruan.

544
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,050
Why don't you eat it, Dad?

545
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,480
I am eating one.

546
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,810
Your father's

547
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,090
appetite has gone down lately.

548
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you two

549
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,050
want some beer?

550
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,640
- No, thanks.
- No.

551
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
A unanimous answer today.

552
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,850
Oh,

553
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,000
how is your wedding organization going?

554
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,090
That's right.

555
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,090
Dad, I'm busy lately.

556
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,760
You should

557
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,690
do it earlier.

558
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,210
I agree.

559
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,520
Just finish things up.

560
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:08,810
Come.

561
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,000
Eat all these.

562
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You didn't see when I ate it just now.

563
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,850
It's delicious.

564
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,330
Oh.

565
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,570
I have to check on my phone.

566
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Zhiqian.

567
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,450
Can you check why my phone
is lagging badly lately?

568
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,970
I don't know why.

569
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,690
Sure.

570
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,850
Let's head to the balcony.

571
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,810
The reception is better there.

572
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,210
Is that so? Okay.

573
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,930
It's cold outside. Remember to put on
an extra layer.

574
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,090
Okay.

575
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,930
Liuzheng.

576
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,120
Your father has been neglecting me.

577
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,450
He keeps looking at his phone.

578
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Do you think he's

579
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,240
e-dating?

580
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,400
Mom.

581
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,400
This is ridiculous.

582
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,480
Who?

583
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,570
Your dad?

584
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
You. You are being ridiculous.

585
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,520
Me?

586
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,240
Am I?

587
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,640
Zhiqian.

588
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,610
The result is out, isn't it?

589
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,090
It's okay.

590
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,360
Just tell me the truth.

591
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,520
I'm ready.

592
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,240
It's bad.

593
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,850
Liver cancer?

594
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,570
Which stage?

595
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,570
I already contacted the best specialist.

596
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,930
We will

597
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,760
have a meeting in a few days.

598
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,970
We will

599
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,640
find you the best treatment plan.

600
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,280
Zhiqian.

601
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,000
Just tell me.

602
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,930
How long do I have left?

603
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,850
If you won't tell me,

604
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,120
I can still ask the hospital.

605
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,970
Dad, you want some fruit?

606
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,690
No, thanks.

607
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,610
Zhiqian.

608
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,210
Can you promise me something?

609
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,330
Don't tell this

610
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,360
to Liuzheng first.

611
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,480
You're about

612
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,280
to get married.

613
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,480
If you tell her now,

614
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,240
she will postpone the wedding.

615
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,690
I want to attend your wedding ceremony.

616
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,930
Do that for me, will you?

617
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,360
Okay.

618
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,610
Don't worry.

619
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,090
After the wedding ceremony,

620
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,760
I will tell her

621
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,160
myself.

622
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,450
How does it feel?

623
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,240
Where did you learn that from?
I love it.

624
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,730
Liuzheng

625
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,810
is my baby daughter.

626
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,850
Promise me

627
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,640
you will treat her well.

628
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,400
Do we

629
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,610
have a deal?

630
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,450
Yes.

631
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,690
Mr. Ruan.

632
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Just save that setting

633
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,090
like I told you.

634
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,240
All right. I got it now.

635
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,330
It's late now. I should head back.

636
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:20,880
Okay.

637
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,640
You're going back?

638
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,050
Yes.

639
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,330
Show him out.

640
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,240
No need.

641
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,160
See you.

642
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,400
No need to show me out, Mr. Ruan.

643
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,930
I'll go now.

644
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,690
Okay.

645
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,050
Safe travels.

646
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,210
Bye.

647
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,610
Sufen.

648
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,930
The moon

649
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,480
is beautiful tonight.

650
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,480
Should we take a stroll together?

651
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,280
Moongazing? How romantic.

652
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,090
Now?

653
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,360
It's cold outside.

654
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,160
And I haven't tidied the table.

655
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,520
I can do that. Just go.

656
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,240
Come.

657
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,690
Put on some layers.

658
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,570
All right.

659
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,120
Sure.

660
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,210
Dad, put this scarf on.

661
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,450
- Okay.
- All right.

662
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,160
We'll go now.

663
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,210
We're taking a stroll.

664
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,330
We'll let you handle the rest.

665
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,360
Bye.

666
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay.

667
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Bye.

668
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,650
Where is the moon?

669
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,050
My neck is sore now
and I still can't find it.

670
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,850
No need to look for it.

671
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,130
It's cloudy today.

672
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,890
When we first met,

673
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,440
it was cloudy and rainy too.

674
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,130
You still

675
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,330
remember after all these years?

676
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,240
By the way,

677
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,760
what was your first impression of me?

678
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,050
Cute.

679
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,960
And then I thought

680
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,680
that if you gave me a daughter,

681
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,130
she would look as pretty as you.

682
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,410
Look at Zheng.

683
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,330
She takes after you.

684
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,720
Zheng turns 30 so soon.

685
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,440
How many 30 years
do we have in a lifetime?

686
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,240
Then let's do sports and eat well

687
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,720
so that we can live
for another 30 or 50 years.

688
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,960
Sufen.

689
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,410
I don't think I have the luxury.

690
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,960
What are you on about?

691
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,170
I'm serious.

692
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,440
I'm sick.

693
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,720
Liver cancer.

694
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,170
Stage IV.

695
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,330
Cry now.

697
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,170
Don't let Liuzheng know.

698
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,000
Have some water too.

699
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,440
Mr. Ruan.

700
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,050
Zhiqian.

701
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,410
We have

702
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,720
the treatment plan.

703
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
When you're free,

704
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,810
touch base with Dr. Wang.

705
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,370
You're early today.

706
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,650
I'm here to pick you up.

707
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,520
What is that?

708
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,720
Nothing.

709
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,410
Just the medical record
of my old comrade.

710
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,000
Yes.

711
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,410
I asked Zhiqian to take a look.

712
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,330
Who?

713
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,370
(Radiology Introduction)
Don't worry about this.

714
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,240
Go to work now.

715
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,090
Or else, you'll be late.

716
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,850
Let's go.

717
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,520
- Go.
- It's congested.

718
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,200
Bye, Dad. Go back inside.

719
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,260
(Beiya Hospital)

720
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,960
Cheng, Dr. Ding.

721
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,960
You two are having lunch?

722
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,280
Thanks.

723
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:13,720
Dr. Ding.

724
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,520
The buns are fresh.

725
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,520
I came here first.

726
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,890
Please take another seat.

727
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,410
It's the same anywhere.

728
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,570
I'll go then.

729
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,720
Do you have to do this?

730
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
We did break up

731
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,170
but we're still colleagues.

732
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,760
Right, Mr. Cheng.

733
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,240
We're just colleagues.

734
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,330
I'll eat somewhere else.

735
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:57,920
Bye.

736
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Hi, Mr. Cheng.

737
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,850
Hi, Dr. Ding.

738
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,890
I opened the window, wiped
the table, and gave you water.

739
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,330
Do you need anything else?

740
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,240
That will be all.

741
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,370
Thank you so much.

742
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,850
It's my duty.

743
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,280
So...

744
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,920
You can bring the first patient in.

745
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,330
Sure, Mr. Cheng.

746
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,820
(Cheng Zhouyu)

747
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,960
Come in.

748
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,090
Doctor.

749
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,850
Miss Li.

750
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,170
Come. Take a seat.

751
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,330
The delivery is close.

752
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,850
Indeed.

753
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Careful.

754
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,130
32 weeks now.

755
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,000
Miss Li.

756
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,610
Your tumor

757
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,280
is looking bad.

758
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
Just tell me.

759
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm ready.

760
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,000
It's growing way quicker than expected.

761
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,330
I'm not that afraid of it anymore.

762
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,890
Just two more weeks

763
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,240
and he'll be safe.

764
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,650
Look.

765
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,000
He

766
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,680
is kicking.

767
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,240
What an active guy.

768
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,090
Don't worry.

769
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,610
Both of you will be safe.

770
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,090
If you don't mind,

771
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,200
can you two

772
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,810
be his godparents?

773
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,280
We'll be honored.

774
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,480
Why not?

775
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,050
I haven't been a godmother before.

776
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
I'm done here for the moment.

777
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,280
You have an appointment with the
obstetrics and gynecology department?

778
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,480
Go there first.

779
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,130
Okay.

780
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,520
I will have a meeting with them tonight.

781
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:19,810
Careful.

782
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,480
Thanks.

783
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Bye.

784
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,050
Thank you.

785
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,000
Next patient, please.

786
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
I don't think you should

787
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,850
agree to be someone's godmother

788
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,890
without any considerations.

789
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,410
Mr. Cheng.

790
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,130
No need to draw the line with me
in every aspect.

791
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
We are just colleagues.
Not more than that.

792
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,650
Don't worry.

793
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,370
Careful.

794
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:47,920
Doctor.

795
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,420
(Cheng Zhouyu)

796
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,100
(Eat Civilly)

797
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,890
You don't look

798
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,570
like the Ding Yiyuan I know.

799
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,410
That stupid Cheng Zhouyu.

800
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,130
How dare he make me cry.

801
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,480
This is the most humiliating

802
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,850
thing I have ever done in my life.

803
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,890
Not humiliating per se.

804
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,890
But it's desperate, yes.

805
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,130
Don't add insult to injury, please.

806
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,090
You still love him a lot.

807
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,090
Perhaps you can try
talking to him again?

808
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,810
He has made it clear enough.

809
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,090
I also burned all bridges.

810
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,720
So be it then.

811
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
At least I don't have to

812
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,920
eat buns with him every so often now.

813
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,480
You just said

814
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
you didn't have to eat it again.

815
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,090
You two are evil.

816
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,240
You're mocking me.

817
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,610
That was a huge bite.

818
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,000
Haven't I suffered enough?

819
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,090
Hush.

820
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,810
Everyone is looking at you.

821
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,410
There, there.

822
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,850
Give her tissue paper.
