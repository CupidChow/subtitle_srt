You're awake?

00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,336
Oh, that was quick.

5
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:18,576
I'm off.

6
00:02:18,576 --> 00:02:19,455
I will see you off.

7
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,216
No need.

8
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,416
I have come all the way here.

9
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:34,895
Let me carry them.

10
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,216
You're leaving soon.

11
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,095
Do you have nothing to say?

12
00:02:58,576 --> 00:02:59,655
What should I say?

13
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:00,496
Anything.

14
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:01,856
Maybe you can tell me

15
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,375
your feeling about this trip.

16
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,015
Should I say,

17
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,655
"I'm happy to see you here again"?

18
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:11,175
It depends on whether
that feeling is genuine or not.

19
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,735
It's a shock rather than a surprise.

20
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:17,976
It's yours.

21
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:18,615
Thanks.

00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:29,655
We feel the same way.

(2012 Jiangzhou, China)
Sorry, I'm late.

37
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,895
It's cool. I just got here.

38
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,616
I ordered you a cold brew and a dessert.

39
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,095
Hope you will like it.

40
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:19,935
I want coffee.

41
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,215
Cold brew is a type of coffee.

42
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:26,255
Why don't you try it?

43
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:33,495
How does it taste?

44
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,215
Good.

45
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,896
Zhiqian...

46
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:45,655
Is he faring well?

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,495
He goes into a frenzy

48
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,535
of jogging and drinking every day.

49
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:55,775
Dong.

50
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:57,255
I don't understand

51
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,976
why you would fall for another guy.

52
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:00,095
Ning is a really good guy

53
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:01,535
and he likes you very much.

54
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:05,095
I said this before.

55
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:09,815
Both arts and the human mind
pursue freedom.

56
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,896
I couldn't control

57
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,416
whom I fall in love with.

58
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,456
Well, medical students
can't understand arts.

59
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:23,775
We uphold the principle of determination

60
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:24,815
and perseverance.

61
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,335
Liuzheng.

62
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:31,896
You are quite different from
what I thought about you.

63
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:34,775
Dong.

64
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,176
I feel the same about you too.

65
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,255
Where does he usually
go for a drink at night?

66
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:48,896
I'm not going to tell you.

67
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,136
Even so, I will find it out

68
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,215
as long as I want to.

69
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,535
Isn't that your usual spot?

70
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,136
Why do you sit here today?

71
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:31,655
You knew?

72
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,976
I have seen you a while ago, silly girl.

73
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:38,696
Excuse me.

74
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:40,296
A glass, please.

75
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,255
(Hi, your glass.)

76
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:45,416
I'm really curious about this.

77
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,215
Are you here to keep watch on me?

78
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,736
I'm worried you might do
something silly.

79
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,016
Something silly?

80
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:55,255
Do you mean to commit suicide?

81
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,856
Continuous drinking
is similar to slow suicide.

82
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:07,495
Tastes good?

83
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:09,176
Good.

84
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:21,136
Ruan Liuzheng.

85
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,375
What do you want from me?

86
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:25,976
I just want to keep your company.

87
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:30,616
I have a very effective method
to heal your broken heart.

88
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:31,535
Do you want to know about it?

89
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:35,935
Fire away.

90
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:37,616
Cry.

91
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,535
Cry out loud.

92
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:44,296
My friends used to cry a lot

93
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,495
after their breakups.

94
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:46,576
Cry as much as you can. Cry a river.

95
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:48,775
You can wail or bawl.

96
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,655
You become so talkative after drinking.

97
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:53,535
You don't have to believe me.

98
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,255
Do you know
why I have a deep interest in medicine?

99
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,176
Because everything is
with traceable clues.

100
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,896
As long as you keep exploring it,

101
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:15,696
the answer will be revealed eventually.

102
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:18,375
But love relationships
don't have an exact answer.

103
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,535
People cheat for no reason.

104
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,255
It's just unexpected.

105
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,535
You know absolutely nothing.

106
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,616
They just fall out of love
for no reason.

107
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,215
Is that even reasonable?

108
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,416
You know nothing at all.

109
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,896
So, you know more than I do?

110
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:32,215
Had you spent effort
to manage the relationship

111
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:35,215
like you did on the study,

112
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,455
things wouldn't have
panned out this way.

113
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:39,856
Do you know that?

114
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:41,976
Have you heard this saying before?

115
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:46,296
"Vigorous river water runs eastward,

116
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,775
carrying away waves along
with the heroes.

117
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,616
Fame and glory are
but a worldly illusion.

118
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,376
As long as the mountain remains green,

119
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,895
the eternal scarlet sunset
can be witnessed."

120
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,256
Can you interpret this?

121
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:03,655
Sure. Listen carefully.

122
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,816
Stop drinking.

123
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:09,296
In nature,

124
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:15,655
everyone is destined
to experience betrayal.

125
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,980
(No Climbing. Stay Safe.)

126
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:10,655
You're up.

127
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,095
Ning.

128
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,256
Why are we here?

129
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,895
You can't remember anything
about last night?

130
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,856
You were so drunk yesterday.

131
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:39,575
I wanted to send you back to the dorm.

132
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,455
But the gate was closed
when we reached there.

133
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:43,015
So, I could only take you here

134
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:43,856
and make do with it.

135
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,215
Thank you.

136
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:47,335
Drink some water.

137
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:49,575
I didn't leave

138
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:50,655
because I was afraid

139
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:51,736
you would be choked

140
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,655
on your own vomit.

141
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,936
I used to encounter such cases

142
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,256
when I was in the emergency department.

143
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:57,816
Thank you.

144
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,410
(Hai Yue Home)

145
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,135
Fret not.

146
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:05,496
This T-shirt belongs to the waitress.

147
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:06,455
She changed this for you

148
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,455
because your vomit stained your shirt.

149
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:09,856
Remember to return her this

150
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:10,736
after washing it.

151
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:16,015
I'll wait for you at the door.

152
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:16,816
Chop-chop.

153
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:35,496
That was a nice game.

154
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:36,575
Did you take the room key?

155
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:38,376
Isn't that Ning?

156
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,135
Ning.

157
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:41,976
Ruan Liuzheng?

158
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:44,176
What are you doing here?

159
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:45,616
We came here to watch the game

160
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:46,616
yesterday night.

161
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:48,376
The lift is over there.

162
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:52,015
Come on.

(Hai Yue Home)

164
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:43,736
Give me a break.

165
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,775
Medical students should
have this knowledge though.

166
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,455
Hurry up and stand up.

167
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:49,335
The heart can't take this.

168
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:50,095
Hurry up.

169
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:53,455
Get up.

170
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:57,496
I feel like

171
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:58,496
I'm going to die.

172
00:12:58,655 --> 00:12:59,616
Don't just stand there. Move.

173
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,135
Stand up. Come on.

174
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:03,976
You're going for a drink tonight, right?

175
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:04,496
Go prepare for it.

176
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:05,416
Stop jogging. Go back

177
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,176
and get a shower.

178
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:07,416
No, I quit the wine.

179
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,256
I'm becoming a resident soon.

180
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:13,215
The seniors said
the following three years

181
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,535
is the toughest time in our career
as a doctor.

182
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:17,416
So, I must make sure
I'm in perfect condition.

183
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:19,296
You can do it.

184
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:21,655
Thank you.

185
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:22,655
I've recovered from it.

186
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:23,816
Thanks for what?

187
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:26,736
"As long as the mountain remains green,
the eternal sunset can be witnessed."

188
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,015
You told me this.

189
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,575
When?

190
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,816
You said this when you were drunk.
Did you forget about this?

191
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:33,775
Thanks to your fighting talk,

192
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,056
I will work out for one hour per day.

193
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,176
Work out one hour per day.

194
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:41,535
To work in perfect health for 50 years.

195
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,535
To work in perfect health for 100 years.

196
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:44,736
100 years?

197
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,095
And lead a happy life.

198
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:48,095
And lead a happy life.

199
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,176
- Come on.
- Come on!

200
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,296
Ning, you can do it!

201
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,496
Ning is having an affair
with that woman.

202
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,535
You better stop that.

203
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,816
There are rumors that

204
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,015
you and Ning Zhiqian
went to a hotel together.

205
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,655
Why don't you explain it?

206
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:27,856
How?

207
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,736
They wouldn't believe me

208
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,056
even if I try hard to explain.

209
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:31,015
Hurry up and eat.

210
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:32,496
True though.

211
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,296
If I hadn't known you
for almost 20 years,

212
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,135
I wouldn't buy it either.

213
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:38,736
But their words are too hurtful to hear.

214
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,376
They said that you have an affair

215
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:41,856
with Ning Zhiqian.

216
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,416
If you really have nothing
to do with him,

217
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,775
stay from him as far as possible.

218
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:47,135
My conscience is clear.

219
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,416
Why should I stay away from him?

220
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:49,535
Hurry up and eat.

221
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:52,376
You're right.

222
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,376
Well, never mind that.

223
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,575
I have good news to tell you.

224
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:57,056
I landed my internship

225
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,655
at Beiya Hospital.

226
00:14:59,056 --> 00:14:59,775
For real?

227
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:00,135
Yes.

228
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:01,575
Treat me to a big meal.

229
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:03,335
Let's not celebrate this first.

230
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:03,976
What about you?

231
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:10,056
Well, eat as much as you can.

232
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:11,895
You can have all the big pieces.

233
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:12,655
Eat more.

234
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:13,736
Eat up.

235
00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,256
And you can have small pieces.

236
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,060
(2019 Jiangzhou, China)

237
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,260
(Arrive at the exit)

238
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
(Did you take my charging cable?)

239
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,610
(Check if it's with you.)

240
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,215
I didn't take your thing.

241
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:39,455
You better look for it yourself.

242
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,056
(I didn't take your thing.)

243
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,535
(You better look for it yourself.)

244
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,015
Mr. Ning.

245
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,655
Isn't your charging cable
right before you?

246
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:53,655
Mr. Ning.

247
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,816
If you want to know
whether she arrived safely,

248
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,856
just ask her directly.

249
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,176
Mind your own business.

250
00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:59,215
Keep your meddling nose out
of my affairs.

251
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:00,416
It's almost time

252
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,335
to go for the rounds.

253
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,335
I know.

254
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,300
(Ning Zhiqian)

255
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,260
(Delete)

256
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,940
(Delete the contact)

257
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
(Two months later)

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,540
(West District Hospital of Jiangzhou)

259
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,320
(President's Office)

260
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:29,895
Come on in.

261
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:32,496
President Wang, why do you ask for me?

262
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:33,775
Go get changed.

263
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:34,816
Let's go to the airport.

264
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:35,856
Airport?

265
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:37,135
President Wang.

266
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,296
I'm sorry to let you down

267
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,895
as I failed to bring Mr. Zhao
back from Dahl last time.

268
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,575
Zhiqian told me about this.
It wasn't your fault.

269
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:45,296
He told me

270
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,736
that Mr. Zhao is healing nicely
these two months.

271
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:49,335
Really? That's great.

272
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:52,816
Are you close to Dr. Ning?

273
00:16:53,135 --> 00:16:54,335
His mother, Wen Yi

274
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:55,895
was my bosom friend for decades.

275
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,535
Sadly, she passed away
in an accident in Africa.

276
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,816
She didn't get to attend
her son's wedding

277
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,215
and meet her daughter-in-law.

278
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:04,575
Life is full of uncertainty.

279
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:09,376
Mr. Zhao.

280
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:10,935
President Wang.

281
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:11,575
Mr. Zhao.

282
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:13,575
Oh, my. President Wang.

283
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,256
Nice to see you again, Mr. Zhao.

284
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:16,055
Your complexion is good.

285
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:17,256
Thank you.

286
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:18,896
You look younger than you did
before you went to Africa.

287
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:21,016
Thanks to Dr. Ding.

288
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:33,616
You're back too, Zhiqian.

289
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:35,976
How do you feel recently?

290
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:36,815
I must get a good look at you.

291
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,736
I'm good here.

292
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,415
Nutritional science is my expertise.

293
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:40,496
I'm in tip-top shape.

294
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,080
Pretty good.

295
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:45,575
Mr. Zhao.

296
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,295
I booked a table at Wangyue Restaurant.

297
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,856
Let's have a meal together

298
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:49,815
to welcome your return.

299
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:52,415
I'm kind of tired

300
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:53,695
after the long flight.

301
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,016
What about this?

302
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,175
Dr. Ning will go on my behalf.

303
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:59,376
Let's meet up someday.

304
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,295
I will treat you to a meal.

305
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:01,935
- What do you say?
- Sure.

306
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,215
You may go home and take a rest.

307
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,335
Zhiqian.

308
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:05,935
You should go.

309
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:06,496
Sure.

310
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,095
Ruan, walk with Dr. Ning.

311
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:11,295
Give it to me.

312
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:11,695
No need.

313
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:12,496
Give it to me.

314
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:21,896
Thank you.

315
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:24,295
Please enjoy your meal.

316
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,656
Zhiqian.

317
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,295
I'm driving today.

318
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:31,095
I can't drink.

319
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:32,896
Dr. Ruan.

320
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:34,896
Drink to Zhiqian for me.

321
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:37,815
Sure.

322
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:39,256
Can Dr. Ruan drink?

323
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:39,935
Don't force her.

324
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,575
She holds her alcohol well.

325
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:45,695
Dr. Ning.

326
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:46,976
I will drink to you.

327
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,455
-Thank you.
-Alright.

328
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:51,935
I will drink juice.

329
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,095
Hello.

330
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,575
Mr. Chen.

331
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:07,215
Hold on.

332
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,815
It's the hospital.

333
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,776
You eat first.

334
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,575
Dr. Wu isn't back this time?

335
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:19,656
He came back last month.

336
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:24,976
Why did you delete my contact?

337
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:27,295
We won't be in touch, anyway.

338
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,455
We're meeting again here.

339
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:30,695
Give me your contact.

340
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:31,856
I'll scan your code.

341
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,376
This isn't necessary.

342
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:34,896
We have nothing to talk about.

343
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,736
You left your pajamas in my room.

344
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,136
I wanted to ask you

345
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:43,295
if you want me to send it back or...

346
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,736
No need. Throw it away.

347
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:46,896
Oh, you should've told me.

348
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,095
I have brought it back.

349
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,815
It's in my suitcase.

350
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:49,736
I will bring it for you later.

351
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:53,256
Zhiqian.

352
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,935
You know what, both you and Dr. Ruan

353
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,376
are with neurosurgery.

354
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,815
Dr. Ruan told me just now.

355
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,536
When Dr. Ruan first came
to the hospital,

356
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,335
I asked which department
she wanted to choose.

357
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:08,335
When she said neurosurgery,

358
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:10,335
I was taken aback by her answer.

359
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,856
She is indeed a tough girl.

360
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,616
About the recent trip to Africa,

361
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,376
she volunteered for it.

362
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:20,575
We must cultivate

363
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,695
such a go-getter like her, right?

364
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:24,736
Oh, right.

365
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,496
Beiya Hospital is short-staffed
currently

366
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:27,856
and requested a secondment

367
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:29,415
from West District Hospital.

368
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,496
I have been thinking about this.

369
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:36,575
I want to give this chance to Dr. Ruan.

370
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:37,896
Really?

371
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:40,776
It's a good chance for you
to learn there.

372
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,215
Thank you so much.

373
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:47,815
Zhiqian.

374
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:50,175
Dr. Ruan is going to Beiya Hospital.

375
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,776
Could you be her mentor?

376
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,215
I'm aware

377
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,736
that you don't simply accept students.

378
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,295
But I can tell you without a doubt

379
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,575
that Dr. Ruan

380
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,776
is a potential top-bracket doctor.

381
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:14,376
Zhiqian.

382
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:15,575
As you know,

383
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,976
West District Hospital
lacks good doctors.

384
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,736
Why don't you share my burden

385
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,896
to cultivate the talents?

386
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,175
Fine.

387
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:25,376
I will guide her.

388
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,896
Ruan, hurry up.

389
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:30,055
Drink to Dr. Ning.

390
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:31,815
Yes.

391
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:34,376
Dr. Ning.

392
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:35,536
I will drink to you.

393
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:37,815
Stop calling him Dr. Ning.

394
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:38,776
That sounds distant.

395
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:40,175
What should I call him?

396
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,455
Call him Mr. Ning.

397
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:45,656
Mr. Ning.

398
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:46,415
Here's to you.

399
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:48,976
I've finished mine.

400
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:08,976
Top up his glass.

401
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:11,496
Sure.

402
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,455
Thank you.

403
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:23,776
Ask for his contact.

404
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,736
Chop-chop. It's a rare chance.

405
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,055
Sure.

406
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:34,656
Ask for the contact.

407
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,536
Mr. Ning.

408
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:40,976
Can we exchange our contacts?

409
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,496
Sure.

410
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:47,295
May I have your contact code?

411
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:50,016
Really?

412
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,660
(Ning Zhiqian)

413
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:15,055
I...I have sent you a friend request.

414
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:15,935
Please approve it.

415
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
(I thought you didn't want my contact.)

416
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,130
(Remember to take your pajamas from me.)

417
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,496
(Zhiqian.)

418
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:56,136
(Eat more.)

419
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:57,215
Madam Wang. You too.

420
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:08,695
Which of these buildings
is his block again?

421
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:10,496
I can't remember that.

422
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:11,815
This.

423
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:14,695
Why did you know about that?

424
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,455
Well,

425
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,215
Mr. Ning mentioned it
before he got into the car.

426
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,095
Block 7 Unit No. 2.

427
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,055
It's written here.

428
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:27,656
Zhiqian.

429
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:28,856
We've arrived.

430
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:30,055
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

431
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:31,575
I know you're tired.

432
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:33,095
Thank you, Madam Wang.

433
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:34,055
You're welcome.

434
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,175
Oh, I have something for you.

435
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,016
Not now. President Wang is here.

436
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,536
Don't take it out now.

437
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:10,575
Madam Wang.

438
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,695
I brought you a gift from Africa.

439
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,496
For me?

440
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,215
I won't be shy then.

441
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:16,935
Thank you.

442
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,455
Don't be so courteous.

443
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:20,575
You carried this all the way back here.

444
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:21,175
The suitcase must be very heavy.

445
00:25:21,295 --> 00:25:22,055
I heard that it's a good product.

446
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:22,776
You can try it.

447
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,536
Let's keep in touch.

448
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,376
Get rest early.

449
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:28,215
I have zipped the case.

450
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:29,016
Let me carry it inside.

451
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,175
No need. I can do it myself.

452
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,016
It's fine.

453
00:25:31,295 --> 00:25:32,215
I will get going, then.

454
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,376
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

455
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:39,016
Don't mention it.

456
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:41,095
Get rest early.

457
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:42,616
Bye-bye.

458
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:43,136
Bye-bye.

459
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:44,455
Bye-bye.

460
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:45,376
Bye-bye.

461
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:47,536
Ruan.

462
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:50,575
I remember
your marital status is divorced

463
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:53,656
when you're filling out the form, right?

464
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:59,016
Same as Zhiqian.

465
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:00,616
I see.

466
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:01,776
Ruan.

467
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:03,935
Your transfer to Beiya

468
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,536
is a singular opportunity.

469
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,656
You must seize it well.

470
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:08,455
You must try

471
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:11,095
to reap success in both career
and love life.

472
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:15,256
Why so serious?

473
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,736
It's just a joke.

474
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:17,536
Hop in.

475
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,920
(When are you taking
the pajamas from me?)

476
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,496
Fasten the belt.

477
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:53,656
Hey, eat something.

478
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:54,616
Sit down and eat.

479
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:56,175
It's too late. I need to go now.

480
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:56,575
Here.

481
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,656
Take two eggs.

482
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:59,016
- One is enough.
- Not at all.

483
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,496
Now, you're working at Beiya.

484
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,136
Does it mean

485
00:27:03,616 --> 00:27:05,776
you will see Zhiqian every day?

486
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,815
Look at her. What's the hurry?

487
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:12,055
This world is small, isn't it?

488
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,016
She has been avoiding Zhiqian
for six years.

489
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,295
Yet now they meet again.

490
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,136
I wonder what Liuzheng

491
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,695
thinks about Zhiqian.

492
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:20,776
Do you know anything?

493
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,095
She always deflects the topic
whenever I mention Zhiqian.

494
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:26,575
Despite this, I think

495
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:29,335
both of them are shoved together

496
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:30,536
by heaven's will.

497
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:32,695
She can't go against heaven,
can she?

498
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,055
No.

499
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:35,935
Speaking of which, Zhiqian

500
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:37,415
is a nice man.

501
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:38,335
- Am I right?
- Rightfully so.

502
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,455
We must be on the same page this time.

503
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:45,695
Yes if it's about our consensus,

504
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:47,575
but not about the food.

505
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:48,695
I prefer buns.

506
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:49,376
What an old hat.

507
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,940
(Beiya Hospital)

508
00:28:13,856 --> 00:28:15,175
(The patient on bed twelve
is off an operating table.)

509
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,295
(Do keep a close watch
on the patient's situation.)

510
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:18,136
Tan Ya.

511
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:19,215
You're here.

512
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:21,736
Come with me.

513
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:22,896
Today is your first day here.

514
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,656
I will show you around.

515
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,055
In Beiya's Neurosurgery Department,
there are four inpatient wards.

516
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:28,335
Over there, it is Ward 1 and 2.

517
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:29,815
This site is Ward 3 and 4.

518
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:32,656
Every ward has its own head.

519
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:34,656
Currently, the head of Ward 3

520
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:35,575
remains vacant.

521
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,055
Ning Zhiqian is one of the candidates.

522
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:39,656
He's not even 35 years old.

523
00:28:39,736 --> 00:28:41,256
How come the hospital
regards him so highly?

524
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,415
Because he is courageous and wise.

525
00:28:43,415 --> 00:28:44,415
He's a skilled neurosurgeon

526
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,376
who stands out

527
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,935
amongst the young doctors.

528
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:49,136
Besides, he has a great teacher.

529
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,496
That's Liu Chenxi, a legendary character

530
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,815
in the history of Beiya.

531
00:28:55,736 --> 00:29:00,016
Speaking of which,
both of you are quite fated.

532
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,656
No, we have a deeper fate.

533
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:04,415
Hey.

534
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:06,695
Don't tell others about our past.

535
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,055
I'm not a gossip.

536
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:09,055
No, you're.

537
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:11,896
You know me well though.

538
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,095
Buy me a meal.

539
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:15,695
You better tell me what you want to eat

540
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:17,215
so that I can buy your silence.

541
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,776
Watch your purse well.

542
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,900
(Expert Team of Neurosurgery)

543
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:39,540
(Ning Zhiqian)

544
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,016
Come on,
I'll show you the changing room.

545
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:00,016
I will introduce
your new colleagues to you.

546
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:02,415
Guys, over here.

547
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,896
Let me introduce her to you.

548
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:05,736
She's seconded to work here

549
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:07,055
from West District Hospital.

550
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,496
Her name is Ruan Liuzheng.

551
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:09,736
Let's welcome her.

552
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:12,496
Hello, I'm Ruan Liuzheng.

553
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:13,935
Please look out for me.

554
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:15,415
It's been a while, Dr. Ruan.

555
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:16,935
Do you still remember me?
I'm Wu Xiaofan.

556
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:17,976
Dr. Wu.

557
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,896
Finally, a female doctor comes.

558
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:22,856
Let me introduce myself.

559
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:23,575
I'm Bai Jun,

560
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,575
the chief resident.

561
00:30:25,695 --> 00:30:26,736
The unattached bachelor.

562
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:27,376
Dr. Ruan.

563
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:28,776
Nice to meet you.

564
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,536
Dr. Ruan, just ignore him.

565
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,335
He's not a good guy.

566
00:30:32,335 --> 00:30:33,536
Stay away from him.

567
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,536
Guys, attention.

568
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,415
Stop eating.

569
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:38,055
- Let me introduce her to you.
- Who is that?

570
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:38,815
Deputy Manager Qian.

571
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:41,415
Ning Zhiqian's competitor
of the ward manager of Ward 3.

572
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:42,335
(She is a new resident.)

573
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:43,376
(Say something to them.)

574
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,616
Hello, I'm Ding Yiyuan.

575
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,256
Please look out for me.

576
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:48,175
Sure.

577
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,095
- Welcome.
- Good.

578
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,215
Mr. Qian.

579
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:52,415
She's a newcomer too.

580
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:53,815
Ruan Liuzheng
from West District Hospital?

581
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,215
Hello, I'm Qian Shaogang.

582
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,055
Nice to meet you, Mr. Qian.

583
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,616
Well. Get to know each other.

584
00:30:58,616 --> 00:30:59,415
We have rounds later.

585
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,736
Seriously?

586
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:01,335
(All right.)

587
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,856
I'm off. Call me if you need anything.

588
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:07,335
Where are our desks?

589
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,496
Go wait at Dr. Ning's office.

590
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,415
He will tell you later.

591
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,736
Where did you study
for your doctoral program?

592
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:26,896
I only took the master's program.

593
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,815
You have already accomplished
the doctoral program?

594
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,575
Impressive.

595
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,575
My parents forced me
to start school earlier.

596
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:49,215
You're here.

597
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:50,815
Mr. Ning.

598
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:51,536
Yes.

599
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,136
I'm the newcomer, Ding Yiyuan.

600
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,295
You're Qian's student?

601
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:55,095
Yes.

602
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,295
Mr. Ning. I'm Ruan Liuzheng.

603
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:01,536
Ding, your place is over there.

604
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:02,856
Ruan Liuzheng, you sit there.

605
00:32:03,295 --> 00:32:04,095
- Yes.
- Yes.

606
00:32:05,455 --> 00:32:07,335
Mr. Ning, may I ask you something?

607
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,055
Go on.

608
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,536
I'm also new to this department.

609
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,215
Why did you refuse to guide me?

610
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:14,455
Is there a problem with me?

611
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:17,976
Maybe I should put it this way.

612
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:19,656
Why did you choose Ruan Liuzheng

613
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:20,976
instead of me?

614
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:26,376
I'm at liberty
to choose my own students.

615
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:27,575
If you think I've made the wrong choice,

616
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:28,736
prove it, then.

617
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:33,976
Time for rounds.

618
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,160
(2012 Jiangzhou University
Medical Faculty)

619
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,640
(Ruan Liuzheng steals
someone's boyfriend!)

620
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:43,376
Ruan Liuzheng.

621
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,415
What's wrong with you?

622
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,215
These annoying notes are on the door.

623
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,616
Didn't you see that?

624
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:49,415
Why bother?

625
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:50,496
I have taken them off several times.

626
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:52,016
Wait.

627
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:54,215
Why don't you tell
those from the Arts Department

628
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,095
that it was Dong Miaomiao
who cheated on him?

629
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:57,815
You can't just remain silent
when you have been wrongly accused.

630
00:32:57,815 --> 00:32:58,575
Keep it down.

631
00:32:58,616 --> 00:32:59,215
Argh.

632
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,400
Why don't you tell them the truth?

633
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,935
Why do you keep the secret
for Dong Miaomiao?

634
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:04,536
No, I didn't do it to protect her.

635
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,016
It's just that I don't want Ning
to be embarrassed.

636
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,736
Besides, this is their privacy.

637
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:08,976
It doesn't concern me.

638
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,095
Still, you should defend yourself
instead of enduring everything

639
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,376
when you didn't steal her boyfriend.

640
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:13,496
That sounds awful.

641
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,976
Calm down. We're graduating soon.

642
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,335
I won't be hearing this
even if I want to.

643
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:18,376
Oh, gosh.

644
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,896
You seem to enjoy these rumors, huh?

645
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:22,055
How generous of you.

646
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,256
Well.

647
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,656
Don't be angry. Let me buy you a meal.

648
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:27,175
No, I don't feel like eating now.

649
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,616
Ning, here.

650
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:35,935
Come on. Sit.

651
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:36,496
Sit.

652
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,016
We wanted to treat you
to a good meal outside.

653
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,536
Yet you refused it.

654
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:41,136
So, we will eat at the school canteen.

655
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,095
This is a pretty place.

656
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:42,736
There are many choices here.

657
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,575
Will anything happen between you two?

658
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:46,536
I don't know.

659
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:52,295
Two people occupied this long table.

660
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:54,055
Are you not ashamed of yourself?

661
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:58,256
Tan Ya, let's move to another table.

662
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:59,215
No, sit here.

663
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:00,256
We're not going anywhere.

664
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,376
The witch still
has a guilty conscience.

665
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:05,496
Whom are you referring to?
Say that again.

666
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:08,016
Ruan Liuzheng steals
someone's boyfriend.

667
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:15,695
Tan Ya, no.

668
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:17,056
How dare you throw water at me?

669
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,375
I will slap you if you swear at me.

670
00:34:19,536 --> 00:34:20,976
Ruan Liuzheng
steals someone's boyfriend.

671
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:22,536
How dare you!

672
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:25,056
Threw water at me?

673
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:25,976
How dare you swore at her!

674
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:30,776
Stop it!

675
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,096
Stop it now!

676
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:39,976
Listen up.

677
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,935
It has nothing to do
with Ruan Liuzheng.

678
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:44,016
If you spew gibberish again,

679
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:45,415
you will be sent
to the Student Conduct Office.

681
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:53,175
Listen up.

682
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,096
If you dare spew gibberish,

683
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:56,455
- I will beat you up whenever I see you.
-Leave now.

684
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,336
-You traitor, Ning Zhiqian!
-You traitor, Ning Zhiqian!

685
00:34:58,336 --> 00:34:58,760
How dare you!

686
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,455
You don't deserve Miaomiao.

687
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:00,000
You traitor!

688
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,976
You don't deserve Arts Department.

689
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:01,935
What a traitor.

690
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,415
I will send you back to the dorm.

691
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:06,976
Sure.

692
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,175
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

693
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:10,816
It's fine.

694
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,135
I'm graduating soon, anyway.

695
00:35:12,135 --> 00:35:14,215
Besides, Tan Ya and I
have beaten them up.

696
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:18,736
Ning.

697
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:20,496
Liuzheng.

698
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:23,096
Hi, Cheng.

699
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:23,776
Have you eaten?

700
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,336
Let's go grab a meal.

701
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,296
I've eaten.

702
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:30,496
I will get going, then.

703
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:32,496
Bye-bye.

704
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:37,016
Ning.

705
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,415
The shirt on her is yours, right?

706
00:35:39,415 --> 00:35:40,615
Mind your own business.

707
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,175
Ning, wait for me.

708
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,496
Ning. Ning Zhiqian.

709
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,855
Let's get something straight.

710
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:46,816
What's it?

711
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,096
You hang out a lot
with Liuzheng these days.

712
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:50,615
Do we have to

713
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,855
get your permission, then?

714
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:53,536
You have already set her up with me.

715
00:35:53,536 --> 00:35:55,016
Never covet your friend's girl,
don't you know that?

716
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,415
You just met her.

717
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,415
Your progress is way far

718
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:58,736
from what you imagined, okay?

719
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:03,695
Do you have a thing for her?

720
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:05,695
She's our junior.

721
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,175
Are you sure?

722
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:11,455
Why hold her hand if you don't like her?

723
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,455
Took advantage of her?

724
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:14,576
You weren't on the scene just now.

725
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,016
I just feel bad for her.

726
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:16,855
Jeez, this is worse.

727
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:18,296
Ning.

728
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,496
Liuzheng is a nice girl.

729
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,415
She's not snobbish and has a kind soul.

730
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,976
Stay away from her
if you don't like her.

731
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,895
Leave this chance
to those who really need it.

732
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,976
Jeez.

733
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:14,096
How does it feel while walking
with your prince in the public eye?

734
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,855
How does it feel while walking

735
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:18,855
with Ning Zhiqian in the public eye?

736
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,536
My brain was deprived of oxygen
and my heart was racing.

737
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,135
I realized

738
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,615
that he has feelings for you.

739
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:28,695
This can't be true.

740
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:32,296
Will such a miracle

741
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,976
fall on me?

742
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:35,455
Why not?

743
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,296
Why can't Ning Zhiqian fall for you?

744
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,536
But I'm way inferior to Dong,

745
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:41,736
right?

746
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:44,976
Well, the gap between you two
is quite large.

747
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:47,496
As compared to you,

748
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:49,816
she's hotter,

749
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,256
more elegant,

750
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,615
and nicely-dressed.

751
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:55,536
She knows arts better.

752
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,615
She indeed has an edge over you.

In my eyes,
you're perfect in every way.

You managed 25 rounds today.

761

I didn't miss even one round.

of the vice president.

851
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:41,375
She requested to follow Ning Zhiqian.

852
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,536
But he refused it.

853
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:44,016
So, she's under Dr. Qian at last.

854
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:47,776
Speaking of Ning Zhiqian
taking you as his student,

855
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:49,415
you have garnered much jealousy
because of this. Do you know that?

856
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:51,496
Many girls in the hospital admire him.

857
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,855
Keep yourself in check

858
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:53,855
and do your work well.

859
00:43:53,895 --> 00:43:54,776
All right.
