3
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:42,707
You must be starving.

4
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:44,347
What do you want? I can cook for you.

5
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,107
Just the instant noodles will do.
It's more convenient.

6
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,266
The operation took you a few hours.

7
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,186
You must be really tired.

8
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:04,906
I'm used to it already.

9
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,747
You should go and unpack now.

10
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,146
I'll do the cooking.

11
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:10,827
Sure.

12
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,066
Do you like your noodles

13
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:28,866
hard or soft?

14
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:30,786
I'm fine with either.

15
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:32,706
What about the soup?

16
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:33,786
Do you want more or less?

17
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,226
I don't mind.

18
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,267
Do you prefer a sunny-side-up egg

19
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:40,346
or a hard-boiled egg?

20
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:42,307
A sunny-side-up egg.

21
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:44,986
You're so meticulous
even when you cook instant noodles.

22
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:46,626
When I was younger,

23
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:49,267
I had instant noodles every day.

24
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,187
I had to make it delicious,

25
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:52,586
so that it'd be more bearable.

26
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,786
Why did you have
instant noodles so often?

27
00:02:58,267 --> 00:02:59,786
My mom was always working
at the hospital.

28
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:02,986
And I never knew where my dad went.

29
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:12,226
I'll make sure
you never eat instant noodles again.

30
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:22,107
Get me two eggs.

31
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,747
It smells great.

32
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:30,466
You're up.

33
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,107
I overslept.

34
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,947
Why did you wake up so early?

35
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,066
I got woken up by your snore.

36
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:40,267
Did I snore?

37
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,226
You talked in your sleep too.

38
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,107
What did I say?

39
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,267
Figure it out yourself.

40
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:04,947
Let's eat. The food is ready.

41
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,547
Sure.

42
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:09,547
I left your pajamas on the bed.

43
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,226

Lunch.

49
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:16,547
Where's mine?

50
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:17,786
Have you seen Ning today?

51
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,867
You shouldn't call him Ning anymore.

52
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:20,707
You should call him darling now.

53
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,746
I'm used to calling him Ning.

54
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,026
Ning Zhiqian.

55
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,346
Your wife brought you lunch.

56
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:31,387
I've got to go.

57
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,707
You're so mean.

58
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:44,746
Do you know

59
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:45,866
where my favorite place is
in the hospital?

60
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,546
The operating theater?

61
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:49,626
You have another chance.

62
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,546
The cafeteria.

63
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:53,186
Here.

64
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:54,707
You're so foolish.

65
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,587
Why do you like it here? It's so windy.

66
00:08:58,186 --> 00:08:58,986
It's quiet.

67
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,227
I didn't expect it to be so windy today.

68
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,186
It's because I'm here.

69
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:03,707
Are you the wind?

70
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:06,866
You haven't had your lunch too, right?

71
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,066
I haven't.

72
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,866
You deliver lunch to me every day,

73
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:10,666
but you never eat your lunch on time.

74
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:13,546
I'll just grab something to eat later.

75
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,106
You've changed.

76
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:17,907
When you were a student,

77
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,426
you were always the first one
to arrive at the cafeteria.

78
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:21,387
How did you know about that?

79
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:23,387
Wait. You didn't bring me chopsticks.

80
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:28,907
What do we do now?

81
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:31,546
I can drink the soup.

82
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:32,546
But the rice...

83
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,066
Why don't we eat with our hands?

84
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,347
Our hands are dirty.

85
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,426
I'll ask Tan Ya. Give me a minute.

86
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:41,426
No need to trouble yourself with that.

87
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,866
We can use this.

88
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:48,746
Cotton swabs?

89
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,827
Why do you carry this with you?

90
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,587
I took this from the Nurse Station.

91
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,306
Why did you take this?

92
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:55,666
Someone told me

93
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,546
I can use this to train
the flexibility of my fingers.

94
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:58,787
I didn't expect this
to come in handy now.

95
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:00,827
- Try it.
- They're too short.

96
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:01,746
That's how you train your fingers.

97
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:02,746
Try it.

98
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:04,986
It's not bad.

99
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:09,986
All right.

100
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,587
Stop messing with the food.

101
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:12,707
You need more practice.

102
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,186
Here.

103
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:17,787
- Is it good?
- Don't open your mouth so wide.

104
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:18,907
Or you'll get a bloated stomach later.

105
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,347
Try the soup.

106
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,707
Why don't you sit here?

107
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,106
Come here.

108
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,746
Or you will get a bloated stomach.

109
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:32,467
You need to start
training your flexibility

110
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,227
through all these
trivial things in life.

111
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,106
Get it?

112
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,587
Try the soup.

113
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:37,426
Show me how you eat the dish.

114
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:40,506
It's not bad.

115
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,066
Try picking up the food.

116
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:46,827
Pick a big one.

117
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,227
That's not bad.

118
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,147
Is it good?

119
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,227
It's not bad.

120
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,106
Do you think it's good?

121
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:01,827
It's good.

122
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:14,306
The surgery's over?

123
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:15,306
How did it go?

124
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,186
It went well.

125
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:18,626
How long have you been here?

126
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:19,827
I arrived not long ago.

127
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,986
I found a new recipe and
made Ginseng Chicken Soup.

128
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,027
I prepared a steamed fish for you too.

129
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,666
Eat it while it's hot.

130
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,306
What are you having for lunch?

131
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:30,866
I'm not hungry.

132
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,426
I'll just grab some food
when I'm hungry later.

133
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:35,306
What do you want for dinner?

134
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,027
I heard that millet pumpkin porridge

135
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,066
is good for the stomach.

136
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,506
Cut yourself some slack tonight.

137
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:40,467
I'm working overtime.

138
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:41,947
I can grab a bite at the cafeteria.

139
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:42,746
You can't.

140
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:43,707
You have a weak stomach now,

141
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:44,506
so you need to eat your meals on time.

142
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,467
Don't trouble yourself with it.

143
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,186
Stay at home and prepare for your exam.

144
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:49,066
Traveling here will not only
waste your time, but also tire you out.

145
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:51,866
I don't mind.

146
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,666
Stop doing that.
We're at the hospital.

147
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,506
I'm having outpatient duty
this afternoon.

148
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,426
You should get going.

149
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,787
I'll get going.

150
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:13,227
Bye.

151
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:13,866
Bye.

152
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,986
Come home early tonight.

Did you have a long day?

156
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:08,907
I'm fine.

Darling.

00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,066
I'll make you
grilled eggplant for dinner.

160
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,920
- Let's have it.
- This one.

Sure.

162

Darling, look how cute the pumpkin is.

163
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:19,546
This is delicious.

164
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:20,787
Let's get both, darling.

165
00:13:20,787 --> 00:13:21,227

00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,066
Darl...

174
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,147
Darl... Ning.

175
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:40,827
I want roasted eggplant for dinner.

176
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:41,986
Let's have roasted eggplant.

177
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,147
Darl... Ning?

178
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,387
I don't want it.

179
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,347
Let's have it.

180
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:51,866
You go first.

181
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:52,666
Take a bite.

182
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,106
I love half-cooked cheese the most.

183
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,426
You should eat more then.

184
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:06,426
Eat it.

185
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:07,746
I don't want to eat this.
You can have it.

186
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,306
Take a bite.

187
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,347
- Just a bite.
- I thought you like it a lot.

188
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:10,387
- You should eat more.
- One more bite.

189
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,347
Is it good?

190
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,180
(2019 Jiangzhou Beiya Hospital, China)

191
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,787
Dr. Ruan.

192
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:37,947
Come here.

193
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:43,827
What's the matter, Mr. Ning?

194
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:46,186
Do you have anything fixed
for the evening later?

195
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:47,587
Evening?

196
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,546
Not yet.

197
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,426
What's the matter?

198
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,027
That's good.

199
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:07,666
Take this.

200
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:10,267
What is this?

201
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,227
Please do me a favor later.

202
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,506
Please pick up my son

203
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:15,467
from Cosmo Kindergarten.

204
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,027
He's in K2 and his name is Ning Xiang.

205
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,387
Send him home after that.

206
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,986
This is the pick-up pass.

207
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,947
Why do you want me to pick him up?

208
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,666
Hasn't Wu Xiaofan
explained it to you already?

209
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,986
My student will do the chores first,
and then the outpatient duty.

210
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,666
You should pick up the boy
after being the operation assistant.

211
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:35,106
I don't know how to look after children.

212
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,106
Don't worry. It takes time.

213
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,546
Why don't you pick him up yourself?

214
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:40,267
I have a meeting
to attend in the evening.

215
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,546
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
asked you for a favor.

216
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:43,066
It's almost time. You should get going.

217
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,746
Pack your things now and don't be late.

218
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,387
My son will bite you if he gets upset.

219
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,900
(Pick-up pass)

220
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,980
(Kindergarten)

221
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:03,947
He's here.

222
00:16:04,387 --> 00:16:05,546
See you tomorrow.

223
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:06,986
Bye, Tongtong.

224
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:08,866
Bye.

225
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:13,707
Who are you?

226
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:15,787
I told you.

227
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:17,267
I'm your dad's coworker.

228
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,027
What's your name?

229
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:22,506
Ruan Liuzheng.

230
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:27,587
Ruan Liuzheng?

231
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,186
We met before.

232
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,027
That's impossible.

233
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:35,066
This is our first meeting.

234
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,186
There's no way you've seen me before.

235
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,027
(I feel like I've seen her before.)

236
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,666
(Where did we meet before?)

237
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,266
Even if you think I'm good-looking,

238
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,107
you don't have
to keep staring at me, right?

239
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,107
I'm sure I've seen you before.

240
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,707
We probably met in your dream.

241
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,827
Have you ever been to Africa?

242
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,507
I have.

243
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,426
What's the matter?

244
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,507
I know who you are.

245
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:36,906
Who am I?

246
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:39,146
My mom.

247
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:42,707
Don't talk nonsense.

248
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:43,827
You're lying.

249
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:47,827
I'm not lying.

250
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:48,827
I'm not your mom.

251
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:49,987
If you're not lying,

252
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,186
why don't you dare look me in the eyes?

253
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:54,906
I...

254
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:58,507
Of course, I dare look into your eyes.

255
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:00,107
Haven't I been staring at you
all this while?

256
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,467
You were averting your gaze

257
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,227
and wouldn't stop looking
at your surroundings.

258
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,587
Listen.

259
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:12,906
I'm not your mother.

260
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:18,627
Where are you going?

261
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:20,066
Stop running.

262
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:25,786
(Door's open.)

263
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,146
Have you been to my place before?

264
00:19:29,507 --> 00:19:30,186
No.

265
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,306
You're lying again.

266
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,906
Aren't you the person in the photo?

267
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,467
I know who you are.

268
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,587
You were married to my dad.

269
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:47,186
If you're not my mom,

270
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,507
who are you?

271
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,146
There's no way I am your mom.

272
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,426
What can I do

273
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,627
to make you believe me?

274
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:54,786
My dad told me

275
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,587
that my mom was a doctor in Africa.

276
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,867
Haven't you been to Africa too?

277
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,066
Yes. I've been to Africa.

278
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:03,867
But I'm not your mother.

279
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:06,227
You were married to my dad.

280
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:08,627
How can you not be my mom?

281
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,306
(Door's open.)
We were once married,

282
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,026
but I'm not your mom.

283
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,227
How many times do I have to repeat this?

284
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:18,107
You're lying again.

285
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,107
Ning Xiang.

286
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:20,987
Dad.

287
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:21,987
Get back to your room.

288
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,546
Dad, I have a question for you.

289
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:27,507
Is she my mom?

290
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,107
She's not your mom.

291
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:32,906
I don't believe you.

292
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,146
I have proof.

293
00:20:35,947 --> 00:20:37,666
Who gave you the permission
to take this?

294
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:56,266
I only wanted to see pictures of my mom,

295
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:59,266
but you hid them from me.

296
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:01,627
Who gave you the permission to take it?
Pass it to me.

297
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:03,827
You're so naughty.

298
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:04,947
Go to your room now.

299
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,266
Why are you so naughty?

300
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,347
Stop crying. Go to your room now.

301
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,347
I have told you many times.

302
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:24,786
I have told you many times.

303
00:21:31,786 --> 00:21:32,987
Stop crying. Go to your room now.

304
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,666
Why are you yelling at him?

305
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:39,186
Stop yelling at the kid.

306
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:40,266
Mom.

307
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,786
Dad bullied me.

308
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:46,227
Mom.

309
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:50,227
He's the bad guy.

310
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:52,947
All right. Stop crying.

311
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,066
Let's go and wash your face.

312
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:54,747
Let's go.

313
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:04,786
Stop crying.

314
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:08,227
Let's go and wash your face.

315
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:09,867
What a crybaby.

316
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,227
Let's go to your room.

317
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:36,987
Stay here and play with your toys.

318
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:52,747
He's just a kid.

319
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:53,906
Don't take what he said to heart.

320
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,987
The kid's mother...

321
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,066
Forget it.

322
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,507
I'll get going.

323
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,186
Also,

324
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,026
you should really stop yelling

325
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:08,987
at the kid.

326
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:39,306
Ning Xiang.

327
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,306
Let me cook you
something nice tonight, okay?

328
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:49,666
Should I make chicken wings?

329
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,827
I'll let you know once I'm done.

330
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,266
My girl.

331
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,507
You gave me a fright.

332
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,347
Look at you.

333
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,666
You're getting wrinkles.

334
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,786
It's time you
take good care of your skin.

335
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,186
I went to the beauty parlor today.

336
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:38,347
I got you
some facial cleansers and E-oil.

337
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:39,507
Most importantly,

338
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:42,707
I got you the Youthkeeper Serum.

339
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,266
I was told that, by using this,

340
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,426
you can keep
your current boyfriend loyal,

341
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:48,266
and make your ex-boyfriend
regret what he did.

342
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:52,386
You only need to make sure
my dad stays loyal to you.

343
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:53,546
Don't do that.

344
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:55,266
I bought them for you.

345
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,186
Look.

346
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,186
Although Zhiqian is
a few years older than you,

347
00:24:58,627 --> 00:24:59,947
you look like you're of the same age

348
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,186
when you're standing side by side.

349
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:03,587
It's too late to regret

350
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:05,146
when others start mistaking you
for his elder sister.

351
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:08,627
I don't mind being his aunt too.

352
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:10,467
What a brave woman.

353
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,186
Good job.

354
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:12,747
Go away.

355
00:25:13,066 --> 00:25:14,666
I just don't get it.

356
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,386
I don't understand

357
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:17,747
why you got a divorce.

358
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:20,107
The divorce has happened.

359
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,827
There's no point dwelling on it anymore.

360
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,107
The divorce has happened.

361
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,786
There's no point dwelling on it anymore.

362
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,386
Why not?

363
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,266
Your paths crossed again.

364
00:25:29,426 --> 00:25:30,747
This is fate.

365
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:32,827
My girl.

366
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:36,987
Have you considered
getting back together?

367
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,266
Stop pressing on this.

368
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,146
Stop pressing on this.

369
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:42,386
Let's go.

370
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,066
Then...

371
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,026
Did he cheat on you?

372
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:51,107
How could he cheat on me?

373
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:53,867
Did you cheat on him?

374
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,867
Wait. That's rubbish.

375
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:56,707
What's the matter with you?

376
00:25:56,707 --> 00:25:57,707
Go away.

377
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,146
You should leave.

378
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,867
She needs to practice yoga in silence.

379
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,747
What actually happened?

380
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:04,747
Tell me now.

381
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,386
You're driving me over the edge.

382
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:09,066
Mom.

383
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,666
His son is six years old now.

384
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,347
He's in K2 now.

385
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:16,347
What?

386
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,587
His son is six years old?

387
00:26:19,906 --> 00:26:21,306
Why did I have no idea about this?

388
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,066
Why haven't I heard about this before?

389
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,347
He doesn't have
to tell you everything, right?

390
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:27,186
What's going on?

391
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,146
You're sending me over the edge.

392
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,306
Tell me now.

393
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,666
Stop asking. You should leave now.

394
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:32,347
Tell me now.

395
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:33,546
Or I won't leave your room.

396
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:34,707
- Hurry up.
- I won't put down my legs

397
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:36,026
if you refuse to leave.
I'll just wear myself out.

398
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:36,867
Look at her.

399
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:37,627
She's so tired now.

400
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:38,627
You should leave now.

401
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:39,666
Hurry up.

402
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:42,347
I won't tell you anything.
Go to bed now.

403
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:43,386
I have to work tomorrow.

404
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:44,507
Just go.

405
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:46,426
You better watch out.

406
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
- She has work tomorrow.
- I...

407
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,386
You should get going.

408
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,627
So annoying.

409
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:52,066
All right.

410
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:53,426
Hurry up.

411
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,227
Put it down.

412
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,906
Get up now.

413
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:58,266
Is your back all right?

414
00:26:58,306 --> 00:26:58,906
It's fine.

415
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:00,786
My back is not.

416
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:03,146
Good night.

417
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:06,347
Does he really have a kid?

418
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:08,827
No...

419
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,186
Don't get mad at me.

420
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,186
I'm just asking.

421
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:12,426
All men are the same.

422
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:15,347
All right.

423
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:18,186
Sure.

424
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:22,707
All men are the same.

425
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,900
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

426
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:52,987
(Door's open.)

427
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:53,906
You're back.

428
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,546
Why did you come back so early today?

429
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,107
I haven't done cooking yet.

430
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,947
Did you finish them all?

431
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,987
Isn't it good?

432
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:12,627
Give me a minute.

433
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:20,186
Go and change into something pretty.

434
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:21,347
We're going out.

435
00:28:21,786 --> 00:28:22,587
Where are we going?

436
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:23,947
We're going to see a movie.

437
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,747
What's the date?

438
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,867
It's been a while
since we last went out for a date.

439
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:29,627
Go and get changed.

440
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:31,987
I haven't done cooking yet.

441
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:32,867
We'll eat out.

442
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:36,906
Hurry up.

443
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,386
What should I wear?

444
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:47,747
You look good no matter what you wear.

445
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,146
Can I wear this?

446
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:50,987
Sure.

447
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,227
Let me fix my hair.

448
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,386
I told you I'd bought the ticket.

449
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,906
We're running late.

450
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:43,507
Hey.

451
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:44,467
(Hey.)

452
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,810
Are you busy?

453
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:47,987
No.

454
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:49,627
Have you taken your lunch?

455
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:50,987
I'm going to eat it now.

456
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:51,666
What's the matter?

457
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:53,227
Nothing much.

458
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:55,507
I just want to remind you
to eat your meals on time.

459
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:56,627
I get it.

How have you been lately?)

00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:07,626
You...

491
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:09,826
I wanted

492
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,346
to make you breakfast.

493
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:12,947

494

Did you burn yourself?

496
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,626
Stick out your tongue to cool it down.

How can you be a doctor?

500
00:37:43,947 --> 00:37:44,826

Of course, I know it doesn't work.

you received a text on your phone.

was looking for you,

00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:26,826
so I took a peek at it.

514
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,106
Then?

515
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:32,386
I realized the text wasn't from
the staff of the hospital.

516
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:33,707
Who was the text from?

517
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:35,906
Dong.

518
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:38,467
Did she send me a text?

519
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:39,227
Why didn't I see any message?

520
00:38:40,826 --> 00:38:42,146
I accidentally deleted it.

521
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:43,227
I don't know what happened

522
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:44,507
and I was just being very clumsy.

523
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:46,547
Anyway, I deleted the text.

524
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:50,346
I'm so sorry.

525
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:51,707
Let it be.

526
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:54,346
Eat it.

527
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,090
(Let me introduce you to each other.)

528
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,570
(Dong Miaomiao, your senior.)

529
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,890
(She's from the Art Department.)

530
00:39:47,987 --> 00:39:48,586
Zhiqian.

531
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:50,227
- I...
- Enough.

532
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,146
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

533
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,027
I should be more understanding.

534
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,426
Do you care for her

535
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:45,467
as much as you care for Miaomiao?

536
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:49,467
Relationships can be built.

537
00:41:50,987 --> 00:41:53,386
Most importantly, my mom likes her.

538
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,130
(She said I should
appreciate this woman)

539
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,680
(who cares for me so dearly.)

540
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,330
(Do you love each other?)

541
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:26,666
I love him.

542
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:28,947
Don't you think

543
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,267
he takes you as my replacement?

544
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:36,067
Where does he go for a drink at night?

545
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:37,507
I won't tell you anything.

546
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:40,467
I can find him
even if you refuse to tell me.

547
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:41,586
I'll be able to find him
as long as I want to.

548
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:04,626
(Door's open.)

549
00:43:06,146 --> 00:43:07,146
You're back.

550
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,106
Why are you still up?

551
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:10,826
You've had a long day.

552
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:11,866
Go and get some rest.

553
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:18,467
Wash up.

554
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:20,146
I'll heat up the soup for you.

555
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,027
Don't trouble yourself with it.

556
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:22,186
I did three surgeries today
and I'm dog-tired.

557
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,027
I'm too tired to drink the soup.

558
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:24,346
Give it a taste.

559
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:25,866
I spent three hours making the soup.

560
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:27,866
I tasted it just now and it is great.

561
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:28,906
It's good for your stomach.
