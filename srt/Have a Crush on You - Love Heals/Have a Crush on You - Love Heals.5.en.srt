=Episode 5=

3
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:49,179
Cerebral parasitic disease
is quite rare.

4
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,819
Why did you come here?

5
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,219
Don't you know that
the other side is occupied?

6
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,660
Go back and rest well.

7
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,459
Dr. Ruan,

8
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,300
you're pretty bold.

9
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,700
You operated on the patient before

10
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,220
the attending doctor arrived.

11
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,019
It was an emergency.

12
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,860
His intracranial pressure
kept rising non-stop.

13
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,259
Why didn't you inject him with Mannitol?

14
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,220
We've already done that.

15
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,340
If we inject him with Mannitol
within a short period again,

16
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,099
he might experience kidney failure.

17
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,259
If so, why didn't you wait for me?

18
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,340
Who will bear the responsibility
if something happens to the patient?

19
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,300
(Door's open.)

20
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,539
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)
I can't stand it anymore.

21
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,179
Be careful.

22
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,700
I'm sure my heel is bleeding.

23
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:50,940
Let me take a look.

24
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,500
It's fine.

25
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,819
Let me clean it for you.

26
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:58,940
It's fine. I can do it myself.

27
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,379
What are you saying? I have to do it.

28
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,340
Give me your foot.

29
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,140
Bear with it.

30
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,099
The person who designed high heels

31
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,500
must be out to torture people.

32
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,659
Your heel is already bleeding.

33
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:37,899
Precisely.

34
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,940
This is my last time wearing high heels.

35
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:41,940
I won't wear it again.

36
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,300
You only did it for the wedding, right?

37
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,619
The wedding was tiring.

38
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:48,500
I smiled the entire day.

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,259
My face is numb now.

40
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,300
I don't think I can smile now.

41
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,140
You're smiling right now.

42
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,140
I will never hold a wedding again.

43
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,619
Again?

44
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,819
Don't tell me you want to
hold another wedding?

45
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,259
With whom?

46
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,500
Give me the other foot.

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,620
It doesn't hurt anymore.

48
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,020
Done.

49
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,180
I'll get you your slippers.

50
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,939
Leave it over there. I'll clean it up.

51
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:39,219
Here.

52
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,700
Go and take a bath.

53
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,059
I'll change the band-aid for you
once you're done.

54
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,939
Untie this for me.

(Those on duty are already here.)

65
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,580
(But we lack manpower.)

66
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,219
You guys lack manpower?

67
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:30,499
(That's right.)

68
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,259
Do you guys know what day it is today?

69
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,059
(Dr. Ning,)

70
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,460
(I know today's your wedding day.)

71

(But this is an emergency.)

72
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,339
(Please come here immediately.)

73
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:40,539
Fine.

74
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,379
Alright, I understand.

75
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:43,980
I'll head there immediately.

I have to go.

79
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,980
Go to sleep after you're done bathing.
Don't wait for me.

Ready or not, here I come.

90

I don't feel like playing anymore.

Didn't I tell you already?

last night.

118

173
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,260
The Department of Neurosurgery

174
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,940
finally has girls now?

175
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,380
One of them is gentle
while the other is feisty.

176
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,020
Both of them are good-looking.

177
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,620
Since I just came back,

178
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,059
you guys should introduce me

179
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,980
in a grand manner later.

180
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,939
- Sure.
- Sure.

181
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,660
Just leave it to me.

182
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,780
I'll leave it to you guys.
Make it grand, okay?

183
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,579
Let's go and get changed.

184
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,500
Let's go.

185
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:26,179
Dr. Ding,

186
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,419
why are you late today?

187
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,500
Don't bring it up.

188
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,140
A despicable guy

189
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,059
stole my parking spot just now.

190
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:31,939
It was so infuriating.

191
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,699
If I see him again,

192
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,780
I'll crack his head open
with my high heels.

193
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:36,699
Don't be angry.

194
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:37,740
I'll crack his head open for you

195
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,020
if you see him again.

196
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,900
Nice. It's a promise then.

197
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:41,860
By the way,

198
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,260
let me introduce an expert to you.

199
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,219
Dr. Cheng?

200
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,500
This is our attending doctor,

201
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,819
Dr. Cheng Zhouyu.

202
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,260
He just came back from his
teaching duty

203
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,980
at a subordinate unit.

204
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:52,900
His skills are superb.

205
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,780
He's only second to Dr. Ning.

206
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,939
Second to Dr. Ning?

207
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,980
They're evenly matched.

208
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,020
That's right.

209
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,419
He's one of the
main forces of our hospital.

210
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,299
We meet again.

211
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,099
Yeah.

212
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,140
Do you two know each other?

213
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,219
We do.

214
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,419
Didn't you say

215
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,540
you wanted to crack
his head open for me?

216
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:12,059
Take this for me. Go ahead.

217
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,219
There was a misunderstanding
at the car park just now.

218
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,459
Is this the feisty one
or the gentle one?

219
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:21,819
This is the feisty one.

220
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:22,660
She's amazing, right?

221
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,459
She's the feisty one?

222
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,780
What about the gentle one?

223
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,860
She went to do her rounds with Dr. Ning.

224
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,660
She's doing her rounds?

225
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:29,620
You guys should go on your rounds too.

226
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,579
I'll wait for Ning to return.

227
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:32,540
Let's go.

228
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,860
The patient in Bed tenth
is recovering well.

229
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,540
Observe his condition.

230
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,459
The crucial period is three days
after the operation.

231
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:43,620
Keep an eye on the patient's condition.

232
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,299
Okay.

233
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,699
Resume your work.

234
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:46,660
Okay.

235
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,620
What are you doing?

236
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,540
Hello, Deputy Manager Ning.

237
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,260
Hello.

238
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,740
We have to keep our distance.

239
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,740
But why?

240
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,579
Ding Yiyuan is keeping
a close eye on me.

241
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,339
Do you think I'll have it easy

242
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,219
if she finds out about our relationship?

243
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,140
What's there to be afraid of?

244
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,140
Why can't we disclose
our divorce to other people?

245
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,339
It might not matter to you.

246
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,980
But have you considered my feelings?

247
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,140
An ex-wife as the student
of her ex-husband?

248
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,860
Even a terrible student can

249
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,459
write a drama based on that.

250
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,699
You're out of your mind.

251
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,240
(Nurse Station)

252
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,140
Why did you come back?

253
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,900
I've already been away for two months.

254
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,059
Of course I need to come back.

255
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,459
I heard that you took in
a female student.

256
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
And, she's quite beautiful.

257
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,339
Who did you hear that from?

258
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,579
That doesn't matter.

259
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,579
How old is she?

260
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,540
Is she taken?

261
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,059
She's not suitable for you.

262
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,819
How would you know when
we haven't met each other yet?

263
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,059
What if she likes someone like me?

264
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,059
Which part of you is likable?

265
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,299
Your smelly feet?

266
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,339
Wear your shoes.

267
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,980
Compliment me

268
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,339
when you introduce me to her later.

269
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,980
Don't forget. You owe me a girlfriend.

270
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,260
I owe you a girlfriend?

271
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,860
When?

272
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,339
Weren't you the one

273
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,860
who introduced Ruan to me back then?

274
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,740
Ruan?

275
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,339
Do you think she'll fall for
a person like you?

276
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:25,500
I don't care.

277
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,579
I'm busy every day even though
I'm at this age.

278
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:28,260
I just expect

279
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,900
to get a girlfriend within our department now.

280
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,780
Dr. Ruan.

281
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,380
I'll introduce an expert to you later.

282
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,459
He was away on a teaching trip
before this.

283
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:37,219
He just came back.

284
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,020
Sure.

285
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,620
Listen.

286
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
His skills are on par with Dr. Ning.

287
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,419
However, his temper is much better.

288
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,419
Is that so?

289
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,579
Listen to me.

290
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,980
It's impossible between you two.

291
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:53,900
Why's that?

292
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,900
Just listen to me.

293
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,980
Wait...

294
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,819
Dr. Cheng,

295
00:20:57,939 --> 00:20:59,260
this is Dr. Ruan Liuzheng,

296
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,500
who was just transferred
to our hospital.

297
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:05,459
Dr. Ruan,

298
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:06,540
don't tell me you want
to crack his head open too?

299
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,620
Is she

300
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,299
your new student?

301
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,140
Not bad at all.

302
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,540
It's your second time.

303
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:14,980
Second time?

304
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,059
Come here.

305
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,299
Listen.

306
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:17,980
They're just

307
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,099
faking it.

308
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,260
How's your delegation?

309
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,339
Is there something
you need to share with us?

310
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,219
About the removal of

311
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,140
the fourth intracranial tumor,

312
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,339
check out this image.

313
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,099
Which image?

314
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,099
I'll search it for you.

315
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,699
Only you and Tan Ya knew about
what happened between us.

316
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,540
Do not tell anyone about it, understood?

317
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,260
But why?

318
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,020
You'll cause unnecessary trouble.

319
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,620
What's with that sound?
I'll take it as a yes then.

320
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,339
It depends on my mood.

321
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,140
What?

322
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,900
You want to negotiate a deal with me?

323
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,740
Let me think about it first.
I'll tell you when I'm done.

324
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,260
Don't go overboard.

325
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,380
Ning,

326
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,299
you knew that I liked

327
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,419
Ruan from the start, right?

328
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,699
Since you two are already divorced,

329
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,620
I think...

330
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:07,620
What are you up to?

331
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,579
Do you think it's appropriate for you

332
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:12,699
to steal her under my nose?

333
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,819
Ding Yiyuan looks like

334
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,780
a better match for you.

335
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,419
Not at all.

336
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,540
Not at all.

337
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,320
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

338
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,260
Can you stop laughing?

339
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:28,900
That means you guys haven't done that

340
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,500
even until now?

341
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,059
He's been busy with the wedding

342
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,540
and surgeries.

343
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,620
He's not concerned about that yet.

344
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,500
Besides, my girl,

345
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
both of us study medicine.

346
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,780
There's no taboo.

347
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,860
Listen.

348
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,179
For the most part,

349
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,260
the stability of a wedding

350
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,980
depends on
the private life of the couple.

351
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,740
Really?

352
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,620
What?

353
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,099
Do you need me to explain it to you
loud and clear?

354
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,459
From a physiological structure

355
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,299
or gender relations?

356
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,059
Listen to me!

357
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:57,780
No, thanks!

358
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:13,540
Liuzheng.

359
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
I heard from my mother

360
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,219
that the Great Migration
in Africa is amazing.

361
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,299
For our honeymoon,

362
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,380
why don't we head to Africa?

363
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,500
I wish to witness
the Great Migration too.

364
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:27,380
It's decided then.

365
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,260
What's the matter?

366
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:38,579
What are you watching?

367
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,459
I'm watching how the lions
are hunting down their prey.

368
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,380
Do you want to join me?

369
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,380
Okay.

370
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:47,260
Wait for me.

371
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,160
(2019 Beiya Hospital, Jiangzhou, China)

372
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,860
Where did he go
this early in the morning?

373
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,980
Didn't he tell you before he left?

374
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,059
The patient is already anesthetized.

375
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,419
He didn't answer my calls at all.

376
00:26:58,579 --> 00:26:59,939
I'll kick him when he comes back.

377
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,380
We're running out of time.

378
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,660
Bai,

379
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,939
why don't you join me?

380
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,459
I can't. I have
another surgery to handle.

381
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:16,819
You, come with me.

382
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:18,819
Okay.

383
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:28,819
Vital signs.

384
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,299
All vital signs are normal.

385
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,900
Why are you still standing here?

386
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,939
You will do the craniotomy.

387
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:38,260
Me?

388
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,660
That's right.

389
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,459
Aren't you the assistant
for this surgery?

390
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,260
You may begin.

391
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
I'll assist you.

392
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:43,819
Okay.

393
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,579
Scalpel.

394
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,660
Steady your hands.

395
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:59,219
Be more stable with them.

396
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,860
(During the Operation)

397
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,020
Don't shake your hands.

398
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,099
Drill.

399
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:46,699
Find the correct position.

400
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,219
Periosteal elevator.

401
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,620
Craniotomy completed.

402
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,860
The tumor is pretty deep inside.

403
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,099
The situation is very complicated.

404
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,339
I'll try my best to hurry up.

405
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:45,500
Bipolar ESU.

406
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,099
What can I do?

407
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:55,339
Hold the brain spatula.

408
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:56,419
Okay.

409
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,860
Adjust your position
according to what I do.

410
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,339
Periosteal elevator.

411
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,419
Dr. Ruan, steady your hands.

412
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:41,620
It all depends on you now.

413
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,660
I got sweat in my left eye.
Wipe it for me.

414
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,660
Don't move, Dr. Ruan.

415
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,219
You should know the consequences

416
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
if you damage the brain tissues.

417
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,860
Steady your hands.

418
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:19,939
Hemostat.

419
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:28,140
You can remove the brain spatula now.

420
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,620
I'll leave the rest to you now.

421
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,579
Me?

422
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:48,980
Alright.

423
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,900
Thread and forceps.

424
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,179
Mr. Ning,

425
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,260
I'm so sorry.

426
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,140
Who are you?

427
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm Wu Xiaofan.

428
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:14,860
So, you're Wu Xiaofan from
Beiya's Department of Neurosurgery?

429
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,020
Mr. Ning, I didn't do it on purpose.

430
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,299
I fell unconscious after drinking

431
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:19,459
soy milk this morning.

432
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,780
You fell unconscious?

433
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,459
Did someone drug you?

434
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,500
No.

435
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,419
No one drugged me.

436
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:26,579
What did you do last night?

437
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,219
I was on duty last night.

438
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:29,900
I only slept for two hours.

439
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,819
You should thank Dr. Ruan.

440
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,140
She salvaged the situation for you.

441
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,219
Dr. Ruan, thank you so much.

442
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,660
Luckily, you're here today.

443
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:38,660
Do not do this again.

444
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:39,900
Remember that.

445
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,219
I understand.

446
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,179
I won't do it again.

447
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:43,660
Let's go.

448
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,099
I'm lucky to have you here today.

449
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,620
He kicked you on the operation table?

450
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,620
He couldn't.

451
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,780
I'm very agile.

452
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,140
Mr. Ning is extremely particular.

453
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:56,980
He doesn't allow anyone
to commit mistakes during work,

454
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,980
not even himself.

455
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,059
I was always scared out of my wits

456
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,819
when I was under him.

457
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,099
However, my skills

458
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,939
did grow at a rapid rate too.

459
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:07,579
By the way, Dr. Ruan,

460
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
I forgot to congratulate you.

461
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,819
If Dr. Ning allowed you to
operate on the patient,

462
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,179
that means he has
acknowledged your capability.

463
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:15,219
Really?

464
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:16,020
Of course.

465
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:16,939
Didn't you realize something?

466
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,059
His attitude toward you changed

467
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:19,900
ever since you won the bet

468
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,260
against Dr. Ding.

469
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:28,860
My hand with the brain spatula

470
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,260
shook a little during the surgery.

471
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,780
Really?

472
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,419
Did Mr. Ning say anything?

473
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,459
He said nothing.

474
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,579
It's better if he reprimands you.

475
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:45,980
It's the worst when
he doesn't say anything.

476
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
But you don't need to be too worried.

477
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,020
Maybe everything's fine.

478
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:51,380
We'll know when the patient is awake.

479
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,260
I'll head upstairs first.

480
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:04,939
Deputy Manager Ning,

481
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,579
the patient who went through
the surgery last night is awake.

482
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,740
Do you want to take a look?

483
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,459
Okay.

484
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,459
Doctor.

485
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,179
He's awake?

486
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,179
He's still quite weak.

487
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,100
Dad, the doctor is here.

488
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,939
Can you hear me?

489
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,899
I'll perform a simple checkup for you.

490
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,980
Doctor, how's my father?

491
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,820
What's your name?

492
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,540
His name is Li Pingshun.

493
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,780
I just wanted to test his reaction.

494
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:32,780
What's your name?

495
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,980
Li Pingshun.

496
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,820
Can you raise your hand?

497
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,060
Raise your right hand for me.

498
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,340
Okay.

499
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,459
What about your left hand?

500
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,810
(When I was at the operation table,)

501
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,610
(my hand with the brain spatula
shook a little.)

502
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
(Maybe everything's fine.)

503
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,370
(We'll know when the patient is awake.)

504
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,379
Dad, use some strength.

505
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,379
Put your back into it.

506
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
A little more.

507
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,419
Dad, use some strength.

508
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:14,459
Come on.

509
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,580
I can't raise my hand.

510
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,859
Doctor, what's going on?

511
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,139
Can he still move his hands?

512
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,459
We'll observe him for a little longer.

513
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,699
Dad, don't panic.

514
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,780
It's fine.

515
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,699
Calm down.

516
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,820
Head Nurse,

517
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,939
if he's still like this
in the afternoon,

518
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,300
arrange another

519
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,980
brain CT scan for him.

520
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,580
Okay.

521
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,500
Calm down.

522
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,580
Thank you, Doctor.

523
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,580
Dad, it's fine.

524
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,260
Alright, no problem.

525
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Wait for me to get off work.

526
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,939
Okay.

527
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,219
I'm entering the elevator.
Talk to you later.

528
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:57,100
Goodbye.

529
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,980
What are you looking at?

530
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:24,500
Wait.

531
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,060
She's crying.

532
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,300
Aren't you going to console her?

533
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:29,980
I thought you took her as your student

534
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,179
because you wanted to make it up to her.

535
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,100
So, you're still trying to torment her?

536
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,419
Who's tormenting her?

537
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:35,619
All of us had been through this process.

538
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,379
She's a female doctor after all.

539
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,340
What's wrong with female doctors?

540
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,260
Are you belittling them?

541
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,820
If she wants to work in this field,

542
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,419
she has to bear the pressure alone.

543
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,260
You're actually lecturing me right now?

544
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,020
She's your ex-wife.

545
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,820
I couldn't care less.

546
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,260
Dad,

547
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,139
stop drinking.

548
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,219
It's fine. I feel much better.

549
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:58,060
Excuse me,

550
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,780
kin of Patient 16.

551
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,659
Dad.

552
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,780
Dr. Ruan.

553
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,419
Come here for a second.

554
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:03,459
I have something to tell you.

555
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,020
Son.

556
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,419
I think the drip is finished.

557
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,219
Let me check.

558
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,379
Check the IV drip.

559
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:19,820
It's not finished yet.

560
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,020
Li Pingshun,

561
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:26,500
can you shake my hand?

562
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
This is great.

563
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,139
Thank you.

564
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:47,300
Thank you.

565
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,179
This is great.

566
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:51,260
Thank you.

567
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,419
This is a good thing. Don't cry.

568
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,020
Thank you.

569
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,580
Please rest well.

570
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:58,619
Thank you, doctor.

571
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,699
What's wrong?

572
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,020
I thought I made him a cripple.

573
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:22,699
That's normal after surgery.

574
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,100
You're a doctor, you know?

575
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,179
Why are you behaving like a fool?

576
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:47,740
What's the matter?

577
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,459
Doctor.

578
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:49,980
My sister's urine bag fell off.

579
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,300
What should I do?

580
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,100
Dr. Ding, let me do it.

581
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,379
It's fine. I'll do it.

582
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,340
Doctor,

583
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,540
sorry about that.

584
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,060
It's fine.

585
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,219
Please wash your hands.

586
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:00,540
Tell her to be

587
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,419
more gentle next time.

588
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,340
- Okay.
- Keep an eye on her.

589
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:03,060
Thank you.

590
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,020
No problem.

591
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,459
Be more careful.

592
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:10,899
Stop bumping into others.

593
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:12,780
You bumped into me first.

594
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,899
You're blind.

595
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,820
What did you rub on my robe?

596
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,060
95% of it is water.

597
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,580
1.1% of it is inorganic salt.

598
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,379
When you don't have disinfectant
to use in the wilderness,

599
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,020
you can use it to clean wounds.

600
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,859
But there's one thing
you need to take note of.

601
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,300
You can only use the middle section.

602
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,859
Ding Yiyuan! Come back!

603
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,379
Don't shout in the hospital.

604
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,219
Qian,

605
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,300
that student of yours, Ding Yiyuan,

606
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,859
why aren't you disciplining her?

607
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,179
What's wrong with her?
She's a great student.

608
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,980
She doesn't respect her senior at all.

609
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:46,500
She's lucky that she's not my student.

610
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,020
If not, I'll teach her a lesson.

611
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:50,820
You want to teach her a lesson?

612
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:54,580
Listen.

613
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,899
Her father

614
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,300
is the hospital's vice president.

615
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,659
Mind your own hygiene.

616
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,740
You shouldn't use so much strength
in the restroom.

617
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:04,699
Vice president?

618
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,300
You meant Vice President Ding?

619
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,040
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

620
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,659
Can we make it in time?

621
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:15,619
What time is the flight?

622
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,419
We can.

623
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,260
But we have to hurry.

624
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,820
Wait, why do you bring
so many pajamas with you?

625
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
I'm wearing them in turns.

626
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,619
My manager gave me the notice
out of the blue.

627
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:25,780
He only approved my leave this morning.

628
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,260
I love sudden trips like this.

629
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:32,419
Is there anything else
you want to bring?

630
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,260
Forget about me.
Just pack your own belongings.

631
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,020
Is this considered our honeymoon?

632
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,699
No. Honeymoon is more official.

633
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,179
Wait.

634
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,300
Bring your own bag.

635
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,740
Okay.

636
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,939
Forget about the rest. Take your phone.

637
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:13,980
Great timing.

638
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,820
I just bought a swimsuit,

639
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:16,980
and I haven't worn it before.

640
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,139
Do you wish to see it?

641
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,419
What? Are you going to wear it now?

642
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,820
Did you bring your swimsuit?

643
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,219
Nope. I only brought my swimming trunks.

644
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:23,980
Is that okay with you?

645
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,580
Hello?

646
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,780
Got it.

647
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:40,820
Alright.

648
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,139
What's wrong?

649
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,379
A patient requires emergency surgery.

650
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,619
I'm responsible for him.

651
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,780
I have to rush back.

652
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,139
Mister,

653
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:49,980
drive us to Beiya Hospital.

654
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:57,659
I'm sorry.

655
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,179
It's fine.

656
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:00,219
We can go there next time.

657
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,459
You owe me one.

658
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:04,820
Alright, I owe you one.
