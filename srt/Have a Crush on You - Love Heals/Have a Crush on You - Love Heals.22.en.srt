=Have a Crush on You=

2
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,520
I want to hear the real reason.

4
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,370
Back then,

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,240
I only had

6
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,240
one simple reason.

7
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,450
Your mom was just too busy.

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,770
She left early and came home late.

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,810
And when she was back,

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,960
she either worried about her patients

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,410
or just went to sleep.

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
Within the blink of an eye,

13
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,520
she's gone.

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,120
It felt like

15
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,810
instead of a wife,

16
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,170
I had

17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,730
a flatmate.

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,610
That's why you separated?

19
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,530
She's a doctor.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,530
It's her job.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,840
You should have expected that

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,610
when you got married.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Yes.

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,010
I know.

25
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,480
She is a doctor.

26
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,920
And a good one at that.

27
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,120
She's an angel.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
No one could say otherwise.

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
She saved so many lives

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,610
and she is brave.

31
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,280
For that, I respect her.

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,920
Even

33
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,480
until now.

34
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,370
She is a good doctor.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,890
She pours her soul into her patients

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,530
but I don't know

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,760
if she has anything left for me.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
When she proposed

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,120
a reconciliation,

40
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,090
why did you say no?

41
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,970
An important reason why your mom

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,250
proposed a reconciliation

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,610
was to give you a proper family.

44
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,090
But I'm just an ordinary man.

45
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,530
After our divorce,

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,400
my career barely took off.

47
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,010
I was deadbeat.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
Drained.

49
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,610
I needed someone

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,090
to care for me.

51
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,810
And then,

52
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,040
I met Xinran.

53
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,040
She was my secretary.

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,760
We worked together all the time.

55
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,090
When I needed someone,

56
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,640
she gave me a cup of hot tea

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,560
and talked

58
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,610
to me.

59
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,560
She took good care

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,800
of my work

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,490
and my life.

62
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,240
So you want

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
someone

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,210
who can babysit you

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
every day?

66
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,280
You can say I'm selfish.

67
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,610
But I'm just an ordinary man.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,930
So a great doctor

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,680
is not deserving of a great family?

70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,170
Your mom has this universal love.

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,840
That means

72
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,170
she won't be able to dedicate her love
to her family.

73
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,890
That's life for you.

74
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,680
You can't have everything.

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,360
I married to my work

76
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,520
so I didn't give you

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,280
as much love

78
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,560
or a proper family.

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
As a mother,

80
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,010
I

81
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,730
failed.

82
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,490
I

83
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,010
want you to learn

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
to love someone.

85
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,330
That way, you can find true love.

86
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,050
The reconciliation
that you brought up last time,

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,050
was it just a random thought or

88
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,680
do you mean it?

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,170
Are you in love with me now?

90
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,520
He's not a bad person.

91
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,400
Why do you not like him?

92
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,490
Why don't I like him?

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,770
Don't you know the reason already?

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,450
No.

95
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,450
Because I'm jealous.

96
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,770
I've been green

97
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,210
with envy.

98
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,330
Will you admit that you

99
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,330
like me then?

100
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,800
I waited for you

101
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,210
for six years,

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,360
for this moment

103
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,560
when you confess your love to me.

104
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,650
Just tell me about your true feelings

105
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,400
and thoughts.

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
If I make a mistake somewhere,

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,770
I'll make amends.

108
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,930
Let's break up.

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,330
Thank you for today, Tan Ya.

110
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,680
I'm used to it already.

111
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,490
Tan Ya, we...

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
Just head back first.

113
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,050
Okay.

114
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,650
Let's go.

115
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,120
Ya.

116
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,680
Why are you here?

117
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,890
I'm here to give you a ride.

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,610
No need.

119
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,560
Ya.

120
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,890
My car is at the entrance.

121
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,050
Let me drive you back.

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,050
No need, I said.

123
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,890
Just sign the divorce agreement
when you have the time.

124
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,560
Ya.

125
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
I came to tell you

126
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,770
that I severed all ties with her.

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,090
That's your private life.

128
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
It has nothing to do with me.

129
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,480
I know

130
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,010
I did you and our kid wrong.

131
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,010
I have no right to ask for forgiveness

132
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,410
but I will do my best to make up to you.

133
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,330
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,970
I regret it so much.

135
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,530
Please give me another chance.

136
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,530
I don't want to hear this.

137
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,530
After a day of work, I'm tired.

138
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,360
I just want to go back and rest.

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,210
Ya.

140
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,680
You love walnuts, don't you?

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,560
I used to peel them for you.

142
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,560
And I picked you up

143
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,360
after your work.

144
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
We took a troll while you ate
those walnuts.

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
I know

146
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,850
I haven't done all that in a long while.

147
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,650
Have some.

148
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,210
They still taste the same.

149
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,890
I already moved on from my past.

150
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,010
I don't want to relive it.

151
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,210
Just go home.

152
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Ya.

153
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,410
I'll sign the divorce agreement.

154
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,450
As you wish.

155
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,970
Daddy.

156
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,040
You overslept today.

157
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,920
I didn't sleep well yesterday.

158
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
Grandpa told me

159
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,920
Mommy Ruan and you went
to get the marriage certificate.

160
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,560
Why are you concerned about
adult businesses like this?

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,720
Have you done it or not?

162
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,650
I want to attend your wedding.

163
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,890
No.

164
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,890
Why?

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,800
I'll be late to work. I have to go.

166
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,680
Bye.

167
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,210
Why are you here?

168
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,850
I...

169
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,800
I fell asleep here.

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,240
You spent the night here?

171
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,480
I don't know where to go.

172
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,920
I feel

173
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,160
like trash right now.

174
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,450
Do we really have to do this
to ourselves?

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,010
I miss you

176
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,890
and our kid too.

177
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,120
Daddy, is that you?

178
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,970
Yes, Yaya.

179
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,360
It's me.

180
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Ya.

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,530
I want to see her.

182
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,040
Daddy's here.

183
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Daddy!

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,650
Yaya.

185
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,560
You have become heavier, Yaya.

186
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,010
I have.

187
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,530
Yaya,

188
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,040
did you miss Daddy?

189
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,240
I did.

190
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,850
I have missed you so much!

191
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,720
Really?

192
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,010
What a doll.

193
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,530
Daddy,

194
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,970
why aren't you home?

195
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,770
I've been very busy.

196
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,680
Then when can we

197
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,210
hang out outside and play together?

198
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,040
I can't keep you company every day

199
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,410
so you have to listen to Mommy.

200
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,770
However, I promise you

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,600
that during weekends,

202
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,090
I'll come to pick you up.

203
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
And we'll hang out together. All right?

204
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,290
Why just the weekends?

205
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,850
Because Daddy made a mistake

206
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,210
that cannot be forgiven.

207
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,040
So I have to be punished.

208
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,650
Daddy.

209
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,160
Mommy said

210
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,530
a good kid learned from mistakes.

211
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,770
Do that

212
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,450
so that Mommy can forgive you.

213
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,360
Look.

214
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,120
This is Daddy.

215
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,120
I will make amends

216
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,240
and be a better person.

217
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,330
Forgive me, Mommy.

218
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,530
Please?

219
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,480
There, there.

220
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,770
Come, Yaya.

221
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Give me a hug.

222
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,720
I have to go now.

223
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,720
Can I take this with me?

224
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,290
I'll go now.

225
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,770
Daddy.

226
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,680
Is it true that you don't want

227
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,530
Mommy and me anymore?

228
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,210
Yaya.

229
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,290
I will never abandon you

230
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,240
and Mommy.

231
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,650
Pinky promise.

232
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,330
Okay.

233
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,360
- Whoever tells a lie
- Whoever tells a lie

234
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,480
- will sink down to a bad place.
- will sink down to a bad place.

235
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
- Pinky promise.
- Pinky promise.

236
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,010
Daddy.

237
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,800
Mommy and I

238
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,240
will always love you.

239
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,010
I have to go now.

240
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,360
I love Mommy and you too.

241
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,450
Okay.

242
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,970
Bye.

243
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,850
Bye.

244
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,040
I'll go now.

245
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,160
Mommy.

246
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,360
Next week,

247
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,800
can we have burgers

248
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,010
with Daddy?

249
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,450
Can we?

250
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,770
Please?

251
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,900
(Beiya Hospital)

252
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,850
Do you feel better now?

253
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,330
What?

254
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,010
You had a fever yesterday.

255
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,040
Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,890
You never asked.

257
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,240
If you're still unwell,

258
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,290
change your shift.

259
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,290
I'm fine.

260
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,450
Yesterday...

261
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,600
It's crowded today.

262
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,900
(Beiya Hospital)

263
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
This is this week's roster

264
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,360
for Ward 3.

265
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,210
Also,

266
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,090
the obstetrics

267
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,560
and gynecology department has sent us

268
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,330
Li Aiying's report.

269
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,800
Everything looks normal.

270
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,850
We can conduct exploratory surgery.

271
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,450
I hope the obstetrics department
can work with me.

272
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,010
I have given prior notice to them.

273
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,160
The obstetrics and gynecology department
as well as the neonatology department

274
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,410
will follow your lead.

275
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,680
Don't worry about that.

276
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,680
I would like to take this opportunity

277
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
to make an announcement.

278
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,960
In light of your performance

279
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,240
and to enhance

280
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,770
our teamwork,

281
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,810
the higher-up discussed

282
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,890
and came to this important decision.

283
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,650
That is,

284
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,170
we will have a team-building exercise

285
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,440
to relax our mind and body.

286
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,240
Where is the applause?

287
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,010
Miss Li.

288
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,840
Dr. Cheng.

289
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,650
Dr. Ding.

290
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,050
We're here to tell you

291
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,480
that everything looks normal.

292
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,360
You will have that surgery
as soon as possible.

293
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,810
Thank you.

294
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,410
Thank Dr. Ning for me too.

295
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,170
You're knitting for your baby?

296
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,930
Yes.

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,930
But my eyesight is getting worse lately

298
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,570
so the progress is slow.

299
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Don't worry about it.

300
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,600
Your vision problem

301
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,690
is due to the brain tumor pressing
on your optic nerves.

302
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,530
It'll improve after surgery.

303
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,410
Don't sweat too much about it.

304
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,650
Also,

305
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,930
the exploratory surgery

306
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,290
is just the first trial.

307
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,440
After that, we have to wait
for the result of the biopsy.

308
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,770
It's only considered a successful
second trial

309
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,360
if it's a benign tumor.

310
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,200
And after that, we have to monitor
your blood pressure,

311
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,840
your blood sugar,
or if you have eclampsia.

312
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,890
There will be many trials

313
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,650
for this delivery

314
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
so please listen to us.

315
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,170
We'll go through it together.

316
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:32,890
That's right.

317
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,530
We'll walk with you
till the final victory.

318
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,650
Rest now. We should get going.

319
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,840
Okay.

320
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,440
Let's go.

321
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,720
Let's go.

322
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,930
(Look at this.)

323
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,360
(You might need to tweak a bit.)

324
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:00,930
(Okay.)

325
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,170
(Take it to the surgeon.)

326
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,690
(Thank you.)

327
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,170
(Neurosurgery Department)
Hi, Dr. Ruan.

328
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,840
Deputy Manager Ning, you're done?

329
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,050
Hey.

330
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,410
Hey, where are you?

331
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
At the office.

332
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,360
Can you come down?

333
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,690
Where are you?

334
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,010
The car parks.

335
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,770
Wait for me.

336
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,080
You parked way too close to me.

337
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,170
I parked it correctly.

338
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,480
You are too left.

339
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,840
Do you think I can get in
my seat like that?

340
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,360
You can get in from the right
if you're desperate.

341
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,170
Move your car.

342
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,720
Where are you going?

343
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,570
Home.

344
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,840
Well...

345
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,840
This morning,

346
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,120
Ning Xiang called me.

347
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,240
He asked about the certificate.

348
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,570
I don't know
how to break it down to him.

349
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,960
He did?

350
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,410
I figure I should let you decide

351
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,530
how I should handle this.

352
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,120
I don't want to hurt the kid

353
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,600
but I don't want to lie to him either.

354
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,170
Then tell him the truth.

355
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,530
Hurry.

356
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,340
(Beiya Hospital)

357
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,530
Qian.

358
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,530
Where are you?

359
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,960
On my way back.

360
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,530
Is Liuzheng by your side?

361
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,480
No.

362
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,010
You two are still not on good terms?

363
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,810
What's up?

364
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,810
Nothing major.

365
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,720
What's his face?

366
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,720
Xue Weilin.

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,440
He has a tender document
worth up to tens of million.

368
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,770
The signature is tomorrow

369
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,410
but he gave it to me,

370
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,200
saying that he

371
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,720
wanted to join the team-building
exercise of your hospital.

372
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,440
I see.

373
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,600
You're so chill.

374
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,840
All right.

375
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm just letting you know here

376
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,890
because thanks to you,

377
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,810
I got a huge gig.

378
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
Wait. Where are you?

379
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,770
Let's talk.

380
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,120
Sure. Come to me.

381
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,200
I'll show you a place.

382
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,840
All right. Wait for me.

383
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,050
He doesn't like one with letters.

384
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,200
Not chic enough.

385
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
Not as handsome as Xue.

386
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,690
Too much.

387
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,010
Just like Xue.

388
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,720
Are you done comparing me

389
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,690
to him?

390
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,320
Be patient.

391
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,480
This one is good.

392
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,890
Try it on.

393
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,410
Hurry.

394
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,170
These three are not good on him.

395
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,050
I'll take them. Pack them for me.

396
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,690
Okay.

397
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,570
It suits you.

398
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,890
Good.

399
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,240
Here.

400
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
Can you pack this up?

401
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,480
Are you sure?

402
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
Yes.

403
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,810
I'll reimburse you.

404
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't. It's a gift.

405
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,570
Make me proud tomorrow.

406
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,810
Take this.

407
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Thank you.

408
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,810
Come again next time.

409
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,930
Thanks, uncles.

410
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,170
She's talking about you.

411
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
No, you.

412
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,930
You look good for your age, sir.

413

(Half-baked Cheesecake,
the Flavor of First Love)

414
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
I love half-baked cheesecakes.

415
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,480
Eat some more.

416
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,620

(The Bagel Store)

418
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
(I quite like this one.)

419
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,320
(This one here?)

420
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
(That looks delicious too.)

421
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,360
(This is good too.)

422
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
(Just take it then.)

423
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,480
(We might as well use all the vouchers.)

424
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,050
This one is delicious too.

425
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,960
Isn't it high in calories?

426
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,930
(Half-baked Cheesecake, the Flavor of First Love)
But I want to eat it.

427
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,080
Take it.

428
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,770
Okay.

429
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,360
Hi.

430
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,480
Do you still have any half-baked cheesecake?

431
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,200
Sorry, we only make this many every day.

432
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
You can check other stores.

433
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,720
Thanks.

434
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,570
(Chlitina)

435
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,170
Move aside.

436
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,960
Move aside.

437
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,320
I am not

438
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,890
throwing a huge tantrum here.

439
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,570
I know

440
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,440
he changed a lot for me.

441
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,930
On the day of that proposal,

442
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,770
he still did it even though

443
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,010
he hated the attention
and the extravagance.

444
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,930
He indulged me too for the wedding
organization

445
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,720
and the photoshoot.

446
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,360
Isn't that great then?

447
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,930
What is the problem?

448
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,890
When we argued that day,

449
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,570
did you see the way he looked at me?

450
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,290
It was the same eyes

451
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,650
from six years ago.

452
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,890
I couldn't utter a thing at all.

453
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,530
I can't stand that.

454
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,840
That's a deal-breaker for you?

455
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, Ruan Liuzheng.

456
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,290
Both of you are adults

457
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,810
but you still act

458
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:45,960
so childishly.

459
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,840
Let's be serious now.

460
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
Do you think both of you

461
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,890
are still the same people
from six years ago?

462
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,530
Not exactly the same.

463
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,890
We are

464
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,720
the updated version.

465
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,690
Version 2.0.

466
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,890
More incompatibility issues.

467
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
Yes, updated version.

468
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,010
Your age got updated too.

469
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,120
Remind me. Are you 70 or 80 now?

470
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,360
The way I see it,

471
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,690
finding the right person
is more important.

472
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,080
I think you two are a better match

473
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,600
than from six years ago.

474
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,930
But you see,

475
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,690
finding the right person
is insufficient for a marriage.

476
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,930
What else do you want?

477
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,050
To tell you the truth,

478
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,200
I never

479
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,120
move on in the past six years.

480
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,010
That's why I fear that I'm making
the same mistake again.

481
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,650
I think

482
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,240
you have this gamophobia

483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,890
because of your past.

484
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,360
Gamophobia?

485
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,320
Yes.

486
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,840
Look at you.

487
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,690
You had to fall sick the day

488
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,650
you were supposed to get

489
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,290
the marriage certificate.

490
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,120
I guess so.

491
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,690
What about you and Jiang Cheng?

492
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,570
He said that he had severed all ties
with that woman.

493
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,480
He did?

494
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,650
For real?

495
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,320
He told me to give him another month

496
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,840
to prove himself.

497
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
If it doesn't work,

498
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,080
we can get a divorce.

499
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,650
If he did

500
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,960
turn over a new leaf,

501
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,440
would you forgive him?

502
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,410
Well...

503
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,930
He made a mistake.

504
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,410
But I am also partly at fault

505
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,890
for our current situation.

506
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,050
It's not all his fault.

507
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,530
I have been working

508
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,960
too hard.

509
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,810
And when I have some free time,

510
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,240
I spend it with Yaya.

511
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm so tired every day

512
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,810
that I just want to sleep once I'm home.

513
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,570
I did neglect his feelings.

514
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Look at you.

515
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,650
Defending him now.

516
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,440
I'm just analyzing

517
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,410
my marital problems rationally.

518
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,690
He is nonetheless

519
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,240
Yaya's father.

520
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,290
It's all your fault.
Why did you ask me that question?

521
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,410
Just mind your own business

522
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,570
and remarry Ning Zhiqian already.

523
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,080
Don't let any other women snatch him.

524
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,080
You sound

525
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
just like my mom.

526
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,290
Oh, my dear daughter.

527
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,480
This is for your own good.

528
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,600
Yes, Mom.

529
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,200
But I just broke up with him.

530
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,690
I should give him some time

531
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,120
to reflect

532
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,200
upon himself.

533
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,650
My dear daughter.

534
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,770
I'm sure he just let

535
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,930
his emotions get the better of him.

536
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,120
You have a team-building exercise
tomorrow, don't you?

537
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,770
Give him a chance to make up to you

538
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,360
and accept him back.

539
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,600
We'll see.

540
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,930
Miss.

541
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,770
Based on your skin evaluation result,

542
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,720
we will arrange

543
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,840
for you a cryotherapy session.

544
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Please come with me.

545
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

546
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,840
Make sure

547
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,410
you do a sloppy job on her.

548
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,600
She can't be prettier than me.

549
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,840
It's quite cold at night.

550
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,080
Which block are you in?

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,770
Don't play dumb.

552
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,770
You have tailed me

553
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,600
in secret several times.

554
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,720
Don't think I didn't notice.

555
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,320
I was protecting you.

556
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,570
Don't say I tailed you.

557
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,600
We've arrived.

558
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,930
You'll go back like this?

559
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,200
You won't say something?

560
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,650
Close your eyes.

561
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,650
Okay.

562
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,050
See you tomorrow.

563
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Yuan, you're back.

564
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,600
Mom.

565
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,290
This is my mom.

566
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,050
This is my colleague.

567
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,290
Hi, Mrs. Ding. I'm Cheng Zhouyu.

568
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,200
I'm her colleague in neurosurgery.

569
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,840
Oh, Cheng.

570
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,080
Only good doctors get to work

571
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,960
in Beiya.

572
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,240
You're young and successful.

573
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,530
You flatter me.

574
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,770
Are you here to take out your trash?

575
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,170
Give it to me. I'll help you.

576
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,240
Thanks.

577
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,810
No worries.

578
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,480
It's windy.

579
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,290
Go back up.

580
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,320
Let's go.

581
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,240
Bye.

582
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,290
Let's go.

583
00:30:59,290 --> 00:30:59,960
Bye, Mrs. Ding.

584
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:00,770
Come.

585
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,200
Not bad.

586
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,290
Your boyfriend?

587
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,010
No, just a colleague.

588
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,840
It's late and he sent you home?

589
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,530
It's late

590
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,010
and there are a lot of robbers around.

591
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,200
Oh, come on.

592
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,810
Robbers

593
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,170
can come in three or four

594
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,290
and they still can't fight you.

595
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,690
Am I your daughter

596
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,200
or am I adopted?

597
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,930
Adopted.

598
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,960
Let's be serious.

599
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:30,930
I think

600
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,930
he's pretty decent.

601
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,930
And Yuan, you're getting old.

602
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,600
I know you have your ambition

603
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,120
but

604
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,080
you still have got to get married

605
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,200
and spend the rest of your life
with someone.

606
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,440
Cheng looks

607
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,480
like an honest man.

608
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,120
Don't you think?

609
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,690
So why not make do with him?

610
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,240
Think about it.

611
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,200
I am.

612
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,050
I want to test him first.

613
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,930
Test him.

614
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,320
Right.

615
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,410
You should test him first.

616
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,410
(Made do with me...)

617
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,010
Hurry up, Mom.

618
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,890
Coming.

619
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,650
Lang.

620
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,840
Is it your part now?

621
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,770
Almost there.

622
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,840
This

623
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,600
is the male lead?

624
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,480
Yes.

625
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,530
That's no good.

626
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,480
Zhiqian will be a better male lead

627
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,810
than him.

628
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,810
Zhiqian is tall and handsome.

629
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,240
Speaking of which,

630
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,480
it sure upsets me

631
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
that my excellent future son-in-law

632
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,480
disappears

633
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
just like that.

634
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,960
Not even a certificate.

635
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,890
That's not a problem at all.

636
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,170
Just get the certificate another day.

637
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,080
Oh, Liuzheng.

638
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,200
The civil affairs bureau
has implemented a new welfare policy.

639
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,170
You can get your marriage certificate
on weekends now.

640
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,120
You can do it tomorrow.

641
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,770
All right.

642
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,530
Let her handle her marriage.

643
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,570
Where are you going?

644
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,360
My part isn't here yet.

645
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,810
You're not going to be popular anyway.

646
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,960
You...

647
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,440
You never support me.

648
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,360
Lang.

649
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,410
The ads are here already.

650
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,890
You sure your part is here?

651
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,440
All right.

652
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,440
Tell us when your part is here.

653
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,570
I missed my match for this.

654
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,650
I think they edit it out.

655
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,530
You're back.

656
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,120
You must have had a busy day.

657
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,050
Sit down and eat.

658
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,120
It's all your favorite.

659
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,440
Sit.

660
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,570
Let me take your handbag.

661
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,050
No need.

662
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,810
Sit. And eat while it's warm.

663
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,330
The dishes are still warm.

664
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,680
Corn.

665
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:29,850
Come.

666
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,480
Have some soup.

667
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,720
Read it.

668
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,680
You can read it yourself.

669
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,200
The password is your birthday.

670
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,440
From now on,

671
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,050
there'll be no secrets between us.

672
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,880
Read it.

673
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,500
(Calling...)

674
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,050
What happened?

675
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,010
Why didn't you pick up my call?

676
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,160
Darling.

677
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
Didn't we agree to this?

678
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,160
Just bear with me for the moment.

679
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,010
I cheated on my wife.
So if I get the divorce now,

680
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll be the party at fault

681
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,200
and I won't be given the apartment.

682
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,480
Do you love me or not?

683
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,610
I do.

684
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,570
You're the only one I love.

685
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,850
I love you with all my heart.

686
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,330
She's on duty tomorrow.

687
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,330
I'll come to you.

688
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:03,770
Behave.

689
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,460
(Beiya Hospital)

690
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:41,960
Morning.

691
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,880
Have you had breakfast?

692
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,530
What's the matter?

693
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,810
You're moody today.

694
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,570
What's wrong?

695
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,130
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?

696
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,090
I don't have that luxury.

What do you mean?

698
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,240
Did I cross you somehow?

699
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,880
Lucky you!

700
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,090
This is the last one.

(Half-baked Cheesecake, the Flavor of First Love)
Thank you.

702
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,010
You're welcome.

703
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,160
So,

704
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,050
team leaders, do a headcount

706

Coming.

707

We'll depart once everyone is here.

708

Cheng, there's a seat here.

709
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,440
Everyone's here.

710
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,570
You can have this.

711
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,330
Sit down and fasten your seat belt.

712
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,720
Who else?

713
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,370
Mr. Ning left for my group.

714
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,570
Call him and ask him

715
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,200
to hurry up.

716
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,530
Where is he?

717
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,530
Mr. Xue.

718
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,640
Why are you here?

719
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880
Why? You don't want to see me?

720
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,130
We do!

721
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,920
Just a small announcement.

722
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,130
Mr. Xue here

723
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,400
represented us in the legal battle

724
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,330
He is a special guest

for this team-building exercise.

726

Let's welcome him.

727
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,160
Woohoo!

728
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,960
Mr. Ning.

729
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,290
Mr. Ning, have a seat.

730
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,400
Ning.

731
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,130

Everyone was waiting for you.

Why are you late?

Waiting for me?

737
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,400
Come. Sit down.

739

Mr. Xue.

740
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,330
I'll sit in front then.

741
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,330
For me?

742
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,880
For Mr. Xue.

743
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,090
All right.

744
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,640
Thanks.

745
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,290
Sit tight now.

746
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,090
Have some, Mr. Xue.

Thanks.

748

Yes. Let's go.

No, thanks.

What is your issue with me
since this morning?

768
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,770
When we were on the bus,

769
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,960
did you not see the seat

770
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,290
I saved for you?

771
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,880
I did.

772
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,050
Then why didn't you take it?

773
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
I was in a bad mood.

774
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,570
Who crossed you?

775
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,610
Before I left this morning,

776
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,720
I wanted to have buns.

777
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,720
I couldn't find any

778
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,720
so I made do

779
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,960
with noodles.

780
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,290
That's why I'm upset.

781
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,570
I see it now.

782
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,440
You're all sarcastic now

783
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,720

what my mom said?

785
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,290
Yes.

786
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,960
I am not as good as Ning

787
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,160
so people

788
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,290
have to make do with me. Happy?

(around who skewered it.)

(Where's your glass?)

803
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,720
(You won't say a toast to him?)

804
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,290
(Come, Mr. Qian.)

805

(I'll chug it first.)

806

Here. Take it.

807
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:32,850
Thanks.

808
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,330
Try it.

809
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,610
Liuzheng.

810
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,480
You just grilled it?

811
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,400
Can I have it?

812
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,240
(I'll blow it out now.)

813
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,960
Is it delicious?

814
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,570

Come.

819
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,850
What do you think?

820
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,480
(I'll grill it for you.)

821
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,370
Smell it.

822
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,850
Does it smell good?

823
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,440
(This one.)

824
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,200
(It smells so good.)

825
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,480
The flavor of first love?

826
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,370
Let's drink together.

827
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,370
Half-baked cheesecake?

828
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
It's my favorite.

829
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,610
The flavor of first love. My favorite.

830
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,200
Have some.

831
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,920
I can't have it.

832
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:15,770
Why?

833
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,240
Why?

834
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,610
Here.

835
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,090
Together.

836
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,570
Because I have to maintain
my sexy figure.

837
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,610
I'll have it on your behalf.

838
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,570
(How funny.)

839
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,290
Do you like it?

840
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,160
It is the taste of first love.

841
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,090
That is what my first love tasted like.

842
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:33,680
Mr. Qian.

843
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,480
What are you eating?

844
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,440
You want some?

845
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I want some.

846
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,090
Come.

847
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,440
First love is like wine.

848
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,610
It's intoxicating.

849
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,850
Cheers.

850
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,440
Cheers.

851
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,440
Cheers.

852
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,720
I'm not joking around

853
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,290
when it comes to Liuzheng.

854
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:11,090
If your feelings toward her

855
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,050
is just a temporary infatuation,

856
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,050
then I don't think you two
are good for each other.

857
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,720
How are you so sure

858
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,010
that your feelings toward her

859
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,090
won't change?

860
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,160
In criminal law,

861
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,160
motive

862
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,240
and the nature of a crime

863
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,960
are two different things.

864
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,160
She is a doctor.

865
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,570
Which means her family won't be

866
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,370
her priority.

867
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,370
Do you think you're ready for that?

868
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,530
Don't worry about that.

869
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,610
I can take good care of her.

870
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,960
