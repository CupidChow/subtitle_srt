=Episode 35=

3
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,600
What would you do if I tell you

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,830
where Bablu is?

5
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,510
Kill him.

6
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,230
And then?

7
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,960
You kill this one,

8
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,080
but another will be born.

9
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,150
Bablu is the biggest enemy of us.

10
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,230
He must disappear.

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
Did they give you a hard time?

12
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,520
Are you hurt?

13
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,470
No.

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Things are decent here.

15
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,440
I've informed the Chinese Embassy

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,830
of your situation.

17
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,470
They are negotiating with Dahl's army.

18
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,750
I'd like to talk about Alfa.

19
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,360
Stay calm.

20
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,880
We'll talk when I get out.

21
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,670
If the embassy is handling it,

22
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,440
I believe they won't
keep me here for too long.

23
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,920
What's wrong?

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,440
I bet their new recruits
are having shooting practice.

25
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,670
It's alright.

26
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,110
Don't worry.

27
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,670
Be careful.

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,190
Dr. Ruan.

29
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,590
The colonel would like to see you.

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,950
This way, please.

31
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,470
Dr. Ruan is here.

32
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,670
Dr. Ruan.

33
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,160
No, thanks.

34
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm not in the mood.

35
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,280
I just want to know

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,670
when you will release Dr. Ning.

37
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
That email was sent to you.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,830
You have read it, right?

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,190
Take us to find Bablu.

40
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't know where he is.

41
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,400
Dr. Ruan!

42
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,190
Don't turn me down so quickly.

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
I will send special forces

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,470
disguised as doctors to go with you.

45
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,750
I'll ensure your safety.

46
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,270
I don't know

47
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,430
how to find Bablu.

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,640
Dr. Ruan.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,310
Your eyes do not tell me lies.

50
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,120
You just saw Dr. Ning.

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,360
He's living in
the new recruit dormitory.

52
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,310
And the shooting range is around here.

53
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,150
And you know what?

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,470
New recruits

55
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,750
are not good at shooting.

56
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,590
There will be some bullets

57
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,750
flying around.

58
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,310
But we'll keep Dr. Ning safe.

59
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,710
But that would be a pity

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,870
if anything happened.

61
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,460
(Outpatient)

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,430
So, the media is here to speak with you.

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,270
You just have to spend a little while
with them and you're done.

64
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,920
That's my cousin Abu.

65
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
- Doctor.
- Hello, Dr. Ruan.

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,310
Can you tell us stories

67
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,870
about Alfa?

68
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,030
I heard he had a craniotomy.

69
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,360
But he wasn't completely cured.

70
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,840
He relapses now
and needs another surgery.

71
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,310
But the government's forces
and Bablu are still at war.

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,190
I don't want to let him die.

73
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,860
(DAHL DAILY)

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,120
I underestimated this woman.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,310
What now?

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,430
In just a few days' time,

77
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,030
the world's mainstream media

78
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,590
will be reporting the story of Alfa.

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,560
You know

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
how easy it is for people
to have compassion for kids.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,120
Public opinion is against us.

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,310
Bablu is screwed!

83
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,710
And?

84
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,680
Anything else?

85
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,120
Bablu has declared a ceasefire.

86
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,270
Bullshit.

87
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,680
Dahl and the whole world

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,470
are waiting for our answer.

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,750
Colonel.

90
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Dr. Ruan wants to see you.

91
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,030
Come in.

92
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,800
Dr. Ruan.

93
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,870
I'm here to take my husband home today.

94
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,430
I haven't released him yet.

95
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,190
However,

96
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,960
we have agreed to cease fire.

97
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,150
Dr. Ruan.

98
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,430
What gives you the right

99
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,990
to say the gossip to media?

100
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,800
I can arrest you for

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,680
leaking military secrets.

102
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,590
I was telling the truth.

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,710
Alfa needs medical assistance.

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,640
And I didn't expect

105
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,870
to attract society's attention.

106
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,960
Please save Alfa.

107
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,240
By saving a child

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,360
you'll be saving a nation.

109
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,400
Hello?

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,270
(Release Zhiqian Ning right away!)

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,030
(The Chinese Embassy
has sent a message to us.)

112
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,750
Yes?

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,710
(We might face diplomatic disputes)

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,150
(if we continue to detain
Zhiqian Ning for no reasons.)

115
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,870
Alright.

116
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,270
Dr. Ruan.

117
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,150
You win.

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
You can go home now.

119
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,640
Let's go.

120
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,320
Dr. Ning.

121
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:35,380
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

122
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,240
Say, "Ni-hao."

123
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,830
You can learn from me. "Ruan Liuzheng."

124
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,800
"Ruan Liuzheng is pretty."

125
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,630
No.

126
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,510
It's Ms. Tan.

127
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,440
What's your favorite superhero?

128
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,440
Spider-Man.

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,270
Superhero?

130
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,320
Yeah.

131
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,710
The kid looks lively.

132
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,270
You wanna make a new friend?

133
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,950
- Alfa.
- Hello. I am Ning Xiang.

134
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,150
- Ning Xiang.
- Hello.

135
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,150
That's his name.

136
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,560
Hi.

137
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,240
Hi.

138
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
You're doing much better now.

139
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,120
They say you like Spider-Man.

140
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,070
- I like him too.
- I like him.

141
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,800
Look what this is.

142
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,760
No idea.

143
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,510
This is Sun Wukong.

144
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,630
He's a superhero from China.

145
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,320
- He can defeat all demons.
- Sun Wukong?

146
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,150
Come to China and play with me.

147
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,390
Great news.

148
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,830
Great news.

149
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,760
Okay.

150
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,440
The government and Bablu have
reached an agreement.

151
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,030
For more than 24 hours,

152
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,760
there will be a ceasefire.

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,320
So this means there will be peace.

154
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:14,270
- Peace!
- Peace!

155
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,220
(One month later)

156
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,800
Where is Senta?

157
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,880
Where is Senta?

158
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,340
Senta!

159
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,240
- Senta!
- Hey, Senta!

160
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,950
Doctor.

161
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,390
How are you doing?

162
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,200
My kid is sick, very sick.

163
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,880
Okay.

164
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:09,920
A fever.

165
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,240
It's over 38℃.

166
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,560
Give him a shot for tetanus.

167
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,680
It's okay.

168
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,590
38.7℃.

169
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,150
He's gonna be fine.

170
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,120
Thank you!

171
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you, man.

172
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,030
Doctor!

173
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,150
Get the ball!

174
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,590
Okay. Wait a moment.

175
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,760
I want Cola!

176
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,560
Thank you!

177
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,630
Let's go.

178
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,590
Watch for the ball!

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,710
Watch out!

180
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,950
Get down!

181
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,800
Watch out!

182
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,950
Ning Zhiqian!

183
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,950
Ning Zhiqian!

184
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,470
Ning Zhiqian! Open your eyes!

185
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,950
Ning Zhiqian!

186
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,000
Ning Zhiqian!

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,800
Help!

188
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,390
My god! Is he alright?

189
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,510
Oh my god.

190
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,560
Oh my god.

191
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,440
Help me!

192
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,150
Ning Zhiqian, wake up!

193
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,470
Ning Zhiqian!

194
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,360
Ning Zhiqian!

195
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,150
Ning Zhiqian!

196
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
Ning Zhiqian!

197
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,630
Hurry.

198
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,800
Save him.

199
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,960
What do we do?

200
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
Liuzheng, calm down.

201
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,680
Ning Zhiqian has
intracerebral hemorrhage.

202
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,350
You're the only neurosurgeon here.

203
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,600
How do I save him?

204
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,200
Only you can save him now.

205
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,920
Do that

206
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,350
or he is doomed.

207
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
How do I save him?

208
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,840
Let him die, then.

209
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,200
Or send him
to the international hospital

210
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,030
300 km away.

211
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,080
They have neurosurgeons.

212
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,080
Three hundred kilometers?

213
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,990
That's at least two
and a half hours away!

214
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,510
Ning Zhiqian won't last that long.

215
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,080
At least we have
a chance at saving him here.

216
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,110
Look at her!

217
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,320
Can she operate on him?

218
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,870
I can.

219
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,380
(Operation)

220
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,150
Absorbable gelatin sponge.

221
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,870
Decreasing blood pressure
and heart rate!

222

(Anesthesia ventilator)

223
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,860
(Operation)

224
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,660
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

225
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,920
(I've heard)

226
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,480
(stories about weapons)

227
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,600
(left behind in Dahl after the war.)

228
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,600
(Innocent people
were harmed by those weapons.)

229
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,350
(I've lived my entire life in peace.)

230
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,270
(But this time, I could feel)

231
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,720
(the damage a war
could bring to the people.)

232
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,380
It's been an entire day.

233
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
She wouldn't eat anything.

234
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,030
She could fall sick before Ning Zhiqian

235
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,030
could wake up.

236
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,270
What is Liuzheng's favorite?

237
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,390
We should get her some.

238
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,200
Leave that to me.

239
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,940
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

240
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,600
Don't.

241
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,350
She wouldn't eat.

242
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Ning Zhiqian has been
in a coma for days.

243
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,480
Should we contact his family back home?

244
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,840
Only his father lives there now.

245
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,920
This might be too much for him.

246
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,840
Let's wait.

247
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,150
I'll ask for Liuzheng's decision later.

248
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,480
Sure.

249

What happened?

288
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,690
You had

289
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,840
a 40℃ fever.

290
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
You've been asleep for three days.

291
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,650
Three days?

292
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,480
How is Ning Zhiqian?

293
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,410
Is he awake?

294
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll check on him.

295
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,080
Where is he?

296
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,840
Calm down.

297
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,930
Where did he go? Tell me now.

298
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,690
He was picked up two days ago.

299
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,480
Ning Zhiqian...

300
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,650
Where was he taken to?

301
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,530
Don't be paranoid.

302
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,290
Is he...

303
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,650
Don't be paranoid.

304
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,840
I must talk to Simeone.

305
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,170
Simeone!

306
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,320
Where is she?

307
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,290
We're looking for her too.

308
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,720
She wouldn't answer our calls.

309
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,080
Have you seen Dr. Ning?

310
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,690
I haven't.

311
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,240
And you?

312
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,050
No.

313
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,290
Jeff!

314
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,170
Have you seen Dr. Ning?

315
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,200
No.

316
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,810
Wait.

317
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,690
Wait for what?

318
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
The day before yesterday night,

319
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,410
I saw him.

320
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,170
I couldn't get a look inside.

321
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
They drove away.

322
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,770
Somebody took him away.

323
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,080
An elderly Chinese guy.

324
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,530
Where did they go?

325
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,080
I don't know.

326
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,650
Maybe...

327
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
Back home? To China?

328
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,240
Liuzheng!

329
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,200
Slow down!

330
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,410
Liuzheng!

331
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,480
Liuzheng!

332
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,960
Calm down, Liuzheng.

333
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,450
What are you doing?

334
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,320
What's the luggage case for? Liuzheng!

335
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm going home.

336
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,200
Liuzheng, stop it.

337
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,170
He's a person!

338
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,840
They just took him away!

339
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,170
Why didn't you ask
where they went?

340
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,840
Ning Zhiqian was taken

341
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,890
straight from the ICU!

342
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,200
I couldn't have always stayed there

343
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,410
just to watch over him!

344
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,720
I have other patients to tend to!

345
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Why didn't you wake me up?

346
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,120
You were unconscious for three days!

347
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
I checked on you every day!

348
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,770
How was I supposed to wake you up?

349
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,530
I would've woken up

350
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,200
had you at least tried!

351
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,050
Everyone is lying to me.

352
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,000
Lie all you want!
You can't fool me forever.

353
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,080
We are not lying to you.

354
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,650
I went to Simeone,

355
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,120
but she was missing.

356
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,170
I asked Jeff.

357
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,720
He said Zhiqian was taken away.

358
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,890
But by whom?

359
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,240
Who would take him away?

360
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,410
Liuzheng, calm down.

361
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,840
We are not lying to you.

362
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,690
Everyone hope for him to get well.

363
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,530
But he was taken away
in the middle of the night!

364
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,720
We didn't know anything.

365
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,720
The middle of the night?

366
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,930
So you know where he is!

367
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,890
I don't know!

368
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,840
You are all lying to me.

369
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,080
Stop it.

370
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,000
Stop it, Liuzheng.

371
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,650
Is he dead?

372
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,650
When did he die?

373
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,050
Yesterday?

374
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,930
- Stop it.
- The day before?

375
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,000
He is not dead!

376
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,600
Ning Zhiqian didn't die!

377
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,650
What day did he die
while I was sleeping?

378
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,960
Why did I fall asleep?

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,530
Why didn't you wake me up?

380
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,960
Stop it!

381
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,930
Calm down!

382
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,360
Ning Zhiqian is not dead!

383
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,200
He didn't die!

384
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,450
He is dead!

385
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,810
Why didn't he come to me?

386
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,240
Don't cry. Calm down.

387
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,450
We'll look for him.

388
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,570
Let's search for him. OK?

389
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,930
I want to go home.

390
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,320
I want to go home and look for him.

391
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,080
I'll request for our return.

392
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,650
Stop it! Let me do it.

393
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,410
We are both going home!

394
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,290
Let go! Let me do it.

395
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,410
Stop crying.

396
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
I can't lose him.

397
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,960
He's alive.

398
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,840
He's not dead.

399
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,050
We'll find him.

400
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Sleep.

401
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,810
We'll find out when we reach Jiangzhou.

402
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,880
(2007, China)

403
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,200
(Jiangzhou University Medical School)

404
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,240
(Welcome, new students!)

405
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,290
(Slow down.)

406
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,240
(Are you from room 320?)

407
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,120
(Yes. You too?)

408
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,810
(Me too!)

409
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,570
Yingchao?

Xu Beibei.

411
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,530
Miss?

412
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,840
(Welcome, new students!)
Are you here for registration?

413
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
Let me carry the luggage.

414
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,480
I'll manage. Thanks.

415
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,120
It's alright.

416
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,360
Leave it to me.

417
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,720
I'll be fine.

418
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,530
Help the others.

419
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,290
Hello.

420
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,240
Done.

421
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,770
Okay.

422
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,320
Excuse me.

423
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Where is dorm No.3?

424
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,570
Head for the main entrance.
There is a stair across it.

425
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
Go upstairs and turn right.

426
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,930
I am Ruan Liuzheng,
from the 07 batch of Clinical Medicine.

427
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Is this the registration counter?

428
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,570
Ruan Liuzheng?

429
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,050
We've been waiting for you.

430
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,450
You know me?

431
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,960
You have great grades.

432
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
The third-best
entrance test results in class.

433
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,050
Fill out the form.

434
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,600
I'll introduce myself.

435
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,770
I am Ning Zhiqian.

436
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:51,530
I know.

437
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,740
Am I really that famous in school?

438
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,530
(Ning Zhiqian)

439
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,690
I'm studying for
my master's degree and my Ph.D.

440
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm the tutor for your class
for the next five years.

441
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,660
(Ning Zhiqian)

442
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,450
You got the name wrong.

443
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
Use a new form.

444
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,930
What's up, everyone?

445
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:54,970
You seem to be having fun.

446
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,840
Do you think

447
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,890
your nightmare
from senior years in high school

448
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,890
is now over and
your brilliant college life awaits?

449
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

450
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,120
First of all, congratulations to you

451
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,280
for becoming
students of Clinical Medicine,

452
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,840
Jiangzhou University
Medical School, batch 2007.

453
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,100
I am your tutor.

454
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,800
My name is Ning Zhiqian.

455
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,380
For the next five years,

456
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,940
I'll assist the lecturers
in helping you

457
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,060
in your daily life and study.

458
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,230
In the next five years,

459
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,710
you have plenty of time to decide.

460
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,840
Will you further your study?

461
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,950
Will you become a doctor?

462
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,430
Will saving lives

463
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,510
be your lifelong

464
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,230
ambition?

465
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,670
And of course,

466
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,910
I won't impose my ideals

467
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,910
onto you.

468
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,750
However,

469
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,710
I do hope that

470
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,080
each and every one of you

471
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,270
will get to put on

472
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,950
the white coat.

473
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,600
Men look fit in it,

474
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,080
while women look classy in it.

475
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,160
I bet you don't know this.

476
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,710
In 2006,

477
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,040
in the ranking of the most
fantasized uniform in the world,

478
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,040
the white coat took the first place.

479
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,470
This is our first meeting.

480
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,990
Let's get to know each other better.

481
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,470
When I read your student ID,

482
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,360
introduce yourself.

483
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,880
Let's see who's the lucky person.

484
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,400
No.007.

485
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,710
Hello.

486
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,950
My name is Lin Nan.

487
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,710
Things went south
when my mother gave birth to me.

488
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
Hence the name. It means "south".

489
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,750
Don't laugh.

490
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,640
My mom went through a lot of pain
to bring me into this world.

491
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,080
That is why I want to be a doctor.

492
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,880
Could you tell us which field

493
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,840
you want to study in?

494
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,880
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

495
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,080
Sit down.

496
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,470
Next.

497
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,840
The name sounds like
there's a story behind it.

498
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
No.025.

499
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,360
No.025?

500
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,430
Hello.

501
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,840
I am No.025.

502
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,510
My name is Ruan Liuzheng.

503
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,600
I graduated from
Jiangzhou No.7 High School.

504
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,600
What are the odds?

505
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,320
I went to the same high school.

506
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,710
Carry on.

507
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,800
I am 170 cm tall.

508
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
My birthday is February 7.

509
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,510
I'm a member of the Youth League.

510
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm a girl.

511
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,990
I believe

512
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,600
we can all tell as much.

513
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,950
Don't be nervous.

514
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
So, tell us.

515
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:21,710
What's the story

516
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,080
behind your name?

517
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,640
My mom had a dream before I was born.

518
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,600
She dreamed of a drifting kite.

519
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,670
Hence, the name. "Drifting Kite."

520
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,230
Very poetic.

521
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,950
If you're always flying in the sky,

522
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,160
I bet no one can catch you.

523
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,020
- (Dear passengers.)
- Liuzheng.

524
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,860
- (The airplane will land soon.)
- Liuzheng.

525
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,510
Wake up.

526
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,430
(Please return to your seat)

527
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,950
(and fasten your seatbelt.)

528
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,990
(Straighten the seat back
and retract the desk.)

529
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,640
(The chief steward of this flight)

530
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,040
(will be at your service.)
Where are we?

531
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,910
We're almost in Jiangzhou.

532
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,600
(Thank you.)

533
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,860
(Beiya Hospital)

534
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,680
(Neurosurgery Department)

535
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,880
Let's talk about the surgery schedule
for next week.

536
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,600
Bed 37.

537
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,160
Bed 4.

538
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,510
Bed 26.

539
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,880
The patient of bed 37 is old.

540
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,430
We need to adjust the surgery plan.

541
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,400
Dr. Wu.

542
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,950
Okay.

543
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,710
Dr. Ruan?

544
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,040
Liuzheng?

545
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,270
Dr. Ruan.

546
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,670
Is Ning Zhiqian here?

547
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,640
No.

548
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,670
Which hospital is he at?

549
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,840
We have no idea.

550
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,160
Tan Ya said

551
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,750
he was rushed back
to China for treatment.

552
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,040
We all thought
he'd be sent to Beiya.

553
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
But we still

554
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,990
haven't seen him.

555
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,120
I told you.

556
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,510
Mr. Ning is not here.

557
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,950
I didn't lie to you.

558
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,430
(Door's open.)

559
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,560
This house has been empty for some time.

560
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,160
Did you have
these covered before leaving?

561
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,270
Are you tired?

562
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,600
I'm sending you home.

563
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,600
Don't think about anything.

564
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,360
Go home and get some sleep.

565
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,040
We'll discuss the matter tomorrow.

566
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,040
I want to ask around
at Ning Xiang's school.

567
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,800
See if there's anything I can learn.

568
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,360
Don't bother.

569
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,840
I asked.

570
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,270
They don't know anything.

571
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,230
