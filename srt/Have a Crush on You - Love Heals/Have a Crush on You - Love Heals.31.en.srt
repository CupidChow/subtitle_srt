3
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,400
(Beiya Hospital)

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,810
Cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology

5
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,080
have appeared
in several provinces and cities.

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,490
It has been confirmed

7
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,640
that the pneumonia of unknown aetiology

8
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,360
is caused

9
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,170
by a new coronavirus infection.

10
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,440
The National Center
for Disease Control and Public Health

11
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
has declared
a level-one emergency response.

12
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,250
And other provinces and cities
have already seen cases

13
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,000
of infection among healthcare workers.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,680
We must all take this seriously.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
I counted

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
three patients in our wards

17
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,440
that have shown different degrees

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
of respiratory infection symptoms.

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Our hospital currently does not have
COVID test kits,

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,370
so we can only isolate them,

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
disinfect the wards,

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
and take their temperature daily.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
The Pulmonology Department
and Fever Clinic

24
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,570
are overwhelmed with patients

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,160
and severely understaffed.

26
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,930
After contemplation, the hospital
administrative office has decided

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,680
that each department must be ready

28
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,570
to provide support at all times.

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,960
Understood.

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Transfer all patients
with respiratory infection symptoms

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,040
to the room at the end of the corridor.

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,520
I'll take that room.

33
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,490
That'll reduce the movement of personnel

34
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,760
and the risk of cross-contamination.

35
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,370
I'll go with Dr. Ruan.

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,650
I'll go with you guys.

37
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,570
Make sure you take
all precautionary measures.

38
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,160
All right.

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,400
You're still here.

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,400
I heard the Pulmonology Department
is short of staff these days.

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,130
They're even borrowing our staff.

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,930
Is that true?

43
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,090
Yes.

44
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,040
I volunteer.

45
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,880
Because you broke up with Ding Yiyuan,

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,680
and you don't want to see her?

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,320
No, wait... How did you know that?

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,130
Who told you?

49
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,730
Anyone with eyes could see that.

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,680
First of all,

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,160
I want to help.

52
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,880
Avoiding her is the second reason.

53
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,010
I believe you.

54
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,730
You do?

55
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,650
We've worked together for years.

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,290
I know the kind of person you are.

57
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,800
You don't.

58
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,370
You really don't.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,730
I just want

60
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,290
to do something right now

61
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,210
to show everyone

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,650
I'm not a good-for-nothing.

63
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,040
Even I'm looking down on myself.

64
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,360
All these years,
I never let you join the research group,

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,400
and I made you perform
the outpatient duty a lot.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,640
I know you're unhappy with me for that.

67
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,770
But I thought you would understand.

68
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,770
Ning,

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,770
I didn't vote for you

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,570
during the election for the manager.

71
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,610
I forfeited my vote.

72
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,450
If you did this

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,330
ten years ago,

74
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,570
I would beat you up for sure.

75
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,170
You can try it now.

76
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,400
But I'll fight back.

77
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,800
Want to do it now?

78
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,800
Take a look.

79
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,800
Read it.

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,640
The hospital has offered
an opportunity for further study.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,010
I recommended you.

82
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,050
It has been approved.

83
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,400
When was this?

84
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,240
Why didn't you tell me
about this sooner?

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
You have two options right now.

86
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,010
Either go to the Pulmonology Department

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,290
or

88
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,050
pursue further study.

89
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,130
What's going on here?

90
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,240
What's with this tense atmosphere?

91
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,850
Did you guys get into a fight?

95

you gave me carefully.)

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,200
(I know my condition.)

97
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,610

98

the remaining days of my life)

99

(with my family.)

100
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,200
The new year's eve is coming up.

101
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,050
We'll probably be spending
new year's eve in the hospital again.

102
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,170
My parents were hoping
we could get married

103
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,360
by the end of the year.

104
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,960
What's the matter?

105
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,170
You don't want to?

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,240
No.

107
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,480
Sure.

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,920
After the new year.

109
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,050
Let's get married after the new year.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,890
I hope the pandemic is over by then.

I'm worried that she...

That's enough.

134
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,770
Look at how serious
the pandemic is right now.

135

How could we tell them about it now?

136
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,090
If we do,

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,130
they won't be able to focus on work.

138
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,010
It's better to let them work
with a sound of mind.

139
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,040
Besides, given my condition...

140
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,970
They won't be able to do anything

141
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,770
even if they know.

142

Are you leaving?

Oh, okay. We'll see you off.

Come on.

148
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,010
Here. Let me carry that for you.

149
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,650
I'm not a kid anymore.

150
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,650
Yes, you are.

151
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,160
When you got accepted into university,

152
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,010
I carried your luggage for you

153
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,800
when I sent you to your school.

154
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,010
To tell you the truth,

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,010
I didn't want you to study medicine.

156
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,450
But your mother wanted you to.

157
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,480
She said it would be good

158
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,090
to have a doctor in the house

159
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,530
in case anyone in the family gets sick.

160
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,650
But

161
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
I always thought

162
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,720
being a doctor

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,920
was too tiring.

164
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,480
You're my only daughter.

165
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,800
I couldn't bear for you
to go through that.

166
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,570
But all is good now.

167
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,800
I'm fine with things now.

168
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,280
My daughter, my angel in white,

169
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,920
is going to serve on the frontlines.

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
But remember this.

171
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,530
Come back

172
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,010
as soon as you can.

173
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,480
It's cold.

174
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,450
Put this on.

175
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,770
Wear this. Come.

176
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,840
Always be safe.

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,130
What's with all of this?

178
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,040
I'll be back in no time.

179
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
As long as you two are safe and healthy

180
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,210
at home,

181
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,720
I'll be able to focus on work out there.

182
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,010
Right. We'll be perfectly healthy.

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,360
All right.

184
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,330
Come on.

185
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:09,800
Oh, right.

186
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Take all these with you.

187
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,770
Take this.

188
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,210
And this beef.

189
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:16,720
Spiced beef?

190
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,600
It's your childhood favorite.

191
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,040
Of course, I know that.

192
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,330
I have it all prepared for you.

193
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,180
Let's go.

194
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,920
- Come on.
- Let's go.

195
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Give me that. No need to see me off.

196
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,970
Go on.

197
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,530
It's cold out there.

198
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,130
You guys just wait here.

199
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,600
All right.

200
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm off.

201
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,770
Go on.

202
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,650
Take it easy.

203
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,890
Be safe.

204
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,650
Bye.

205
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,360
Bye.

206
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,920
Li Aiying can't hold on any longer.

207
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,650
The Obstetrics and Gynecology Department
asked Mr. Ning to get there right away.

208
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,970
How is Li Aiying?

209
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,840
We don't know much
about the condition of her brain,

210
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,680
but the fetus is showing signs
of premature labour.

211
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,010
The heartbeat
is unstable as well.

212
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,530
How have you been feeling these days?

213
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
I've been feeling dizzy and nauseous.

214
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,130
Dizzy and nauseous. How's your sleep?

215
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,360
Not good.

216
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,570
I think

217
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,130
the tumor is growing too fast

218
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,210
and is causing
increased intracranial pressure.

219
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,450
The change in the cranial pressure
triggered a threatened miscarriage.

220
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,650
So what's the best solution now?

221
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,920
How far along is the fetus?

222
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,840
34 weeks.

223
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,480
Combined surgery.

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,890
Combined surgery?

225
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,650
You guys will retrieve the baby.

226
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,360
We'll remove the tumor.

227
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
But that's too difficult and risky.

228
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,570
Prepare for surgery.

229
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,570
We're out of time.

230
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,720
Okay.

231
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,570
Prepare for surgery.

232
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,280
Prepare the skin.

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,130
Hello?

234
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,090
Qian?

235
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,650
(Dr. Ning, what's wrong?)

236
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,650
Come to the operating room.

237
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,570
What surgery can't you handle?

238
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,570
It's Li Aiying.

239
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,970
Increased intracranial pressure
triggered a threatened miscarriage.

240
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,530
I'll be performing a combined surgery.

241
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,570
The condition of the tumor is complex.

242
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,600
I need your help.

243
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Let me remind you something.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
If you're not careful,

245
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,650
you'll lose two lives.

246
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,280
I'll take the responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

247
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,600
Stop hesitating.

248
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,210
You always say that.

249
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,970
Qian.

250
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,210
I don't want to do any moral coercion.

251
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,680
If you're not here tonight,

252
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,650
even if the baby is born,

253
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,770
the mother might not make it.

254
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,010
Patient name, Li Aiying.

255
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,450
Female. 39 years old.

256
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,530
Inpatient number 032817.

257
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,600
Scalpel.

258
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,210
Gauze.

259
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
Rapid drop in blood pressure.

260
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,410
90/60.

261
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,570
Abnormal fetal heartbeat.

262
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,010
The baby could die
in the womb at any time.

263
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,330
We need to retrieve the baby at once.

264
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,570
Hold on, Dr. Liu.

265
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,240
The situation's complicated on my end.

266
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,360
The tumor is bigger than expected.

267
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
And it's surrounded

268
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,040
by a lot of blood vessels.

269
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,840
There is a high risk of hemorrhage
during the procedure.

270
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,160
If that happens,

271
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
the mother will go into shock.

272
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,890
The baby's life will be in danger.

273
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,840
We have to hurry.

274
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,680
Bipolar coagulation forceps.

275
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,210
You should have time
to retrieve the baby.

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,330
If I don't remove this tumor,

277
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,450
there's a high chance
the mother won't make it.

278
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,330
Qian,

279
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,480
I knew you'd come.

280
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,090
Let's get the baby out first.

281
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,040
Get ready.

282
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,890
Scalpel.

283
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,530
Qian, I'll cut.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,800
You stop the bleeding.

285
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,210
If we work with Dr. Liu,

286
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,410
both mother and baby
will have a higher chance of survival.

287
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,160
Periosteal elevator.

288
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,280
Dr. Ruan.

289
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,720
Give me a hand.

290
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,010
Here you go.
Bipolar coagulation forceps.

291
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,480
We can do this.

292
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,280
We got this.

293
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,650
Hemostat.

294
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,600
Periosteal elevator.

295
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,130
Micro scissors.

296
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,720
Anesthetist.

297
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,080
Blood pressure is still dropping.

298
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,560
Qian, we need to hurry up.

299
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,530
Take care
of the small surrounding vessels first.

300
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,840
Dr. Ruan, the suction machine.

301
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,170
The baby is coming out.

302
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,130
Blood pressure is still dropping.

303
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,240
The baby is out.

304
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,840
Scissors.

305
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,440
Blood pressure is still dropping.

306
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,360
How's the baby?

307
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,930
Premature birth. Less than 2kg.

308
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,930
Weak breathing.

309
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,530
And

310
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,650
poor cardiopulmonary development.

311
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,600
The baby will probably need
to spend a month in the incubator.

312
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,200
But not too bad overall.

313
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,650
That's good news.

314
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,810
We'll finish soon as well.

315
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:47,890
Tumor forceps.

316
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
Continuous drop in blood pressure.

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,650
Her heart rate
isn't looking good, either.

318
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,170
Hang in there, Qian.

319
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,200
Bleeding stopped.

320
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,480
Blood pressure stabilized.

321
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,080
Good.

322
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,170
Good work, Qian.

323
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,890
We did it.

324
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,050
I owe you barbecue.

325
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,100
(Li Aiying gave birth.)

326
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,050
(Both mother and baby are safe.)

327
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,600
To heck with you, Ning Zhiqian.

328
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,730
You set me up again,

329
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,130
didn't you?

330
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,370
Don't say that.

331
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,040
The baby and the mother are safe.

332
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,250
We got a happy ending.

333
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,020
I don't do well

334
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,840
under pressure.

335
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,080
You have me with you.
What have you got to worry about?

336
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,770
I've finally figured it out.

337
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,930
You gave me the manager position

338
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,720
so you could continue causing trouble

339
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,080
and make me

340
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,530
clean up your mess.

341
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,690
I have hands.

342
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,530
I don't need you
to clean up my mess for me.

343
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,290
You became a smooth talker
after you started dating.

344
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,200
Did he learn it from you?

345
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,200
Don't get the innocent bystander
involved in your argument.

346
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,320
You? Innocent bystander?

347
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,930
You two are on the same side.

348
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,810
You breathe from the same nostril.

349
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,810
You even smell the same.

350
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,600
You smelled us, Qian?

351
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,690
Listen.

352
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,170
Even if I made a mistake today,

353
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,720
I made a promise to you, didn't I?

354
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll just treat you to a barbecue
after the matter is settled.

355
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,840
If one isn't enough, make it three.

356
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,690
Make it five.

357
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,570
Let me ask you another thing.

358
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,570
If you were in my position,

359
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,440
wouldn't you have taken the risk too?

360
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,200
I bet you would.

361
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,690
Qian,

362
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,570
we've known each other for a decade.

363
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,810
I know you too well.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,320
Do you know why

365
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,690
I let you be the Ward Manager of Ward 3

366
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,890
and willingly work under you?

367
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,770
Why?

368
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,120
I respect you.

369
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,360
You're the only one I'll concede to
in Beiya Hospital.

370
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,770
Ask Dr. Ruan.

371
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,290
I always sing your praises.

372
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,410
He does talk about you a lot.

373
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,410
Did I play into their hands?

374
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,220
(Beiya Hospital)

375
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,300
(Happy birthday)

376
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,300
(Happy birthday)

377
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,540
(Happy birthday)

378
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,740
(Happy birthday)

379
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,170
I forgot it's my birthday.

380
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,890
Quite a romantic set-up you have here.

381
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,810
Take a look.

382
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,080
Do you like it?

383
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,690
The bakeries were closed,

384
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,360
so I could only get you a steamed bun
from the cafeteria.

385
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,570
Where did you get the flowers?

386
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,530
Don't they look familiar?

387
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,080
It's what Cheng Zhouyu gave Ding Yiyuan.

388
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,120
I found them.

389
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,810
Make a wish.

390
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,810
Done.

391
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,690
What is your wish?

392
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,960
I hope this pandemic ends soon

393
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,650
and everyone is safe and sound.

394
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,080
Blow out the candles.

395
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
Forgot to remove my mask.

396
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,930
Happy birthday.

397
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,010
It's embarrassing
if someone catches us like this.

398
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,050
What are you worried about?

399
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
Everyone knows it's your birthday today.

400
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,010
I relayed their wishes to you.

401
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,050
No cheating.

402
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,290
The other day,

403
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,890
I was lamenting.

404
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,410
Which do you think

405
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,120
will come first?

406
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,010
Your tomorrow or your end?

407
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,360
You think too much.

408
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,290
In the past,

409
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,530
when I became a doctor,

410
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,170
I thought I was fearless.

411
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,600
Now,

412
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,840
the older I get, the more I worry.

413
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,770
What are you afraid of the most?

414
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,200
It's...

415
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
Who was that message from?

416
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,840
My dad.

417
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,600
What did he say?

418
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,650
He wished me a happy birthday.

419
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,010
Nothing else?

420
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,480
He asked us to get married soon.

421
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,720
He did?

422
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,770
Lately,

423
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,050
he has gotten so sentimental.

424
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,010
Well, tell him

425
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,840
that we'll get married

426
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,320
after the pandemic is over.

427
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,650
We'll get married!

428
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,650
Today

429
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,320
is a fulfilling day.

430
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,840
Yes.

431
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,240
That child

432
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,200
shares the birthday with you.

433
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,770
I'll never forget today.

434
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,420
(Beiya Hospital)

435
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,650
Tan,

436
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,690
take care when you're there.

437
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,960
We'll miss you.

438
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,290
I will. Don't worry.

439
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,690
Look after the nurse station.

440
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,570
You too.

441
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,410
Take care of yourself.

442
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,010
Liuzheng,

443
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm heading into the isolation wards.

444
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,010
We might not see each other for a while.

445
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,960
Keep a safe distance.

446
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,930
Look after the Neurosurgery Department.
Wait for me to come back.

447
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,010
Keep yourself protected.

448
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,930
I'm off.

449
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,200
All the best.

450
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,600
Take care, Tan.

451
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,480
We'll be waiting for you.

452
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,530
Team One, assemble.

453
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,410
Team Two, assemble.

454
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,200
Team Three, assemble.

455
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,480
(Buffer Zone)

456
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,170
We'll begin the roll call.

457
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,320
Wang Xiaoliu.

458
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,650
Present.

459
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,240
Ding Yiyuan.

460

Present.

461
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,360
Yang Guoguang.

462
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:37,840
Present.

463
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,360
Present.

464
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,170
Li Cao.

465
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,530
Present.

466
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Tan Ya.

467
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,530
Present.

468
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Cheng Zhouyu.

469
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,410
Cheng Zhouyu!

470
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm here!

471
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,200
Cheng Zhouyu from Neurosurgery.

472
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Sorry, I'm late!

473
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,120
Note down his name.

474
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,740
Okay.

475
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,720
Are you ready?

476
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,770
-Ready.
-Ready.

477
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,650
Off you go.

478
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,320
Turn.

479
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,170
Next.

480
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,010
Please help me write my name.

481
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,240
Cheng Zhouyu.

482
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,080
The characters Zhou from Zhoushan
and Yu from universe.

483
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,500
(Steamed bun)

484
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:13,650
Next.

485
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,810
Thanks.

486
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,220
(Steamed bun)

487
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,360
Doctor, will I be okay?

488
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,440
You're fine.

489
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,170
Just take it easy

490
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,240
and rest well.

491
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,890
Thank you.

492
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,410
- All the best.
- You got this.

493
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,440
Doctor, this is bad!

494
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,200
Blood oxygen level
of the patient in Bed 8 is down to 30.

495
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,320
Can you hear me?

496
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,170
He's still conscious.

497
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,360
What is the patient's
current blood oxygen level?

498
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,170
45.

499
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:55,930
Blood pressure?

500
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,010
80/60.

501
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,840
Blood oxygen level is too low.

502
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,360
Monitor blood pressure at all times.

503
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,050
Blood pressure is still dropping.

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,840
Intubation.
Connect him to the ventilator.

505
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,960
His blood pressure is too low.

506
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,720
I don't think he'll make it
even with a ventilator.

507
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,200
Inject 1mg of adrenaline.

508
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,810
Got it.

509
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,280
(Tan Ya)

510
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,890
Inject 1mg of adrenaline.

511
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,480
Yes.

512
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,810
Can you hear me?

513
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,720
I'm the doctor in charge of you.

514
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,840
You're on the edge of life and death.

Blood pressure is up a little.

518
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,810
Intubation.
Connect him to the ventilator.

519
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,410
Got it.

Here.

528
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,440
Put it here.

529
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,690
Give that to me.

530
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,360
Easy there.

531
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,410

I will.

537
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,410
Keep it up!

538
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,650

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,170
Take it easy.

545
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,050
Did you

546
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,080
help move all these?

547

When the country is in trouble,
every citizen has to play his part.

548

Come. Let's move the boxes together.

549
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,650
Okay.

550
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,840
All right.

551
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,170
Here.

552
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,480
All right.

Hello? Juan?

559
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,890
What happened to Ning Xiang?

560
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,620
(Ning Zhiqian, Ruan Liuzheng)

561
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,480
Hurry! They're here!

562
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,010
Ning Xiang!

563
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,120
Please save Ning Xiang!

564
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,810
Ning Xiang.

565
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,930
- Please save him!
- Ning Xiang.

566
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,930
Ning Xiang!

567
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,770
Ning Xiang!

568
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,810
The recurring tumor
is larger than the last,

569
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,010
making the operation

570
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,530
more challenging and risky.

571
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,200
From medical imaging,

572
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,890
the tumor tightly adheres
to the brain stem.

573
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,320
The boundaries are unclear.

574
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,170
That will make surgical removal

575
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
a challenging task.

576
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,050
The tumor is close
to the fourth ventricle

577
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,410
near the centre
of the circulatory system.

578
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,570
Intraoperative fluctuations
in blood pressure and heart rate

579
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,080
are also concerning variables.

580
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,080
He is too young.

581
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,530
The risk of this procedure

582
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,010
is already high in the first place.

583
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,200
If he bleeds any more than necessary,

584
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
the consequence could be grave.

585
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,200
In the event
of intraoperative hemorrhage,

586
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,010
the consequence will be unfathomable.

587
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,320
If he were an adult,

588
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,690
the chance of success could be higher.

589
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,770
But it's too late to transfer him

590
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,080
to the children's hospital now.

591
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,320
It'll be difficult

592
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,010
to get a pediatric oncologist
to come over

593
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,410
during a pandemic as well.

594
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,720
I have an expert in mind.

595
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,050
If we can get him here,

596
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,530
there'll be hope for the boy.

597
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,840
I'm done with the paperwork.

598
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,320
Dr. Ning,

599
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,570
please save Ning Xiang.

600
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,320
Quiet.

601
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,240
Keep an eye on Ning Xiang.

602
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,360
- Let's talk somewhere else.
- Okay.

603
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,170
Follow me.

604
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,440
How did Ning Xiang fall?

605
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,010
I was busy with things that day.

606
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,480
I took my eyes off him for a second,

607
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,360
and he fell down the stairs.

608
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,530
If he hadn't fallen,

609
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,120
were you never going to realize
that his brain tumor had recurred?

610
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,320
No...

611
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
Didn't I tell you

612
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,650
that he needs to come back
for routine checkups,

613
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,570
and you need to watch him closely
for any signs of recurrence?

614
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,720
How do you call yourself a mother?

615
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,480
No, I...

616
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,930
He usually seemed fine.

617
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,570
With the pandemic,

618
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,720
it's not good
to go to the hospital too often.

619
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,290
I sent him to the hospital
right after he fell.

620
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,840
The doctor examined him

621
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,050
and said

622
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,170
his brain tumor had recurred.

623
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,530
I've told you this before.

624
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,080
The second his tumor recurs,

625
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
it will develop rapidly.

626
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,010
And there's a high chance
it will spiral out of control!

627
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,720
Did you not understand me?

628
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,770
Dr. Ning.

629
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,480
What should I do now?

630
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,570
Please save him.

631
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,530
Of course, I will.

632
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,240
Dr. Ning.

633
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,300
(Beiya Hospital)

634
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,570
Go and eat something.

635
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,810
No, I have no appetite.

636
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,090
Go and get some rest, then.

637
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,130
I'll look after him.

638
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,200
No need.

639
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,880
I want him to see me

640
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,850
the moment he wakes up.

641
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,880
Juan went to raise money.

642
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,290
She feels really guilty.

643
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
She's blaming herself for everything.

644
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,920
She should've done it sooner.

645
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,200
Dr. Ning! Dr. Ning!

646
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,290
Can...

647
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,530
Can you operate on Ning Xiang?

648
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,090
Listen to me.

649
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,200
The medulloblastoma
that Ning Xiang has been afflicted with

650
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
is a malignant tumor.

651
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,090
The tumor is closely connected
to the brain stem.

652
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,610
If it is surgically removed,

653
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,050
there's a high risk
of serious functional disorder

654
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,290
and even brain death.

655
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,440
What do you mean by functional disorder?

656
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,770
It could be

657
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
speech and language impairment,

658
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
or visual impairment.

659
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,530
And in more severe cases...

660
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,920
Paralysis.

661
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,130
He might even enter a vegetative state.

662
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,130
Then... Then tell me...

663
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:56,960
Tell me...

664
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,570
What are his chances of survival?

665
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,810
I can't answer that.

666
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,050
For the individual,
it's a zero-sum situation.

667
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,920
But you're his mother.

668
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,610
You need to make the call

669
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,330
and sign the consent form
for the procedure.

670
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,240
I'll sign it.

671
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,810
Can you

672
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
perform the surgery?

673
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,370
No.

674
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,880
Dr. Ning!

675
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,290
I'm on my knees.

676
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,480
Please save him.

677
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,960
Please save him.

678
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,810
I came to you
because I wanted you to do it.

679
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,050
I can't think of anyone else
in this world

680
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,090
who can save him.

681
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,290
Please save him.

682
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,370
I'm begging you, Dr. Ning.

683
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,200
I want to save Ning Xiang

684
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,010
just as much as you do.

685
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,010
My feelings for him

686
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,680
will affect

687
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,680
my objective judgement
during the operation.

688
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,640
I'm not a suitable candidate
to perform his surgery.

689
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,090
He's so young.

690
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,610
How could you bear to do this?

691
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,700
(Outpatient Clinic)

692
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,850
Don't move.
Let me take a good look at you.

693
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,130
It is you!

694
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,480
You deliver food to me every day

695
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,200
wearing a military coat.

696
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,480
Are you tired?

697
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,850
Yes.

698
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,530
Ya.

699
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,770
You're probably not used
to hearing that from me.

700
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,610
Well.

701
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,010
Can you try to get used to it?

702
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,200
Because I want

703
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,240
to keep calling you that from now on.

704
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,330
I used to call you Ms. Tan Ya

705
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,330
because I didn't think
I was a reliable guy.

706
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,400
I didn't think I deserved that right.

707
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,680
Well,

708
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm a reliable guy now, right?

709
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,050
So...

710
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,130
Will you give me a chance

711
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,720
to cook for you for the rest of my life?

712
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,440
No need to answer that right away.

713
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,920
I'll leave your food here.

714
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,770
Remember to eat it.

715
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,240
No need to give me an answer.

716

(Early detection, reporting,
diagnosis, isolation and treatment)

717

(Emergency Department)

718
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,260
(Beiya Hospital)

719
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,200
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

720
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,810
Dad

721
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,640
didn't want you guys to know
because he didn't want

722
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,330
you guys to be upset.

723
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,530
So...

724
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,720
He tried to keep it from you guys
as long as he could.

725
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
Is there no hope left for him?

726
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,960
What about a specialist?

727
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,330
We tried.

728
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,400
It's in the late stage.

729
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,530
Surgery?

730
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,440
He already has multiple metastases.

731
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,010
Surgery.

732
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,850
Chemotherapy.

733
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Medication.

734
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,240
He said no to all of them.

735
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,480
Because he didn't want
to go through all that suffering.

736
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,530
Is there really no other way?
