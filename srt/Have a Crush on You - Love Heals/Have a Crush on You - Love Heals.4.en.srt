Ding, get ready.

4
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:44,142
We'll head to
the Outpatient Department later.

5
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,182
Okay, Mr. Qian.

6
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:46,581
Wu,

7
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:47,701
how many surgeries do we have today?

8
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:48,422
Two.

9
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,581
Join me for the surgeries later.

10
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:50,661
Yes, Mr. Ning.

11
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:51,782
What about me?

12
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,581
I'll talk to you

13
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,021
once I'm done with the surgeries.

14
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:05,062
Dr. Ruan,

15
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:05,822
come here for a second.

16
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:06,502
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,261
Get me some water.

18
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:15,901
Mr. Ning,

19
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,701
I'll follow Mr. Qian
to the Outpatient Department now.

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,062
Mr. Ning,

21
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,541
what are my tasks for today?

22
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:27,222
Translate this neurosurgery thesis.

23
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,062
And, type these medical histories

24
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,862
into the computer.

25
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,942
Bring the medical consumables required
on Wednesday

26
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,142
to the material room.

27
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:37,662
Wu, let's go.

28
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:38,261
Okay.

Services, Meticulous Care)

32
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:23,981
Dr. Ning.

33
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,261
Why did you follow me here?

34
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,422
You said my brain was fine.

35
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:31,621
What did you mean by that?

36
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,142
Didn't I explain it to you already?

37
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:34,981
Judging from the images

38
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,981
produced by the CT scan,

39
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,901
your brain is perfectly fine.

40
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,662
If so, why can't I sleep?

41
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,541
I couldn't sleep no matter what.

42
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,341
It's definitely not related
to your brain.

43
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:46,621
In the future,

44
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,261
you should head to the
Outpatient Department for a diagnosis

45
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:49,302
instead of the washroom.

46
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,502
Dr. Ning,

47
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,701
I didn't mean to offend you.

48
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,502
Dr. Ning.

49
00:03:58,101 --> 00:03:59,541
I've already explained it to you.

50
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,382
You're not sick.

51
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,302
Dr. Ning, I'm sick.

52
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:04,181
This is the doctor's office.

53
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,101
Do not follow me inside.

54
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,382
I can't sleep every night!

55
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,142
It feels terrible!

56
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,382
Dr. Ning!

57
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:11,782
What's the matter? Do you need anything?

58
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,782
Are you a doctor?

59
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:15,741
Are you a neurosurgeon too?

60
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:17,262
That's right.

61
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,021
Please take a look at this for me.

62
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,982
Please tell me if I'm sick or not.

63
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,702
What do you think? Am I sick?

64
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,062
Judging from the images,

65
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,461
you look fine.

66
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:39,062
If so, why do I suffer from insomnia
every night?

67
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,062
I suffer from headaches too.

68
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:41,461
Sometimes, I even feel like puking.

69
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,141
When I searched for my symptoms online,

70
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:44,901
it said that I had a brain tumor.

71
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:48,421
Have you asked Mr. Ning about
your condition?

72
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,262
What did he say?

73
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:50,062
He said I'm fine.

74
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,301
He didn't give me any medicine too.

75
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,181
He's one of the best in our field.

76
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:55,382
You're not sick when he says you're not.

77
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,861
Shouldn't you be relieved to hear that?

78
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,301
Even so, he can at least
give me some medicine.

79
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,502
I can't sleep right now.

80
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:04,662
Hello, Mr. Ning.

81
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:09,741
Mr. Ning,

82
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,102
please review
this case for me.

83
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,102
Coming.

84
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,181
Mr. Ning, here.

85
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:23,861
I don't understand this part.

86
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:25,502
Place this case history

87
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,222
and the X-ray film at my table later.

88
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,021
Okay.

89
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,341
Organize this report for me.

90
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:42,461
I think you're suffering

91
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,222
from insomnia because of your troubles.

92
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,861
Have you encountered
any stressful events lately?

93
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,861
My wife wants to get a divorce.

94
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,461
My son will be attending
high school soon.

95
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,581
And, my dog gave birth to seven puppies.

96
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,102
Our neighbor came to borrow
vinegar

97
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,181
for the dumplings.

98
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,021
Even now, he hasn't returned it to me.

99
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,222
I've been fretting about them

100
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,542
all day long.

101
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,141
- I can't stop thinking about them.
- Hello, Mr. Ning?

102
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,102
Come to my office.

103
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,062
I need to talk to you.

104
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,222
Alright, I'll head upstairs now.

105
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:04,702
Doctor, can you give me some medicine?

106
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,382
Can you please give me some medicine?

107
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,581
I'm sorry. I have to go.

108
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,461
I'll head upstairs first.

109
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,102
Doctor,

110
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,741
can I not
look for Dr. Ning in the future?

111
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:12,102
Can I look for you instead?

112
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:13,702
You can look for me anytime
if you have any questions.

113
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:14,542
Okay.

114
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:16,102
It's not a big deal.

115
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:17,782
Communicate with your wife more often

116
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,102
and try to resolve
the misunderstandings.

117
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,581
And, try to avoid taking sleeping pills.

118
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,621
There's a side effect to it,
and you'll become dependent on it.

119
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,062
May you sleep well tonight.

120
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,222
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

121
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:26,102
You're truly a nice person.

122
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:26,901
Dr. Ruan.

123
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,382
Mr. Ning, were you looking for me?

124
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,102
What were you doing out there?

125
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,861
I encountered a troubled patient.

126
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:41,982
I was free anyway.

127
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,502
I had a chat with him.

128
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,461
Have you finished moving
all the medical consumables?

129
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,181
I have.

130
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:47,181
Have you translated the thesis?

131
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:49,861
I've sent it to your mailbox.

132
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:50,782
Please check it.

133
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,861
Where did you learn your
English for Medicine?

134
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:04,982
Did you even pass the subject?

135
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:07,702
I got 85 points.

136
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:08,662
I was the third in class.

137
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,181
Objective to surgery, neuronavigation.

138
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,102
It should be the neuronavigation system.

139
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:14,901
You knew the term, right?

140
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,021
Why did you ask me to translate it then?

141
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,262
I was afraid that
you might not understand.

142
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:19,662
How's the progress
with the medical histories?

143
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:21,662
I haven't finished them yet.

144
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,621
How dare you chat with a patient then?

145
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:24,782
Do you take yourself as a priestess now?

146
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,382
He was emotionally affected.

147
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:29,982
Remember this.

148
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,421
Doctors are only
responsible for giving diagnoses,

149
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:32,581
not counseling sessions.

150
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:37,341
Mr. Ning,

151
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:38,822
sometimes, I think the patients

152
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:39,621
just want us

153
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,901
to comfort them.

154
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,621
He followed you all the way
to the restroom.

155
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,062
Can't you just tell him something nice?

156
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:46,861
Great timing.

157
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,341
Both of the newcomers are here.

158
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:49,421
I'll emphasize this again.

159
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:51,581
Remember not to
be too close with your patients.

160
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,421
But why?

161
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:54,021
So you can work better.

162
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,621
Mr. Ning,

163
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:57,421
I think you're putting me
on the spot here.

164
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,942
I have to move so many things.

165
00:07:58,982 --> 00:07:59,861
And, I have to translate a thesis.

166
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:01,062
I don't have time
for the medical histories.

167
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:02,262
How many medical histories
have you recorded?

168
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:04,062
One-third of them.

00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,262
This is delayed intracranial hematoma,

172
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,861
one of the medical histories
you recorded.

173
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:17,822
Tell me

174
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,581
the reason and the process
of the onset.

175
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:24,461
After the patient's brain was damaged,

176
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:25,741
no hematoma was detected

177
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:26,461
after the first CT scan.

178
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:28,141
Did you even understand my question?

179
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:31,301
Dr. Ruan, I hope you can

180
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,541
bring your brain to work next time.

181
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,101
I need an assistant,

182
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,262
not a typewriter.

183
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,301
As an inexperienced neurosurgeon,

184
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,702
the tasks you're doing have their
own meanings to them.

185
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:42,181
Understood?

186
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,541
Don't put on so much lipstick
in the hospital.

187
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:54,702
Everyone, listen up.

188
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,741
From tomorrow onward,

189
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,781
Dr. Ruan alone will be in charge

190
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:58,022
of moving the medical consumables.

191
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:58,981
Got it.

192
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,621
Now, we'll summarize the performance
of our residents

193
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:13,181
and medical interns.

194
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:16,262
Let's talk about Dr. Ding, a resident.

195
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:19,262
For the past month,

196
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,981
not only can Dr. Ding Yiyuan
assist the chief physician

197
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:22,342
to complete his outpatient duty,

198
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:25,181
but she's also the head assistant
for five surgeries.

199
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,661
She performed well.

200
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:27,541
Give her a big hand.

201
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:29,342
Do not get ahead of yourself.

202
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:30,301
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

203
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:32,582
Let's talk about Dr. Ruan.

204
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:34,902
Outpatient duty,

205
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,022
none.

206
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:39,502
Surgery duty,

207
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,741
none.

208
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:50,702
Dr. Ruan,

209
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,421
although there's a difference
between you and Dr. Ding,

210
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,541
I believe that you can

211
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:57,462
definitely catch up to her.

212
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:00,462
Alright!

213
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,462
Let's keep up the good work.

214
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:03,582
Time to go on our rounds.

215
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:04,621
Let's go.

216
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:15,861
How are you? Do you
feel uncomfortable anywhere?

217
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:16,661
No.

218
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,582
How's your appetite?

219
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:19,462
It's fine.

220
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,421
What about your body temperature?

221
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:21,382
It's normal.

222
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:22,942
Modify the antibiotic

223
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:23,861
according to her allergies.

224
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,661
You must take note not to let him

225
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:28,621
exert too much strength during
the excretion process.

226
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,342
How long has he been sleeping?

227
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,462
It's been quite some time.

228
00:10:32,822 --> 00:10:33,181
Arrange a head

229
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,142
and chest CT scan for him.

230
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,502
Change the Mannitol dosage
to 250ml,

231
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,462
q12h.

232
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:37,181
Alright.

233
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,462
Did you jot it down?

234
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,382
Mr. Ning, we need to do a ward handover.

235
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:54,382
Alright, I'll be there soon.

236
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:55,342
You can go ahead.

237
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:03,221
Mr. Ning, can I get off work now?

238
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,781
Ask Dr. Qian.

239
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,661
Don't ask me.

240
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,900
(Beiya Hospital)

241
00:11:58,462 --> 00:11:59,781
Get in. I'll send you home.

242
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,781
It's fine. I can take the subway.

243
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:03,101
I need to speak with you.

244
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:19,822
What's with the long face?

245
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,101
Are you going to continue your lecture?

246
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,421
We've been together for quite some time.

247
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,181
You should know the things I like

248
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:27,342
and the things I don't.

249
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:28,702
Don't buy braised meat and

250
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:29,421
sweet and sour pork ribs
for me in the future.

251
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,142
I don't like sweet food.

252
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:31,142
I didn't buy them for you.

253
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,342
Take note of it next time.

254
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,022
When can I perform outpatient duty
and surgeries?

255
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:39,822
When I think you're ready.

256
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,661
I've reviewed your suture techniques

257
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:42,541
during the last surgery.

258
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,661
You need more practice.

259
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:45,861
It's because I didn't
perform well last time.

260
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,541
Why didn't you perform well?

261
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:51,181
I was a little nervous.

262
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:53,142
Why were you nervous then?

263
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,342
Because you were beside me.

264
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,101
Why were you thinking about me

265
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,062
instead of focusing on your work?

266
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,142
Who said I was thinking about you?

267
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,462
Stop looking for excuses.

268
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:01,022
Do you know what you're doing?

269
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,142
You're blaming others
for your own mistake here.

270
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,942
Yeah, you're the mistake here.

271
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,181
What?

272
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,022
Move out of the way.
I need to take my stuff.

273
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,301
Have you turned into a child again?

274
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,822
You're actually taking
children's crackers?

275
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,421
I'm starving.

276
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:35,181
Don't break it. It belongs to my son.

277
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,462
You have a son already?

278
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:39,142
What's wrong with that?

279
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,181
Wait.

280
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,781
Why didn't you tell me that
you have a son?

281
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:43,861
Why should I

282
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:44,541
tell you?

283
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:45,861
What has that got to do with you?

284
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:48,661
What are you doing?

285
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,221
I'm getting off.

286
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,382
What are you saying?

287
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,861
I'm home. Thanks for the ride.

288
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,062
How old is your son?

289
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,181
Six.

290
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,022
Did you have him
before or after our divorce?

291
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:53,301
Before our divorce.

292
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,181
I mean, after our divorce.

293
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,822
Your son is six when

294
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,062
we've been divorced for six years, huh?

295
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,022
You're pretty quick on your feet.

296
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,120
(2012 Jiangzhou, China)

297
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,022
What?

298
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:24,822
What did you say?

299
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,221
I want to get married.

300
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:28,502
Get married?

301
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,142
You don't even have a boyfriend.

302
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,462
Is this a blitz marriage?

303
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:32,902
I didn't have one before.

304
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,262
Now, I have one.

305
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,541
Who is it?

306
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,221
His name is Ning Zhiqian.

307
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,421
He's 27 years old this year.

308
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:40,221
He has a doctorate
at my medical faculty.

309
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,781
A doctorate?

310
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,582
Dad, all doctors have
receding hairlines.

311
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,142
Receding hairlines?

312
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:45,262
What does that mean?

313
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,702
That means he has less hair
than an old man.

314
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:49,181
He has thick hair.
Stop spouting nonsense.

315
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,301
Don't tell me he's an old man.

316
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:53,582
I remember now.

317
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,861
You said he is 27, right?

318
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:56,902
How tall is he?

319
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:58,382
Very tall.

320
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,342
Is he good-looking?

321
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:00,142
Very good-looking.

322
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:14,942
Be honest with me.

323
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,101
Are you pregnant?

324
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:18,421
Liuzheng,

325
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,022
Mom asked
if you were pregnant.

326
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,621
I'll kill you!

327
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:22,462
- Return to your room.
- What did you say?

328
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:23,221
Return to your room!

329
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:24,101
Can't I even ask you that?

330
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,142
Come here!

331
00:16:28,181 --> 00:16:29,221
Stand straight.

332
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:32,702
Be honest with me.

333
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,781
Are you pregnant?

334
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:34,902
No.

335
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,981
Our daughter wouldn't
do something like that.

336
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:38,582
We did nothing.

337
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,942
Look at you. You're only 23 years old.

338
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,101
Why the rush?

339
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,621
You'll be missing out on better partners

340
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:44,942
if you want to tie the knot now.

341
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:49,541
I thought you said you wanted
to study overseas?

342
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,661
That's right.

343
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,181
We wish to settle down
as soon as possible.

344
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,541
And, getting married
won't affect me from pursuing my study.

345
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:55,981
Look at her.

346
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:56,421
You have a point.

347
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,301
You're talking back to Mom again.

348
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:00,142
Mom is right.

349
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:01,942
You'll be worthless
if you go through a divorce.

350
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:02,942
Listen up.

351
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:05,141
You better stay out of my affairs!

352
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,301
- Get out!
- Look at him.

353
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,222
Just leave!

354
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:08,982
- Get out!
- Stop it!

355
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:10,181
Ruan Liuzheng, come here.

356
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,982
I don't understand

357
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:15,942
why you're in a hurry to get married.

358
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,661
You have plenty of chances
in the future.

359
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,381
You can...

360
00:17:19,462 --> 00:17:20,622
He's here. I'll get the door.

361
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,342
No!

362
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,622
Don't go. I'll get it.

363
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,222
He's already at the door.

364
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,582
It'll be rude for us
not to get the door for him.

365
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:26,541
She's already bringing him here?

366
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,102
This is ridiculous.

367
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,021
He's already at the door.

368
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:29,381
We should let him come inside first.

369
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:29,702
Mom!

370
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:30,781
We have to let him in somehow...

371
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,222
Hello, Mister, Madam.

372
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:39,301
Please come inside.

373
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,062
Go ahead.

374
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:45,901
I'm Ning Zhiqian.

375
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,021
I've prepared some gifts for you all.

376
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,222
Madam, this is yours.

377
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,141
He's good-looking, right?

378
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,582
Mister, this is for you.

379
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,781
His hair is thick too.

380
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:01,622
This must be mine.

381
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,501
Thanks.

382
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:05,982
Please have a seat.

383
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:11,062
Have a seat.

384
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,342
I'll get you a cup of water.

385
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:18,661
This is my mother.

386
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:19,301
Madam.

387
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,781
This is my father.

388
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:21,462
Mister.

389
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:22,102
- This is...
- I'm her little brother.

390
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:23,301
I'm Ruan Lang.

391
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:24,222
Nice to meet you.

392
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:26,021
Here's your water.

393
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:26,781
Thanks.

394
00:18:29,261 --> 00:18:31,661
When did you guys
get to know each other?

395
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,462
It's been quite some time.

396
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,261
I'm the tutor of their class.

397
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,141
So, you're technically her teacher?

398
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,222
That's pretty romantic.

399
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:42,622
We call him Ning in school.

400
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:46,901
So, when did you
start dating each other?

401
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:48,702
Not long ago.

402
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:49,942
Their love came in time.

403
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:51,942
Their relationship is...

404
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:55,342
If so, have your parents
met Liuzheng before?

405
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,702
My mother met her before.

406
00:18:58,862 --> 00:18:59,661
What did she think about her?

407
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:00,661
She likes her very much.

408
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:02,342
What does your mother do for a living?

409
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,102
My mother is a doctor too.

410
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,541
She went to Africa to
provide aid to them three months ago.

411
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:06,982
What about your father?

412
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,261
My parents divorced each other

413
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,301
when I was very young.

414
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,742
I rarely contact my father.

415
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,862
That doesn't really matter, does it?

416
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,021
I was just asking.

417
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:19,942
Yeah.

418
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,822
Let me introduce our family then.

419
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:25,181
I'm an educator.

420
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,661
We have a traditional family.

421
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:28,702
Of course,

422
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:31,181
I don't object to Liuzheng
being in a relationship.

423
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:32,781
However, it must be

424
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,062
based on marriage.

425
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,942
It shouldn't be for fun.

426
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,501
Understood?

427
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:39,501
Yes, Madam.

428
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:41,462
That's why I came here

429
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:42,501
to express my stand.

430
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,342
I've made up my mind to marry Liuzheng.

431
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:49,622
Where will you guys stay
after getting married?

432
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:50,901
My mother owns two houses.

433
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,702
She gave me one of them.

434
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:52,862
It's right beside the Second Ring Road.

435
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,141
I don't have any loans.

436
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:55,781
I bought a new car some time ago

437
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,702
so it was more convenient for me
to get to Beiya Hospital for work.

438
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:00,261
Do you mean that Beiya Hospital?

439
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:01,541
That's right.

440
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,901
I'm a resident of Beiya
Hospital's Department of Neurosurgery.

441
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:07,742
Ruan Lang!

442
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:08,582
get him some drinks.

443
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:13,062
When do you guys
plan to get married then?

444
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,102
Mister, Madam, you guys can decide that.

445
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,301
You see,

446
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,942
when it comes to marriage,

447
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:21,862
it should be...

448
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:22,781
The sooner, the better.

449
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,822
A long delay may cause issues.

450
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,181
They're afraid that
you might not marry my sister

451
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,342
after you sober up.

452
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,021
This headphone is pretty good.

453
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,261
This headphone is great.

454
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:37,261
Thank you.

455
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,661
Dad, check out your gift.

456
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:41,582
Okay.

457
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:42,381
Mom, you too.

458
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:43,381
Let me see.

459
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:46,661
A thermos cup?

460
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,381
This is a thoughtful gift indeed.

461
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:50,582
I feel warm.

462
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:52,421
Please have some water.

463
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:04,901
Say, the water tastes different

464
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:05,742
when you drink with this cup.

465
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:06,261
Yeah, right?

466
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,462
It's dinner time.

467
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:11,261
How about this?

468
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:12,862
I'll treat you guys to a meal outside.

469
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:14,501
Are you muddle-headed?

470
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,622
We're a family now.

471
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,742
We should eat at home.

472
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,661
You're right.

473
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:18,862
Mister, Madam, don't trouble yourselves.

474
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,742
I still need to work
the night shift later.

475
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,342
I have to go soon.

476
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,982
Why don't I prepare some food for you?

477
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,781
It's fine.

478
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:25,501
Please don't trouble yourself.

479
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,702
There's a canteen in the hospital.

480
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,501
You should visit us often later.

481
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:29,702
Sure.

482
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,501
I'll be going now.

483
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,181
Ruan Lang, come out and
see our guest off.

484
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:33,901
Mom, don't call him here.

485
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:34,381
Yes, Mom?

486
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:35,582
Go back to your room.

487
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:37,021
Yeah, back to your room.

488
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:37,661
Goodbye.

489
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:38,501
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

490
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:39,541
- Goodbye.
- I'll make something nice for you

491
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,501
when you visit us next time.

492
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,781
Sure.

493
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:43,702
I'll take you as my brother-in-law then!

494
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:45,982
Goodbye.

495
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:46,901
Goodbye, Mister, Madam.

496
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:48,622
Visit us often!

497
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:49,661
- Visit us when you're free.
- Take care.

498
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,062
Look at how happy you are.

499
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,501
Can you lower your volume?

500
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,062
Look at him. He's tall and handsome.

501
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:02,021
Our daughter has great taste indeed.

502
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,582
I wonder who's the one
that nurtured her?

503
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:08,541
Ms. Pei, of course it's you.

504
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:11,342
She's a triple-A student.

505
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,942
Ms. Pei, you're a great teacher indeed.

506
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:32,301
Ning, I like you!

507
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:13,582
This isn't nice. Next.

508
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,982
I think this one is okay.

509
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:16,261
No, I didn't smile.

510
00:23:16,982 --> 00:23:18,141
This is nice.

511
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:20,982
This looks so stiff.

512
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:23,141
- Look at your hands.
- You can proceed.

513
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:24,421
I need to answer a call
from the hospital.

514
00:23:25,222 --> 00:23:26,062
Okay.

515
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:27,301
You can take your time with them.

516
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:28,141
I need to use the washroom.

517
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:28,901
I'll be back in a second.

518
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:30,181
Alright, go ahead.

519
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,301
Did you see that girl just now?

520
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:46,541
What's the matter?

521
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,942
I remember she wasn't the girl
who came here to pick the wedding gown.

522
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:51,421
He found himself
another fiancee already?

523
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,622
It's obvious that the guy was

524
00:23:54,622 --> 00:23:55,702
much more concerned about the last girl.

525
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:57,901
Alright, let's not talk about it.
I need to get back to work.

526
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,540
(Dong)

527
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:05,342
Dong?

528
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:08,982
I'm in the middle of
a wedding photoshoot.

529
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:17,862
I'll go and look for you then.

530
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:19,181
Goodbye.

531
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,141
I heard that you two
are getting married.

532
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:27,222
That's right.

533
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,942
Why do you think he's marrying you?

534
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:37,742
Is there love between you two?

535
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,181
I love him.

536
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:42,901
But does he love you?

537
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:48,501
Liuzheng,

538
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,862
don't you think he's treating you
as my replacement?

539
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:56,862
I didn't call you out today

540
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,301
to criticize you.

541
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:00,781
I'm not jealous of you either.

542
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,862
I just want you to think twice.

543
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:04,781
In an unequal relationship,

544
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:08,501
the person who devotes herself
to the other will be hurt the most.

545
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:13,622
I've hurt Zhiqian.

546
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:15,661
I don't want him to hurt other people.

547
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,261
He won't hurt me.

548
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:22,462
I know.

549
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:24,822
Zhiqian is a nice man.

550
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:26,181
But Liuzheng,

551
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:28,462
you aren't too bad yourself.

552
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:32,781
A perfect relationship consists of
both parties loving each other

553
00:25:33,062 --> 00:25:34,462
as equals.

554
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,822
I hope you can remember my words.

555
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:46,381
Right after I joined the law firm,

556
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,381
my mentor showed me

557
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,222
dozens of divorce cases in one go.

558
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:50,462
I doubted my life decisions after that.

559
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,381
Do you think I'll get a brain tumor

560
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,141
just because I see them all day?

561
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,301
Stop talking back.

562
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,781
You just want to tell me
that I will have a divorce,

563
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,301
right?

564
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,261
I didn't say that.

565
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:00,381
Don't tell me you don't wish
to get married?

566
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:01,661
Of course I do.

567
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:03,301
Don't tell me you don't wish
to settle down?

568
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:04,222
I...

569
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,021
Mainly, my mother likes her too.

570
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:09,541
She told me not to miss out on

571
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,822
a girl who is

572
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,702
this nice to me.

573
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:14,381
Will you be nice to her then?

574
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,901
Of course I will.

575
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:17,462
Will you like her as much

576
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:18,862
as you like Dong Miaomiao then?

577
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:22,742
Love can be cultivated.

578
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:23,901
I don't believe you.

579
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:25,301
I couldn't care less.

580
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:26,102
Hurry up.

581
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,900
(Bliss)

582
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,342
Hey.

583
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,021
You're getting married tomorrow,

584
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:43,181
yet Ning Zhiqian isn't here
to help you out?

585
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,222
He's at the hospital.
He's busy with his work.

586
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,702
I sure hope he won't be busy tomorrow.

587
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:52,261
Done!

588
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:57,381
Mrs. Ning.

589
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,342
Let me tell you something.

590
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:05,021
Lately, a patient's relative

591
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:06,222
has been courting me.

592
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,661
His name is Jiang Cheng.

593
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:09,661
What does he look like?
Do you have a picture of him? Show me.

594
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:12,702
He's very cute.

595
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:15,062
He's just like Monchhichi.

596
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:16,342
And, I can tell

597
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,462
he's a househusband.

598
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:20,021
He calls me every day.

599
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:22,501
He buys flowers for me
whenever he comes to the hospital.

600
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,421
He also buys snacks for me.

601
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:26,421
Seems like

602
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:27,862
you've fallen for him.

603
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:30,702
You know?

604
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:32,141
One time, during my night shift,

605
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:33,381
I was especially hungry.

606
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:34,901
I wanted to have some garlic crayfish.

607
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:35,982
Guess what happened?

608
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:40,102
Did he order crayfish for you?

609
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,901
He drove to the hospital
and delivered it to me personally.

610
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:44,661
He delivered it all the way
to the duty office.

611
00:27:44,661 --> 00:27:45,982
He even peeled them for me.

612
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:48,261
It would've been perfect if he fed me.

613
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,222
He's that considerate?

614
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,141
If you wish to get married that badly,

615
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,102
I'll toss the bouquet to you tomorrow.

616
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,181
Who said I wanted to get married?

617
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,381
If you want to toss it to me,

618
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:08,742
you better aim it properly.

619
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:11,421
I shall be accurate with my aim.

620
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:16,021
How dare you throw that at me?

621
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,541
How dare you?

622
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:29,381
Hello?

623
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:30,742
I just got off work.

624
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,222
It must've been tough on you.

625
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:33,301
Not at all.

626
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:35,661
Rest early then. See you tomorrow.

627
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,421
So, tomorrow...

628
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,280
(Don't you think he's treating you
as my replacement?)

629
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:15,982
In an unequal relationship,

630
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:19,622
the person who devotes herself
to the other will be hurt the most.

631
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,210
(A perfect relationship consists of
both parties loving each other)

632
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,640
(as equals.)

633
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,330
(Dear John University School
of Medicine,)

634
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:46,462
(this is Ruan Liuzheng.)

635
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,570
(After careful consideration,)

636
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,381
(I decided to give up
on the opportunity)

637
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,622
(to study for a Master's degree.)

638
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,050
(Thank you for the opportunity.)

639
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:10,622
Liuzheng.

640
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,541
Where is she?

641
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,622
Jianzhong,

642
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:19,742
did you see our daughter?

643
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:21,702
What's the matter? I didn't see her.

644
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,862
Where did she go?

645
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,021
Liuzheng?

646
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,141
Liuzheng!

647
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,781
Mom, why are you shouting
this early in the morning?

648
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:29,781
Your sister is missing!

649
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,541
Is she a runaway bride?

650
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:37,982
That's pretty cool.

651
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,582
Mister, can you drive faster?

652
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:43,862
What time is your flight?

653
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:44,622
8am.

654
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,062
Alright, sit tight.

655
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,700
(Entrance)

656
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:58,942
Dong!

657
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:00,342
Dong.

658
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:01,622
Liuzheng?

659
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,541
Right now, we don't love each other
deeply,

660
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,661
and we're not equals.

661
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:07,462
However, perfect love

662
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,062
doesn't exist in this world.

663
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,541
I might not be his best choice,

664
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:14,141
but I will do all I can to love him.

665
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,261
I will make sure he falls for me.

666
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:17,982
We will definitely be happy.

667
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,102
Goodbye, Dong.

668
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:20,982
Safe trip ahead.

689
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,462
Thank you, my dear.

690
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,421
I thought you were Tan Ya.

691
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:16,982
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

692
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,901
You have 15 minutes for the meal.

693
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:21,582
What's wrong?

694
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:23,541
Attend outpatient duty with me
this afternoon.

695
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,381
Me?

696
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:35,661
You have two minutes left.

697
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:36,982
You can go to the restroom first.

698
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:38,622
That's fine. I don't feel like going.

699
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:39,822
Don't drink too much water.

700
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:40,702
Why?

701
00:33:40,942 --> 00:33:42,062
You won't have time to use the restroom.

702
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:45,421
It's not like I haven't done this
in West District Hospital before.

703
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:46,982
It's different here.

704
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,381
I suggest you prepare
some adult diapers.

705
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:51,901
Do you need them?

706
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:55,062
Dr. Ning is here.

707
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,181
Doctor.

708
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:56,582
Dr. Ning.

709
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:57,261
Please wait here.

710
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:02,261
Dr. Wu,

711
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,501
where did Mr. Ning go?

712
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:05,421
He's performing outpatient duty
with his new student.

713
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:08,981
New student?

714
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:10,422
Who is it?

715
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:11,662
Of course it's Dr. Ruan.

716
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:12,941
Mr. Ning actually took her in?

717
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,221
There are four steps to becoming
Mr. Ning's student.

718
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:18,382
Doing chores, performing outpatient
duty, and performing surgeries.

719
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:19,501
That's what I went through.

720
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:23,062
Doing chores, performing outpatient
duty, and performing surgeries?

721
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:24,981
What's the fourth step then?

722
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:26,862
Take a guess.

723
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:27,862
Take a guess?

724
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,461
Forget it.

725
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:30,582
I'll have them myself.

726
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,342
Dr. Ding, you bought a lot of food.

727
00:34:33,382 --> 00:34:34,021
Did you buy my share too?

728
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:35,142
Yeah, join me.

729
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,261
- Coming.
- Come and join me.

730
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,301
Come on. Let's eat.

732
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,221
You can call their numbers now.

733
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:43,920
Okay.

(Beiya Hospital, Ning Zhiqian)

735
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:46,422
I'm the first patient!

736
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,021
Wait!

737
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,142
Please line up.

738
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,062
What's going on? Please keep quiet.

739
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:56,662
Your recovery is going pretty well.

740
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,541
Is that so?

741
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,021
There's no issue here.

742
00:34:59,182 --> 00:34:59,902
Remember, come back

743
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:01,461
for a checkup once every month.

744
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,822
I feel like I'm becoming
more and more forgetful.

745
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:06,781
Is this because of

746
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,781
the side effect?

747
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,662
No, this is normal.

748
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:12,142
Do not be stressed out by it.

749
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:12,941
Take your medicine on time.

750
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:13,622
Next.

751
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:14,582
Take your medical record with you.

752
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,501
Okay.

753
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:17,981
My head hurts lately.

754
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,301
I can't sleep at night.

755
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:21,182
And, my vision is blurry at night.

756
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:22,662
Blurry vision?

757
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:24,062
Remove your glasses.

758
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:27,981
Look into my eyes.

759
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:28,981
Can you see my fingers?

760
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:29,781
I can.

761
00:35:30,182 --> 00:35:31,342
It's not a big issue then.

762
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,102
Did you go for plastic surgery lately?

763
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,142
You're a neurosurgeon, right?

764
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,261
I don't think you should
interfere with my personal life.

765
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,261
You have to tell the doctor

766
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,501
about what you've done lately.

767
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:41,142
Only then, he'll be able to
give you an accurate diagnosis.

768
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:43,062
Mister, where do you feel uncomfortable?

769
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:47,422
I feel dizzy and bloated.

770
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:48,382
Does your head hurt then?

771
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:49,182
Yeah, it hurts.

772
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:51,182
Straighten your arms for me.

773
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,541
Mister, please stand up.

774
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:56,781
Slowly.

775
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,422
Do some steps for me.

776
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,461
Alright.

777
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:06,221
Mister, sit down.

778
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,902
This might be peripheral neuropathy.

779
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:11,102
I'll give you a...

780
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:12,301
Doctor, what did you say just now?

781
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:14,021
I have peripheral neuropathy?

782
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:14,862
Yes, that's what I suspect.

783
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,382
Please go for an X-ray scan first.

784
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,062
I'll give you a prescription later.

785
00:36:27,221 --> 00:36:28,741
Judging from the image,
it doesn't look like a huge issue.

786
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:30,981
You may opt for conservative treatment.

787
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:32,382
Next.

788
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:35,501
Doctor, I think the surgery

789
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,541
wasn't done cleanly.

790
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,941
I think it wasn't removed entirely.

791
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:40,461
It looks pretty clean to me.

792
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,021
Do you have a better X-ray scan here?

793
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:45,261
It's best if you can
scan his entire body.

794
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,541
The cost doesn't matter.

795
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,822
Give us the costliest treatment.

796
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:54,382
His name is Ning Zhiqian.

797
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:55,662
Doctor!

798
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,422
I traveled for over two hours

799
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:58,182
just to come here.

800
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,021
Doctor, please register
my number for me.

801
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:00,902
Can you register a number for me?

802
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,382
Please wait here.

803
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:03,701
Sorry for the trouble.

804
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:04,582
Doctor,

805
00:37:04,582 --> 00:37:06,422
this illness of mine
is killing me.

806
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:07,182
Please take a look.

807
00:37:17,182 --> 00:37:18,741
Doctor, please help us out.

808
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,461
It won't take you too long
to register a number for us.

809
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,221
Yeah, I'm begging you here.

810
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,701
Please.

811
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,541
My illness is killing me.

812
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:25,981
Ran,

813
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:26,981
Mr. Ning is still around, right?

814
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:28,221
Register their numbers for them.

815
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:28,981
Alright, I got it.

816
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:30,342
Register a number for me too.

817
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:30,981
Over here.

818
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:32,701
Over here.

819
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,221
I was right to tell you
not to drink too much, right?

820
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,301
Pack your things and get ready to leave.

821
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,021
I don't think we can leave yet.

822
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:44,261
I might need to take up
some of your time.

823
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:45,021
What's wrong?

824
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:46,781
Two patients didn't register
their numbers in time.

825
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,382
They've been begging me for so long.

826
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:50,261
I took my own initiative and

827
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,382
registered their numbers for them.

828
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:53,501
You should give them a diagnosis then.

829
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,142
Since you registered it for them,

830
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:58,062
you should do it.

831
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:02,941
Deputy Manager Ning,

832
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:03,582
I registered their numbers for them.

833
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,182
Deputy Manager Ning.

834
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,021
Madam, I came here first.

835
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:05,822
You guys should wait.

836
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:06,221
Wait.

837
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,301
Give me your medical record.

838
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:08,461
Please wait outside.

839
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,622
Deputy Manager Ning,
it's been reacting strongly lately.

840
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:24,301
Mr. Ning, thank you for your hard work.

841
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:26,902
Head Nurse, you're still here?

842
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:27,862
- That's pretty rare.
- Are you getting off work?

843
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:30,622
Let's get off work.

844
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:34,902
What's the matter?

845
00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:36,902
I registered two extra patients for him.

846
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:37,781
He was upset with it.

847
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,062
It's your first day performing
outpatient duty with him.

848
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:40,941
You don't understand what he's facing.

849
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:41,781
Forget about you.

850
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,662
He'll even be
upset with the president if he does so.

851
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,461
Why are there so many more patients here

852
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,261
compared to West District Hospital?

853
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:49,062
That's why you should try to
understand his feelings.

854
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:50,902
He's been doing this every day
for six years.

855
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:51,622
It's tough.

856
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:54,902
This is just the beginning.

857
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,382
You haven't even
stepped into the surgical theater yet.

858
00:38:56,382 --> 00:38:56,981
Let's go.

859
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:07,062
Dr. Ruan, you're still here?

860
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:08,541
I'm not done with my work yet.

861
00:39:09,741 --> 00:39:11,342
Dr. Ding, what about you?

862
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:13,182
I'm working overtime of my own accord.

863
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:14,862
I was planning to carpool with you.

864
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:16,622
Wu, you can carpool with me.

865
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:17,781
I'm going to pick up my son anyway.

866
00:39:18,662 --> 00:39:19,541
Forget it.

867
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:21,261
Mr. Ning, I won't trouble you.

868
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:22,461
I'll take the subway since it's near.

869
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:23,541
Suit yourself.

870
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:25,142
See you guys.

871
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:26,622
Goodbye.

872
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:27,622
Goodbye, Mr. Ning.

873
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:33,781
Say, how long will the two girls

874
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:35,342
in our department
compete with each other?

875
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,781
Dr. Qin, are you hungry?

876
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:47,822
No.

877
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:02,021
How old is Mr. Ning's child?

878
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:04,301
You can ask him yourself.

879
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,062
You don't know?

880
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,301
I thought you two were close.

881
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,701
You've been carpooling with him

882
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:11,941
for more than once.

883
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:13,701
We stay in the same area.

884
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:14,662
He was just sending me home
on his way back.

885
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:17,342
Don't carpool with him for no reason
in the future.

886
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:19,902
What's the matter?

887
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,062
Nothing. It just doesn't look good.

888
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,662
We've been together for quite some time.

889
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:26,701
You should

890
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:27,461
know the things I like

891
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:28,501
and the things I don't.

892
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,062
Do not buy braised meat and

893
00:40:30,062 --> 00:40:30,701
sweet and sour pork ribs
for me in the future.

894
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:31,741
I don't like sweet food.

895
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:34,941
What's with you buying lunch

896
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:35,902
for him every day then?

897
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:37,182
You're harming others

898
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:38,102
without benefiting yourself here.

899
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:39,461
I'm buying it for him of my own accord.

900
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:40,902
How am I harming others
without benefiting myself?

901
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,501
Wait, it was you?

902
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:44,501
If so, can you stop buying

903
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:46,501
sweet and sour pork ribs and
braised meat for him in the future?

904
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:48,461
He doesn't appreciate your effort.

905
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:50,902
And, he's blaming me for
buying the wrong food.

906
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:56,182
(Department of Neurosurgery,
come to the ER immediately.)

907
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,461
(Department of Neurosurgery,
come to the ER immediately.)

908
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,501
It hurts!

909
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:12,142
It hurts!

910
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:14,142
It hurts!

911
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,382
What's the situation?

912
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,382
He's 42 years old.

913
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:18,182
He came to Jiangzhou for a trip.

914
00:41:18,182 --> 00:41:19,862
He fell unconscious on the street
suddenly and was sent here.

915
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:20,822
Is it a case of cerebral cyst?

916
00:41:20,822 --> 00:41:21,822
Come, hold my hand.

917
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:23,142
My head hurts!

918
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:24,221
The intracranial pressure is too high.

919
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,102
Inject him with one dose of Mannitol.

920
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,301
Have you fallen down or

921
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:27,461
bumped your head lately?

922
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:28,261
No.

923
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:29,781
Are you sure?

924
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,701
Yes!

925
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,021
It does seem like
a case of cerebral cyst.

926
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:35,182
However, according to the patient,

927
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:36,582
there wasn't cerebral damage

928
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:37,582
of any kind in the past month.

929
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,021
It might be a case of congenital
intracranial arachnoidal cyst.

930
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:41,822
However, it won't cause severe headache

931
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:43,382
or increase intracranial pressure.

932
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,822
Doctor, it's hurting again!

933
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:45,781
Intracranial pressure
is increasing again.

934
00:41:46,382 --> 00:41:47,662
Inject him with
another dose of Mannitol.

935
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:48,862
No.

936
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,062
If you exceed the maximum dosage
of Mannitol in a short period,

937
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:52,382
kidney failure might occur.

938
00:41:52,382 --> 00:41:53,382
Don't you know that?

939
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:54,301
But the patient's life will be in danger

940
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:55,741
if we don't reduce
the intracranial pressure.

941
00:41:56,062 --> 00:41:57,541
Now, our priority is to
identify the cause.

942
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,102
I'll call Mr. Qian right now.

943
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:00,662
Doctor, my head hurts!

944
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:01,501
Doctor!

945
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:02,902
Where do you come from?

946
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:03,902
Inner Mongolia!

947
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:06,422
What do you do for a living?

948
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:07,422
I breed horses.

949
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:09,701
It might be a cerebral parasitic
disease.

950
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:10,662
He's a horse breeder.

951
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,342
He's most likely infected by
the horses' parasites.

952
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,422
Due to that, it formed a cerebral cyst.

953
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:16,501
When it grows to a certain extent,

954
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,062
it exceeds the skull's
pressure compensation capacity.

955
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,741
Thus, severe headache and

956
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,021
increased intracranial pressure
are detected.

957
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:22,021
Prepare for surgery.

958
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:24,342
What if that's not the case?

959
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,622
A normal cerebral cyst

960
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:27,221
doesn't require a surgery.

961
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:28,301
If we keep delaying it,

962
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,741
the intracranial pressure
will keep increasing.

963
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:30,741
I'm sure

964
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:32,261
it's a cerebral parasitic disease.

965
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,261
The patient is in a coma.

966
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:35,382
Prepare for the surgery.
