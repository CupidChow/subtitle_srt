3
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,960
Hello,

4
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,320
have you seen this patient around?

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,130
He went out.

6
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,770
When did he go out?

7
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,890
It's been some time.

8
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,170
Do you know where he went?

9
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,890
I don't.

10
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,130
Thank you.

11
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,530
Mr. Ning,

12
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,170
Du Xiaoyu is missing,

13
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,200
but his things are still here.

14
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,000
Have you searched all the places
he could possibly be in?

15
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,410
I have.

16
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,250
I couldn't find him.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Dr. Ruan,

18
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,970
you're in charge of Du Xiaoyu.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,690
You should've kept a close eye on him.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,610
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,330
I guess it makes sense.

22
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,760
You would rather spend your time

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,970
with a man like Xue Weilin.

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
What kind of man do you mean?

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
I can tell he's a playboy
at first glance.

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,170
What gives you the right
to say that about him?

27
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,560
I told Xiao'er to do
a background check on him.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,890
Why did you do that?

29
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,050
I was afraid that you might be
taken advantage of.

30
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,810
Seems like you're concerned about me.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,890
Dr. Ruan,

32
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,330
listen here.

33
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Xue has so many ex-girlfriends

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,760
that they can form a platoon.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,970
Do you wish to be the platoon leader?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Mr. Ning,

37
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,840
I know what to do
when it comes to making friends.

38
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,840
Please do not interfere

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
with my private life.

40
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,200
Besides,

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,760
I don't know
if he was a playboy in the past,

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,530
but he might be sincere to me.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,330
Mr. Ning, to you,

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,970
maybe I'm not attractive at all.

45
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,410
However, I might be somewhat attractive

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,000
to other guys.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
Did I hear something

48
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,280
that I wasn't supposed to?

49
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,480
Ning,

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm not criticizing you here.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,250
But look at your attitude.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
You've been a teacher for so long

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,690
that you sound like
you're scolding people when you talk.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,530
But Dr. Ruan,

55
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,560
Ning does make a good point there.

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,720
Indeed,

57
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,690
all the other guys in the world
are unreliable

58
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,200
except for him and me.

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,120
Enough.

60
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,920
Dr. Ruan, you should quickly

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
locate your patient.

62
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,480
And, can you stop interfering

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,200
with our affairs?

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,970
I was sleeping over there.

65
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,330
You two woke me up
with your conversation.

66
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,360
I found Du Xiaoyu.

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,760
He's on the rooftop. Come quickly.

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,410
Alright, I'll be there immediately.

69
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,840
Xiaoyu was found.

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,480
He's on the rooftop.

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
Xiaoyu,

72
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,730
what are you doing here?

73
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,570
Don't worry.

74
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,410
I'm not trying to commit suicide.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
You should come down first.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm practicing my dance here.

77
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,010
There's an international

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
modern dance contest in three months.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
I've already registered my name.

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,850
I've practiced this dance
for six months.

81
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,410
I wonder if I'll have the chance

82
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,160
to perform it in public.

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,090
Are you willing to be
my first batch of audience?

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,480
- Sure.
- We do

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,160
- Sure.
-We do.

86
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,810
You should come down first.

87
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,920
Come down first.

88
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,010
Your operation is tomorrow.

89
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,850
Go back and get some rest,

90
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,440
okay?

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,010
Come.

92
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,320
Let's go.

93
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,600
We're willing to be your audience.

94
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,920
Let's return to the ward.

95
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,090
Amazing!

96
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,640
You did great.

97
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That was so touching.

98
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,410
You were exceptional.

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,530
You were amazing.

100
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:48,970
- Yes.
- That's awesome.

101
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,490
Nice dance.

102
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,490
Why don't we take a group photo?

103
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,090
Okay?

104
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,490
Sure.

105
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,370
-Okay.
-Come on.

106
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,760
Come on.

107
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,440
On the count of three,

108
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,930
let's say "Xiaoyu, you can do it",

109
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,370
okay?

110
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,850
Three.

111
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,440
Two.

112
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,970
One.

113
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,320
-Xiaoyu, you can do it!
-Xiaoyu, you can do it!

114
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,120
Xiaoyu, you can do it!

115
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,730
You can do it!

116
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,440
You should have some.

117
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,300
(Operating room)

118
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,780
(Fire Hydrant)

119
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,290
(Operating room)

120
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,410
Verify the patient's details.

121
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,410
Name, Du Xiaoyu.

122
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Male, 25 years old.

123
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
Admission number, 031815.

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,800
We need to be prepared

125
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,050
for a long battle today,

126
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,000
because his tumor
is located on the brainstem

127
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,680
and it covers a wide area.

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,730
Su,

129
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,240
you have a tough mission today.

130
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,170
You must make sure

131
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,850
Du Xiaoyu's vital signs are stable.

132
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,680
Okay.

133
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,800
We have to do our best
to remove the tumor

134
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,880
while retaining his vital functions.

135
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,970
Vital signs.

136
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
Vital signs are normal.

137
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,370
Begin operation.

138
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,240
Poles.

139
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,970
Blood pressure is dropping.

140
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,680
How much?

141
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
80/50.

142
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,880
Heart rate?

143
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,370
45.

144
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,240
Suspend the operation.

145
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,490
Wait for him.

146
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,610
Blood pressure and heart rate
have returned to normal.

147
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,120
Proceed with the operation.

148
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,800
Periosteal elevator.

149
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,800
Nurse, wipe my sweat.

150
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,970
To the right.

151
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,560
On top of my eyes.

152
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,930
Thank you.

153
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,320
Blood pressure is dropping.

154
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,090
How much?

155
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,880
75/50.

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,680
Heart rate?

157
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,490
40.

158
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,970
It's still dropping.

159
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,370
Suspend the operation.

160
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,530
Su, think of something.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,490
I'll inject him
with a shot of adrenaline,

162
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,320
Atropine.

163
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,490
Du Xiaoyu, pull yourself together.

164
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,680
Du Xiaoyu, you can do it.

165
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,970
You want to dance, right?

166
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,290
Blood pressure and heart rate rebound.

167
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,290
I'll continue then.

168
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,490
(Operating Time)

169
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,610
Blood pressure is dropping again.

170
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,440
How much?

171
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,050
50/30.

172
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,730
Heart rate?

173
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
40.

174
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,610
We can't afford to wait.

175
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,610
Su,

176
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,120
keep a close eye on
the patient's vital signs.

177
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,970
I'll finish it as soon as possible.

178
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,530
Du Xiaoyu, you can do it.

179
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,610
You want to dance, right?

180
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,090
You want to join
the dance contest, right?

181
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,540
(Low warning)

182
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,300
(Operating Time)

183
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,490
I'll leave the rest to you.

184
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,970
Blood pressure and heart rate
are increasing.

185
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,000
It's stable now, right?

186
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,440
I'll do the suture.

187
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,050
Yeah.

188
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,120
Dr. Ruan,

189
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,290
Du Xiaoyu loves to show off his body.

190
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,680
Do a good job.

191
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,170
Okay.

192
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,800
I heard

193
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,410
that Tan Ya cried when she saw

194
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,560
Du Xiaoyu's dance last night,

195
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,320
right?

196
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,050
Did you cry then?

197
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,320
No.

198
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,800
Why did I hear

199
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
that you cried the loudest of them all?

200
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,800
That's not true.

201
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,290
Suture completed.

202
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,170
Sanitize the incision.

203
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,560
Su, great job.

204
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,970
Gauze.

205
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,120
Great job.

206
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,290
Deputy Manager Ning, please sign this.

207
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,420
(During the Operation)

208
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,460
(Wake Room)

209
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,920
How did it go?

210
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,560
It went smoothly.

211
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,650
Ning Zhiqian does live up to his name.

212
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,280
People don't call him the number one
neurosurgeon for nothing.

213
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,970
You must be exhausted.

214
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,890
I'll make you some food.

215
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,970
Mr. Ning hasn't eaten too.

216
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,090
Got it.

217
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,280
I'll make two sets.

218
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,400
I'll go and stay by his side.

219
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,560
I'll leave him to you once he wakes up.

220
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,520
Don't worry.

221
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,770
I'll definitely take good care of him.

222
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,340
(Beiya Hospital)

223
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,680
Do you know something?

224
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,560
My mother urged me to get married again.

225
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,770
I guess you know everything.

226
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,160
(Neurosurgery Department)
Xiaoxiao.

227
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,730
Did you see Mr. Ning?

228
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,890
I never saw him

229
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,320
after getting off work.

230
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,440
Alright, I'll go and find him.

231
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,490
Okay.

232
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,500
(Dressing Room, Male)

233
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,650
Is anyone there?

234
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,520
Is anyone there?

235
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,370
Mr. Ning, are you in there?

236
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,490
Mr. Ning?

237
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,650
Mr. Ning.

238
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,680
What's with the bow?

239
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,650
How many is that?

240
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,770
It isn't three, right?

241
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,490
You're truly a good doctor.

242
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,320
Stop licking my boots.

243
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,650
What?

244
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,250
You think I'm not a machine today?

245
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,680
You're a machine today.

246
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,850
Let me help you up.

247
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm fine.

248
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,890
Why did you fall asleep on the ground?

249
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,850
I was too tired.

250
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,040
I wish to become

251
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
a machine like you too.

252
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,280
Why did you say that out of the blue?

253
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
Because humans commit mistakes,

254
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,200
machines don't.

255
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,090
Between a machine
that has perfect execution

256
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,320
and a human that might make mistakes,

257
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,370
I believe 99% of all patients

258
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,730
will choose the machine.

259
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,920
After all, sympathy
can't cure their diseases.

260
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,200
Let me correct you.

261
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,090
It's not 99%.

262
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,970
It's 100%.

263
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,800
Do you still remember

264
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,520
the couplet inside

265
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,970
the medical academy's building?

266
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,770
What is it again?

267
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,010
Are you testing me?

268
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,520
Save the people, the nation,
and the world.

269
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,440
Cure the people, diseases,
and one's heart.

270
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,490
That was my initial intention
for studying medicine.

271
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,850
I did so to serve the remaining 1%.

272
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,560
I wish to work hard
and become a machine like you.

273
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,280
Dr. Ruan,

274
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
you're enlightened today.

275
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,490
That's great.

276
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,730
I hope I can see you

277
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,040
become a doctor like me

278
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,370
while I'm still alive.

279
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,560
You can do it.

280
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,010
Please live a long life then.

281
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,010
I have no problem with that.

282
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,890
Machines need to eat too.

283
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,490
Is there any food?

284
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,520
(Germ-free Room)
Tan Ya prepared food for us.

285
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,320
I've already finished my portion.

286
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,490
I think yours has gone cold.

287
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,320
So the head nurse cooked for you?

288
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,440
You've finished your portion?

289
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,040
So I'm having your leftovers?

290
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,800
I'll buy food for you right now.

291
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,920
Xiaoyu,

292
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,370
congratulations on
being discharged today.

293
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,370
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

294
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,250
Thank you, Dr. Ning.

295
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,730
Remember to come back every month

296
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,490
and take your medicine on time.

297
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,160
If you feel uncomfortable,

298
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,090
come to the hospital immediately.

299
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,130
There's a high rate of
you suffering a relapse.

300
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,200
Don't feel pressured.

301
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,800
Got it.

302
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
Dr. Ning,

303
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm leaving today.

304
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,650
Can I

305
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,520
hug you?

306
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,370
I suddenly remember that
I have a phone call to make.

307
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,800
Don't feel pressured.

308
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,520
Relax.

309
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,850
Don't mind him.

310
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,160
He's just not used to
bidding farewell like this.

311
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,010
It's fine.

312
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,370
I understand.

313
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,320
I wish you a speedy recovery.

314
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,850
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

315
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,890
Oh yeah.

316
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,890
This is a present for you.

317
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,250
Thanks.

318
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,680
This is for Dr. Ning.

319
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,130
Please pass this to him.

320
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,890
Okay.

321
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,770
Let's go. I'll see you off.

322
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,890
Madam,

323
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,610
I'll be leaving now.

324
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,010
Goodbye.

325
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440
Let's go.

326
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,970
Dr. Ruan,

327
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,130
I'll leave those
succulent plants to you then.

328
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,800
Goodbye, Dr. Ruan.

329
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,010
Has he finally left?

330
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,130
Yes.

331
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,040
Xiaoyu prepared this present for you.

332
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,440
What is it?

333
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,610
You should unwrap it.

334
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,650
I'm curious about it too.

335
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,320
You should unwrap it then.

336
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,040
Did he prepare this for you?

337
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,280
It does look like you.

338
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,610
I'll unwrap it now.

339
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,200
Go ahead.

340
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
It's a surgical cap.

341
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,010
It looks nice.

342
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,200
He wants you to smile more often.

343
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,970
Hold this for me.

344
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,130
Wear it.

345
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,200
I don't like this color.

346
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,250
I don't like that.

347
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,130
Why don't we swap our presents?

348
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:06,970
It suits you perfectly.

349
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,890
This dog looks pretty nice.

350
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,090
It's a bear.

351
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,610
Oh, it's a bear.

352
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,940
(Beiya Hospital)

353
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,920
I thought Du Xiaoyu cherishes
these plants the most?

354
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,850
Why did he leave

355
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,890
all his plants behind?

356
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,250
He's moving.

357
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,970
So he wants us to take care
of them for the time being.

358
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,650
He'll come back and check on them
when he's free.

359
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,130
He's not here to check on them.

360
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,520
He's here to check on Ning.

361
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,040
Stop spraying them.

362
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,560
You can't spray succulent plants
with water like this.

363
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,160
You have no common sense at all.

364
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,800
It's been a few days since
anyone watered them.

365
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,850
I thought you were
going to put these plants

366
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,250
to rest before this?

367
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,680
Why have you suddenly become a saint?

368
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,160
If you dare to touch them again,

369
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,770
I'll put you to rest.

370
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,280
Dr. Ding,

371
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,650
do you know

372
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,090
what day it is today?

373
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,920
I don't.

374
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,680
Dr. Cheng,

375
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,160
what day is it today?

376
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,520
Today's a

377
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,010
very important day for you.

378
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,650
Isn't today
Deputy Manager Ning's birthday?

379
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,280
Dr. Ding bought a cake for him
in advance.

380
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,520
So you knew?

381
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,010
That's no fun.

382
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,650
Read this when you go back.

383
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,730
Dr. Ruan, this is yours.

384
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,370
(Beiya Hospital)

385
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,320
Let's go, Dr. Ding.

386
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,040
It's time for outpatient duty.

387
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,800
We still have ten minutes.

388
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,970
You're so punctual, huh?

389
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,730
Hurry up.

390
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,680
Wu, stop sleeping.

391
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,490
Let's do our rounds.

392
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,490
Dr. Ding, let's go.

393
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,320
Dr. Ruan,

394
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,250
Madam Cai's daughter is here.

395
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,040
Madam Cai has a daughter?

396
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,890
I'll check it out.

397
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,490
Dr. Ruan, I'll join you.

398
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,200
It's time for outpatient duty.
Stop dilly-dallying.

399
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,890
I bought some fruit for you.

400
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,400
You should take them.

401
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,800
Take one fruit per day.

402
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,730
Hello.

403
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,520
You must be Madam Cai's daughter.

404
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,560
Yes, my name is Juan.

405
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,250
You must be Dr. Ning.

406
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,400
You're Dr. Ruan?

407
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,490
That's right.

408
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,490
My mother's operation
was a huge success.

409
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,250
Thank you so much.

410
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,800
Here,

411
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
have an orange.

412
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,160
No, thanks.

413
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
It's okay.

414
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,650
Before this,

415
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,200
I've been working in Guangzhou.

416
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,160
My elder brother has a bad temper.

417
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,560
He must've created trouble for you guys.

418
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,010
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,520
Madam Cai.

420
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,800
How's your vision doing?

421
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,370
It's getting better.

422
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,490
I can see my daughter now.

423
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,520
Madam Cai can be discharged

424
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,490
after resting for a few days.

425
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,560
Okay.

426
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,010
Don't worry.

427
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,160
I won't pay a penny less
for the surgery,

428
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,520
treatment and hospitalization.

429
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,650
We'll make a move first then.

430
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,130
Let's go.

431
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,400
Thank you, Dr. Ning.

432
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,490
Thank you.

433
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,370
Please rest well.

434
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,560
Take care.

435
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,090
That girl looks pretty sensible.

436
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,040
Why is her brother so bad?

437
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,610
There's a huge difference between them.

438
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,250
Don't you think

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,400
Juan looks like someone we met before?

440
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,370
Have you seen her before?

441
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,650
Dr. Ruan,

442
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,890
do you have too much

443
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,650
spare cash on your hands lately?

444
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,650
What do you mean?

445
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,730
I know

446
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,850
I've been quite moody lately.

447
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,250
But I was the same in the past.

448
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,970
Yeah.

449
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,730
Don't think that you can
lower my standard

450
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,010
and change my attitude

451
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,130
with something like that.

452
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,250
I got it.

453
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,770
A strict mentor produces
outstanding students.

454
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,320
Don't do this again.

455
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,200
It will be bad if our colleagues see it.

456
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,490
Mr. Ning.

457
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Do you like the watch?

458
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,920
Were you the one
who left it on my desk?

459
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,010
I've fancied you for a long time.

460
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,970
That's why I bought you a watch.

461
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,730
Treat it as a birthday gift.

462
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,440
I already have a watch.

463
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,680
Thank you for your kind intention,

464
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,800
but I don't deserve it.

465
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,040
I know you have a watch.

466
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,370
I bought it for you.

467
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,890
It's a token of my appreciation.

468
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,320
I appreciate your intention.

469
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,650
I hope you can

470
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,610
spend your time and effort

471
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,560
on your job

472
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,770
instead of useless things like this.

473
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,040
Take back the watch.

474
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,730
It's not like
I am not focused on my job.

475
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,730
Mr. Ning,

476
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,440
it's fine that you don't fancy me.

477
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,490
But you can't just treat
other people's feelings

478
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,680
for you as a mistake.

479
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,770
I'm not wrong for fancying you.

480
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,040
Take it back.

481
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,850
Mr. Ning,

482
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,160
sign this.

483
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,660
(Mr. Ning, the watch represents
my heart. Happy birthday. Ding Yiyuan.)

484
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:18,920
Congratulations.

485
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,440
(Mr. Ning,)

486
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,370
(the watch represents
my heart.)

487
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,490
(Happy birthday.)

488
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,320
(Ding Yiyuan.)

489
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,770
Watch where you're going.

490
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,970
Are you blind?

491
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,250
Dr. Ding,

492
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,730
you could've told me

493
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,890
if you fancy me.

494
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
Don't just jump into my arms.

495
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,090
You even bought a present for me?

496
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,970
This watch is pretty good.

497
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,370
This...

498
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,650
I guess I didn't tell you

499
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,320
I got a perfect score
on my dissection exam.

500
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,970
Dr. Ding,

501
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,520
here's a friendly reminder.

502
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,370
You're a girl.

503
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,970
You shouldn't mention things
like dissection and scalpel

504
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,800
all the time.

505
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,610
Be gentler.

506
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,200
You don't want it?

507
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,370
I'll take it then.

508
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,400
Thanks!

509
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,040
She's pretty strong.

510
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,460
(Beiya Hospital)

511
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
(During the Operation)

512
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,520
Why are the lights off?

513
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,170
Yeah, why is it so dark in here?

514
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,650
Are we having a power outage?

519
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,520
Thank you.

520
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,240
Thank you, everyone.

521
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,040
Thank you.

522
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,610
Mr. Ning,

523
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,370
this is your crown.

524
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,410
It's just for the birthday boy.

525
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,650
Dr. Ding,

526
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,480
you're late to the party.

527
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,960
You bought the cake

528
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,320
and you gathered us here too.

529
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,170
You should be here with us.

530
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,690
My presence doesn't matter anyway.

531
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,410
To Mr. Ning,

532
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,210
my presence doesn't matter at all.

533
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,240
Who said so?

534
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,040
The Neurosurgery Department
is one big family.

535
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,090
No one can be left out.

536
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,280
Yeah, we're a family.

537
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,610
Ning, make a wish first.

538
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,170
Why don't we do it together?

539
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,760
Okay?

540
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,960
Sure, let's do it together.

541
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,480
Make a wish.

542
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,760
Are you guys done?

543
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,480
Speak out your wishes then.

544
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,890
I hope that Mr. Ning
can smile more often.

545
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,370
I hope that Deputy Manager Ning
can do better in his work.

546
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,960
I hope that Deputy Manager Ning
falls in love and gets married.

547
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,280
I hope that Deputy Manager Ning
can celebrate his birthday every day.

548
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,930
Dr. Ding, have you made your wish?

549
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,560
It's not my birthday.

550
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
Why should I make a wish?

551
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,130
Everyone made one.

552
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,760
You should make one too.

553
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,240
I wish that I won't like him
in the coming year.

554
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,320
Dr. Ruan,

555
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,800
what's your wish?

556
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,320
My wish?

557
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,280
I wish that all your wishes for Mr. Ning

558
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,170
can come true.

559
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,560
That's a great wish.

560
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,800
May all of our wishes come true.

561
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,930
Blow the candles.

562
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,210
- Let's do it together.
- Come on.

563
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,800
Three. Two. One.

564
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,090
Thank you, everyone.

565
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I am quite touched.

566
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,890
I thought you guys already left

567
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,170
as we've just finished the operation.

568
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm usually

569
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
pretty strict

570
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,650
and I have high demands of you guys.

571
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,480
That's why I always

572
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,930
thought that you guys hated me.

573
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,720
I never expected myself
to be this popular.

574
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm very satisfied.

575
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,240
Mr. Ning.

576
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,850
-We love you.
-We love you.

577
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,960
I love you guys too.

578
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,170
Since everyone is here,

579
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,610
let's take a group photo.

580
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,800
Alright. Let's take a group photo.

581
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,890
Dr. Ding, join us.

582
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,560
No.

583
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,170
Fine. Come on.

584
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,000
Stay close to each other.

585
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,650
Three. Two. One.

586
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,890
Cut the cake.

587
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,890
Pass this to the ladies first.

588
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,720
Sure.

589
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,610
- Come on.
- Here.

590
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,410
To the men.

591
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,800
Smile.

592
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,320
Ladies first.

593
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,930
Here.

594
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,890
Eat up.

595
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,000
I'll get myself a slice.

596
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,280
Do you need a fork?

597
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,650
Hello, Mr. Xue?

598
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,480
(Liuzheng,)

599
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,280
(I'm at your house.)

600
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,650
You're at my house?

601
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,480
(Mr. Ruan and Mrs. Ruan ask you
if you're coming back for dinner.)

602
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,930
(What time will you
be getting off work?)

603
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,410
I've already gotten off work.

604
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
It'll take around half an hour
for me to reach home

605
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
if there's no jam.

606
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,800
(Alright,)

607
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,040
(we'll wait for you then.)

608
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:27,760
Okay.

609
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,610
Have a slice of cake.

610
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,720
Thank you.

611
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,450
Mr. Ning, what's the matter?

612
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm serving
the driving restriction today.

613
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,650
I didn't drive here.

614
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,960
Can you send me home?

615
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,450
Okay, get in.

616
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:45,930
What are you doing?

617
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,520
Nothing.

618
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,960
I did take the watch.

619
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,210
I thought you didn't want it?

620
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,960
That's right.

621
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,650
I was too heavy with my kick
this morning.

622
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,410
I'm here to apologize.

623
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,410
You're here to apologize?

624
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,930
Have you heard of this saying before?

625
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,650
We don't need cops

626
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,930
if apologies work.

627
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,370
What do you want then?

628
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,040
Why don't you kick me back?

629
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,930
Is that okay with you?

630
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,410
Come on then.

631
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,410
Hit me on the head.

632
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,130
Come on.

633
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,210
Just hit me.

634
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,240
It's okay.

635
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,210
I'm not angry.

636
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,930
Come on.

637
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,000
- Hit me on the head!
- Wait.

638
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,240
I will be imprisoned

639
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,040
if something happens to your head.

640
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,610
If you wish to do something silly,

641
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,000
you can bang your head on the wall.

642
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Are you even a man?

643
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,520
You don't even dare to hit a woman?

644
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm asking you to hit me.

645
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,450
- Just hit me!
- No.

646
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,000
Don't be like this.

647
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,240
- Calm down!
- Hit me on the head!

648
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,040
- Don't be like this!
- Just hit me!

649
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,280
Calm down.

650
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,450
Are they fighting?

651
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,210
Xiaoxiao!

652
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,560
I'll lend you my courage.

653
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,170
Just hit me on the head.

654
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,480
Dr. Ding? Dr. Cheng?

655
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,040
- Just hit me on the head!
- Dr. Ding!

656
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,930
I never expected her wish
to come true so soon!

657
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,320
My goodness.

658
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,130
Mr. Ning, we've arrived.

659
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,480
Aren't you coming?

660
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,040
No, thanks.

661
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,170
Ning Xiang ordered a cake for me.

662
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,650
I made a promise to him this morning.

663
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,040
I said I would bring you home
to celebrate my birthday.

664
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,210
You can choose not to come
if you think it's troublesome.

665
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,280
I'll explain it to him.

666
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,690
Forget it. I'll join you.

667
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,240
Okay.

668
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,500
(Xingfu Residence)

669
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,480
(Door's open.)

670
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,610
Dad, happy birthday!

671
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,210
Thank you, son.

672
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,760
Look! Grandpa made
so many dishes for you.

673
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,930
He even bought you a huge cake!

674
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,130
It's inside the refrigerator.

675
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
Look who's here.

676
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,170
I'll wash my hands first.

677
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,480
Mom,

678
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,930
you're here too?

679
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,480
Grandpa,

680
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,650
Mom is here too!

681
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,170
Liuzheng, you're here.

682
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,890
Hello, Mr. Ning.

683
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,720
Hello.

684
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,960
Liuzheng,

685
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
it's been so many years

686
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,650
and you didn't change at all.

687
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,960
You're still as beautiful as ever.

688
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,210
Mom,

689
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,720
go and wash your hands.

690
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,450
What's it?

691
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,760
Later, tell your father
to sit over there.

692
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,960
You can sit opposite your father.

693
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,240
I'll sit here.

694
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,610
Let your mother sit beside your father.

695
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,130
Got it?

696
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,320
Let's hurry.

697
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,650
Set the table.

698
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,370
Mr. Ning, let me help you.

699
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,370
It's fine.

700
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,000
Liuzheng,

701
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,720
have you reconciled with Zhiqian?

702
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,450
Listen,

703
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,000
if you two

704
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,650
wish to have another child
in the future,

705
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,480
I'll bring Ning Xiang to my place.

706
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
Mr. Ning, that's not it.

707
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
I'm Zhiqian's student right now.

708
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,410
I'm here to visit Ning Xiang today.

709
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,450
You don't need to hide it from me.

710
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,370
We're a family.

711
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,370
Right,

712
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,930
if you two have decided
on a date for the wedding,

713
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,930
you have to book
the wedding banquet in advance.

714
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,890
It's okay.

715
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,170
You can tell me by then.

716
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,610
I know someone who arranges
wedding banquets.

717
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,560
I'll make the arrangement for you.

718
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,560
That's not it.

719
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Mr. Ning, you've misunderstood us.

720
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,450
What were you talking about?

721
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,720
I wish to join in.

722
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,930
It's nothing.

723
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,690
Nothing.

724
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,170
Here, sit down.

725
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,650
Mom, sit here.

726
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,170
Call your father here.

727
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,000
Dad, sit here.

728
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,240
Grandpa, sit here.

729
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,210
Okay.

730
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,450
I'll pour the fruit juice.

731
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,040
Let me do it.

732
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,800
Give it to me.

733
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,690
Thank you.

734
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,610
Thank you, Mom.

735
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,240
You're welcome.

736
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,000
Today's your birthday.

737
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,280
I've prepared your favorite dishes.

738
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,690
Dad, happy birthday.

739
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,690
Thank you, son.

740
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,520
It's so good.

741
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,450
Help yourself.

742
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,040
What do you want?

743
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,720
Lotus root?

744
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,610
Black fungus? Okay.

745
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,240
I'll get you the black fungus.

746
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,480
Here you go.

747
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,210
It's too big.

748
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,650
Eat up.

749
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,280
Were you guys talking about
a wedding just now?

750
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,610
No. We were talking about you.

751
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,450
We said you're a good boy.
