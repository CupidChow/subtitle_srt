00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,980
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,770
Zheng.

4
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
It was wrong

5
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,050
for me to keep this from you.

6
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,410
Blame me all you want.

7
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,370
But don't blame Zhiqian.

8
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,120
Dad.

9
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,040
You gave up on the treatment so soon.

10
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,370
It's too hard on all of us.

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Perhaps we can try other treatments.

12
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,090
In that regard,

13
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Zhiqian was more prudent.

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,090
He considered all other options.

15
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,840
In the remaining time I have,

16
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,840
I want to go home and
spend time with your mother.

17
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,010
I want to talk to her.

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,970
Have a little chat with her.

19
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,920
I want to try

20
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,640
her cooking.

21
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,810
Had you told me sooner,

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,400
I would have spent more time with you.

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,450
I didn't tell you

24
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,530
because I wanted you to be happy

25
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,200
every time I saw you.

26
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,170
I've always

27
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,560
wanted to see you happy.

28
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,480
It really gladdens me

29
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,330
to see you so happy.

30
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,730
Dr. Ruan.

31
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,360
I have a favor to ask.

32
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,450
Could you

33
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,730
give me an early discharge?

34
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,010
Let me go home.

35
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,280
You should do

36
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,010
Ning Xiang's surgery first.

37
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll visit you after the surgery.

38
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,210
I look forward to your good news.

39
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,610
Zhiqian.

40
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,330
Dad?

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,770
I'm counting on you.

42
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,840
Don't worry.

43
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,610
So,

44
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,280
you two should be careful.

45
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,080
Maintain good personal hygiene.

46
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,890
Don't skip your meals.

47
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
Is that clear?

48
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,400
Don't go wandering off for no reason.

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,170
Okay, you two can go home now.

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,170
To the entrance.

51
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,930
We're already there.

52
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,680
Ning Xiang passed the tests.

53
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,930
The surgery is a go.

54
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,330
How has Dad been lately?

55
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,280
He seems sprightly.

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,680
He even sings for Mom.

57
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,450
See?

58
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,610
The ducklings are out.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,400
Spring is just around the corner.

60
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,010
Yeah.

61
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,080
(Beiya Hospital)

62
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Mom.

63
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,080
Don't be scared.

64
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,610
I am very brave.

65
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm Spider-Man.

66
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,930
Ning Xiang is the best, right?

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,650
Let me show you something.

68
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,120
Look who this is.

69
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,930
- Ning Xiang, all the best!
- Grandpa.

70
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
- We are waiting for you at home!
- Grandma.

71
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,930
- Ning Xiang, Grandpa said
- Grandma.

72
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,400
- when you come home,
- Grandpa.

73
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
he'll play chess with you.

74
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,080
I will make you something tasty too.

75
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,610
Ning Xiang, my nephew.

76
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,050
- All the best.
- Uncle.

77
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm rooting for you at the set.

78
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:10,890
And Uncle Xiao'er.

79
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,650
All the best!

80
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,680
Uncle Xiao'er.

81
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,560
Ning Xiang.

82
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
I am Weilin.

83
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,400
- I promise
- Xue Weilin is here too.

84
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
when you get well,

85
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,890
I'll take you to the theme park.

86
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,770
All the best!

87
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,420
Hello, Ning Xiang.

88
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,180
- Do you remember Ms. Tan Ya?
- Look who's next to me.

89
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,840
Ms. Tan Ya.

90
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Good luck!

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,280
Do you remember Mr. Cheng?

92
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,210
- And me too!
- Mr. Cheng and Ms. Ding.

93
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,930
All the best, Ning Xiang!

94
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,840
Aren't you happy to see them?

95
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,770
So many are here for you.

96
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,560
See?

97
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,770
Dad, don't be afraid.

98
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,330
I'm not afraid.

99
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,400
I'll always be there for you.

100
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,240
Mom.

101
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,210
Don't cry.

102
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,610
I'm not crying.

103
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm waiting for you to get well.

104
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,400
Okay?

105
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,010
All the best.

106
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,700
(Special Elevator for Operation)

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,890
Mr. Liu.

108
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,010
I'm counting on you.

109
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,260
(Operating Room)

110
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,240
The weather is nice today.

111
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,970
The sun is warm and nice.

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,480
Come on.

113
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,010
Let's get some warm sunshine.

114
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,970
It's good for your health.

115
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,090
See?

116
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,410
The birds wouldn't stop chirping.

117
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,120
Lately,

118
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,330
the plants have been growing well.

119
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,970
How nice.

120
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
The child is still young.

121
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,530
The surgery will be difficult.

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,240
It could take quite a while.

123
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,770
There could be blood loss.

124
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,290
How many blood packs do we have?

125
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,010
Two packs.

126
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,330
Get two more packs.

127
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,210
Sure. I'll notify the blood bank.

128
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,040
Manager Liu thinks
the surgery will drag on

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,970
as the boy is too young.

130
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,650
We need two more packs of blood.

131
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,290
Blood pressure is declining.

132
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,890
How much?

133
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,210
80/50.

134
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,680
Heart rate?

135
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,560
55.

136
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,720
Calm down.

137
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,650
Calm your nerves.

138
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,360
Take it slowly.

139
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,660
(During the Operation)

140
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,450
Two more packs of blood are here.

141
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,600
Come.

142
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,210
Let's look at

143
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,770
some of Zheng's photos.

144
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,530
Come on.

145
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,850
See this?

146
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,040
She was adorable when she was little.

147
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Back then,

148
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,360
she meant the world to you.

149
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,120
She was the apple of your eye.

150
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,290
And our son?

151
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,010
As if he was adopted.

152
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,010
I wonder

153
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
how Ning Xiang's surgery is going on.

154
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,010
I've been worried the whole morning.

155
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,360
Jianzhong.

156
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,680
I'll get you some water.

157
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,650
(Kid.)

158
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,330
(I'm afraid)

159
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,210
(the game is lost for me.)

160
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,240
(But your game)

161
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,330
(can still go on.)

162
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,940
(Operating Time)

163
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,780
(Operating Time)

164
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:03,660
(Operating Room)

165
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,480
Come. Have some water.

166
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,920
The crisis

167
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
has been resolved for now.

168
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,890
You must take over from here.

169
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,650
Calm down.

170
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,770
I'm here for you.

171
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:42,920
Suture.

172
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,330
The child is lucky to be alive.

173
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,970
Disinfection.

174
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,020
(During the Operation)

175
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,010
The kid

176
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,210
is lucky to have met you.

177
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,410
Mr. Liu.

178
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,360
Thank you.

179
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,650
Let's not break it to them right away.

180
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,080
- Hello, everyone!
- Hello, everyone!

181
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,530
Dr. Ding and I are transferred

182
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,320
back to Neurosurgery
from Infectious Disease.

183
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,890
We start working today.

184
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,600
Welcome!

185
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,050
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

186
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,120
Hold on.

187
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,960
Did you get your nucleic acid test?

188
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,010
Of course.

189
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,840
We've had it three times this week.

190
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,170
For everyone's safety,

191
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,120
you two should be quarantined for
another two weeks.

192
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
Well said.

193
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,930
Agreed.

194
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,840
He has a point.

195
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,010
Never mind.

196
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,170
Never mind.

197
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,570
You worked together
in Infectious Disease

198
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,600
for an entire week.

199
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,770
Did the spark of love

200
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
not reignite?

201
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,320
Well.

202
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,440
Of course not.

203
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,650
Dr. Ding feels embarrassed.

204
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,930
Of course it did!

205
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,480
Get your filthy hand off me.

206
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,440
Get working.

207
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,810
Run!

208
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,480
My test result was alright!

209
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,440
Aren't you happy to be discharged?

210
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,480
Yeah!

211
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,690
I want to spend time with Mom and Dad.

212
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,410
I want to ride a bicycle.

213
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,690
Which mom did you mean?

214
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,360
You, and you!

215
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,290
I have two moms!

216
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,770
Why isn't Grandpa here?

217
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,120
He is making food for you back home.

218
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,410
Why didn't my other Grandpa come here?

219
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,290
I want him to give me chess lessons.

220
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
I'll make time

221
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,600
- I can teach you.
- to pay madam a visit.

222
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,320
What is your plan?

223
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm staying in Jiangzhou.

224
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,600
I want to look after Ning Xiang

225
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
with you guys.

226
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,650
That's great!

227
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,290
Mom and Dad

228
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,050
can finally be with me!

Let's put your work aside for a moment.

231
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,240
I have an announcement to make.

232
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,010
Recently,

233
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,570
Jiangzhou authority will select a team

234
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,600
to provide Africa with medical aid.

235
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Every hospital is sending someone.

236
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,720
This is the form.

237
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,840
If you wish to volunteer,

238
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,960
get a form from me.

239
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,890
Well? Are you going?

240
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,200
Sure.

241
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,600
I wish I could go,
but my mom wouldn't let me.

242
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,600
Anyway, I will go.

I want to go.

245
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,600
We meet the requirements.

246
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,410
You two should go.

247
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,930
Go.

Here.

254

What's wrong with you?

255
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,290
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

256
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,720
I did it on purpose.

257

Here, one for you too.

but I've never been abroad before.

We've never

318
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,080
lived in a dorm after we graduated.

319
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,170
So?

320
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,120
We are thousands of miles
away from home.

321
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,720
We should look after each other.

322
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,320
Yeah, Dr. Ai.

323
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,120
We worked in different departments.

324
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
We never get to talk.

325
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,930
We can

326
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,240
have a long chat this time.

327
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
I have a personal habit.

328
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,200
I prefer quiet space.

329
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't like talking.

330
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't like
listening to people talking.

331
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,240
When I am around,

332
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,320
please keep your voice down.

333
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,960
Thank you.

334
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,530

336
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,290
have you been to Dahl before?

337
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,240
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I don't feel like talking.

338
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Which do you want?

339
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,770
Either one.

340
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,200
You pick.

341
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,320
I'll take the other bed.

342
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Okay?

343
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,170
Dr. Ruan.

344
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,570
Let's help the patients in critical

conditions.

346
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,360
Make the arrangement.

347
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,320
Three surgeries?

348
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,080
Why? Is there a problem?

349
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,480
Of course not.

350
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,320
So many patients are without a bed.

351
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,690
I wish I could do five a day.

352
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,530
You've improved.

353
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,650
Should I cut the left side?

354
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,890
Wait. Be patient.

355
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,320
Dr. Ning.

356
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,650
Jeff, what happened?

357
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,650
There is a woman. She's delivering.

358
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,530
She's having trouble giving birth.

359
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,480
Why didn't you ask Simeone?

360
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,120
Simeone is not here.

361
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,120
When she left, she told me

362
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,840
whenever she's not available,

363
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,170
you're in charge.

364
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,120
The woman has lost a lot of blood.

365
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,480
Please come and help her.

366
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,360
Dr. Ruan, go with him.

367
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,530
I can handle it here.

368
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,120
Me?

369
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,320
I don't know how to deliver a child.

370
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,480
You were in the Obstetrics
Department for your training.

371
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,120
Yes.

372
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,840
But I've never delivered a child
on my own.

373
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,240
I'm a woman,

374
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,410
but that doesn't mean I was born
to have the knowledge.

375
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,480
That's not what I mean.

376
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,050
Two lives are at stake here.

377
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,120
The decision is yours.

378
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,320
Please, come and help her.

379
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,770
Please, come with me.

380
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,240
Well? How did it go?

381
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,050
It went well.

382
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,930
A boy or a girl?

383
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,240
A boy.

384
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,810
It's said that potential

385
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,240
can always be discovered.

386
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,890
Are you exhausted yet?

387
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,410
What now?

388
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,170
Let me take you somewhere.

389
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,120
Why did you take me here?

390
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,840
I used to come here to take a bath.

391
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,200
Why didn't you use the bathroom?

392
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,480
I can't see the stars there.

393
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,570
But I can watch the stars
while taking a bath.

394
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,690
Come on.

395
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,890
Let's pick you some stars.

396
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,120
You never cease to amaze me.

397
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,200
When my mom left,

398
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,960
I couldn't be with her.

399
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,200
I thought

400
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,290
I should come back here to see her.

401
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,650
(We've only met once,)

402
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,050
(but we had a great time.)

403
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,010
(We talked a lot.)

404
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,570
In my eyes,

405
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,770
she is truly a charismatic woman

406
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,240
and an outstanding doctor.

407
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,240
She told me

408
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,690
she'd leave for Africa the next day.

409
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,770
It was that day.

410
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,840
She liked you a lot.

411
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,080
You've only met her once,

412
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,170
but she mentioned you a lot.

413
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,530
There's another battle going on.

414
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,530
Who knows how many will die this time?

415
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,770
By the way,

416
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,440
the medical system of

417
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
the international hospital
is overloading.

418
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,010
They are transferring
surgeons from around the world.

419
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,930
I want to volunteer.

420
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
I'm coming with you.

421
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,360
You shouldn't.

422
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,410
It's too dangerous.

423
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,050
Stay in your post.

424
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,650
When are you leaving?

425
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
I registered.

426
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll leave in a few days.

427
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,660
(Dahl Chinese Hospital)

428
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,960
Help! Help us!

429
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,240
Quick!

430
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:13,240
- Please help us!
- Help!

431
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,240
Are you worried about Ning Zhiqian?

432
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,120
There was a firefight
at the international

433
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,600
hospital this afternoon.

434
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
There were heavy casualties.

435
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,010
Communications with that side
have been cut off.

436
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,120
How did you know?

437
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,650
I was in Dahl.

438
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,720
I have a lot of friends here.

439
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,440
Is there a way

440
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
I can get in touch with Mr. Ning?

441
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,010
We must wait for the communications
to get back online.

442
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,600
That could take forever.

443
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,840
Shouldn't you be in bed?

444
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
You are operating tomorrow.

445
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,320
You're still awake too.

446
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
Are you talking back at me?

447
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,810
Mr. Ning and I were in the same batch.

448
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,050
Did he teach you nothing?

449
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,650
As a doctor,

450
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,080
you must take care of yourself

451
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,170
before you can take
better care of the patients.

452
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,290
Go to bed.

453
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,290
Good night.

454
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,010
Did you bring your ID?

455
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,440
And your charger?

456
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,480
Yes. Stop nagging.

457
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,170
We'll be away for a couple of days.

458
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,360
You should say goodbye to Cheng.

459
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,600
Mom wants me to say goodbye to you.

460
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,050
My mom saw this!

461
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,240
No.

462
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,290
If you miss me,

463
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,840
send me a message.

464
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,240
If I don't reply instantly,

465
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,770
it means I'm operating.

466
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,010
I get it.

467
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,170
Good.

468
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,690
Don't get yourself into trouble.

469
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,120
That's not your turf.

470
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,480
I won't.

471
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,650
Good girl.

472
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,690
Did you get the sunscreen?

473
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,080
Yes. I got tubes of them.

474
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,930
Don't worry.

475
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,720
Are you sure?

476
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,650
Can we go now?

477
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,240
Get in the car.

478
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:49,960
Madam,

479
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,200
have fun while you're there.

480
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,480
Thank you for your help, Cheng.

481
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,100
Thank you for your help, Cheng.

482
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,360
- Silly child.
- Sure, Madam.

483
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,930
When we're back from the vacation,

484
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,890
maybe we should start
calling you Manager Cheng.

485
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,960
Madam,

486
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,930
you should just stick to Cheng.

487
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,170
Yuan.

488
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,690
Take care of both of you.

489
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,770
Fine, I get it.

490
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,640
Stop nagging.

491
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,090
Close the door.

492
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,570
Okay.

493
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Everything about Cheng is great,

494
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,960
except for his background.

495
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,640
What I like the most about him

496
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,810
is that he listens to you.

497

♪Let me open up your head♪

498

499
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,400

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,200
(Due to the landslide during)

503
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,810
(the National Cycling Championship,)

504
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,610
(several national athletes,
including Nie Xing,)

505
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,810
(have been injured.)

506
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,480
(Nie Xing suffered the worst injury.)

507
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,240
(According to his father,)

508
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,720
(he suffered trauma to the head.)

509
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,090
(After his surgery
at a local hospital in Ruining,)

510
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,610
(he's been in a coma.)

511
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
(He is still in critical condition.)

512
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,720
That's the situation.

513
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,960
We should discuss

514
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,700
whether we should accept
Nie Xing's transfer or not.

515
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,580
(Meeting Room)

516
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,130
Come in.

517
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,880
Take a seat.

518
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,010
Quick.

519
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,160
You are in charge
of Neurosurgery Ward 3.

520
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,720
Something just came up.

521
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
We must discuss it with you.

522
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,050
Have you heard the news
about the cyclist called

523
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,050
Nie Xing?

524
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes.

525
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,050
I'll make it brief.

526
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,720
During the contest,

527
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,530
a falling rock hit his head.

528
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,570
He suffered a severe injury.

529
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,090
Ruining Hospital contacted us

530
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,770
about the emergency this morning.

531
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
They wish to transfer Nie Xing here

532
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,530
and hope that we can accept him.

533
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,090
This is the detailed medical diagnosis.

534
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,200
You have a copy there.

(Ruining Hospital,
Nie Xing: Admission Record)

536
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,060
Vice President Ding.

537
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,130
We must think it through before we can

538
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,130
accept Nie Xing's transfer.

539
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
His situation has the attention

540
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,530
of the media nationwide.

541
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,680
Unless we are certain of our chances,

542
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,920
we should not accept him.

543
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,290
Nothing is absolute

544
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,960
in the medical field.

545
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,400
Our Neurosurgery

546
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,330
has a great reputation
throughout the country.

547
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,370
Our technology, techniques, and staff

548
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,850
are all top-notch.

549
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,130
If we can save this athlete,

550
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,810
we must uphold the spirit of medicine

551
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,880
and save him as best as we can.

552
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,770
If Ning Zhiqian was here,

553
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,010
I wouldn't be worried.

554
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
In my opinion,

555
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,370
we should not put
Beiya Hospital's reputation

556
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,530
at risk.

557
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,720
Cheng.

558
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,640
What is your take on the matter?

559
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,090
I need to study his medical record.

560
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,090
I must discuss it with

561
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,200
the other neurosurgeons as well.

562
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,130
Very well.

563
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,200
This is a serious matter.

564
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,440
We'll wait for your response.

565
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,850
These are the CT scans

566
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,370
of Nie Xing's skull

567
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,330
after his admission.

568
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,530
The CT scans show

569
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,440
fractures at the skull,

570
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,290
cerebral contusion and laceration,

571
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,160
and ICH.

572
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,720
These have led to increased intracranial
pressure and brain herniation.

573
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,810
Ever since they removed the hematoma

574
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,090
and conducted
a decompressive craniotomy,

575
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,920
the patient has been in a coma.

576
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,400
There is infection at his lungs.

577
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,850
Dr. Bai.

578
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,050
Craniocerebral trauma
is your field of expertise.

579
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,010
Tell us what you think.

580
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:19,960
Let's check

581
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,920
the CT scans.

582
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,640
The decompressive craniotomy
didn't cover enough range.

583
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,720
Secondly, he's suffering from severe

584
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,400
increased intracranial
pressure and brain herniation,

585
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,160
and there is the infection at his lungs.

586
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,610
We can conduct another surgery

587
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,770
to increase the range of
decompressive craniotomy.

588
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,920
But by doing so,

589
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,010
the risks are too great.

590
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,530
There is another factor to consider.

591
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,480
The trip from
Ruining Hospital to Jiangzhou

592
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,610
will take at least

593
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,050
two and a half hours.

594
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
What if anything
happens to him on the way?

595
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,440
If we agree to his transfer,

596
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,370
Ruining Hospital's staff
will escort him.

597
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,330
Let's assume

598
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,480
Nie Xing has been transferred here.

599
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,570
We face the same problem

600
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,880
as they did

601
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
at Ruining Hospital.

602
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,370
If we don't conduct another surgery,

603
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,330
we can't relieve

604
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,680
the intracranial pressure.

605
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,880
We all know what that leads to.

606
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,810
But if we do conduct another surgery,

607
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,610
the risks are too great.

608
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
Either option won't end well.

We all agreed that

639
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,610
his injuries were too severe.

640
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,880
He should not be transferred.

641
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,920
We advise you to contain
the infection at his lungs.

642

Conduct a second craniotomy

We understand your worries.

accept any consequences.

666
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,160
Please don't give up on him.

667
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,130
Please give it a try.

668
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,850
Please, I beg of you.

669

Well.

670
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,290

have you lost your mind for fame?

674

career evaluation!

675
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,850
Why are you trying to be a hero?

676
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,610
You know about Nie Xing's transfer.

677
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,010
Who told you that?

678
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,680
Never mind.

679
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,130
My dad agreed on a whim,

680
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,240
because he didn't know better.

681
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,880
You're an expert.

682
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,850
Don't you know

683
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,050
Nie Xing's chances of making it through

684
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,050
are next to nothing?

685
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,770
As you said,

686
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,370
there is still hope for him.

687
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,160
I thought you only cared

688
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,400
about results and personal gains.

689
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,640
How did you get so ignorant this time?

690
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,720
Nie Xing is the best
cyclist in the country.

691
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,640
If he dies because of you,

692
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,010
do you know what it will do

693
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,240
to your career?

694
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
I only know that

695
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,680
Ning would have saved him

696
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,480
if he were here.

697
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,960
You're not him!

698
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,880
Yes.

699
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,370
I am not Ning Zhiqian.

700
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,200
But I am a doctor.

701
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,370
Talk to you later.

702
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,020
(Emergency Department)

703
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,530
Who's in charge here?

704
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,130
I am Cheng Zhouyu.

705
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,720
He stopped breathing.

706
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,610
His heart rate is weak.

707
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,200
Send him to the ICU!

708
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,880
Put on the ventilator!

709
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,290
Yes.

710
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,290
This way.

711
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

712
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,480
Are you Dr. Cheng Zhouyu?

713
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,130
Yes.

714
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,480
Hello. I am Nie Xing's father.

715
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:21,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

716
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,400
Dr. Cheng.

717
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,770
Thank you so much.

718
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,920
You helped us
when we needed help the most.

719
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,160
If you deem it necessary,

720
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,480
proceed without my permission.

721
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,370
I only want

722
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,330
my son to survive.

723
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,400
Do whatever you must.

724
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,640
Dr. Cheng, please.

725
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,570
Don't worry.

726
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:37,850
Please.

727
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,720
I will give it my best.
