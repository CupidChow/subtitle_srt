3
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,350
Dr. Ruan.

4
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,220
Mr. Ge.

5
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,550
Hello.

6
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,100
Hello.

7
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,550
I'm Ge Qing.

8
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,990
The characters used
for kudzu root and the color green.

9
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,790
How do you do?

10
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,300
Please sit.

11
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,820
Okay.

12
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,630
Thank you.

13
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,270
Take your time.

14
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,070
Be careful.

15
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,990
Excuse me.

16
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,220
What would you like to order, mister?

17
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,510
You can order anything you want.

18
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,660
I'm fine with anything.

19
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,510
I'm not that hungry now.
Why don't you order?

20
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,820
You're not hungry?

21
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,070
Then I'll start ordering.

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,740
Is there anything that you don't eat?

23
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,350
I'm not good with spicy food.

24
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,710
Not good with spicy food.

25
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,910
Okay.

26
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,270
One Sweet and Sour Pork,

27
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,380
one Roman Lettuce with Soy Sauce,

28
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,070
and one Cucumber with Peach Kernels.

29
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:56,990
Okay.

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,660
That's all. Thank you.

31
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,710
Your food will be ready soon.

32
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,660
Have some water.

33
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,990
Dr. Ruan.

34
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,820
I heard

35
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,550
you're working at Beiya Hospital.

36
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,710
No.

37
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,070
I work at West District Hospital.

38
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,190
I'm only transferred
to Beiya Hospital temporarily.

39
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,710
I see.

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,790
That's not so bad.

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,510
Well,

42
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,990
I have much respect for doctors.

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,460
Really?

44
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes.

45
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,510
I have the utmost respect
for teachers too.

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,380
Is that so?

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,460
What was your major?

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,350
I majored in Biology.

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,630
Medicine and Biology
are practically one family.

50
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,790
Yes, they're one family.

51
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
We'll have a lot of things in common

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,150
to talk about in the future.

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,740
Actually, I never imagined

54
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,630
I could be a doctor.

55
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,630
I know what you mean.

56
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,790
I can tell you this.

57
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,350
When I studied in the United States,

58
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,510
I majored in Biology, right?

59
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,740
Do you know the difference

60
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,990
between Biology and Medicine?

61
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,510
What?

62
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,300
We studied cells and bacteria all day.

63
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,860
Slow down.

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,180
(Ban Tian Yao)

65
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,300
Dad, look!

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,510
- That's Mom.
- Dr. Ruan, you see.

67
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,510
When I was in the United States,

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,230
there were many interesting things.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,790
Really?

70
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,300
Yes.

71
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,390
Don't say anything foolish later.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,390
Don't call her "Mom",

73
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,020
understand?

74
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,230
But she's my mom.

75
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,300
Why can't I call her that?

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,790
Just do as I say.

77
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,580
I'll tell you about it next time.

78
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,830
Ning Xiang.

79
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,070
Madam.

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,510
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,790
I come here to learn painting
every week.

82
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,580
Dr. Ruan,

83
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,910
this is...

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
He's

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,860
my mentor at Beiya Hospital.

86
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,670
Mr. Ning.

87
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,350
Ah, Mr. Ning.

88
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,860
Hello, Mr. Ning.

89
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,740
Hello.

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,790
I'm Ge Qing.

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,790
The characters used
for kudzu root and the color green.

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,740
I'm Dr. Ruan's friend.

93
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,910
I'm pleased to meet you.

94
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,110
What's the matter?

95
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,510
Who's that mister in the glasses?

96
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,670
Can I choose

97
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,980
not to answer your question?

98
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,510
Are you on a date with him?

99
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,350
Kid, you know quite a lot.

100
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,300
Mr. Ning,

101
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,300
it's such a coincidence.
I'm a teacher too.

102
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,700
But I teach at a university.

103
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,790
Oh? Which university?

104
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,230
Nanhu University.

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,390
I started working at the university

106
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,540
after I returned from the United States.

107
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,740
Some say

108
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,350
teaching isn't a promising profession.

109
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,540
But

110
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,790
I don't like a life competing
with others.

111
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,420
- You don't look handsome if you're mad.
- I prefer

112
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,950
a stable life.

113
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
You also teach

114
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,420
at a university, right?

115
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,980
You can say that.

116
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,390
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

117
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,390
By the way,

118
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,390
does Zheng do well at the hospital?

119
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,460
Zheng?

120
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,300
I mean, Dr. Ruan.

121
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,670
Zheng

122
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,510
is doing pretty well.

123
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,830
That's for sure.

124
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,740
She's the most beautiful, intelligent,

125
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,110
and lovely girl I've seen

126
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,980
since I came back

127
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
from the United States.

128
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,790
We felt like seeing old friends
when we first met.

129
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,950
She's my girlfriend.

130
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,260
Girlfriend?

131
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,630
Yes, girlfriend.

132
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,860
It was only last week

133
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,790
she told us she was single.

134
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,830
We just started dating.

135
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,830
It hasn't been that long.

136
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,860
Perhaps she hasn't told anyone yet.

137
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,860
Mr. Ning,

138
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,790
I heard it's difficult

139
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,300
to get promoted in Beiya,

140
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,860
right?

141
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
I'm guessing

142
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
you're not over 35, right?

143
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm 34.

144
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,950
You see, it's not easy

145
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,670
to be an attending doctor

146
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,510
at 34.

147
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,350
Because your hospital

148
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,740
is not like my university, right?

149
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,350
Mine makes a lot of exceptions.

150
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,110
You see,

151
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,630
we're almost the same age.

152
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,300
But I'm already

153
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,510
the Associate Professor.

154
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,140
It may be hard

155
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,110
to get promoted.

156
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,910
But I've at least made it,

157
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,980
right?

158
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,580
I need to take my son to class now.

159
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,190
We're going to be late.

160
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,070
I have to go now.

161
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,350
Don't leave just yet.

162
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,740
Since we ran into each other,

163
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,950
why don't we have
a meal together someday?

164
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,740
Zheng and I will be buying

165
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,260
as thanks for taking good care of her.

166
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,630
Bring your wife too.

167
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,190
Wife?

168
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,910
Yes,

169
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,540
your wife.

170
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,740
The wife of her mentor.

171
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,950
Sure.

172
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,950
No problem.

173
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,540
It's a deal then.

174
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,700
It's set then.

175
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,540
Ning Xiang,

176
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,980
say goodbye to them.

177
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,630
Goodbye.

178
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,670
See you around.

179
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,460
He's such a good boy.

180
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,540
Dad, it's not this way.

181
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,700
It's that way.

182
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,860
Oh, Zheng.

183
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,420
I promised to have a meal
with Mr. Kudzu Root here.

184
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,300
I'll bring my wife

185
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,390
along for it.

186
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,230
It's Ge Qing,

187
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
from the color green.

188
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,140
Keep that in mind.

189
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,110
He can't even remember my name.

190
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,630
Let's go.

191
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,350
Stop looking at them.

192
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,420
You didn't talk much

193
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,700
to Mr. Ning.

194
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,860
It looks like

195
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,910
you're closer to his son.

196
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,270
Children like me.

197
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,900
By the way,

198
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,950
how long will you stay at Beiya?

199
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,660
One year.

200
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,100
Three months had passed.

201
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,710
I see.

202
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,660
Why don't you transfer

203
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,780
to a different hospital
for the next six months?

204
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,100
That hospital

205
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,470
may be slightly worse than Beiya.

206
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,470
But I know an Associate Professor

207
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,220
in that hospital.

208
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,950
It's better than you learning

209
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,950
from this attending doctor.

210
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,190
Did you say he's an attending doctor?

211
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,220
Isn't he?

212
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,900
He is a professor

213
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,190
and the Deputy Manager.

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
That's not possible.

215
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,710
Isn't

216
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,860
the Deputy Manager

217
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,030
of Beiya to be at least 40 years old?

218
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,950
The teacher told me

219
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,470
you weren't paying attention

220
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,030
in class today.

221
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,190
Is something troubling you?

222
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,150
You can stop going to school
if you don't want to.

223
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,630
No, I want to go to school.

224
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,780
Then tell me

225
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,070
what was on your mind today.

226
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,630
My head hurt.

227
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,980
Your head hurt?

228
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,270
Not only my head hurt,

229
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,830
but I also felt nauseated.

230
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,390
You felt nauseated too?

231
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,740
We must go to the hospital now.

232
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,590
Some guy

233
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,710
is going to steal my mom.

234
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,030
What's the point
of going to the hospital?

235
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Doesn't your head hurt about this,

236
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,150
Dad?

237
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,780
What?

238
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,190
That mister is worse than you.

239
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,900
I wanted to puke when I saw him.

240
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,900
You little brat.

241
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,540
So tell me.

242
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,710
How is that mister worse than me?

243
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,900
It's a child's instinct.

244
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,630
A child's instinct?

245
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,860
What a showoff.

246
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,900
Be serious.

247
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,630
Dad,

248
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,300
why don't you

249
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,070
just win my mom back?

250
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,780
Then you have a wife,

251
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,980
and I'll have a mom.

252
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,710
It's indeed

253
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,100
reaping two benefits in one action.

254
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,780
Hitting two targets with an arrow.

255
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,710
Killing two birds with one stone!

256
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,950
You sure learned a lot of idioms lately.

257
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,900
Think about what I said.

258
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,340
I'm home.

259
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,740
You're home.

260
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,860
Sufen,

261
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,190
hurry. Liuzheng is home.

262
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,900
Come on.

263
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,340
You're home?

264
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,190
What do you think?

265
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,340
What do you mean?

266
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,300
The guy, your aunt introduced you to.

267
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,900
He's neither that good nor bad.

268
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,390
Is he tall?

269
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,710
He's neither tall nor short.

270
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,830
Then...

271
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,030
He's neither fat nor thin.

272
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,340
Do you two get along?

273
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,900
Do you have anything
in common to talk about?

274
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,300
What is his job title?

275
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,780
What do his parents do for a living?

276
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,740
Mom,

277
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,590
it's my first time meeting him.

278
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,510
If I asked him all these,

279
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
it would feel like I'm probing into
his family matters.

280
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,710
Don't tell me you told him by mistake.

281
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,300
What?

282
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,030
About you and Zhiqian's divorce.

283
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,660
What do you mean?

284
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,900
Didn't Aunt tell him about it?

285
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,070
We planned

286
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,420
to wait until you've secured
his feelings.

287
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,150
Then

288
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,190
perhaps

289
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,540
he wouldn't mind about it.

290
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,340
Do you think we can hide it from him?

291
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,150
We can't do this to him.

292
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,030
That's right.

293
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,900
You can't mislead him like this,

294
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,660
right?

295
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,860
You can keep it from him now.

296
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,900
But can you hide it forever?

297
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,590
If you don't tell him now,

298
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,390
it'll only reflect badly on Liuzheng

299
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,860
if he finds out later.

300
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,390
Then what happened after you texted him?

301
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,830
I don't know.

302
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,900
He probably deleted me
from his contact list.

303
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,860
He's being mean.

304
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,270
He could've at least replied,

305
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,300
"Okay", right?

306
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,630
I can't believe he teaches
at a university.

307
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,710
How rude.

308
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,510
Forget it.

309
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,710
It's not a big deal anyway.

310
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,740
You have a pretty big heart.

311
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Don't worry about it anymore.

312
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,510
I'm fine.

313
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,740
- Okay.
- Let's go.

314
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,030
Mr. Ning.

315
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,220
So

316
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,300
are you getting along

317
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
with that teacher from the university?

318
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,590
We get along pretty well.

319
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,030
I wish you all happiness.

320
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,860
Get to the OR quickly.

321
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:32,340
(Operating Room)

322
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,470
Dr. Ruan.

323
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,070
Oh, Mr. Ge.

324
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,740
Is it convenient to talk?

325
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,980
Sure, come with me.

326
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,420
Dr. Ruan,

327
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,150
I've thought about it for three days.

328
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,030
I think I can put aside

329
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,950
your past.

330
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,630
Mr. Ge,

331
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,950
you don't have to force yourself.

332
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,950
There is plenty of fish in the sea.

333
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,780
You'll find someone more suitable.

334
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,740
Dr. Ruan,

335
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,270
that's not what I meant.

336
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,300
Can we find a place

337
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,740
to sit down and talk?

338
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,470
There's no one here.

339
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,340
We can talk here.

340
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,710
Okay.

341
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,950
Dr. Ruan,

342
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,030
I don't disdain you.

343
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,710
You're really a nice lady.

344
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,150
You're intelligent, lovely,
and beautiful.

345
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,390
Or else,

346
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,270
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you
at first sight.

347
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
But...

348
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,420
Never mind.

349
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,220
Let's not talk about the past anymore.

350
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,340
If you can commit to these two things,

351
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,390
I think we can continue

352
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,420
with this relationship.

353
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,420
First,

354
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,470
leave Beiya

355
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,510
and don't work with your ex-husband.

356
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,510
Second,

357
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,630
you can visit your son

358
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,510
every now and then.

359
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,100
You can also provide living expenses.

360
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,220
But

361
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,980
don't let him enter

362
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,030
our lives.

363
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,070
Dr. Ruan,

364
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,950
I know Beiya is a reputable hospital.

365
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,300
But think about it.

366
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,100
Is it good for your reputation

367
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,830
to mix around

368
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,660
with your ex-husband all day?

369
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,220
You're a lady.

370
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,590
A lady's reputation

371
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,590
is very important.

372
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,150
I'm doing this for your sake.

373
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,540
I may have studied overseas.

374
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
But I'm

375
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,300
a conservative person.

376
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,660
Honestly speaking,

377
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,100
I never wanted

378
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,510
to be with a divorced woman.

379
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,390
But

380
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,900
you're a remarkable woman.

381
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,190
That's why I made up my mind

382
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,950
to try and get along with you.

383
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,030
Mr. Ge, I know what you meant.

384
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,630
I think what you said
is quite reasonable.

385
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,340
I understand too.

386
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,540
But please disdain me.

387
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,660
Dr. Ruan,

388
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,780
I don't disdain you.

389
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,150
You got it wrong.

390
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,540
No, no.

391
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,100
I wasn't trying to disdain you.

392
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,190
I do understand
what you're trying to say.

393
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,780
Dr. Ruan.

394
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,860
I wasn't.

395
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,590
- I get it.
- Let me explain.

396
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,220
- Mr. Ge.
- Dr. Ruan, I...

397
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,100
What brings you here?

398
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,340
What are you doing?

399
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,190
What's going on here?

400
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,390
It's none of your business.

401
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,190
What?

402
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,780
I need to explain something to Dr. Ruan.

403
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,150
You can talk to her nicely.

404
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,900
You don't have to tug at her.

405
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,980
People will think
it's a medical dispute.

406
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,980
Please leave.

407
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,070
I don't want to see you.

408
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,710
But this is where I work.

409
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,190
You're harassing my student.

410
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,220
I can't just watch and do nothing.

411
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,590
Your student?

412
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,270
Yeah.

413
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
I already know.

414
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,190
Since you divorced couple

415
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,950
still fools around with each other,

416
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,470
why did you go on a blind date
with me and lie to me?

417
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,270
Why?

418
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,660
Lied to you?

419
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,340
What did she lie about?

420
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,150
Did she cheat you out
of your house or car?

421
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,300
She played with my feelings.

422
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,830
Feelings?

423
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,300
Wasn't that your wishful thinking?

424
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,540
Did she agree to date you?

425
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,470
Did you agree to date him?

426
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,590
See? She never agreed.

427
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,860
Please stop making a fuss here.

428
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,830
You're at the operating room's entrance.

429
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,590
If you keep doing this,

430
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,740
I'll call security.

431
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,780
Head Nurse, you're just in time.
Come here.

432
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,270
Deal with him.

433
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,860
What's going on?

434
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,780
Relationship dispute.

435
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,340
Let's go.

436
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:29,830
Mister.

437
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,070
Stop right there, mister.

438
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,900
This is the OR.

439
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
There are patients
undergoing surgeries now.

440
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
You're not allowed to make noise here.

441
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,860
Okay, I'll stop talking loudly.

442
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,470
I'll stop.

443
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,900
Okay, guys, drama is over.
Nothing to see anymore.

444
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,420
(Fire Safety Related Knowledge)

445
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,470
What's so funny?

446
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,900
If you can't work as a doctor
in the future,

447
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,420
you can work as a security guard.

448
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,830
I hate to say this.

449
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,830
Can't you find a reliable blind date
in the future?

450
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,590
What's your plan after work?

451
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,350
Just hire a part-timer.

452
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,660
I'm busy today.

453
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,710
I wanted to talk to you

454
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,660
about the research group.

455
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
It's okay if you're not interested.

456
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
What research group?

457
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,350
Your research group?

458
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,010
You really want me to join?

459
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,650
What's this?

460
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,200
Research data of the research group.

461
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Does that mean

462
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,440
you're very satisfied

463
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,610
with my recent performance?

464
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,770
You might as well work hard

465
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,650
than spend your time
going on blind dates

466
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,250
with that kind of man.

467
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,800
After all,

468
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,160
you're my student now.

469
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,920
If you don't do well,

470
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,280
I'll lose face.

471
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm going abroad

472
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,090
to study.

473
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,970
I don't have time

474
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,650
to buy things for you guys.

475
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,320
Please try and understand.

476
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,160
Forget it.

477
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
We'll just buy from
the overseas shopping websites.

478
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,250
Are you falling out with me?

479
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Is our friendship that fragile?

480
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,850
Which one do you want?

481
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,250
I promise!

482
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,730
I want to drink that one.

483
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,890
When I return,

484
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,280
everyone will have a gift.

485
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,520
Come on. Smile.

486
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
What did I tell you?

487
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
Besides Dr. Ning,

488
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,970
Dr. Qian is the best.

489
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,370
I like what you said about me.

490
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,090
Have you been abroad before?

491
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,890
I'll send you a video blog
when I arrived.

492
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Dr. Ding.

493
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,440
Yes. Mr. Qian.

494
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,890
While I'm away for my studies,

495
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
you'll follow Dr. Cheng.

496
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,850
Follow him?

497
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,010
Is he good?

498
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,250
I should be asking you that question.

499
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,440
Are you good?

500
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,400
Cut it out, you two.

501
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,370
Those who managed
to enter Beiya's Neurology Department

502
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,850
are capable people.

503
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,010
Dr. Cheng,

504
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,090
you're a senior.

505
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,650
You should watch over the juniors.

506
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,490
Can you do that?

507
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,850
A man cannot say that he cannot.

508
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,800
Okay, I can.

509
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,680
I have high expectations of you.

510
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,490
All right.

511
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,920
While I'm away,

512
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,920
all of you should listen to Ning.

513
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,770
You can get back to work now.

514
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll go follow up on the patients!

515
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,560
They're so energetic.

516
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,770
Don't we always listen to Dr. Ning?

517
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,280
We have always listened to Mr. Ning.

518
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,770
Look.

519
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,250
What's this?

520
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,920
See for yourself.

521
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,970
I've done this already.

522
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,090
Revise it.

523
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Why didn't Dr. Qian let Ding Yiyuan

524
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,610
follow Ning Zhiqian?

525
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,400
Do you think Qian is as foolish as you?

526
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,490
If Ding Yiyuan followed Ning Zhiqian,

527
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,490
Mr. Ding would ask for favors
from Ning Zhiqian.

528
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,920
Would he give Ning Zhiqian and Mr. Ding

529
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,090
the chance to get close?

530
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,770
Come on. Use your brain.

531
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,250
Wow, he's flexible.

532
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,970
Du Xiaoyu.

533
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,490
Du Xiao...

534
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,440
How is he feeling today?

535
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,400
Dr. Ruan.

536
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,920
You need to rest.

537
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,130
Don't

538
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,160
do such strenuous activities.

539
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,850
Understand?

540
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,280
It'll be dangerous

541
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
if the tumor on your brain stem ruptures

542
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,250
by mistake.

543
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,920
Dr. Ruan,

544
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,800
I was practicing.

545
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,090
I'm a dancer.

546
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,490
If I miss a day's practice,

547
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,090
my body won't be flexible anymore.

548
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,320
You can't practice either.

549
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,490
Dr. Ning,

550
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,920
practicing won't affect my brain, right?

551
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,370
Dr. Ruan is right.

552
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,400
It's dangerous for you to practice.

553
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,560
Hear that?

554
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,320
Sit down and get some rest.

555
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,560
Since when did the ward
become a botanical garden?

556
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,440
Ruan Liuzheng, aren't you going
to do something about this?

557
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
If he turns the ward into this,

558
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,610
how can other patients rest well?

559
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,490
It's okay.

560
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
After Xiaoyu

561
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
tidied up the room,

562
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,800
it does feel

563
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,010
like home.

564
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,890
It's very comforting

565
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:46,680
and doesn't feel that bad.

566
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,650
Even if you feel comfortable,
you still can't do this.

567
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,400
If every patient

568
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,610
does the same thing,

569
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,280
the hospital

570
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,560
won't be able
to take care of them.

571
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,400
You can only keep one plant.

572
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,890
You must never hang

573
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,610
these plush toys there.

574
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,730
If your life is in danger,

575
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,130
we wouldn't be able to save you

576
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,160
at the first moment,

577
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,200
understand?

578
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,160
Ruan Liuzheng,

579
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,090
aren't you going to say anything

580
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,440
as the doctor in charge?

581
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,730
Dr. Ding,

582
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,730
Dr. Ning didn't even say anything.

583
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,610
But you kept bossing people around.

584
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,920
Those who don't know

585
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
would think you're our superior.

586
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,250
Cheng, you talk too much.

587
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,650
Ding is right.

588
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,650
Clear everything.

589
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,920
Wu, come here.

590
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,680
Dr. Ning,

591
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,680
I've grown these succulents
for a long time.

592
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,920
I named it Little Kiddo.

593
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
It's sick like me too.

594
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,090
Can you take care of it for me?

595
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,610
I don't know how to take care of plants.

596
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,890
It's easy.

597
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
I can teach you.

598
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm too busy with work.

599
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,890
I don't have time.

600
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,520
You only need to water it every day

601
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,650
and put it under the sun.

602
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,520
After that,

603
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,200
you can talk to it once in a while.

604
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,400
Mr. Ning is busy

605
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,090
that he doesn't even have time to sleep.

606
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,890
Ning doesn't even have time to sleep.

607
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,490
Even you know about this, Dr. Ruan.

608
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,850
Let's continue with the rounds,

609
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,680
Dr. Ding.

610
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,280
These ones.

611
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,280
Change it for him.

612
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,680
- Just observe him after this.
- Okay.

613
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,730
You can give it to me.
I'll help you take care of it.

614
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,320
You look pretty energetic.

615
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,850
So I don't need
to do a follow-up check on you.

616
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,280
Remember.

617
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
Don't do any strenuous activities.

618
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,490
It's very dangerous, understand?

619
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,370
Also, wear your shoes.

620
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,490
Dr. Ruan, come here.

621
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,250
Remember what we said.

622
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,440
Help him tidy up the toys

623
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,610
and store them for him.

624
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,280
What's the matter, Mr. Ning?

625
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,250
What is it?

626
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,400
What's wrong with Du Xiaoyu?

627
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,850
Don't you watch your patient?

628
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,370
He was fine
during the ward round yesterday.

629
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,400
He became like that

630
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,370
after his friend visited him.

631
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,010
What about his parents?

632
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,400
I secretly asked his friends yesterday.

633
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,090
He's really an orphan.

634
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,920
His grandfather and father

635
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,200
all passed away
because of the brain tumor.

636
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,560
So his brain tumor is mostly genetic.

637
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,850
Oh,

638
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,130
he really wants you
to take care of this one.

639
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,010
Why don't you do a good deed

640
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,650
and help him out?

641
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,370
Take it away from me.

642
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Don't let me see it.

643
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,770
Poor thing.

644
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,200
(Nurse Station)
How do you raise succulents?

645
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,610
I don't know.

646
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,280
Let me check online.

647
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,280
We can't give it too much water.

648
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,520
Oh.

649
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,920
I have something to tell you.

650
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,440
Madam Cai's bill

651
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,610
has not been paid until today.

652
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,770
The Inpatient Department
has been rushing

653
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,890
for payment every day.

654
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,400
You're the doctor in charge.

655
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,850
So you need to take care of this.

656
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
I can see that her son

657
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,920
doesn't intend to pay up.

658
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,490
By law,

659
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,200
Madam Cai can sue him

660
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
and force him to pay

661
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,800
the medical fees
and living expenses.

662
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,130
Do you think Madam Cai bears

663
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,400
to sue her son?

664
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,010
We can't let this matter drag on.

665
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,520
The hospital has rules and regulations.

666
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,520
I know what to do.

667
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,250
(Zhanying Law Firm)

668
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:05,890
Hello.

669
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,370
Hello, may I know
who you're looking for?

670
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm here to see Mr. Xue Weilin.

671
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,040
Do you have an appointment?

672
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,130
No.

673
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
But I wish to consult him

674
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,320
on some legal issues.

675
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,090
All right. Please wait over there.

676
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,490
Follow me.

677
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,040
Let's go.

678
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,730
Okay.

679
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,280
Hello, miss.

680
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,970
Hello.

681
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,160
Are you Mr. Xue?

682
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm not Mr. Xue.

683
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,610
I'm his assistant.

684
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,560
Is it inconvenient for Mr. Xue

685
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,610
to see anyone?

686
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,200
No.

687
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,090
I need to inform you

688
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,770

a little cheaper?

Thank you.

Mr. Xue,

730
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,800
I'll excuse myself now.

731
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,610
My assistant told me

732
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,920
you wanted me to represent you
in a lawsuit.

733
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,970
I heard you only accept
commercial litigation,

734
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,730
and your fee is pretty high.

735
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,200
So I wonder

736
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,520
if you could recommend

737
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
a cheaper attorney

738
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,040
to represent a small case like mine.

739
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,850
It's okay.

740
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,800
Tell me about your case.

741
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,320
Okay.

742
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,160
Do you know Beiya Hospital?

743
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,920
It's the biggest Grade 3A hospital
in Jiangzhou City.

744
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,770
Everyone would know that.

745
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,730
Wasn't there some news

746
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,400
about their doctor beating people up
a while ago?

747

in this case.

You're the patient's family

750
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,730
who was beaten?

751

I'm

753
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,130
You were beaten?

754
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,130
Yes.

755
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,730
But we have clarified

756
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,200
this matter to the press.

757
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,130
The doctors didn't beat anyone up.

758
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,130
It was self-defense.

759
00:26:59,370 --> 00:26:59,890
Sorry about that.

760
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,920
I didn't follow up with the news.

761
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,560
It's okay.

762
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,200
So

763
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,320
you're a neurosurgeon?

764
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,440
Why? Don't I look like one?

765
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,200
I just haven't seen such

766
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,610
a beautiful female doctor.

767
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,610
Tell me what happened

768
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,730
and your demands.

769
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,680
Okay.

770
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,890
I'll do my best to keep it short.

771
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,490
I won't take too much of your time.

772
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,680
It's okay. You can take your time.

773
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,890
Okay.

774
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,040
So that was what happened.

775
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,400
I want to sue Zhang Lei for defamation

776
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,280
and want him to compensate me
for the loss of reputation.

777
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,680
Provided the evidence is sufficient,

778
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,850
it'll be easy to win this case.

779
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,970
Really?

780
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,490
How much

781
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,850
can he compensate me for this?

782
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,370
According to previous similar cases,

783
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,130
it wouldn't exceed 20 thousand yuan.

784
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,200
It's okay.

785
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,320
That's enough.

786
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,770
Thank you for your help today.

787
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,370
I've occupied 32 minutes

788
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,650
of your time today.

789
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,850
Please charge
according to the minimum standard.

790
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,850
Are you going to file the lawsuit?

791
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,560
Yes.

792
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,370
But I can't afford to hire you.

793
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,400
I'll do this pro bono.

794
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,090
Mr. Ruan and my dad

795
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,490
have been friends for decades.

796
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,770
You're his daughter.

797
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,280
You were bullied

798
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
despite having a kind heart.

799
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,730
How can I sit and do nothing?

800
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,130
I feel really bad about this.

801
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,890
You're a doctor, right?

802
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,650
Perhaps,

803
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,560
I might need your help in the future.

804
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,010
You must never ask me for help.

805
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,400
Being ill is not something good.

806
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,520
Okay.

807
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,800
It's decided then.

808
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,610
Leave this case to me.

809
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,770
So don't worry about it.

810
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,320
That's great.

811
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,490
Thank you.

812
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,890
Okay.

813
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,400
I'll leave it to you then.

814
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,040
I'll get going now.

815
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,850
Aren't you going to leave your number?

816
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,970
Ah, yes.

817
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,010
You can leave your number.

818
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,130
Oh, it's on the business card.

819
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
How about I add you
to my WeChat contact list?

820
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,920
Sure.

821
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,970
I'll scan your QR code.

822
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,090
Okay, I've sent the request.

823

Please approve it.

824
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,320
- Okay.
- Then I shall wait for your updates.

825
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,090
Thank you.

826
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,730
Don't mention it.

827

Bye-bye.

828
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,010
Bye-bye.

829
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,440
Starting today,

830
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,610
you'll start the first stage
of chemotherapy.

831
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,650
During this period, you might have

832
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,560
some side effects.

833
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,040
I know.

834
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,650
My dad did his chemotherapy
when I was young.

835
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,440
I'll lose my hair and feel nauseated.

836
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,200
I'll have no strength in my whole body.

837
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,490
If you don't feel well,

838
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,520
press the bell anytime.

839
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,560
I'll be right over.

840
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,890
I have something to do now.

841
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,770
I'll come back and see you.

842
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,800
What's wrong?

843
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,280
Dr. Ruan,

844
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,160
I'm nervous.

845
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,400
It's okay.

846
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,680
Don't be scared.

847
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,970
I'll stay with you for a little longer.

848
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,040
Dr. Ruan,

849
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,400
will I die?

850
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,970
We'll do everything we can

851
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,770
to save you.

852
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
My grandpa died when he was 45.

853
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,440
My dad died at the age of 35.

854
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,130
I got sick at 25.

855
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:24,680
I know

856
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,040
the earlier I have this disease,

857
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,440
the more malignant it'll be.

858
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,490
Don't worry.

859
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,320
So

860
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm more likely to die.

861
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,770
It's been so many years.

862
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,250
Now, medical technology
is progressing rapidly.

863
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,010
Mr. Ning is the most skilled doctor

864
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,490
in our hospital.

865
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,010
Didn't you say you trusted him?

866
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,730
Dr. Ruan,

867
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,850
have you seen Dr. Ning smile before?

868
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
I've seen him smile in the past.

869
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,970
I rarely see it now.

870
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,320
I'm curious

871
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,610
what he looks like when he smiles.

872
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,130
Why?

873
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,010
I joined the dance team at a young age.

874
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,920
I have no parents.

875
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,370
Other kids always picked on me.

876
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,440
Only one big brother

877
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,770
always took care of me

878
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,680
and was concerned about me.

879
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,730
He danced very well.

880
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,850
He's the pillar of our team.

881
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,730
But too bad

882
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,370
he was transferred to another troupe.

883
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,610
I never saw him again.

884
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,610
Guess what, Dr. Ruan.

885
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,040
Dr. Ning looks similar to him.

886
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,610
So whenever I see Dr. Ning,

887
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,400
I feel particularly close to him.

888
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,730
But he always treats me coldly.

889
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,800
That's what he's like.

890
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,970
Don't take it personally.

891
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,490
He doesn't do that to you alone.

892
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,400
He's cold to everyone.

893
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,970
Really?

894
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,770
I thought he hated me.

895
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,130
Of course, not.

896
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,800
Oh, Dr. Ruan.

897
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,850
Can you do me a favor?

898
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,680
What is it?

899
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,090
I know

900
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,970
I'll lose my hair from chemotherapy.

901
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,560
So

902
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,370
can you take a picture of me?

903
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,650
Sure.

904
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,920
Give me your phone.

905
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,850
It's in the drawer.

906
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,010
Smile.

907
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,010
Thank you, Dr. Ruan.

908
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,200
Do you feel any discomfort?

909
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,090
Does it hurt?

910
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,730
Do it slowly.

911
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,010
Relax.

912
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,490
Repeat what you said just now.

913
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,440
I said,

914
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,440
can you visit Du Xiaoyu

915
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,800
and smile for him?

916
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,490
I'm a doctor, not an entertainer.

917
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,320
It's something

918
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,800
you can do pretty easily.

919
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,610
Can you say something nice

920
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,280
to lighten him up

921
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,090
and comfort him?

922
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,160
It's not that hard.

923
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,610
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

924
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,320
Mr. Ning,

925
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,250
you know about Du Xiaoyu's condition

926
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,520
more than I do.

927
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,520
The tumor on his brain stem

928
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,920
is probably the most malignant

929
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,010
glioblastoma.

930
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,560
He'll die if he doesn't do the surgery.

931
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,160
The prognosis is not ideal even
after we remove the tumor.

932
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,680
In his case,

933
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,680
his five-year survival rate
is less than five percent.

934
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,250
So?

935
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,770
So I hope he has a better time

936
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,730
in the hospital.

937
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,970
Dr. Ruan,

938
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,130
your job is not
to make the patient happy,

939
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,970
but to cure him.

940
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,090
So he can keep living.

941
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
What's the difference?

942
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,730
I'll say this one more time.

943
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,090
You must keep your distance

944
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,200
from the patients as far as possible.

945
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,200
Why?

946
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,850
It helps you
to be objective and rational

947
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,010
as a doctor.

948
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, my. You're all grown up.

949
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,920
When I first saw you,

950
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,970
you were just this small.

951
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,130
You're now this tall in a flash.

952
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,730
Come with me.

953
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,320
Come.

954
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,160
Time sure flies.

955
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,160
Let's play another round.

956
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,010
Your dad and I

957
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,280
are equally skilled

958
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,040
and capable opponents in chess.

959
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,240
Neither one of us would give in.

960
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,610
Xue, have some drinks.

961
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,560
Thank you, Madam.

962
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,170
When my dad has free time,

963
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,280
he always makes me play chess with him.

964
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,090
What did I tell you?

965
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,170
Let's play one round.

966
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:16,450
Come.

967
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,760
Okay.

968
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,410
I'll go first.

969
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:17,930
You can go first.

970
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:18,850
I'll move the Elephant.

971
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,130
Say,

972
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,090
he has such a handsome face
and he's a lawyer too.

973
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,320
He sure does.

974
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,370
Dad. Mom, I'm home.

975
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,850
Dr. Ruan, you're back.

976
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,520
Mr. Xue,

977
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,130
what are you doing here?

978
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,760
I happened to be working nearby.

979
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,000
So I dropped by to visit your parents.

980
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,760
Sit down.

981
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,040
Xue,

982
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,240
go and sit on the sofa.

983
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,890
We're in the middle
of playing chess here.

984
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,650
Stop playing

985
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,280
for a while.

986
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,520
Xue, take a seat.

987
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,520
Then I'll continue the game
with you later.

988
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,090
Okay, go and take a seat.

989
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,370
They look good together.

990
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,800
What do you mean?

991
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
They look good together.

992
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,240
Shall we talk

993
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
about the case?

994
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,720
Let's talk outside.

995
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,690
Follow me.

996
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,960
Come back for dinner, okay?

997
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,370
Okay. Mr. and Mrs. Ruan,

998
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,170
we'll be heading out.

999
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,210
- Okay. Come back early.
- Okay.

1000
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,040
Come back early.

1001
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:22,760
The court

1002
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,800
has filed your case.

1003
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,210
Thank you so much.

1004
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,130
You're really efficient.

1005
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,560
I don't like dragging things

1006
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,000
when I do something.

1007
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,450
Dr. Ruan,

1008
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,560
you can wait for my good news.

1009
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,650
Who's that?

1010
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Let me introduce you guys.

1011
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:37,850
This is my brother, Ruan Lang.

1012
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,320
This is Mr. Xue,

1013
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,130
my friend.

1014
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,090
Hello.

1015
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm Xue Weilin.

1016
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,760
I've never heard

1017
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
of him before.

1018
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,000
Dr. Ruan and I

1019
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,800
only met not too long ago.

1020
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,130
You only met not long ago.

1021
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,610
But you already chased her
all the way home.

1022
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Don't you think you have no manners?

1023
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,800
Ruan Lang,

1024
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,800
Mr. Xue

1025
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
is the son of Uncle Xue,

1026
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,890
our dad's good friend.

1027
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,410
Our families are old friends.

1028
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,280
So Dad introduced him to you?

1029
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,000
Since when is he this nosy?

1030
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,450
It's getting late.

1031
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,450
I should go back first.

1032
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,720
I'll see you off.

1033
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,480
Mr. Xue,

1034
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,000
it's pretty late.

1035
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,320
If my sister sees you off,

1036
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,320
she'll have to walk back home alone.

1037
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,000
It's pretty dangerous.

1038
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,930
Otherwise,

1039
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,210
I'll have to go and pick her up.

1040
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,210
How about both of us see you off?

1041
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,210
It's okay.

1042
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,280
I'll get going then.

1043
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,890
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1044
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,690
We won't walk you then.

1045
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,930
A gentleman never uses violence.

1046
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,480
What was wrong with you?

1047
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,650
Yes, something is wrong with me.

1048
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,210
Please send me to the hospital.

1049
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
I want to find my brother-in-law.

1050
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Can't you get over it?

1051
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,130
Remember when I say this.

1052
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,240
I, Ruan Lang,

1053
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,320
have only one brother-in-law.

1054
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,690
He's Ning Zhiqian.

1055
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,890
What?

1056
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,520
Is he a leader of some cult

1057
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
that brainwashed you to this extent?

1058
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,480
Liuzheng, you don't get it, do you?

1059
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,650
Men are very mysterious creatures.

1060
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,320
What's the name of the guy
we met just now?

1061
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,170
His name is Xue Weilin.

1062
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,170
Just his name alone sounds

1063
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,450
like Hypocritical Lin.
[*Hypocritical: rhymes with Xue Weilin]

1064
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,040
He just wants to fool around with you.

1065
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,170
I can see right through him.

1066
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:20,930
Listen.

1067
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,090
Stop overthinking.

1068
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,800
He's helping me with a lawsuit now.

1069
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,760
Don't get the wrong idea.

1070
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,960
That proved I was right.

1071
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,130
He'll take the lawsuit as his chance

1072
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,130
to fool around with you.

1073
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,210
It's over once he gets what he wants.

1074
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:32,890
Shut up.

1075
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,610
Hello?

1076
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,280
Bank?

1077
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,320
Yes, I've been driving the car.

1078
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,280
What?

1079
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,890
Stop it, Liuzheng.

1080
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm busy.

1081
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,610
Zero down payment?

1082
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,610
Cut it out.

1083
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,210
How much is it a month?

1084
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
What? 5900 yuan?

1085
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,090
Dad.

1086
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,610
What are you doing?

1087
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,170
Stop picking on your sister.

1088
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,240
I wasn't picking on her.

1089
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,650
I'm teaching her how to dance.

1090
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,610
What were you guys doing?

1091
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,280
What did you do?

1092
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,850
Liuzheng, why can't you understand

1093
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,210
my good intention?

1094
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,650
I wanted you to save some time

1095
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,850
so you can tend to more patients

1096
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,320
and learn more knowledge.

1097
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,800
Apart from that,

1098
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,040
I showed them your photo.

1099
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,560
So a beautiful woman like you

1100
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,450
deserved a zero down payment

1101
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,040
and a discount.

1102
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,610
It's a limited edition,

1103
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,890
which matches you.

1104
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,560
Stop right there.

1105
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You can let me trick you.

1106
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,450
But don't let other men do the same.

1107
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,480
Listen here!

1108
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,760
Don't meddle in my affairs.

1109
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,960
If I don't, would you grow up like this?

1110
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,720
I wasn't talking to you.

1111
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,610
Unbelievable.

1112
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,450
What's the matter?

1113
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,370
I could hear

1114
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,720
you acting mischievous from outside.

1115
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,890
Why are you still awake, brat?

1116
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,760
Stop playing around.

1117
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,240
Come here!

1118
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,760
Sleep with me.

1119
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,650
- Or else I
- I can't sleep.

1120
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,690
- won't sleep.
- I need to work.

1121
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,480
Go to bed.

1122
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,650
If you don't sleep with me,

1123
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,800
I'll stay awake.

1124
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,000
Dad,

1125
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,370
Mom

1126
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,320
hasn't come for days.

1127
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,890
Is she going on blind dates again?

1128
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,520
She has been busy working these days.

1129
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,040
So she has no free time.

1130
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,650
Even if she doesn't go on blind dates,

1131
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,040
what if another man

1132
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,410
goes after her?

1133
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,170
That's not likely to happen.

1134
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,280
So don't worry about it.

1135
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,040
In any case, I don't want a stepfather.

1136
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,520
That depends on your mom.

1137
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,130
No, it depends on you.

1138
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,240
Why me?

1139
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,450
Because you must protect Mom.

1140
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,410
Do you understand?

1141
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,040
Are you telling me what to do?

1142
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,930
Because if you get in Mom's way,

1143
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,040
no guys can snatch her away.

1144
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,610
Am I right?

1145
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,450
You have a point.

1146
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,960
Dad,

1147
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,960
are doctors the most formidable people

1148
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,240
in the world?

1149
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,690
Why are you asking?

1150
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,370
When my teacher found out

1151
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,090
you're a doctor,

1152
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,410
she kept asking me about you.

1153
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,370
What did she ask?

1154
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,240
She asked which hospital

1155
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,320
and department you're in,

1156
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,280
and your...

1157
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,450
Uh... Job title.

1158
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
What else did she ask?

1159
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,480
She asked if Mom was living with us.

1160
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,560
She even asked
such a personal question, huh?

1161
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,280
So what did you tell her?

1162
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,280
I didn't know what to say.

1163
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,930
So I ran to the toilet to pee.

1164
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,210
That was a smart move.

1165
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,210
If your teacher asks you again,

1166
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,370
just tell her to call me directly

1167
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,760
if she has any questions.

1168
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,610
If it's within my means,

1169
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,890
I'll do my best to help.

1170
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,690
Okay?

1171
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,410
One more thing.

1172
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,130
If she asks about your mom again,

1173
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,090
just tell her that Mom lives with us

1174
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,480
and sleeps with me every day.

1175
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,690
Why must I lie to the teacher?

1176
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,560
Lying is not right.

1177
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,000
No, how is this lying?

1178
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,320
Mom is not home.

1179
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,690
But I tell the teacher

1180
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,130
that Mom is home.

1181
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,450
This is called "lying".

1182
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,370
Understand?

1183
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,240
Dad,

1184
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,960
are doctors the most formidable people

1185
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,090
in the world?

1186
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,610
You'll know when you're older.

1187
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,850
Go to bed.

1188
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,760
Sleep with me.

1189
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,560
I don't want to sleep with you.

1190
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,450
Come on. Sleep with me.

1191
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,480
I have to work. Go to bed now.

1192
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,650
Sleep with me.

1193
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,480
Go to bed.

1194
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,520
- Sleep with me!
- Go to bed!

1195
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,760
- Go to bed.
- Come on. Sleep with me.

1196
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,410
Go to bed.

1197
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,930
- Sleep with me.
- I said, sleep.

1198
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,410
Go to bed.

1199
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,850
Sleep with me.

1200
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,410
- Fine.
- Stay with me.

1201
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,130
- Sleep with me.
- I'll sleep with you. One. Two. Three.

1202
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,760
Time for bed.

1203
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,320
Get some sleep.

1204
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:03,960
Sleep.

1205
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,760
Don't go, okay?

1206
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,090
I won't.

1207
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't grab me.

1208
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,450
I'm afraid you'll leave.

1209
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,240
Close your eyes and sleep.
