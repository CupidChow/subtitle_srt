00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,339
Miss Meguru Aizawa?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,758
I'm Kanade Oe from Umezono High School.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>We need your help, Miss Aizawa.</i>

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,555
He's so quick.

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>I joined back as a freshman.</i>

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,268
<i>But school clubs</i>
<i>aren't very time-effective.</i>

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,519
Time-effective?

9
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,271
Devoted their youths?

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,023
Isn't that asking too much of them?

11
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>If I could beat her at just one thing,</i>

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,194
then maybe I would cry.

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,115
So you do want to play <i>karuta</i>?

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,409
I just forgot to get a parent's signature.

15
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,661
<i>And she seemed so close</i>
<i>to sticking around.</i>

16
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,540
<i>Everyone goes at their own pace.</i>

17
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>With the spread of COVID-19,</i>

18
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>the Tokyo Stock Market saw</i>
<i>a dramatic, temporary drop in share prices</i>

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>by more than 1,000 yen.</i>

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,807
Everything's going crazy, huh?

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,144
It's like something out of a movie.

22
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,896
What's going to happen?

23
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,690
Makes you think, doesn't it?

24
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,275
About what?

25
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,486
Just what if, you know.

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,866
Like, what if we had taken the money
for Meguru's junior high entrance exam

27
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,911
and invested it all now,

28
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,998
then maybe in ten years' time,
we'd have been able to FIRE.

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,167
You're shameless!

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,337
-Huh?
-Actually, sorry. I had the same thought.

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,588
Right?

32
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:35,303
Who'd have thought all that time and money
would just go down the drain?

33
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,223
Maybe we should've given it more thought.

34
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,809
About if she didn't get in anywhere.

35
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,604
That poor thing though.

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,273
We put nothing but pressure on her.

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,375
-Morning.
-Morning.

38
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,584
Hey, sis.

39
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,130
I told you to switch accounts
when you use YouTube, right?

40
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

41
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,552
My feed's full of <i>karuta </i>stuff now.

42
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,055
Oh no. My face is reflected in the glass.

43
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,182
Come on, I'll be late.

44
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,810
One sec.
I can't have my face in the photo.

45
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,271
Morning, Meguru! I signed this for you.

46
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,564
Right.

47
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,692
Hey, I didn't know you
were in a <i>karuta </i>club.

48
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,986
I just forgot to leave it.

49
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,237
Oh, really?

50
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,409
Wise choice though. No point
in starting in your sophomore year.

51
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,954
It's not like <i>karuta</i>
will ever come in handy.

52
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,540
Yeah… I guess not.

53
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,167
-See you later.
-Wait! Here.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,210
Huh? That was a close one. Thanks.

55
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,920
-See you.
-Bye.

Morning.

66
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,559
You scared me.

00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,019

68
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,270
Morning.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,731
What're you listening to?

70
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,943
-Songs.
-What songs?

71
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,695
<i>Waka </i>poetry. You know <i>waka</i>?

72
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,989
<i>Waka</i>? I know <i>waka</i>, <i>waka</i>.

73
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
That's enough of that.

74
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,204
-Checks out though.
-Checks out?

75
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,999
I saw you at the school festival.
The <i>karuta </i>club, right?

76
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,836
Actually, I was going to quit today--

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,130
I want to join too. The <i>karuta </i>club.

78
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,800
Huh.

79
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,969
Huh?

80
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,553
Huh?!

81
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,181
We have one!

82
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,310
Mr. Yono! Don't run in the hall!

83
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm sorry, Mr. Principal!

84
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,732
We have one!

85
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,317
We have one!

86
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,988
We have one, Miss Oe!

87
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,365
We have one, Miss Oe!

88
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,408
Huh?

89
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,287
What is it, Mr. Yono?

90
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,248
We finally have an applicant!

91
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,249
What did you say?

92
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,126
We did it!

93
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,294
We did it!

94
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,472
I'm so sorry.

CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:31,039
POEM TWO:
THE WHITE BEADS OF DEW

97
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,290
Do you regret it?

98
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,000
Quitting the baseball club.

99
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,462
Forget me. There was no need
for you to quit, Haruma.

100
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,798
I shall not miss my bench-warming duties.

101
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,723
It's not fair.

102
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,145
All that strength,
just 'cause they're boys.

103
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,857
With me being an exception to that rule.

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,904
Hey, Chieri.

105
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,947
Over here.

106
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,199
Throw me the ball.

107
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,493
I don't know.

108
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,162
I'm not sure I can throw that far.

109
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,664
Of course you can.

110
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
Come on, quick.

111
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,710
Enough already.

112
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,713
-I'll come get it.
-Stay back!

113
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
Huh?

114
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,475
Whoa! You're kidding me!

115
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,478
Dummy!

116
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,861
I'll begin with the basics
of competitive <i>karuta</i>.

117
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,947
At the start of the game,

118
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,784
you and your opponent
both have 25 cards like this

119
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:55,248
in each of your territories, on which
poems from the <i>Hyakunin Isshu </i>are written.

120
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:00,420
It looks like only the second halves
of the poems are written on them.

121
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,296
That's right!

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,718
These cards are only to be used
for the players to pick up.

123
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,596
When a poem's first half is read out,

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,892
the players have to find
the second half of the same poem…

125
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,857
and take it before their opponent.

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,608
Let's play a few hands.

127
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,735
-If you would, Miss Oe.
-Certainly.

128
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,418
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

129
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,838
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

131
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,925
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,181
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,603
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

134
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,356
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

135
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,524
What's that?

136
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,818
It's…

137
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,571
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yes.

138
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,574
A very refined voice.

139
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,330
-Shall we go take a look?
-Huh?

140
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,873
-Quick!
-We're going?

141
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,459
Where's it coming from?

142
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,419
I'm not sure.

143
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,799
<i>For this journey's sake</i>
<i>I could prepare no tribute</i>

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,010
<i>May the many hues</i>

00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,060
<i>Of Tamuke's autumn leaves</i>

146
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,981
<i>Be made offerings instead</i>

00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,901
<i>Hear how the waves crash</i>

148
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,070
<i>Into Suminoe's cliffs</i>

149
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,947
<i>Be it night or day</i>

150
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,324
It's Miss Oe, the classics teacher.

151
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,787
With that really enthusiastic guy,
Sota Yono,

152
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,707
and… Fuki Shirano from the boxing club.

153
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,169
Talk about a strange group.

154
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,510
<i>Looking at the moon</i>
<i>I feel rended to pieces</i>

155
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,470
Are they playing cards?

156
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,723
It's competitive <i>karuta</i>.

157
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,393
<i>Karuta</i>?

158
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,065
I feel like he keeps getting the cards
the moment you start reading.

159
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,150
You're a keen one.

160
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:35,992
Look at this.

161
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,829
These are practice cards.

162
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,248
Practice cards?

163
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,958
There are characters on it.

164
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,004
As the name implies,
there are 100 <i>Hyakunin Isshu </i>poems.

165
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,756
But to put it another way,
there are only 100.

166
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,802
So you can identify a card
just by hearing the first few syllables.

167
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,597
Right. I see.

168
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,765
For example…

169
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,935
Here.

170
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,770
"Shira."

171
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,818
"Shira."

172
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,738
That's the "white beads of dew" card.

173
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:21,120
There are only two cards that begin "shi."
One is "shino" and the other "shira."

174
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,290
-Meaning?
-You can get them from two syllables?

175
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,375
Bravo! I'd expect no less, Miss Murata.

176
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,753
You know a lot about this, Haruma.

177
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,671
It's common knowledge, no?

178
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,217
This should be a good card for you,
Shirano.

179
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,138
It's easy to become familiar with cards
that contain your name.

180
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,766
It's the sound we're most used to hearing.

181
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,227
I see.

182
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,151
What does it--

183
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,153
I'm glad you asked!

184
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>The white beads of dew</i>

185
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,659
<i>Buffeted so by the wind</i>
<i>Scattered in this way</i>

186
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>Across the autumn meadow</i>
<i>Like jewels that defy the thread</i>

187
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,540
So how do you know all this stuff?

188
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,543
It's morning, deep into the fall.

189
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,964
The glistening dew on the leaves
is blown by the wind

190
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,427
<i>and scatters everywhere,</i>
<i>like beautiful pearls.</i>

191
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,808
ACROSS THE AUTUMN MEADOW
LIKE JEWELS THAT DEFY THE THREAD

192
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,227
It's a beautiful poem.

193
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,230
Yes, it is! You can appreciate that?

194
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,732
A strong wind blows in an autumnal meadow,

195
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:36,696
sending white dewdrops scattering
and glistening like pearls--

196
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,822
Oh yeah!

197
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,658
Are you free this Saturday?

198
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,036
There's a tournament at the civic hall
in the morning.

199
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,579
Great, I'll be there.

200
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,126
I'm not good with mornings.

201
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,086
Huh? Are you going?

202
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,671
What about Aizawa?

203
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,632
Will she be playing?

204
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,761
Miss Aizawa is…

205
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,230
What's that sound?

206
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,652
Miss Aizawa?

207
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,280
You came!

208
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,157
-No, I was--
-Please, come in.

209
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,869
We were just talking about going
to Mr. Yono's singles tournament.

210
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,829
No, I…

211
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,832
Here.

212
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,671
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

213
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,549
You should come too if--

214
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,259
I have cram school now, so…

215
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,440
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

217
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,485
Now, <i>The Pillow Book</i>

218
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,821
is a collection
of over 300 assorted writings,

219
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,656
many of them short in form.

220
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,243
The most famous of these,
<i>In Spring, the Dawn…</i>

221
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,112
Haruma.

222
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,377
That's…

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,980
Good. Even better than before.

224
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,356
-Really?
-Yes.

225
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:24,071
Whichever way I look at it,
I can tell you're interested in <i>karuta</i>.

226
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,031
Let's go inside now.

227
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,950
I told you I don't want to.

228
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,911
Watching from out here suits me just fine.

229
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,663
Don't you get it?

230
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,458
So it's love at this point, is it?

231
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,506
-It's not me.
-Me neither.

232
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,770
There's nobody there.

233
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,607
-I wonder what that was.
-Yeah.

234
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,327
The tropics span the low latitudes
close to the equator.

235
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,330
The temperatures are high
and rainfall is heavy,

236
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,497
so forest resources…

237
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,500
RESULT FOR DESIRED UNIVERSITY

238
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,794
GRADE: D
DEVIATION VALUE: 63.2

239
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,634
-See you later.
-Later.

240
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,845
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

241
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,731
-Oh!
-Oh!

242
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,654
Actually, we went on
to the All Japan grand finals and won.

243
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,573
You won? That's amazing.

244
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,868
Our school's won
for several years running now.

245
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,163
And not only that,
I won the singles final.

246
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,791
So you're the best in Japan?

247
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,377
Well, the best high-schooler.

248
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,797
I didn't realize
I was playing such a great player.

249
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,632
Did you keep <i>karuta </i>up?

250
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,301
Not at all.

251
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,095
No way.

252
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,556
And there I thought
you were kind of interested.

253
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,434
Well, I was, kind of.

254
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,769
Then why hesitate?

255
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,646
Play <i>karuta</i>.

256
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,649
I…

257
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,944
Kenshin. Kenshin Orie.

258
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,654
Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,950
Why <i>karuta</i>, Mr. Orie?

260
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,161
Why <i>karuta</i>…

261
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,831
To get a reference for college?

262
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,375
Huh? You can get a reference?

263
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,336
Yeah. If you place first
or second in the All Japan.

264
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,588
Only for the best, then, huh?

265
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,215
Well, you know.

266
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,301
Well, I'm this way.

267
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,053
Goodbye, then.

268
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,055
One second.

269
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,516
Don't move.

270
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,101
Huh?

271
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,602
It's following you.

272
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,567
Huh? What is it?

273
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,068
It's all over you.

274
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:09,778
Huh?

275
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,073
Ouch! What are you doing?

276
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,075
She doesn't seem to like that.

277
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,411
You okay?

278
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,456
Huh? What are you doing here?

279
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,710
A mosquito. Look.

280
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,882
So, Mr. Conclusion-Jumper,

281
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,593
you a friend of Meguru's?

282
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,304
We're classmates.

283
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,056
Umezono, then?

284
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,433
I'm sorry about that.

285
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,227
Don't sweat it, stud.

286
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,021
See you around.

287
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,110
You can call me Kenshin, by the way.

288
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,363
No, that's all right.

289
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,826
Huh? Your boyfriend?

290
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,828
Don't be stupid. No.

291
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,831
Anyway, why are you here?

292
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,419
I was just passing through,
doing some roadwork.

293
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,589
What's roadwork?

294
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,469
I never knew
this was on the other side of the station.

295
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,267
-Dad.
-Hey, Fuki.

296
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,188
Oh?

297
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh?

298
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,484
Fuki.

299
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,112
-Is this…
-Huh?

300
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,488
…what I think it is?

301
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,865
Is that what it is? Is it?

302
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,787
Actually, you came at just the right time.

303
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,623
-Huh?
-Come on in.

304
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,167
SHIRANO BOXING GYM
TAKING NEW STUDENTS!

305
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,585
Hello?

306
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,630
I'm going to have dinner out,
then come home.

307
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,674
Yeah.

308
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,885
It just kind of ended up that way.

309
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,055
Yeah. Okay.

310
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,684
FUKI SHIRANO
FIRST PLACE, MEN'S FLYWEIGHT

311
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,394
All right. Is that done?

312
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
What are you going to eat, Nanami?

313
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,941
-Lots of meat, right?
-Meat and…

314
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,026
-Do we have enough veggies?
-We do.

315
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,820
Fill yourselves up.

316
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,739
Come on over.

317
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,159
-Are your parents okay with it?
-Yes.

318
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,202
Come and tuck in, then!

319
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,871
Please, take a seat.

320
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,874
-Thank you.
-There you are.

321
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,791
Thanks.

322
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,587
Fuki started boxing
when he was five years old.

323
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,381
He was a real quick learner.

324
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,217
He even went undefeated in junior high.

325
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,552
Thank you.

326
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,972
I guess he inherited all of my talent.

327
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,808
-That's what you really wanted to say.
-Well…

328
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,351
-Some rice.
-Thank you.

329
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,272
He just seems to love boxing so much,
there's no stopping him.

330
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,276
He's been on
a losing streak lately though.

331
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,945
We found out it's due to an injury.

332
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,159
So you're doing that thing
to keep your reflexes sharp till it heals.

333
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,620
What's it called again?

334
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,830
-Competitive <i>karuta</i>.
-That's the one.

335
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,876
-Another oddball thing he's started.
-Easy there, Dad.

336
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,504
-Aizawa's in the <i>karuta </i>club too.
-Oh? Excuse me, then!

337
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,675
That reminds me, Fuki.

338
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,720
I got you  an appointment
at a new clinic on Saturday.

339
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,597
What? Saturday?

340
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,434
There's a tournament at the civic hall
in the morning.

341
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,769
Great, I'll be there.

342
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,771
Saturday's…

343
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
It took me ages to find a place this good.

344
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,109
It'll be fine.

345
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,113
You'll be boxing again in no time
once it's healed.

346
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
-And you, Meguru?
-Yes?

347
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,539
Anything you put a lot of work into?

348
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,085
Investing, maybe.

349
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,003
-Investing?
-Yes.

350
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,756
Did you just say investing?

351
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,634
-Yes.
-I…

352
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,847
A while back, I invested a load of cash,
and it lost half its value.

353
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,557
What? You never told me.

354
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,521
Please coach me.

355
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,524
What should I buy with my NISA account?

356
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,986
Let's see.

357
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,571
First of all…

358
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,283
Yes?

359
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,371
You're going wrong from the moment
you ask someone what stocks to buy.

360
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,873
Total shutdown!

361
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,542
Way to go, Meguru!

362
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,168
Let him have some more!

363
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,712
Dad's already down.

364
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,131
Are you okay, Daddy?

365
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,926
What? You're quitting the <i>karuta </i>club?

366
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,220
Yeah. Well…

367
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,348
Like ships in the night. Why?

368
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,268
I feel like

369
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,063
it's wasted on me.

370
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,692
Wasted on you? <i>Karuta</i>?

371
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,819
Not so much <i>karuta</i>

372
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,780
as having a youth.

373
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,908
Huh? What do you mean?

374
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:13,623
What made you so interested
in <i>karuta </i>anyway, Shirano?

375
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,836
<i>If it was you whom I met</i>

376
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,839
<i>I cannot be sure</i>

377
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>-What? You were there?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

378
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,846
<i>So I'm the reason?</i>

379
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,973
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

380
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,642
I feel like I should apologize.

381
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,356
But you'll be back to boxing
once your injury's healed, right?

382
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,153
Well, I'm not so sure.

383
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,490
You mean you won't?

384
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,991
It's just

385
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,537
before I was old enough to even know
what was going on, I was boxing.

386
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,874
I didn't think to do it myself.

387
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,002
Or rather, I wasn't thinking at all.

388
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,297
That's what I think

389
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,841
is so amazing about you.

390
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,928
How do you work that out?

391
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,763
You have your own will.

392
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,894
I just followed
the process of elimination.

393
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,771
Even so.

394
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,110
I feel like I'm paying the price now

395
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,695
for all the choices I never made.

396
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,410
Basically, I'm an empty shell.

397
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,580
That's why

398
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,749
I started playing <i>karuta</i>.

399
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,085
Now I'm kinda having fun.

400
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,384
Are you coming Saturday?

401
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,688
An empty shell.

402
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,574
Me too.

403
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:25,714
SATURDAY

404
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,349
I don't see Mr. Shirano or Miss Aizawa.

405
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,977
No.

406
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,522
Shall we get going?

407
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,321
COMPETITIVE KARUTA
MINAMI-TAMA C-CLASS TOURNAMENT

408
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,909
<i>What is in fact Yoshino</i>

409
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>Under a snow-white blanket</i>

410
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,376
<i>Evening descends</i>
<i>Kadota's paddy rustles</i>

411
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,338
<i>With swaying rice leaves</i>

412
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,923
Number 1.

413
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,884
It's her.

414
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,305
Are you at Mizusawa?

415
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,642
Nagi. Nagi Tsukiura.

416
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,077
This is…

417
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,336
Jab. Okay.

418
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,755
Move.

419
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,257
Jab. And block.

420
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,758
Respond. Do something.

421
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,842
Okay.

422
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,096
Huh?

423
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,848
Teacher!

424
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,852
You're here in person, teacher!

425
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,020
Teacher?

426
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,398
What are you talking about, teacher?

427
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,901
You taught me so much about investing
when we last met.

428
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,530
So that's what…

429
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,658
-Is this…?
-Oh, sorry.

430
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,080
I thought it might help you out,
even if only a little.

431
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,165
Here you are.

432
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,630
How did Fuki's trip to the clinic go?

433
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,217
He said his hand was better.

434
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,719
Better?

435
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,598
He asked me to let him go see the <i>karuta</i>
now he's better,

436
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,392
and I said catching up
with boxing comes first.

437
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,602
So here he is.

438
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:52,736
At any rate, I'm sure he's happy
to be back in the ring.

439
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,910
Hey, Haruma!

440
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,413
What?

441
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,047
<i>How can I decide</i>
<i>Who I should choose as my friend?</i>

442
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,925
The reader always begins
with the second half of the poem

443
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,428
that they read out last.

444
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,640
<i>The pines of Takasago</i>

445
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:27,062
<i>Are not my acquaintances</i>

446
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,689
<i>Looking at the moon</i>

447
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,691
Then it's the next poem.

448
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,113
Being able to tell the first few syllables
of a poem's opening part is vital,

449
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:42,202
so when the reader begins,
everyone in the vicinity must be silent.

450
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,120
Got it.

451
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,876
Looks like Yono won a hand.

452
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,713
Miss Oe's here to cheer him on too.

453
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,632
Where's Shirano?

454
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,806
I once fought this really tough guy.

455
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,939
<i>I was totally outclassed.</i>

456
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,444
<i>It was around then that all this stuff</i>
<i>started creeping into my head.</i>

457
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,827
<i>Like, is this really what I want to do?</i>

458
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,621
<i>It was like my head was empty so long</i>

459
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,291
<i>that once I started thinking that way,</i>
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

460
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,715
My hand got better, but I kept it quiet.

461
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,848
What am I even saying?

462
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,976
Sorry. Pretend you didn't hear that.

463
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,908
Hey.

464
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,246
Come practice with me later
when you're done with work.

465
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,957
Huh?

466
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,839
I'm not sure I'd be any good.

467
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,716
That's not what I meant.

468
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,679
Karuta <i>has different grades</i>
<i>for each ability level.</i>

469
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,265
Everyone starts out in E-class.

470
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,727
Then, by winning tournaments,

471
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,605
you work your way up to D-class,
C-class, and so on.

472
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,608
In order for Mr. Yono
to be promoted to B-class,

473
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,110
he needs to make it to the final.

474
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,403
Good luck.

475
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,530
Huh.

476
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,408
<i>That grow by Naniwa Bay</i>

477
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:50,580
<i>You would not see me again?</i>

478
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,958
<i>Hear how the waves crash…</i>

479
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,460
-Thank you.
-Yes!

480
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,086
All right!

481
00:29:59,047 --> 00:29:59,881
Oh?

482
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,602
Perfect timing.

483
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
I promised to give
the cards back tomorrow.

484
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,193
Hey, are we seriously doing it here?

485
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,279
Where else? There's no tatami mats.

486
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,032
Okay. Let's get started.

487
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,367
Okay.

488
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,537
Right.

489
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,331
<i>In Naniwa Bay…</i>

490
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,000
<i>I've suddenly got more supporters.</i>

491
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,003
Please, don't mind us.

492
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,047
Yono.

493
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,715
Keep it up!

494
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,010
Not that we've ever talked before.

495
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,473
The next matchups are set.

496
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,649
I saw her at the school festival.

497
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,861
Miss Nagi Tsukiura.

498
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,030
Keep winning and you're sure to play her.

499
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,616
A shot at redemption.

500
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,744
Yes. For the both of us.

501
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,206
<i>And Miss Aizawa.</i>

502
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,876
<i>Going round the path…</i>

503
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,085
That was fast!

504
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,337
I was taught this one.

505
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,132
You know your stuff.

506
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,301
The next one's mine.

507
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,635
Here we go.

508
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,180
<i>For behind a single cloud</i>

509
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:37,478
<i>The moon that night did vanish</i>

510
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,971
Hold on.

511
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,223
We're way too bad at this.

512
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,517
Hold on. My stomach hurts.

513
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,896
I'm not used to using these muscles.

514
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,691
I can't remember
when I last laughed so much.

515
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,234
Me either.

516
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,280
Tell me.

517
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,077
What's so wrong with having a youth?

518
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,003
If you don't want to talk about it,
that's fine.

519
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,261
I think I know when it began.

520
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,017
I heard something.

521
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:03,106
Like, what if we had taken the money
for Meguru's junior high entrance exam

522
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,441
and invested it all now,

523
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,779
then maybe in ten years' time,
we'd have been able to FIRE.

524
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:16,869
Who'd have thought all that time and money
would just go down the drain?

525
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,081
Maybe we should've given it more thought.

526
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,166
<i>I didn't feel sad or anything.</i>

527
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,335
Just furious.

528
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,546
Furious?

529
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,173
My parents' care for me…

530
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,467
The money…

531
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,553
The time…

532
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,596
The friends…

533
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,225
I couldn't forgive myself
for wasting them all.

534
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,896
So you decided there's no room for youth?

535
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,002
Oh crap.

536
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,339
Hello, Miss Oe.

537
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,217
<i>Mr. Shirano? I'm so glad I got through.</i>

538
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm sorry about today. I…

539
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,515
<i>It's okay. As long as you're safe. Anyway,</i>

540
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,392
Mr. Yono's doing really great.

541
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:25,104
He's still in the tournament.
It's the semifinals next!

542
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,940
What? Sota's winning?

543
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,862
Sorry, Aizawa. I've gotta go.

544
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,074
<i>Miss Aizawa? Is she there too?</i>

545
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,826
Yeah, she's with me right now.

546
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,124
Right.

547
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,460
See you later.

548
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:58,179
She said they were waiting at the station
for us till the last minute.

549
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,098
Shall we get going?

550
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,183
A little longer.

551
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,646
Please let me wait a little longer.

552
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,606
Mr. Yono.

553
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,276
I don't want to give up.

554
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,363
It may have been just once,

555
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,075
but the two of them
showed an interest in <i>karuta</i>.

556
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,065
All right.

557
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,569
If I win here,
I get that B-class promotion.

558
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,073
I suspect Miss Tsukiura's specialty cards
are "looking at the moon"

559
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,908
and "deep into the night."

560
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,577
Look out for those.

561
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,955
I get "looking at the moon,"
but why "deep into the night"?

562
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,793
Because it was composed by Sei Shonagon.

563
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,005
Sei Shonagon?
The person from the textbooks?

564
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:20,094
Yes. She's another female author,
said to be the rival of Murasaki Shikibu.

565
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,347
Famous for the phrase "most charming."

566
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,101
Most charming? That's the one!
But what's the connection?

567
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,272
"Sei Shonagon" was a kind of nickname,
not her real one.

568
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,901
According to one theory,
her real name… was Nagiko.

569
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,740
Kiyohara Nagiko.

570
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,409
That's got to be it.

571
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,037
It's only you two
getting excited about that.

572
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,955
Not necessarily.

573
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,665
And to prove it,

574
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:54,212
Miss Tsukiura hasn't let anyone
take "deep into the night" once today.

575
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,341
I'm convinced that's a card she aims for.

576
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,261
Understood. I'll be wary of that.

577
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,889
I'll avenge our loss.

578
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,018
For you and Miss Aizawa.

579
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,817
-How cool!
-How cool!

580
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,993
-Let's have a good game.
-Let's have a good game.

581
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,709
<i>Sei Shonagon…</i>

582
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,756
<i>and Murasaki Shikibu.</i>

583
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,551
<i>What are the chances?</i>

584
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,644
<i>No wonder the mountain wind</i>

585
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:56,399
<i>Is known as devastation</i>

586
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,151
<i>I shall leave this world…</i>

587
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,820
<i>Forgotten by you…</i>

588
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,198
<i>Though I know at dusk</i>
<i>The sun will set once again</i>

589
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,659
<i>And I shall see you</i>

590
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,543
<i>How loathsome the dawn is</i>

591
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:21,007
<i>That forces us to part ways</i>

592
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,636
<i>An autumnal wind</i>
<i>Blows down from Mount Yoshino</i>

593
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,888
<i>Late into the night</i>

594
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,974
It's still early in the match.

595
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,030
There's something nice about it.

596
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,823
<i>Karuta</i>, I mean.

597
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,412
It doesn't matter
if you're male or female.

598
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,206
An adult or a child.

599
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,254
Maybe I could play it too.

600
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:23,944
Excuse us.

601
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:29,116
<i>And harbor no resentment</i>

602
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,704
<i>For you or my own fortune</i>

603
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,835
<i>If in the future</i>
<i>It proves difficult for you</i>

604
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,420
<i>To remember me</i>

605
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,804
<i>In the gentle light</i>
<i>Of the sun on this spring day…</i>

606
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,391
<i>In the still of dusk</i>
<i>I await one who won't come</i>

607
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,310
<i>By Matsuho's bay</i>

608
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,865
Hang in there.

609
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,619
<i>Knowing you come not…</i>

610
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,037
Yes!

611
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,499
<i>Though as night deepens</i>

612
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,047
The next hand decides it.

613
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,856
<i>I then notice that the moon</i>

614
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:46,694
<i>Is hanging low in the sky</i>

615
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,408
<i>The white beads of dew</i>
<i>Buffeted so by the wind…</i>

616
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,618
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

617
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,038
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

618
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,294
<i>Across the autumn meadow</i>

619
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:08,632
<i>Like jewels that defy the thread</i>

620
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,437
Yep. She's good, all right.

621
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,607
I'll practice even more.

622
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,861
Stop it, please.

623
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,780
You did really well.

624
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,245
It was a great match.

625
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,046
I'm sorry.

626
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,758
Thank you.

627
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,801
-Good job.
-Good job.

628
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,434
Hey.

629
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,898
Excuse me. I'm gonna go for it.

630
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,278
What about your dad?

631
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,865
I'll talk to him properly.

632
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,078
I'm sure he'll understand.

633
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,045
And you?

634
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,422
What will you do?

635
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,071
But I want you to find something
that gives you that same feeling.

636
00:42:55,781 --> 00:43:01,537
<i>Then it will be an irreplaceable treasure</i>
<i>that will support you in the future.</i>

637
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,916
What? All three of you are joining?

638
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,129
Well, I'm kind of a bonus
that comes with Miss Murata.

639
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,339
A bonus is just fine!

640
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,134
This is great!

641
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,802
I'm thrilled.

642
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,470
Thanks for having us.

643
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,139
Thank you for having us.

644
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,565
-Nice job!
-Really!

645
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,234
-That's great!
-I'm officially B-class!

646
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,411
Winning the final will be a boost,
so give it your all.

647
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,454
Will do.

648
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,205
Miss Aizawa?

649
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,960
You came! Thank you.

650
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,128
Miss Oe.

651
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,091
The club seniors' tears on that day,

652
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,721
I still don't understand them.

653
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,308
I didn't understand them,

654
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,979
<i>but those tears were just so beautiful.</i>

655
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,232
<i>Like scattered beads of white dew.</i>

656
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,528
<i>The truth is,</i>

657
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,781
<i>part of me wanted…</i>

658
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,118
to understand what

659
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,163
I had misunderstood.

660
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,541
That's how I felt.

661
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,089
I'm going to keep saying it.

662
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,384
Miss Meguru Aizawa,

663
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,345
would you like

664
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,847
to play <i>karuta </i>with us?

665
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,019
I can't.

666
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,522
If I indulge myself now,

667
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,734
everything will go down the drain again.

668
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,699
But…

669
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,619
but let's say

670
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,748
if you were to serve as the evidence,
Miss Oe.

671
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,251
"Evidence"?

672
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,130
That people who find
their treasure in <i>karuta</i>

673
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,966
are guaranteed

674
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:23,762
to have a bright future
waiting for them in ten years' time.

675
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,810
Please show that to me.

676
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,483
The way my life is right now, I…

677
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,464
No.

678
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,844
All right. I'll do it.

679
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,471
I'll be your evidence!

680
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,558
I will…

681
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,687
devote myself to it.

682
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,747
Miss Aizawa has withdrawn her resignation!

683
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,624
What?

684
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,923
Miss Aizawa!

685
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,013
Thank you for having me.

686
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,393
All right!

687
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,395
At last.

688
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,273
At last we have five members, Miss Oe!

689
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,733
Thank you.

690
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,693
-We did it!
-We did!

691
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,070
I'm so happy.

692
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:07,157
Now we can play team games.
Let's all go to Omi Shrine!

693
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,535
-Omi Shrine?
-Yes.

694
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,871
The All Japan Championship
is held there annually.

695
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,498
It's a Shinto shrine in Shiga.

696
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,086
Schools from each prefecture
that won their local qualifier

697
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,922
gather to battle it out
to be the best in Japan.

698
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,132
This is what it looks like.

699
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,305
It's like Koshien is to baseball.
Everyone dreams of it.

700
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,683
-Koshien?
-Yep.

701
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,143
He said Koshien, Haruma!

702
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,979
It's not Koshien though, is it?

703
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:37,980
Everyone.

704
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,692
None of this will happen
if you don't learn the poems.

705
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,819
There'll be a test next week.

706
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,945
Huh?!

707
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,488
Let's start today, then.

708
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,199
-Sit down, everyone.
-All of them?

709
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,785
We'll begin with the first 50.

710
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,580
-Fifty?
-Quick, Shirano, sit down.

711
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,832
All eyes on the chalkboard.

712
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,711
See "mu-su-me-fu-sa-ho-se"
at the top? Each letter's an opening.

713
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:11,179
One, two… Everyone together now!

714
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,931
Everyone together.

715
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,767
<i>I found this old photo!</i>

716
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,729
