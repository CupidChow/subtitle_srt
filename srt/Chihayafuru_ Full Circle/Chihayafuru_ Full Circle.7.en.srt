00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,879
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,047
I would!

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>When I'm around her,</i>

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,885
<i>I can't help but be reminded</i>

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>that I'm one of the losers.</i>

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>So you play </i>karuta<i>, then?</i>

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,518
Let's…

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,149
have a game sometime.

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>If I could beat her at just one thing,</i>

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,573
then maybe I would cry

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,867
like the girls from the <i>karuta </i>club.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,452
Miss Oe.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,998
Who is this Chihaya?

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,791
KARUTA QUEEN!
CHIHAYA AYASE

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,251
Chihaya is this person right here.

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,547
I've seen her somewhere…

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,265
2020

18
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,518
COMPETITIVE KARUTA EXPERIENCE

19
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,479
So pretty.

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,651
Hey! You two young ladies over there!

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,986
Could it be

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,238
that you're interested in <i>karuta</i>?

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,115
Oh, no.

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,327
-Huh?
-We just thought the kimono was pretty.

25
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,497
Huh?

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,500
I see.

27
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,628
If you start competitive <i>karuta</i>,
you'll be legally…

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,505
"Legal" is an odd word.

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,841
Basically, you'll get to wear
lots of kimonos.

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,969
My friend can help you
with the kimono dressing.

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,597
Anyway, it's happening next month,

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,225
so be sure to come along
if you're interested.

33
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,685
Here you are. Invite your friends too.

34
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,605
It's in the public hall
just down there. Okay?

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,066
All right.

36
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,444
Hope to see you there. Bye!

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,503
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah!

38
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,047
-Wanna go together?
-Let's!

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,758
The entrance exams will be over by then.

40
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,218
I thought that too.

41
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,637
Okay, let's go.

42
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
-I can't wait.
-Me neither.

43
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,558
I wonder what'd suit me.

44
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,144
What color kimono would look good?

45
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,062
Maybe white's my color.

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,982
Yeah. Maybe pink for me.

47
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,235
<i>The shallows run swift</i>

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>And so even if they part</i>
<i>As they hit the rocks</i>

49
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,953
<i>It shall not be very long</i>

50
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>Until they meet once again</i>

51
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,090
Let's leave it there for today.

52
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,592
All right.

53
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,517
IT SHALL NOT BE VERY LONG
UNTIL THEY MEET ONCE AGAIN

54
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,980
A river's current…

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,360
even if split in two by a rock,

56
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,531
is destined to be one again.

57
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,829
They're on your mind, aren't they?
The people you left back in Tokyo.

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,209
No.

59
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,796
Ding-ding! Nakanishi quiz time.

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,843
What do you think
the most important thing for a reader is?

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,973
Let's see.

62
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,684
I suppose

63
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,687
it's to enunciate each syllable well,

64
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,816
especially the identifying part,
so players can hear you well.

65
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,693
Uh-uh! Incorrect.

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,531
That's important,
but not the most important.

67
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:04,160
So what is, then?

68
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,663
Impartiality.

69
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,249
Impartiality?

70
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
Competitive <i>karuta </i>is a small world.

71
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,173
You're likely to read at friends'
and students' games sometimes.

72
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,510
When that happens,
letting your emotions come to the fore

73
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,720
and giving one side an advantage

74
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,890
is the most shameful thing
a reader can do.

75
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,561
Be as invisible as possible

76
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,983
and continue to be impartial
in each and every situation.

77
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,779
That is our greatest duty as readers.

78
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,365
To put it another way,

79
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,536
It is at such times that a reader's worth
is truly challenged.

80
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,210
Well, that's it for lunch.
Let's head back to the office.

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,628
Yes, Ms. Nakanishi.

82
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,892
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

83
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,195
MIZUSAWA HIGH SCHOOL

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,699
POEM SEVEN:
THE SHALLOWS RUN SWIFT

85
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,951
KARUTA CLUB

86
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,952
All right!

87
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,704
Take a look, freshmen.

88
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,913
BATTLE OF FATE

89
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,792
When each player has one card
left in their territory like so,

90
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,836
it's called a "battle of fate."

91
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,465
Who knows why it's called that?

92
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,216
-Me!
-Go ahead.

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,721
-It's the person you're fated to be with.
-How romantic! But incorrect.

94
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,014
-Me!
-Go ahead.

95
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,141
Because it's down to luck.

96
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,728
And why do we say it's down to luck?

97
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,940
The answer is

98
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,737
because whoever has the card
that's read out almost always wins.

99
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:09,452
It's always easier to cover your own card
than reach for your opponent's, right?

100
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,663
Anyway, it'll be quicker to show you.

101
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,457
Let's give it a try.

102
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,630
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:26,302
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

104
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>The waterfall's sound</i>

105
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
Yay!

106
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,561
I'm kind of bummed out,
even though it's just practice.

107
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:40,483
As you just saw, guarding your own card in
a battle of fate is the standard tactic,

108
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,986
but, of course, it's also fine
to go for your opponent's, like so.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

110
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,578
<i>The waterfall's sound</i>

111
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,163
Yes!

112
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,750
In most cases like this,
the player moves without listening,

113
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,086
so it's an all-or-nothing gamble.

114
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,549
This could determine the result
of an entire team game,

115
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,509
so it takes serious guts.

116
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,177
Right on this corner here…

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,679
That's a no-no.

118
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,433
Pretend the camera isn't there.

119
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,184
We want natural footage.

120
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,061
Right. Sorry.

121
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,813
You got told off!

122
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,650
Shut up, Oto.
Or I'll stop fixing your blazer buttons.

123
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,903
-No!
-Huh? Where did that former member go?

124
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
-Huh?
-What?

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,076
I agreed to look after Mizusawa
while Miss Ayase's away

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,329
because I heard Mr. Mashima
would be helping out, too,

127
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,042
but he never shows up at all!

128
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,257
This isn't what I signed up for.

129
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,259
What am I even here for?

130
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,850
I wish they would've told me
about the film crew.

131
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,520
I came in a dang tracksuit
since Mr. Mashima's never here!

132
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,106
Miss Hanano!

133
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,525
The director's looking for you.

134
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,903
At last, my time to shine.

135
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,156
Coming! Hanano here!

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,617
I'd like to start shooting the interviews.

137
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,035
Yes, certainly.

138
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,207
Oh…

139
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,626
I didn't mean you.

140
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,882
Please tell us
why you joined the <i>karuta </i>club.

141
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,843
I saw Miss Nagi's videos,
and it looked really cool.

142
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,222
I was also invited by Miss Nagi.

143
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,725
She gave me the hard sell as well.

144
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,562
Me too. Miss Nagi gave me a flyer,
and before I knew it…

145
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,108
Stop it, all of you!
You're making me sound like a weirdo!

146
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,654
You're not a weirdo. Just <i>karuta </i>crazy.

147
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,616
I was also bewildered
by your pushiness at first.

148
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,994
Hey! You're both meanies, Oto and Kota!

149
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,162
Sorry.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,373
Are you coming in?

151
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,334
Now there are two of us!

152
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,088
Just like Miss Ayase.

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,174
Okay, next person.

154
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,888
Well, as for me,

155
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,974
I wanted to wear a kimono,

156
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,186
and I couldn't decide between
archery club and tea ceremony club,

157
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,230
but I settled on <i>karuta </i>club!

158
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,192
Was he here before?

159
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,822
We have so many new members,
I don't know everyone's faces yet.

160
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,369
There's something familiar about him.

161
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,999
If you're going to wear one,
you want it to be a pretty one, right?

162
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,876
I like <i>karuta </i>too, of course.

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,797
Cute kimonos and <i>karuta</i>…

164
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,758
It's a match made in heaven!

165
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,927
-Okay.
-It's like it's made for me.

166
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,054
That's plenty now. Thanks. Right.

167
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,557
Okay, shall we move on to the next group?

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,310
The way teachers looked at me was so…

169
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,771
Hey, you there.

170
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,775
It sounds like you've got more to say,
so let's hear the rest of it.

171
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,041
Thank you.

172
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,550
What was she like?

173
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,263
Solid <i>karuta </i>with few mistakes,
as expected.

174
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,931
Mine was like that too.

175
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,100
Maybe it's the advisor's policy.

176
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,979
We should report this to Sota.

177
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:53,235
Still, though, I never expected
Sota to come out with that.

178
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm going to stop competing

179
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,411
and focus on management.

180
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,332
Stop competing?

181
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,793
Do you mean that?

182
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,130
You can play now, Haru Bun.

183
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,841
You all got promoted.

184
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,636
A freshman we can count on joined.

185
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,099
We're so much stronger
than we were back at the start.

186
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,228
But we're still nowhere near a match

187
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,856
for the best schools in Tokyo.

188
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,152
If we're going to win the Tokyo qualifier,

189
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,074
taking them head-on
with our skill alone isn't viable.

190
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,035
What should we do, then?

191
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,999
Gather intelligence
and consider our strategy.

192
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,294
Now that Miss Oe's gone,

193
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,715
I'm the only one who can do that.

194
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,137
I'll keep training
as a reserve player, of course.

195
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,891
That way, I can step in if necessary.

196
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:13,941
Firstly, I want to get
more data on other schools.

197
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,362
I'd like you to split up
and train with other schools.

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,409
<i>Whether it's players to look out for</i>
<i>or their overall play style,</i>

199
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,745
<i>tell me anything you find out.</i>

200
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,623
We need to live up to Sota's decision.

201
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,377
Yeah.

202
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,515
<i>Save me, guys!</i>

203
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,603
<i>I've been arrested on suspicion</i>
<i>of espionage. Boo-hoo.</i>

204
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,236
<i>It sounds like Mr. Yakumo</i>
<i>snuck into Mizusawa.</i>

205
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,908
The last place we should go,
and the one person who should never go.

206
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,577
That's Yaku Moku for you.

207
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,080
<i>He probably just wanted</i>
<i>to make himself useful somehow.</i>

208
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,708
<i>But it backfired.</i>

209
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,794
<i>The situation's bad,</i>

210
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,004
<i>but they look oddly relaxed.</i>

211
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,175
Maybe we should go apologize.

212
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,343
Good session.

213
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>It should really be me who goes, but…</i>

214
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>Mr. Yono and I still have</i>
<i>matches to play after this.</i>

215
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,477
<i>Me and Chieri too.</i>

216
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,065
Meaning… me, right?

217
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
You're kidding me.

218
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,240
<i>I did my best to argue against it.</i>

219
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,034
"I don't want to go to
such underhanded lengths," I said.

220
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,955
But the older members yelled at me.

221
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,335
"You get your butt to Mizusawa first,"
they said.

222
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,628
What?

223
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,047
"Don't think you can run away."

224
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,427
"Losing isn't an option for our ace."

225
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,515
Oh, and also,

226
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,310
"Watch yourself when you're out at night."

227
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,898
Umezono's scary!

228
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,819
You've had such a hard time, Yakumon!

229
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,989
Whatever happened to law and order?

230
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,290
Death?

231
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,918
No! Don't film this.

232
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,171
I don't know what it is,
but I don't think you should film.

233
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,638
This is power harassment, 100%!

234
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,601
All right! Let's report this
to someone. The courts!

235
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,394
I have a relative who's a lawyer.

236
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,688
Okay! Let's fight them together!

237
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,523
Right!

238
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,317
What is going on here?

239
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,945
Mr. Shirano!

240
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,072
You came to pick me up?

241
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,782
Yeah.

242
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,963
Please accept our sincere apologies
for our younger member's behavior.

243
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,841
You're leaving? Are you sure?

244
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,429
They'll beat him up
if he doesn't take our intel back.

245
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,682
-Here. I made him myself.
-Beat him up?

246
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,934
Take him with you.

247
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
Thank you so much!

248
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,314
I only have these for you right now.

249
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,151
This is like a home away from home!

250
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,778
What is this?

251
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,657
Come back anytime
if anything happens. Here.

252
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,825
Thank you.

253
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,079
If you bully our Yakumon,

254
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,997
you'll pay for it.

255
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,167
Right.

256
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,337
We'll be more careful.

257
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,546
By the way,

258
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,091
is Mr. Orie not here today?

259
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,219
Kenshin? He's out training somewhere else.

260
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,805
Something about us
not being good enough practice.

261
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,392
He's training with someone
Miss Ayase introduced him to, apparently.

262
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,604
Is there anyone
who could teach Mr. Kenshin anything?

263
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,483
And we told him we wanted
to do some team game practice today.

264
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,527
I know.

265
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,737
Who's not here?

266
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,826
Kenshin!

267
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
Oh? What are you doing here?

268
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,208
Hello. We were just leaving.

269
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,168
Yakumo.

270
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,170
Well, then.

271
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,422
Huh?

272
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,424
Huh?

273
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,884
Leaving so soon,
after coming all this way?

274
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
You did come here to gather intelligence,
didn't you?

275
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:06,275
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

276
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,361
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

277
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,157
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

278
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

279
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

280
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:28,422
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

281
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,217
<i>Hear how the waves crash…</i>

282
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,594
Are you for real?

283
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,851
Wow.

284
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,437
Just as I thought.

285
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,898
You're good.

286
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,197
<i>I was wondering though, Mr. Yono.</i>
<i>Is this really what you want?</i>

287
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,782
What?

288
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,659
To be the manager.

289
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,709
At that last tournament,

290
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,754
I became sure of it.

291
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,715
Sure? Of what?

292
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,676
Miss Aizawa and Miss Murata's potential.

293
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,139
<i>They're both C-class now, like me.</i>

294
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,976
<i>But they're going to get even better.</i>

295
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,232
Besides, Fuki's no slouch either.

296
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,900
Mr. Shirano?

297
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,945
<i>You saw it too, Haru Bun.</i>

298
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,906
<i>How he swept that card away</i>
<i>in the Adore game.</i>

299
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,952
Just as fast as Mr. Orie.

300
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,249
Right. Last year, he was only a beginner,
and he already sweeps like that.

301
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,627
He's a real natural.

302
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,967
<i>Fuki may well turn out to be</i>
<i>Umezono's secret weapon.</i>

303
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,950
<i>And of Tatsuta's river</i>

304
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>It makes a colored brocade</i>

305
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,381
Oh yeah! This is when
the concert band club have practice.

306
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,885
We let them have this time slot
for this month.

307
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,052
Too bad.

308
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,891
Well, let's all go for a picnic.
It can double as a welcome party.

309
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,231
Isn't that a bit much?

310
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,903
Not at all. I can't let anything
happen to Umezono's player.

311
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,571
There. All done.

312
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,242
This is amazing. It's so easy to move in.

313
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,120
Right? It's a common taping method
for <i>karuta</i>.

314
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,540
I never knew about that.

315
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,836
One of our former members is studying
to be a doctor. He showed me it.

316
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,257
You have all sorts of ex-members, huh?

317
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:21,970
Um…

318
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,806
Where's Meguru today?

319
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,311
Aizawa's out scouting someplace…

320
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,695
So you are here scouting!
I knew something seemed off.

321
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,739
-You didn't hear that.
-Got it.

322
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,244
Huh? Do you two know each other?

323
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,871
Yeah.

324
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,457
Childhood friends, I guess.

325
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,213
<i>We lived next door to each other</i>
<i>from birth and always got along great.</i>

326
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,342
<i>We went to kindergarten,</i>
<i>school, everywhere together.</i>

327
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,431
We even wore the same clothes.
People said we were like real sisters.

328
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:11,645
-Our families vacationed together too.
-Wow. That's quite the bond.

329
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,901
I thought we'd stay that way
right into adulthood.

330
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,697
But then my family moved away,
and we got separated.

331
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:27,452
So it's a coincidence
that you both play <i>karuta </i>now?

332
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,167
I guess so.

333
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,253
I don't know.

334
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:40,716
It's <i>karuta </i>that brought you
back together in high school,

335
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,676
so it must be fate.

336
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:46,972
Fate…

337
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,768
Right.

338
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,979
Maybe it is fate.

339
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,489
Pop by our alumni's clinic
on your way home

340
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,158
and get it looked at properly.

341
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,453
-I'll call him.
-Will do. Thanks.

342
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,163
See you later.

343
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,333
Or not yet. Yakumon's still here.

344
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:20,172
He looked like he was having fun.
Can he stay a little longer?

345
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,466
If that's not a problem.

346
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,842
Not for us.

347
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,137
-Could you tell him I left?
-Sure thing.

348
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,640
-See you at the Tokyo qualifier, then.
-See you.

349
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,448
MEGURU: CAPTAIN MARUYAMA IS TOUGH!!
BUT I THINK WE CAN WIN!

350
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,867
CHIERI: I'LL SEND MY NOTES TOO!

351
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,088
20 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

352
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,298
LET'S WIN THIS THING!

353
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,811
How's your stamina holding up?

354
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm A-class, so just fine, thanks.

355
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,566
-Let's up the pace, guys!
-Okay!

356
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,988
19 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

357
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,457
16 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

358
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,251
Thank you.

359
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,133
14 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

360
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,847
How do we handle a player like this?

361
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,016
Don't shy away. Take the fight to them.

362
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,526
10 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

363
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,363
7 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER!

364
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,364
YANAKA HIGH SCHOOL

365
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,616
Thanks to your work,
we've gathered a lot of data.

366
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,413
Additionally, I've come up with a strategy
with Mr. Komano's help.

367
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,875
In a nutshell,
it's about predicting playing order.

368
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,627
-Predicting playing order?
-Yes.

369
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,631
The order in which a team deploys players
changes the odds drastically.

370
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,094
Shall we simulate
a game against Mizusawa as an example?

371
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,223
We'll begin by
considering Umezono's ability.

372
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:40,729
Umezono's strongest player is
A-class Yakumo,

373
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,566
followed by B-class Shirano

374
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,194
and Okuyama.

375
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:54,826
Then there's C-class Yono,
Miss Aizawa, and Miss Murata.

376
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,455
There's your form on the day
and stylistic matchups, too,

377
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,582
but this is just for reference.

378
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,709
As for Mizusawa,

379
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,004
A-class Orie is their strongest player.

380
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,090
After him, it's A-class Miss Yoshino.

381
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,053
Followed by B-class Miss Tsukiura,

382
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:17,349
Shinohara, and Niwano.

383
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,231
If we pit our strongest players
against theirs in descending order…

384
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,650
We'll probably all lose, right?

385
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,609
Right.

386
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,446
But if Yakumo's opponent

387
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,784
is Mizusawa's Shinohara…

388
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,536
A B-class.

389
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,247
I could probably win.

390
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,333
Yes. There's a high chance
of us taking a win.

391
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,879
And if Fuki faces Niwano…

392
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,386
there's a fifty-fifty chance
that we get another win.

393
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,638
By the same logic, Orie--

394
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,432
Should be made to play
a C-class like me or Chieri.

395
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,185
A sacrificial lamb, huh?

396
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,145
Don't take it personally.

397
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,565
Yeah, we get it!

398
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,401
So the same
for A-class Miss Yoshino, right?

399
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,905
And the remaining match between me
and Miss Tsukiura is a toss-up.

400
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,825
So then what happens?

401
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,577
Incredible!

402
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,161
We'd have a chance!

403
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,333
If we can predict their playing order,

404
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,837
we can put up a good fight
against even the toughest opposition.

405
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,840
It's a legit strategy for team games.

406
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,219
You actually won the All Japan
using this method, didn't you?

407
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,762
That's right.

408
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,934
I remember arguing with my teammates
when they asked me to be the sacrifice.

409
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,145
We don't talk about that.

410
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,606
I'm seeing
the light at the end of the tunnel.

411
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,692
We can do it. We can do it, guys!

412
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,943
Yes.

413
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,738
Okay, shall we try simulations
for other schools?

414
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:58,158
Me! I want to predict their playing order!

415
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,035
Let me do it.

416
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,120
Okay, next up is…

417
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,872
3 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER!

418
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,126
I came across <i>karuta</i>
when I was a grade-schooler.

419
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,336
B-CLASS CHAMPION
NAGI TSUKIURA

420
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,882
There was a <i>karuta </i>taster
at the local public hall,

421
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,137
so a good friend and I went together.

422
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,765
Hello--

423
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,017
Oh?

424
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,520
What's the matter?

425
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,399
Coming in?

426
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,112
Then let's take this card, shall we?

427
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,617
<i>The same person is now</i>
<i>Mizusawa's club advisor.</i>

428
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,576
Three, two, one…

429
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,746
<i>Then I fell in love with </i>karuta<i>…</i>

432
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>Right now, my biggest dream is for us</i>
<i>to win the All Japan Championship.</i>

433

NAGI TSUKIURA
THIRD-YEAR, MIZUSAWA HIGH SCHOOL

434
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,261
NEW FRIENDS

435
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,181
<i>And with those new friends</i>
<i>who share that dream…</i>

436
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,517
It's me!

437
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,395
-Why are you in the uniform?
-A friend lent me it.

438
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,647
-Impressive!
-I'm thorough.

439
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,109
<i>Mizusawa High School's campaign goes on.</i>

440
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,405
Awesome.

441
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,282
So they do news stories on you
if you win the All Japan.

442
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,492
Yes.

443
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,329
And I suppose Mr. Yakumo's
a Mizusawa freshman.

444
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,873
-Yep!
-It was seriously hairy.

445
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,543
Mizusawa just keep
taking it to the next level.

446
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:39,384
Oh yeah, seeing that
reminded me of something.

447
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,301
Yeah?

448
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,054
I met Miss Tsukiura.

449
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,432
What? Where?

450
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,143
That day I went to collect Yakumo.

451
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,150
She said you were always close?
Next-door neighbors too.

452
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,777
Yeah.

453
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:02,741
That friend she talked about
going to the <i>karuta </i>taster with on TV…

454
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,325
It was you, wasn't it?

455
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,203
Probably.

456
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,788
Probably?

457
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,040
Yeah.

458
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,670
I… didn't go.

459
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,714
What?

460
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,675
I didn't go.

461
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,304
<i>We'd arranged to go together,</i>

462
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,265
<i>but then I flunked the entrance exam.</i>

463
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:35,732
<i>Who'd have thought all that time and money</i>
<i>would just go down the drain?</i>

464
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,534
COMPETITIVE KARUTA EXPERIENCE

465
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,454
Morning!

466
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm so excited for the <i>karuta </i>taster.

467
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,750
Right.

468
00:29:55,335 --> 00:30:00,590
Apparently, the teacher
is the Queen of Karuta.

469
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,134
What's up, Meguru?

470
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,305
Meguru! Wait, Meguru.

471
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,431
Wait.

472
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,767
The public hall's that way.

473
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,813
Congrats on passing the exam, Nagi.

474
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,190
You're moving away, right?

475
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,108
Yeah.

476
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,112
But we'll still be friends, won't we?

477
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,698
Is there really such a thing

478
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,326
as being friends forever?

479
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,082
We're fated to be apart now.

480
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,596
Why did you push her away like that?

481
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,602
The two of us did
absolutely everything together.

482
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,815
Kindergarten. Grade school.

483
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,401
Cram school. Swimming. English.

484
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,197
Gymnastics. Abacus and piano too.

485
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,412
<i>Whatever we did,</i>
<i>Nagi was always better than me.</i>

486
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,789
FIRST: NAGI TSUKIURA

487
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,249
<i>"Nagi, you're amazing," they'd say.</i>

488
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,295
<i>When we were little,</i>
<i>I could live with that.</i>

489
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,214
<i>But as we got older,</i>

490
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,634
<i>people started comparing us.</i>

491
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,138
It was so little.

492
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,224
The gap between us was so small.

493
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,478
But I just couldn't close it.

494
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,982
At some point,

495
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,484
something inside of me

496
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,822
couldn't handle it anymore
when they called Nagi amazing.

497
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,243
I got in!

498
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,790
<i>It really hurt me</i>

499
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,002
<i>to be next to Nagi.</i>

500
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,090
When I heard she was moving away,

501
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,553
I was relieved, to be honest.

502
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,935
Even when I'm around Nagi now,

503
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,606
<i>it makes me feel so pathetic somehow.</i>

504
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,612
It's like a Pavlovian response
or something.

505
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,117
I see.

506
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,664
Sorry. This got a little weird.

507
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,375
I'll stop now.

508
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,754
I'm glad I got to hear it.

509
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,257
Yeah.

510
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,259
Thanks.

511
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,055
Let's win the Tokyo qualifier.

512
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,390
Yeah.

513
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,267
It's our last shot in high school.

514
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:07,318
TOKYO QUALIFIER TODAY!

515
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,654
46TH ALL JAPAN

TOKYO QUALIFIER

517
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,448
We'll give it our all!

518
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,376
You okay, Fuki?

519
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,919
Calm down.

520
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,339
-Calm down and keep your cool.
-Yeah. It's you who needs to calm down.

521
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,590
I am calm.

522
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,592
-You calm down.
-Mr. Shirano.

523
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,929
I'm clueless about this,
so you'll have to fill me in.

524
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,515
I got you, buddy!

525
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,558
Hey, Chieri!

526
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,562
Yuki! What are you doing here?

527
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,231
Oh, I just happened to be passing by.

528
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,692
Here.

529
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,569
What is it?

530
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:56,034
I heard this stuff was good for <i>karuta</i>.
Since you'll have no time to eat.

531
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,786
So you weren't just passing by.

532
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,621
Shut up.

533
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,877
See you around.

534
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,046
You won't stay and watch?

535
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,173
We've got practice.

536
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,976
<i>Guys.</i>

537
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,314
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,401
Sota!

539
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,279
-I'm sorry.
-We're sorry.

540
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,448
We're sorry we didn't win.

541
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,579
Here we are again, huh?

542
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,539
Yep.

543
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,292
I never imagined

544
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,172
<i>that I'd be standing here again.</i>

545
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,431
Thank you, Miss Aizawa.

546
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,562
Maybe it's a little early for that.

547
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,608
We're just getting started.

548
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,403
Right.

549
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,122
2025
A-CLASS OFFICIAL READERS' SCREENING VENUE

550
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,129
YOU: I'M SORRY I COULDN'T GO
TO THE QUALIFIER WITH YOU!

551
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,590
MEGURU: IT'S OKAY! YOU JUST FOCUS
ON YOUR OWN THING TODAY!

552
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,219
CHIERI: WE'RE SURE TO WIN,
SO YOU GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT TOO!

553
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,763
YOU: THANK YOU.
LET'S ALL DO OUR VERY BEST!

554
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:46,602
Will those taking part in the screening
please step inside for a briefing?

555
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,687
Yes.

556
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,180
Was it two schools from Tokyo
that can go to the All Japan?

557
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,517
That's right, since Tokyo has
a high number of competing schools.

558
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,813
The winner of the first qualifier today
will be Tokyo's first team.

559
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,106
TOKYO PREFECTURE'S FIRST TEAM

560
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,569
The losers go into a repechage
to decide the second team.

561
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,905
LEAGUE OF FOUR TO DETERMINE
TOKYO PREFECTURE'S SECOND TEAM

562
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,743
It's Hokuoh.

563
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,415
<i>So you play </i>karuta<i>, then?</i>

564
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,084
Let's…

565
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,839
have a game sometime.

566
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,639
Guys!

567
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,350
Let's all wear these today.

568
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,811
I made them.

569
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,896
-Headbands?
-Here.

570
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,690
Thank you.

571
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,484
UMEZONO

572
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,738
Totes adorbs, no?

573
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,659
You want us to wear these
in our matches today?

574
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,160
Yes.

575
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,957
Shall we save them
till we've checked out the other schools?

576
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,333
Yes.

577
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,169
-And now the opening ceremony.
-Let's go.

578
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,380
-Let's go.
-Please line up.

579
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,301
That's cold.

580
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,733
On behalf of all the players here,

581
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,361
I vow to play fairly
and play hard for every last card,

582
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,197
in the spirit of <i>karuta</i>.

583
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,784
Kenshin Orie of Mizusawa High School,

584
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,455
players' representative, May 24, 2025.

585
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:08,304
And to conclude, the declaration
from the tournament president.

586
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,015
Over to you, President.

587
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,065
That's the Meijin!

588
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,649
As in the Master?

589
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,516
My name is Arata Wataya…

590
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,729
and I have the honor
of presiding over this tournament.

591
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:06,654
I… still have much to learn
both as a person

592
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,697
and a human…

593
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,075
Aren't they the same thing?

594
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,453
The Meijin's nervous.

595
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,624
Anyway, never mind that.

596
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,380
I also entered this very tournament
for the first time

597
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,674
in my last year of high school…

598
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,470
<i>and lost spectacularly.</i>

599
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,267
<i>I regretted that I didn't take</i>
<i>team games more seriously</i>

600
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,478
<i>and sooner.</i>

601
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,690
That's why

602
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,901
I want to tell all of you…

603
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:56,328
that though regret
might not fix your past choices…

604
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,708
you can still turn them

605
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,711
into the right choices.

606
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,178
Use all the tools at your disposal today

607
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,097
to make them the right choices.

608
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,562
I now declare the Tokyo qualifier

609
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:26,066
of the 46th All Japan High School
Ogura Hyakunin Isshu Karuta Championship

610
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,152
underway.

611
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,252
The lots will now be drawn,

612
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,173
if representatives from each school
will please gather round.

613
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,731
Hokuoh High School, number 7.

614
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,240
All right.

615
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,701
Get us a good one, Mr. Yono.

616
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,377
Please let my investment in virtue
pay off.

617
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,179
Thank you.

618
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,268
Umezono High School, number 6.

619
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,523
That's…

620
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,108
It can't be…

621
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,901
You're kidding me.

622
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:56,323
5: MIZUSAWA HIGH SCHOOL
6: UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

623
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,617
Huh? What is it? What does this mean?

624
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,037
We've drawn the favorites
in the first round.

625
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,539
What?!

626
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,275
Sorry, guys.

627
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,944
I drew us the final boss.

628
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,656
No, Sota.

629
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,327
We have to face them sooner or later
to go to Omi Shrine.

630
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,038
-What?
-She's right.

631
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,042
-Yes. It's true
-We just have to win.

632
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,210
So, Sota,

633
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,547
we're gonna need
some darn good predictions, please.

634
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,179
Right.

635
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,184
I'll try.

636
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,941
Miss Tsukiura being A-class is unexpected.

637
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,445
Now Mizusawa have
even fewer vulnerabilities.

638
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,115
They'll probably shake up
their usual order.

639
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,495
If only we had some kind of clue…

640
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,461
Sota.

641
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,757
-Huh?
-I might have got one.

642
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,425
A hint.

643
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,844
We got a bye in the first round,

644
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,390
but let's watch the teams
we could face later.

645
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,685
All right. Heads in the game, guys.

646
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,061
Right!

647
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,411
Here you are. Thank you.

648
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,631
We will now hold the first round.
All teams in place, please.

649
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,174
Okay.

650
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,388
-This is ours to win, guys.
-Right.

651
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,142
-Here we go, Umezono!
-Yeah!

652
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,228
-Go get 'em.
-Okay.

653
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,147
We're counting on you, Yaku Moku.

654
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,444
What's up?

655
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,784
I've… never played

656
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,705
a competitive team game before.

657
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,499
Huh?

658
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:05,304
Oh boy, talk about bad luck,

659
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,015
drawing the favorites right off the bat.

660
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,226
Absolutely. I hope they're all doing okay.

661
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,353
They acted like it's nothing, but…

662
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,397
Getting Mizusawa right off the bat

663
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,858
is a raw deal for sure.

664
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,070
But those guys…

665
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,280
<i>No, Sota.</i>

666
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,700
We have to face them sooner or later
to go to Omi Shrine.

667
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,789
They acted like it was no big deal,
just for my sake.

668
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,833
So at the very least,

669
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,378
I want to get the order right.

670
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,135
Please!

671
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,013
Let my investment pay off!

672
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,560
Announcing the order.

673
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,689
Number 1.
Umezono High School, Miss Aizawa.

674
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,732
Yes.

675
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,485
Mizusawa High School, Orie.

676
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,569
What the…?

677
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,364
You thought we'd fall for that?

678
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,496
Number 2. Umezono High School, Okuyama.

679
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,413
Yes.

680
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,707
Mizusawa High School, Shinohara.

681
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,625
Yes.

682
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,669
All right.

683
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,506
Number 3.
Umezono High School, Miss Murata.

684
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,549
Yes.

685
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,968
-Mizusawa High School, Miss Yoshino.
-Yes.

686
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,138
Yes! Just as I predicted.

687
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,600
Number 4.
Umezono High School, Shirano.

688
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,726
Yes.

689
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,271
-Mizusawa High School, Niwano.
-Yes.

690
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,356
Sick!

691
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,318
Number 5. Umezono High School, Yakumo.

692
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,695
Yes.

693
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,947
Mizusawa High School, Miss Tsukiura.

694
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,323
Yes.

695
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,951
It's perfect!

696
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,452
What do you mean?

697
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,748
Now that Mizusawa
has three A-class players,

698
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,210
we have to beat at least one A-class.

699
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,423
The only one of us who can do that
is Yakumo, who's also A-class.

700
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:09,678
After that, our only way to victory
was to pair Fuki and Haru Bun

701
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:14,099
with their B-class players
in two fifty-fifty matches.

702
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,059
And it worked out that way?

703
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,019
Yes!

704
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,770
Incredible, Yono!

705
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,106
I just did what I could.

706
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,776
All we can do now is pray.

707
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,865
Now please deal the cards.

708
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,410
Let's have a good game.

709
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,152
Let's have a good game.

710
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,198
Let's have a good game.

<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>

712
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,747
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

713
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,916
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

714
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,209
Let's go, Umezono!

715
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,752
Right!

716
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,380
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

717
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:31,134
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

718
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,140
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

719
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:42,187
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>
