00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,401
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,903
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:40,081
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

4
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:48,798
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:56,056
<i>Even in old days</i>
<i>When the gods did reign supreme</i>

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,433
<i>Never was it heard</i>

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,810
He's so quick.

8
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>So</i>

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>how did I get here?</i>

10
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,073
55 MINUTES EARLIER

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,949
What's she doing there?

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,910
Beats me.

13
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,872
She said she's making
her money work as she does.

14
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,832
What's that mean?

15
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,752
Miss Aizawa. Can you do a delivery?

16
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,836
Yes, boss.

17
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,130
The customer requested you.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,216
Requested me?

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,853
45TH ALL JAPAN
HIGH SCHOOL KARUTA CHAMPIONSHIP

20
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,938
TOKYO QUALIFIER

21
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,156
Pizza Gap.

22
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,035
Did anybody order pizza?

23
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,788
Miss Meguru Aizawa?

24
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,876
-Have we…?
-I'm Kanade Oe from Umezono High School.

25
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,631
-You're the teacher who just--
-I'm sorry. There's no time.

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,550
I'll get straight to the point.

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,262
We need your help, Miss Aizawa.

28
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,430
My help?

29
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:24,477
As it stands, the <i>karuta </i>club seniors
can't play in their retirement game.

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,437
-Please!
-Please.

31
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,022
Please.

32
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,651
Huh? You mean you're at work right now?

33
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,695
I guess so.

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,531
Sounds like my boss gave the okay.

35
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,243
And this is your first time
doing competitive <i>karuta</i>?

36
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,371
Yes, it is.

37
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,415
I thought something seemed off.

38
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,459
That's hilarious.

39
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,797
-I'm sorry. I really shouldn't be here.
-That's not true.

40
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
All right. Here's how it goes.

41
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,927
You know the <i>Hyakunin Isshu</i>?

42
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,890
Yeah. I mean, just from
what we did at school.

43
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,059
Soon, that person will read
the first half of a poem.

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,105
You grab the card with the second half.
That's all, really.

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,234
You mean that everyone here
has memorized the <i>Hyakunin Isshu</i>?

46
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,028
Yep. They sure have.

47
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,030
But…

48
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,617
just memorization isn't enough.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>That waters were as crimson</i>

50
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:28,374
<i>As the River Tatsuya</i>

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,547
<i>I try to hide it</i>
<i>But my face betrays my love</i>

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,592
<i>Secret and profound</i>

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,304
You have to be seriously fast too.

54
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,686
I see.

55
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,398
Hey. Miss Oe.

56
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,776
Mr. Yono!

57
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,737
Should you be here?

58
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,656
It's fine.

59
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,449
But never mind me. I'm sorry.

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,953
I can't believe
I didn't make it in time to compete.

61
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,666
It couldn't be helped
with your anisakiasis. I've had it before.

62
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,253
-It's… hell.
-Yes.

63
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,092
But why are you here? There can't
be enough of us to play without me.

64
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,763
We managed to avoid losing by default
thanks to someone called Miss Aizawa.

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,723
Miss Aizawa?

66
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,938
Meguru Aizawa!

67
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,985
-I see. So that's how.
-She's not been winning any hands though.

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,736
Of course not, Miss Oe!

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
Excuse me.

70
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,699
Of course she hasn't.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,411
Miss Aizawa has been
a ghost member since she joined.

72
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,580
-She's never played one proper game!
-Right.

73
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,582
What did you say?

74
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,085
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,301
<i>Parted we may be</i>
<i>But if on Mount Inaba</i>

76
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,012
<i>I hear the pine trees</i>

77
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,395
Hey, everyone's sweeping
loads of cards up together.

78
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,439
Doesn't that count as a foul?

79
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,275
Good question.

80
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,320
This is the boundary

81
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,322
that separates your area
from your opponent's.

82
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,698
OWN TERRITORY
OPPONENT'S TERRITORY

83
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,536
You're allowed to touch any cards that are
in the same area as the correct one.

84
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,247
I see.

85
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,962
How about this, then?

86
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,760
<i>Tell me that you wait for me</i>

87
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:49,098
<i>I shall hasten to return</i>

88
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,436
<i>Across the ocean</i>
<i>And to its countless islands</i>

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,397
<i>Does my ship set sail</i>

90
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,154
Impressive.

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,367
<i>Down from Tsukuba…</i>

92
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,576
<i>The flower's color…</i>

93
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,495
<i>Going round the path…</i>

94
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,332
Good. Real good, Meguru.

95
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,543
No, that's not against the rules.

96
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,170
What a bold move!

97
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,756
She's really giving it her all.

98
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,342
Thank you, Miss Aizawa.

99
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,513
You did it.

100
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,224
One of those cards was the right one.

101
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,893
Here you are.

102
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,895
To commemorate your first hand.

103
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,024
It's the perfect card for you, Meguru.

104
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901
Perfect?

105
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,447
This poem starts with "going round,"
like your name.

106
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,534
Huh.

107
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,745
FOR BEHIND A SINGLE CLOUD
THE MOON THAT NIGHT DID VANISH

108
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,746
Thank you.

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,039
Thank you.

110
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,879
Oh man. That was fun.

111
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,424
Let's play again sometime.

112
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,553
Huh? Oh, this is a one-off for me.

113
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,434
Thank you so much
for coming today, Miss Aizawa.

114
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,769
-Thank you.
-Really, thank you.

115
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,937
Guys.

116
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,817
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,905
-Sota!
-We're sorry.

118
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,323
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,159
We're sorry we didn't win.

120
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,683
<i>Huh? What is this? What's with them all?</i>

121
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,061
<i>I'm scared!</i>

00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,163
-Sis.
-Yeah?

132
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,749
-Can we change the channel?
-No.

133
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,212
-I can't take my eye off the market.
-You're not watching it.

134
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,463
Yes, I am.

135
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,426
Are you watching TV, listening to music,
eating, or reading? Choose one.

136
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,594
Hey, Meguru!

137
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,264
We're running late. Oh, my phone.

138
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,141
-Shoot, I've gotta go!
-Oh, thanks, Susumu.

139
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,687
Sorry, I'll be late home again tonight.
Eat without me.

140
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,981
-I'll be late too.
-Just Kakeru and I, then.

141
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,357
Okay. See you later.

142
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,276
-See you.
-Your hair's soaking.

143
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,653
Natural drying's more efficient. Bye.

144
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,821
I'm off.

145
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,199
-You got cram school today?
-No, work. The late shift.

146
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,910
Easy with that. You're a student first.

147
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,287
It's educational.

148
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,831
-All right. Take care.
-Yeah.

149
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,749
-See you later.
-Goodbye.

150
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,635
I knew it.

151
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,763
Long-term incremental investments are key.

152
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,909
The <i>karuta </i>club.

153
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,827
TAKING NEW MEMBERS!

154
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,828
Interested in <i>karuta</i>?

155
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,997
-No?
-We'll be at the school festival.

156
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,332
Come and watch.

157
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,960
-Good morning. We're the <i>karuta </i>club.
-Please come see us.

158
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,003
<i>Karuta </i>club!

159
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,593
Nobody's biting.

160
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,638
It's still an improvement on last week.

161
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,058
Your idea to hand out
flyers at the gate is working.

162
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,227
We need three people for the team game.

163
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,855
If we can just find one more person…

164
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,734
Are you saying

165
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,030
that the <i>karuta </i>club
currently has two members?

166
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,782
Of course.

167
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,369
You and Miss Meguru Aizawa.

168
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,745
Well,

169
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,500
I wonder if Miss Aizawa
would actually help us out.

170
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,793
Help out with what?

171
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

172
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,049
No worries. This blew over my way.

173
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,927
Thanks.

174
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:24,225
Miss Aizawa. I'd like to thank you again
for your help at the tournament.

175
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,434
Not at all.

176
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,353
The third-years have gone now,

177
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,689
so to bring in some new members,

178
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
we're doing a <i>karuta </i>demo
at the school festival.

179
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,068
So if you're happy to…

180
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.

181
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,411
I heard it would be good for my report,
so I joined back as a freshman.

182
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,997
But school clubs
aren't very time-effective.

183
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,332
Time-effective?

184
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,712
Yes, Miss Oe. So I'll be submitting
my letter of resignation.

185
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,171
Excuse me.

186
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,430
46TH UMEZONO SCHOOL FESTIVAL

187
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,018
-Morning.
-Morning.

188
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,604
-Morning.
-Morning.

189
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,566
Hey, Fuki. You hurt your hand.

190
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,608
This, huh?

191
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,278
Well, you know.

192
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,449
Everyone in class was gonna go
to karaoke today. You in?

193
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,077
Kind of like a kickoff party
for the school festival.

194
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,872
Hey! Is Fuki coming?

195
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,166
I'll hold the mic for you.

196
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,876
How's that?

197
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,628
Karaoke, huh?

198
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,257
Huh? Are you coming too, Miss Aizawa?
What would you sing?

199
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,635
Come on. There's no way
Miss Aizawa's coming.

200
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:46,182
-Why not?
-Because she's got lofty ambitions.

201
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,143
She doesn't have time for karaoke.

202
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,562
Sorry. I've got work.

203
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,980
See? What did I say?

204
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,441
I'll pass too. Sorry.

205
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,277
-What? No way. That's a shame.
-Seriously?

206
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,279
Shall we invite Takagi and co?

207
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,490
-Takagi, huh?
-Yeah.

208
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,368
Hey.

209
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,246
How much does karaoke cost again?

210
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
Huh?

211
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,418
Well, it's about 1,000 yen,

212
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,378
maybe 1,100, isn't it?

213
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,173
Thanks.

214
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>My yearning for you</i>

215
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,768
<i>Has proven to be fruitful</i>
<i>For this chance meeting</i>

216
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,814
<i>Can demonstrate nothing else</i>
<i>Than that our fates our entwined</i>

217
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,192
THE TALE OF GENJI BY MURASAKI SHIKIBU

218
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,028
MIOTSUKUSHI

219
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,032
This word, "miotsukushi,"

220
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,952
refers to a marker
found in rivers and seas

221
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,747
that means a route is passable by boat.

222
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,167
It's a kind of sign
to keep boats from getting lost.

223
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:02,174
Then there's "mi wo tsukushi," meaning
to give your all to something.

224
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
As these terms sound the same,

225
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:09,473
it's been a popular play on words
in <i>waka </i>poetry since ancient times.

226
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:14,895
The <i>Ogura Hyakunin Isshu</i>
contains two poems with this word.

227
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,107
The notion of utterly devoting oneself

228
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,320
must have been a very moving one
to the poets of the time.

229
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,954
Speaking of the <i>Hyakunin Isshu</i>,
if I can talk about myself for a moment,

230
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,958
I devoted myself to competitive <i>karuta</i>
back when I was a young woman.

231
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
CHOOSE AMOUNT: ¥1100

232
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,670
I even took part in the All Japan…

233
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,629
All right.

234
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,557
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,477
Please come to the counseling office
after school.

236
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:13,412
I USED MY PHONE IN CLASS. FROM NOW ON…

237
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,836
You're struggling there.

238
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,007
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,219
I can't write something
I don't really feel.

240
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,179
Right.

241
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,434
Huh?
You mean you don't regret what you did?

242
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:40,064
I mean, is there even any point
to classic literature?

243
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,567
These days, AI can draw pictures
and make videos.

244
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,820
Even write apologies.
What place is there for classics?

245
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,280
To put it mildly,

246
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,158
we're not going to need them
in ten years' time.

247
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,454
You might be right there.

248
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,538
Right.

249
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,291
But that's another matter entirely.

250
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,837
What were you even doing
on your phone anyway?

251
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,381
Investing.

252
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,257
Investing?

253
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,302
I invested the money I saved
by not going to karaoke.

254
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,140
You invest the money
that you refrain from spending?

255
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,645
Yes. My allowance, New Year's money,
wages from my jobs,

256
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,190
and any money that I manage
to stop myself wasting.

257
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,486
That's kind of commenda…

258
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,198
-But you're so young--
-All the more reason!

259
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,199
Right.

260
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,117
It's investment,

261
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,079
but I'm not trying to hit it lucky
with one good stock or crypto.

262
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,583
I make long-term incremental investments,
gradually building them over time.

263
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,756
You think it sounds shady, right?

264
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,554
But it's all based on data and theory.

265
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,223
It's an excellent mindset.

266
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,935
But don't sacrifice
too much of your present

267
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,146
for the sake of your future.

268
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,982
My old teacher says

269
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,110
that you should do things
you can only do when young,

270
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,486
even if it costs--

271
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,906
So dated! Now you're
reciting millennial classics.

272
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,119
These days, it's not about study,
sports, or follower counts.

273
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,412
It's FIRE.

274
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,913
Fire?

275
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,623
As in flames?

276
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:32,593
It stands for "financial independence,
retire early." FIRE.

277
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,512
Hanging it up while you're young.

278
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,599
You're not even in work yet!

279
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,395
You invest wisely, avoid tax,
and emit as little carbon as possible.

280
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,400
It's the best policy now that life
in this world is a game of survival.

281
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,280
It's not too late for you
to get started, Miss Oe.

282
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,242
I'll lend you my book.

283
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,828
<i>The Dignity of Losers</i>.

284
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,207
It's guaranteed to turn
any loser into a winner.

285
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,586
I'd like some evidence, so please
give me some millennial opinions.

286
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,173
What made you want to be a teacher?

287
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,554
-I--
-You gave your life to <i>karuta </i>as a girl.

288
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,934
Ten years after that glamor,
doing things you only could when young,

289
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,396
have you become the person
you hoped to be?

290
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,993
WORK
18:00–22:00

291
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:44,081
I'm sorry.
I've got two part-time jobs to get to.

292
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:48,085
Please can I have my phone?
Otherwise, it'll hinder my work.

293
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,589
And please can I have a punishment
that isn't a letter of reflection?

294
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,425
Or I'll just get an AI
to write one at home.

295
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,304
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

296
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,647
Excuse me.

297
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,917
Gen Z high-school girls are tough.

298
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,794
I'm at my wits' end.

299
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,172
Interesting student you have there.

300
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,465
She saw right through me.

301
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,719
I didn't want to be a teacher.

302
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,722
It was just meant to be a temporary thing.

303
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,641
Here is your grilled platter.

304
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,726
Thanks.

305
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,939
I wonder what Chihaya would do.

306
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,152
Ayase, eh? I wonder how she's doing.

307
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,322
Have you told her you're advisor
for the <i>karuta </i>club?

308
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,950
I can't quite find the confidence.

309
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,914
<i>I wonder if I could ever be like her.</i>

310
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,334
You don't have to.

311
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,002
She's ferocious.

312
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,671
That's for sure.

313
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,346
You're amazing too, Mr. Desk.

314
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,141
You're a full-fledged pharmacist.

315
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,518
You took over the family drugstore.

316
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,899
The old club president
and Meat Bun are doing great too.

317
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,195
Then there's me, going nowhere.

318
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,742
There's no big hurry.

319
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,370
People have their own pace.

320
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,998
And you go at your own, too, Kana.
I'm telling you.

321
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,505
I hope so.

322
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,978
Miss Aizawa.

323
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,689
Miss Aizawa!

324
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,816
-Yes?
-You can go now.

325
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,986
-But it's not time yet.
-Regulations.

326
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,572
They'll arrest me if I make
a high-schooler work any longer.

327
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,366
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,250
You okay, Mr. Desk?

329
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,211
You hold your liquor
as well as ever, Kana.

330
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,006
You don't show it,
so I end up guzzling too.

331
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,634
I'm sorry for making you
listen to me whine.

332
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,764
Someone you know?

333
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,058
-A student?
-Yeah.

334
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,853
She works this late?

335
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,453
Oh, sorry!

336
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,838
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Not at all.

337
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,673
Is he your boyfriend?

338
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,091
No, nothing like that.

339
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,801
Wrong?

340
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,807
No, you're not wrong.

341
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,893
Not wrong?

342
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,564
You're not… not wrong

343
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,192
if you said it was wrong.

344
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,366
That is to say, we're old classmates.
From high school.

345
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:53,205
-From back when Miss Oe played <i>karuta</i>?
-That's right. We played together.

346
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,166
Your glamorous youth.

347
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,421
I don't remember it being glamorous.

348
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,800
Sorry, I'm Meguru Aizawa.

349
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,927
Tsutomu Komano.

350
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,346
Huh. Kana…

351
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,767
Miss Oe, I can't believe
you have students.

352
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,435
It feels kind of odd.

353
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,729
I see.

354
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,899
Please don't jump to any conclusions.

355
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,110
No, sorry.

356
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,284
You really are incredible, Miss Oe.

357
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,619
You think so?

358
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,538
Why do you say that?

359
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,625
You played <i>karuta </i>at the All Japan
and became a classics teacher.

360
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,836
You're a real freak.

361
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,005
That kind of "incredible," eh?

362
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,844
I guess that's just how much
you love <i>karuta</i>.

363
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,845
Huh?

364
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,930
Yes.

365
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,184
Actually, I'm not so sure

366
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,729
if you could go as far
as to say I love <i>karuta</i>.

367
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,231
Huh?

368
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,819
To begin with,

369
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,115
I was also baffled at
how captivated everyone was by it.

370
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,120
Taking those beautiful poems
and violently swiping them away…

371
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,998
<i>When I first saw it,</i>

372
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,417
<i>I even yelled, "What the hell is this?!"</i>

373
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,377
You did yell that.

374
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,796
Why, then?

375
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,091
When I was in high school,

376
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,761
a friend of ours invited us.

377
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,558
She was straight to the point.
No self-doubt.

378
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,853
And she loved <i>karuta </i>more than anything.

379
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,985
Then she became the Queen of Karuta,
just like she always aspired to do.

380
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,737
Trust your friends.

381
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:53,241
Make this final the most fun game
of <i>karuta </i>you've ever played.

382
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,743
All right!

383
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,000
<i>As club advisor, she achieved her dream</i>

384
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,669
<i>of winning</i>
<i>the All Japan High School title,</i>

385
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,548
<i>and now she's chasing a new dream</i>
<i>at full speed.</i>

386
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,220
She's a dear friend,

387
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,680
and someone I greatly admire.

388
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,974
Admire?

389
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,729
Next to her love of <i>karuta</i>,
mine's nothing.

390
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,151
I think I understand.

391
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,321
I knew someone like that.

392
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,491
The kind of girl
who seems like a manga protagonist.

393
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,159
Did you?

394
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,577
Yes.

395
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,956
They can do pretty much anything.

396
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,125
Always give their all.

397
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,212
And even get results for it.

398
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,048
Yes. That's right.

399
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,971
But, I mean,
you became a classics teacher, Miss Oe.

400
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,516
I'm

401
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,227
not the same.

402
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,274
What I really wanted to do
was research work in Kyoto.

403
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,776
But there were no openings.

404
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,072
And Umezono was kind enough to employ me.

405
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,493
And that's how I got here.

406
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,955
Pathetic, isn't it?

407
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,250
I couldn't even look her in the face now.

408
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,174
I live that way, so…

409
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,637
Sorry for intruding on your time together.

410
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,931
No, you weren't intruding. Was she?

411
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,143
Okay, then. See you tomorrow.

412
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,894
Goodbye.

413
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,943
Miss Aizawa? Are you okay?

414
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,197
By the way, Miss Oe,

415
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,493
did you think of anything
instead of a letter of reflection?

416
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,663
Actually…

417
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,042
I did have one idea.

418
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,257
-A little higher.
-Higher?

419
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,425
Too high.

420
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,345
-This way?
-Over here.

421
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,598
Are you okay, Miss Aizawa?

422
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,642
Turning now.

423
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,394
Maybe a letter of reflection
would be better.

424
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
Thank you.

425
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,941
And down.

426
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,278
-One more to go.
-What?

427
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,529
Off we go.

428
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,573
What shall we do with this?

429
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,493
-Let's put it out front.
-Okay.

430
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:48,041
TRANSLATION INTO MODERN JAPANESE
ANALYSIS

431
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,971
This poem has your interest, then?

432
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,933
Miss… Meguru Aizawa?

433
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,352
Well, I…

434
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,604
Yes.

435
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>Going round the path</i>

436
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,652
<i>If it is he whom I met</i>
<i>I cannot be sure</i>

437
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,239
<i>For behind a single cloud</i>
<i>The moon that night did vanish</i>

438
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,450
It was composed about 1,000 years ago

439
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:26,454
by Murasaki Shikibu,
author of <i>The Tale of Genji.</i>

440
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,084
<i>Just as she thought she saw</i>
<i>someone dear from her past,</i>

441
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,919
<i>they disappeared.</i>

442
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,090
<i>Just like the moon</i>
<i>being concealed by the clouds.</i>

443
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,845
Was it an old lover she saw?

444
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,056
It's easy to read it that way,

445
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,143
but apparently the person
was a childhood friend.

446
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,149
It sounds like a love poem,
but it's actually about friendship.

447
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,985
Huh.

448
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,620
We finished on time, somehow.

449
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,332
Tomorrow's the big day. Let's do our best.

450
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,959
-Let's.
-Yes.

451
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
-Work?
-Yes.

452
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,801
-Work, then cram school.
-You're very busy.

453
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,597
-I'll leave it to you from here.
-Okay.

454
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,766
Thank you very much.

455
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,642
Are you okay?

456
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,643
I'm okay.

457
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,481
-Maybe you should get some rest?
-No, I'm fine.

458
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,024
I'm…

459
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,070
-Miss Aizawa?
-You okay?

460
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,327
<i>Thank you so much</i>
<i>for coming today, Miss Aizawa.</i>

461
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,996
<i>-Really, thank you.</i>
<i>-I wish I could've played.</i>

462
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,374
<i>-It was so much fun.</i>
<i>-Take this feeling and win next year.</i>

463
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,921
<i>-I really wanted to play together.</i>
<i>-Thank you so much.</i>

464
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,351
You're awake?

465
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,480
I called your parents.

466
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,818
I'm so sorry for overexerting you.

467
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,994
Miss Oe.

468
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,288
Yes?

469
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,583
Did you cry too?

470
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,129
Like they did at the <i>karuta</i>.

471
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,258
Like they did?

472
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:50,890
I just had a dream about it.
The day of the tournament.

473
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,105
The older club members were crying.

474
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,817
As if the world had ended.

475
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,865
I didn't get it.

476
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,661
I'd get it
if they had come in second or something.

477
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:17,292
But why cry that much
when you went out in the first round?

478
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,254
Is it me that's weird?

479
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,632
No.

480
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,635
That's just fine.

481
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:34,225
The girls' tears were the result
of them giving their all.

482
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,272
They devoted their youths to <i>karuta</i>
enough to weep over it.

483
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,775
Devoted their youths?

484
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,157
Isn't that asking too much of them?

485
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,493
-Asking too much?
-Yes.

486
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,537
Way too much.

487
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,293
Miss Aizawa…

488
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:07,300
have you ever given so much of yourself
to something, it made you cry?

489
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,885
-No.
-Oh my.

490
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,805
In that case, what do you think

491
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:17,185
you would have to do or accomplish
in order to cry like that?

492
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,396
There's nothing.

493
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:26,569
I didn't even shed a single tear when
I flunked my junior high entrance exam.

494
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,239
<i>I didn't feel sad.</i>

495
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,743
<i>If anything, I felt refreshed.</i>

496
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,662
<i>Refreshed?</i>

497
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:41,793
You know that stuff Olympic athletes
and billionaires always say?

498
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,172
"Do your best and results will follow."

499
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,926
"There's no such thing as wasted effort."

500
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,931
"All lives have meaning."

501
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,182
Things like that.

502
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,687
Something in me always asked,

503
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,731
"Is that really true?"

504
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,945
<i>I'm actually glad I realized early on</i>

505
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,532
<i>that I'm someone else's supporting role.</i>

506
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,997
It let me adjust my life to fit that role.

507
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:31,801
46TH UMEZONO FESTIVAL

00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,764
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

510
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,849
Thank you.

RING TOSS AND WHACK-A-MOLE

INTERESTING BOOKS WE RECOMMEND

514
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,909
I'll give you this

515
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,291
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

516
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,960
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

517
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,588
Very well.

518
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,049
Though it is a shame.

519
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,805
I read this.

520
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,979
Did you get how
long-term incremental investment works?

521
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,522
I did.

522
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,903
I somehow feel as if I've been investing

523
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,739
for a very long time.

524
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,698
Huh?

525
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,578
So you're going to join the FIRE movement?

526
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,705
-Oh, no.
-Guys.

527
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,999
Are you ready?

528
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,959
Yes.

529
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,921
Let's do this, then.

530
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,347
Hello, everyone.

531
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,850
Thank you for coming to this demonstration

532
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,187
by the Umezono High School
Competitive Karuta Club.

533
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:12,193
Let's get straight to it
with a three-versus-three game.

534
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,737
Please raise a hand if you'd like to play.

535
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,823
I would!

536
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,533
I'd like to play!

537
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,164
Is it okay I've played before?

538
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,250
Of course.

539
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,210
Anybody else?

540
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,964
Everyone's welcome, beginner or not.

541
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,259
-Huh?
-Two more.

542
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,929
Mr. Yono, can you hold the fort ? Thanks.

543
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,140
Huh? Hold on…

544
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,644
Two more volunteers.

545
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,778
Miss Aizawa?

546
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,322
What's the matter?

547
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,870
I'm not going to take part after all.
Sorry.

548
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,205
I'll write the apology.

549
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,499
I'm sorry about this.

550
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,170
There's nothing in my hands, is there?

551
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,921
No.

552
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,257
Hold on!

553
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,010
What?

554
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,928
That's amazing!

555
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,014
<i>Is it that girl?</i>

556
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,021
It's her, isn't it?

557
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,607
The manga protagonist.

558
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,237
When I'm around her,

559
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,199
<i>I can't help but be reminded</i>

560
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,868
<i>that I'm one of the losers.</i>

561
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,958
You must know what I mean, Miss Oe.

562
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,003
Wait.

563
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,635
It's true. I didn't turn into
the person I wanted to be.

564
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,220
However…

565
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,432
thanks to you, I realized

566
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,061
that without knowing it,
by devoting myself to <i>karuta</i>,

567
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,356
I was building something up.

568
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,528
It may have started out as just a stone.

569
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,199
<i>But it was polished</i>
<i>by the passage of time.</i>

570
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,409
<i>And now, ten years on,</i>

571
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,871
<i>it's more radiant than any jewel.</i>

572
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,252
When I remember those three years,
how that stone feels,

573
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,797
I feel I can pick myself up over and over.

574
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,638
It doesn't have to be <i>karuta</i>.

575
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,310
But I want you to find something
that gives you that same feeling.

576
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:58,734
Then it will be an irreplaceable treasure
that will support you in the future.

577
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,571
Be it ten years

578
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,034
or even 100 years from now.

579
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,834
Why?

580
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:20,006
Why… do you care so much about me?

581
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,094
Well…

582
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,725
I suppose it's because…

583
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,895
I've encountered so many through <i>karuta</i>.

584
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,566
<i>Smiles like unpolished jewels.</i>

585
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Miss Oe.

586
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,668
There is… one thing.

587
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,508
That I'd cry about if I accomplished it.

588
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,434
Now it's colorful hankies!

589
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,810
Incredible!

590
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,729
Sorry about that.

591
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,606
Sorry, everyone.

592
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,822
Whoa!

593
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,076
What a super cute mask!

594
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,585
When a poem's first half is read out,
grab the corresponding card.

595
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,213
The first team to lose
all their cards wins.

596
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,425
Thank you.

597
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,553
Here.

598
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,015
Thank you.

599
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,565
Let's have a good game.

600
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,110
Let's have a good game.

601
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,906
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>

602
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,242
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

603
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,620
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

604
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,207
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

605
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:23,796
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

606
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,091
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

607
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:32,763
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

608
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,599
<i>The shallows run swift…</i>

609
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,642
Gotcha!

610
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,356
She's fast.

611
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,952
<i>There is… one thing.</i>

612
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,955
<i>That I'd cry about if I accomplished it.</i>

613
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,042
-You're first, Nagi. Amazing!
-Beyond amazing.

614
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:02,960
Thanks.

615
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,753
Amazing, Nagi!

616
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,047
You run so fast!

617
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,390
<i>If I could beat her at just one thing,</i>

618
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,643
then maybe I would cry…

619
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,772
like the girls from the <i>karuta </i>club.

620
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,113
Thank you

621
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,033
for sharing that with me.

622
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,373
Miss Oe?

623
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,751
What is it?

624
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,797
This must be the moment

625
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,801
that I've been playing <i>karuta</i>
all this time for.

626
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,934
Miss Meguru Aizawa…

627
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,646
leave it to me.

628
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,526
<i>As I venture out…</i>

629
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,445
-That was beautiful!
-Let's focus.

630
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,197
Yes, Miss Oe.

631
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,620
<i>On the high peak of Fuji</i>

632
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:25,417
<i>The snow tumbles gently down</i>

633
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,837
All right!

634
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,382
Bad luck, Mr. Yono.

635
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,887
It's okay. Just stay focussed.

636
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,352
I'd like you to memorize this.

637
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,937
Okay.

638
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:50,526
You're going to be in charge of the poems
you can get from the first syllable.

639
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,071
-Sweep them away like you did before.
-Right.

640
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,657
<i>Down from Tsukuba…</i>

641
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,783
Yes!

642
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,826
Nice one!

643
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,539
<i>The moment will come.</i>

644
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,333
<i>Don't let it pass you by.</i>

645
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,296
<i>The moment will come.</i>

646
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,799
FOR BEHIND A SINGLE CLOUD
THE MOON THAT NIGHT DID VANISH

647
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,678
In particular,
the poem beginning "going round"

648
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,557
that was composed by Murasaki Shikibu

649
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,978
<i>is sure to be a special card for you.</i>

650
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>Going round the path</i>

651
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,575
<i>If it is he whom I met</i>

652
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,453
<i>I cannot be sure</i>

653
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,835
You did it!

654
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,003
Nice one!

655
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,479
The red team win by one card.

656
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,691
Thank you.

657
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,068
Yay!

658
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,195
You guys are really skilled.

659
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,155
I can tell you play <i>karuta</i>.

660
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,907
I really love it.

661
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,702
-Are you at Mizusawa?
-Yes.

662
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,286
What's your name?

663
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,206
Nagi. Nagi Tsukiura.

664
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,379
I'm aiming to be Queen of Karuta.

665
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,433
Be sure to work hard at it.

666
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,642
I will!

667
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,520
Thank you.

668
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,605
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

669
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,774
Let's go.

670
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,985
And thank you, everyone.

671
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,654
-Thank you.
-That's all for today.

672
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,617
Let's go back to Mizusawa to play <i>karuta</i>.

673
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:51,582
Teacher said I'd be A-class
by the time she gets back.

674
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,208
Miss Aya, that is.

675
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,793
Come on, quick!

676
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,932
I'm sorry you didn't win
like you wanted to.

677
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,395
Miss Oe.

678
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:19,443
What you said earlier
about the treasure that would support me…

679
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,492
don't you think "100 years"
was going a bit far?

680
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,243
I expect to be dead by then.

681
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,372
You might be right there.

682
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,250
Having said that…

683
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,549
this poem's been around for 1,000 years.

684
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,931
FOR BEHIND A SINGLE CLOUD
THE MOON THAT NIGHT DID VANISH

685
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,980
Miss Oe…

686
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:04,238
please can I have
that letter of resignation back after all?

687
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,198
Huh?

688
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,325
Of course you can!

689
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,503
Huh? So you do want to play <i>karuta</i>?

690
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,255
No,

691
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,841
I just forgot to get a parent's signature.

692
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,259
Huh?

693
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,763
I'll call it a day there, then. Thank you.

694
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,599
Excuse me.

695
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,561
Thank you.

696
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,399
And she seemed so close
to sticking around.

697
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,652
Oh well.

698
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,530
There's no rush.

699
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,451
Everyone goes at their own pace.

700
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:04,882
AND I BECAME ADVISOR FOR THE KARUTA CLUB!

701
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,703
KANADE OE: AND I BECAME
ADVISOR FOR THE KARUTA CLUB!

702
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:50,093
WOW! REALLY?! AWESOME!
LET'S BOTH AIM FOR OMI SHRINE!

703
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,733
