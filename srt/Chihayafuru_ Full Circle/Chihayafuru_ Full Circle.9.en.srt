PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,508
Though regret might not
fix your past choices,

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:12,429
you can still turn them
into the right choices.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,557
Use all the tools at your disposal today

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,183
to make them the right choices.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,271
<i>Fuki?</i>

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,773
<i>Umezono's number 4 player forfeits.</i>

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,526
<i>We haven't lost all hope</i>
<i>of going to the All Japan.</i>

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,071
<i>We're now in the repechage tournament.</i>

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,114
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,160
<i>If we can get through that, we'll be</i>
<i>in the final qualifier in three weeks.</i>

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,248
WE'RE HEADED FOR THE FINAL QUALIFIER!

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,546
What? Mizusawa and Hokuoh both lost?

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,798
Please teach me more about <i>karuta</i>…

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,425
sir!

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,305
Fuki!

17
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,349
What's this about
playing <i>karuta </i>with your left hand?

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>You're left-handed, right?</i>

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,937
<i>I was advised to ask you</i>
<i>to practice with me.</i>

20
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,024
Our left-handed player's here.

21
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,403
I'm Taichi Mashima.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Dr. Mashima is the current Jun-Meijin.</i>

23
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,576
As in, second only to the Meijin?

24
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,554
Now I'll start sweeping.

25
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,555
Okay.

26
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,477
Your layout and posture are mirrored.

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,937
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,109
Put your weight on your left knee.

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,443
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,494
Imagine your left leg springing up
as you twist your body.

31
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,168
- Use your axis!
- Yes, sir.

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,715
<i>Three more matches.</i>

33
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,094
I just need it to last three more matches.

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,180
Can't we make it work somehow?

35
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,516
I'll do whatever it takes.

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,227
Please.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,146
Don't be unreasonable, Fuki.

38
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,359
As a doctor, I don't recommend it.

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,320
However,

40
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,409
speaking as a <i>karuta </i>player,
there is a way.

41
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,956
There's no guarantee it'll work in time.
Even less so that you can win.

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,459
But if you're prepared
to go through with it despite that…

43
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,004
I am. I'm prepared!

44
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,463
What are you saying? It's--

45
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,882
Please, Dad!

46
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,385
Let me do this.

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,395
Your center of gravity's off.

48
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,934
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

49
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,197
Please let me take time off cram school
just for now.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,949
POEM NINE:
FOR THIS JOURNEY'S SAKE

51
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,368
I'll be sure to catch up once it's over.

52
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,584
We already talked with the school
because we knew you'd ask!

53
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,795
- Huh?
- You go for it, Meguru!

54
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,630
- Is that okay?
- It is!

55
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,299
This is how you sweep, right?

56
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,969
Every school will be desperate.

57
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,222
We'll fight to the bitter end as well.

58
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,307
Right!

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,685
11 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

60
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,061
Final push now, guys!

61
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,271
Right!

62
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,403
HOKUOH HIGH SCHOOL
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

63
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,571
Put your heart and soul in it!

64
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,118
Let's go, Hokuoh!

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,706
You have an interesting
and unique style, Miss Aizawa.

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,041
Why did you reach over here just now?

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,460
Normally, one would reach over there.

68
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,586
Well,

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,882
after considering what cards
have been read and what cards are left,

70
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,178
something in me felt that
it was slightly more likely

71
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
that it'd be one of these.

72
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,017
For real? You think about stuff like that?

73
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,602
Huh? You mean not everybody does?

74
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:16,733
Probability and statistics can be applied
to competitive <i>karuta</i>, for sure.

75
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,652
I'm not as technical as that.

76
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,238
I go more by intuition, I guess.

77
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,156
Miss Aizawa.

78
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,285
Want to try changing the way
you think about <i>karuta</i>?

79
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,579
Huh?

80
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,849
10, 9, 8 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

81
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,146
<i>An autumnal wind</i>

82
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,607
<i>Blows down from Mount Yoshino</i>

83
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,109
<i>Late into the night</i>

84
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,695
Kenshin and Yosuke are at the ends,
seats 1 and 5.

85
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,113
SITTING ORDER FOR TEAM GAMES

86
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,450
I think it's best
if you focus on your own games.

87
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,913
Now, let's try out a practice game
with this order.

88
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,539
Okay.

89
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,043
<i>Parted we may be</i>

90
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,420
<i>But if on Mount Inaba</i>

91
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,757
<i>I hear the pine trees</i>

92
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,554
<i>This poem has often been used</i>
<i>as an incantation since ancient times.</i>

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,642
The second half would be pasted
or hidden by the front door

94
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,522
with a wish
that someone would one day return.

95
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,743
<i>By Naniwa Bay's marker</i>

96
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:56,082
<i>I would give my very life</i>

97
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,461
<i>How can I decide</i>
<i>Who I should choose as my friend?</i>

98
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,797
<i>The mountain hamlet</i>

99
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,468
<i>Is a place where loneliness</i>
<i>Prevails in winter</i>

100
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,482
Thank you.

101
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,488
Thank you.

102
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,328
You're so good!

103
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,248
I can't believe

104
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,002
someone beat you
at the All Japan in your senior year.

105
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,004
You're good, Kenshin.

106
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,423
You're good,

107
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,801
but you're nothing to be feared
in a team game.

108
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,722
Just like I was.

109
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,392
What do you mean?

110
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,605
Truly fearsome opponents in team games

111
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,983
aren't just good at <i>karuta</i>.

112
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,868
They make their whole team stronger too.

113
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,998
<i>Let's go, Umezono!</i>

114
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,291
Right!

115
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,001
<i>After we first met…</i>

116
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,628
A foul?

117
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,841
Calm down, Yaku Moku.
Just focus on your own game.

118
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,850
All of my friends

119
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,312
were those kinds of people.

120
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,238
<i>In the ancient city…</i>

121
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,864
<i>Like the waves that break…</i>

122
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,824
<i>The waterfall's sound…</i>

123
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,785
<i>Regretting regret…</i>

124
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,747
<i>Bright the moon still shone</i>
<i>As that night turned into dawn…</i>

125
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>Blown just a little</i>
<i>See how the plants of autumn…</i>

126
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,796
<i>Loud the crickets chirp…</i>

127
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,673
<i>Spring passes me by…</i>

128
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:13,302
<i>These two sleeves of mine</i>
<i>Like the rocks in the offing</i>

129
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,014
<i>Unrevealed by tides</i>

130
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,738
For the longest time,

131
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,866
I pretended I was still injured.

132
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,743
I…

133
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,873
wanted to get away from boxing.

134
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,422
And maybe because I couldn't face that
back then…

135
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,011
now, at such a crucial time…

136
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,723
I've injured myself again.

137
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,607
A liar like me

138
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,151
<i>could never beat him.</i>

139
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,870
Say that after you've devoted
your whole youth.

140
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,124
Huh?

141
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,796
I had someone I couldn't beat too.

142
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,426
When I whined that I could never beat them
even if I devoted my whole youth,

143
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,179
those are the words my teacher said to me.

144
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,514
<i>Not even if you devoted your whole youth?</i>

145
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,393
Mr. Eyelashes.

146
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,229
Say that after you've devoted it.

147
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,817
That's harsh.

148
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:59,200
At the time, I didn't understand what
he meant by "the true meaning of youth."

149
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,953
Youth…

150
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,167
It's not just the three years
of high school or something?

151
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,670
That's what I thought too.

152
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,966
But… that word was never
about describing a period of time.

153
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,262
Youthhood isn't a time?

154
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,306
I don't really get it.

155
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,935
Shoot!

156
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,978
I forgot I was going to the lab.

157
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,022
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

158
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,025
Don't sweat it.
It's my own fault I'm busy.

159
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,903
I've got both my residency
and the lab, see.

160
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,037
6 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

161
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,622
5 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

162
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,929
- Focus!
- Thank you.

163
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,389
Right!

164
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,599
4 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

165
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,768
3 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

166
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,186
2 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL QUALIFIER

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,025
- Almost there!
- Yes.

168
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,945
You made it!

169
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,406
Great job. You too, Yaku Moku.

170
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,367
Stole it!

171
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,411
- Stole it too.
- Nice, guys.

172
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,370
I stole it too.

173
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,332
<i>Evening descends</i>

174
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,835
<i>Kadota's paddy rustles</i>

175
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,144
LET'S GO TO THE ALL JAPAN!

176
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,189
All right.

177
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,650
Let's leave early today and get some rest.

178
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,610
All right.

179
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,404
It's finally time for the play-offs!

180
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,157
Nobody sleep in tomorrow, okay?

181
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,327
Says the person most likely to.

182
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,538
Okay, shall we tidy up?

183
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,664
- Let's.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,584
- Can someone…?
- We'll take it together.

185
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,377
Thanks.

186
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,130
Since she's in Kyoto,

187
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,342
Miss Oe won't make it
to the matches tomorrow, will she?

188
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,052
It's so sad.

189
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,929
I guess not.

190
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,557
Miss Oe's fighting her own battle.

191
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,643
That's right.

192
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,194
<i>Parted we may be</i>

193
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,907
<i>But if on Mount Inaba</i>

194
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>I hear the pine trees</i>

195
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,371
<i>Tell me that you wait for me</i>

196
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,208
<i>I shall hasten to return</i>

197
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,795
I made it!

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,216
Miss Oe!

199
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,303
I'm here… to deliver the <i>hakama</i>!

200
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,015
<i>Hakama</i>? <i>Hakama</i>! What? <i>Hakama</i>?

201
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,517
They're heavy.

202
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
I'm back.

203
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,444
Welcome home.

204
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,449
You all look well.

205
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,159
Yes. So do you, Miss Oe.

206
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,911
Yes, I'm well.

207
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,914
TELL ME THAT YOU WAIT FOR ME
I SHALL HASTEN TO RETURN

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,459
I'm sorry I can't be there
to cheer you on tomorrow.

209
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,005
But I'm glad I got to see you,
even if only for a moment.

210
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,217
It's given us a boost too.

211
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,135
Yes.

212
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,137
Well, then.

213
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,930
Give it your all!

214
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,849
We will.

215
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,434
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

216
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,060
- Goodbye.
- See you.

217
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,354
- <i>Hakama</i>!
- <i>Hakama</i>.

218
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,315
- Let's go.
- We're leaving now.

219
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,234
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

220
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,117
- Shall we go?
- Let's.

221
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,919
So tomorrow's the big day.

222
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,795
It is.

223
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,091
On our way home,

224
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,969
shall we stop to make one last prayer?

225
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,265
"For this journey's sake."

226
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,770
ONO SHRINE

227
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,862
Let's make offerings for everyone.

228
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,780
Okay.

229
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,333
<i>In lieu of a proper offering,</i>

230
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,837
<i>we present these maple leaves.</i>

231
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,258
<i>We entrust the rest</i>

232
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,469
<i>to the will of the gods.</i>

233
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,223
<i>For this journey's sake</i>

234
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,725
<i>I could prepare no tribute</i>

235
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,935
<i>May the many hues</i>

236
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,105
<i>Of Tamuke's autumn leaves</i>

237
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>Be made offerings instead</i>

238
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,032
You seemed to be
very deep in prayer back there.

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,621
That's because I started off
investing in virtue from a deficit.

240
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,415
A deficit?

241
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,709
Yes.

242
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,296
I often imagine it
when I come down this road.

243
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,721
What would have happened…

244
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,931
COMPETITIVE KARUTA EXPERIENCE

245
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:02,187
<i>…if, in that moment, I had taken</i>
<i>the road to the left with Nagi.</i>

246
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,488
You both came?

247
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,448
We did.

248
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
Want to give it a go?

249
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,119
We do.

250
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,078
Come on in, then.

251
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,582
Amazing!

252
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,000
Amazing!

253
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,794
You're good.

254
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,255
- Now you try.
- Okay.

255
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,840
One, two, three…

256
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,009
Very good.

257
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,594
Amazing.

258
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,014
<i>Could I have turned into someone else?</i>

259
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,350
I wonder if, in that moment,

260
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,271
maybe I went the wrong way.

261
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,903
I'm scared.

262
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
Really scared.

263
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,824
Because if tomorrow

264
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,620
I get trounced by Nagi…

265
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,250
I might go back to how I was
before I met you.

266
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,217
Miss Aizawa.

267
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,595
Did you know

268
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,681
that the <i>Hyakunin Isshu</i>
is sometimes called

269
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,309
an anthology of poems by history's losers?

270
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,021
- History's losers?
- Yes.

271
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:32,027
Many of the poems selected for it are by
people who lost wars or power struggles.

272
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,696
I never knew.

273
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,826
History is written by the victors.

274
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,788
Which is precisely why
Fujiwara no Teika wanted to preserve

275
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,916
the voices of the losers
for posterity, I believe.

276
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,710
I know I'd do the same.

277
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,344
If I had a time machine,

278
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,348
I'd go to see you
while you were a grade-schooler.

279
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,226
What?

280
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,228
To thank you

281
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,816
for going the wrong way.

282
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,488
After all,

283
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,909
it was only because you chose this road

284
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,580
that you found me, Miss Aizawa.

285
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
<i>And that you found </i>karuta<i>.</i>

286
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,430
<i>You also got to meet</i>
<i>everyone in the </i>karuta <i>club.</i>

287
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,706
It's all right.

288
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,960
You have lots

289
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,796
and lots

290
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,008
of good things in store for you.

291
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,776
It's like the Meijin said.

292
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,279
<i>"You can't fix your past choices,</i>

293
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,908
but you can still turn them
into the right choices."

294
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,964
Please don't forget.

295
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,009
Forever and wherever,

296
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,429
I'll be cheering you on.

297
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,809
I won't.

298
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,994
46TH ALL JAPAN
HIGH SCHOOL KARUTA CHAMPIONSHIP

299
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,662
FINAL TOKYO QUALIFIER VENUE

300
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,039
BURNING WITH THE KARUTA SOUL
UMEZONO COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

301
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,082
Hey, Sis is here!

302
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,208
Meguru!

303
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,747
The final qualifier

304
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,958
will be a round-robin tournament
between these four schools

305
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,211
with the remaining place
at the All Japan Championship at stake.

306
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,673
The team with the best overall record

307
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,217
will earn a ticket
to the All Japan Championship.

308
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,230
KANADE OE:
THANK YOU! I GOT TO SEE EVERYONE!

309
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,607
YOU: THAT'S GOOD!

310
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,613
Hanano?

311
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,868
- What's gotten you all flustered?
- Miss Ayase isn't here yet.

312
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,953
Mr. Meat Bun went to pick her up,

313
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,373
but she got held up
in customs or something.

314
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:59,586
Mr. Mashima says he's going to be late,
too, so I'm all on my own again.

315
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,091
Anyway, where's your Mizusawa T-shirt?

316
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,219
Well, the thing is,
I've kind of been coaching them,

317
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,555
so I'm afraid to say
I'm in the Umezono camp today.

318
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,016
You're joking! How can you be so disloyal?

319
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm not <i>not </i>rooting for them.

320
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,228
Then put this on--

321
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,523
Tsukuba!

322
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,652
Hey, Hanano! And Mr. Desk too! Sup?

323
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,445
Don't "hey" me!

324
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,531
Miss Ayase asked you
to cover for her, too,

325
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,866
but you never came to Mizusawa once!

326
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,660
At least cheer them on with me.

327
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,412
- No can do.
- Huh?

328
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,331
Tsukuba's one of the officials today.
Thanks for your work.

329
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,541
Officials?

330
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,000
TOURNAMENT OFFICIAL
MANAGEMENT STAFF

331
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,919
So I can't go taking sides with anyone.

332
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,922
- Over here, please, Mr. Tsukuba.
- Coming.

333
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,342
You'll just have to cheer
for the two of us, Hanano.

334
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,802
- Later.
- Okay.

335
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,388
No way!

336
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,848
What's with everyone?

337
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,891
- Come on, Hanano.
- Huh?

338
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,393
Wait for me!

339
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,068
All right.

340
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,279
We've got this, Fuki.

341
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,364
Yeah.

342
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,203
Okay.

343
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,751
Let's go, Umezono!

344
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,587
Right!

345
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,298
- Let's give it our all.
- Yes.

346
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,675
Announcing the playing order.

347
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,385
- All right.
- Let's go.

348
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,595
- Go for it.
- I will.

349
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,929
FIRST ROUND:
MIZUSAWA VS. HOKUOH

350
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,972
ADORE VS. UMEZONO

351
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,416
Tsukuba? Hey.

352
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,960
Mr. Mashima! Long time no see.

353
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,920
How's it going?

354
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,422
It's the second round right now.

355
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,884
Mizusawa and Adore both won
their first games.

356
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:15,013
MIZUSAWA 3-2 HOKUOH
ADORE 3-2 UMEZONO

357
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:33,532
FINAL QUALIFIER, SECOND ROUND
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL VS. HOKUOH HIGH SCHOOL

358
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,599
<i>The stubble of reeds…</i>

359
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,142
- On a streak!
- Nice!

360
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:11,653
If we lose this game, there'll be
no All Japan for Umezono, will there?

361
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,739
No. And the opposition
are ranked higher than us.

362
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,410
Even so, Umezono still has
a chance of winning.

363
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,667
Shirano.

364
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,503
Yes?

365
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,507
It was brave of you
to have Sota step in for you.

366
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,509
Not just anyone could do that.

367
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,140
<i>Sota.</i>

368
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,019
I want you to play instead of me
in the Hokuoh match.

369
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,646
What?

370
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,236
Don't worry, Fuki.
You lost the last one, but next time--

371
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,988
I hate to admit it, but I'm not ready.

372
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,160
I can't beat these guys with my left hand.

373
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,414
But…

374
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,628
I can't fill your shoes, Fuki.

375
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,464
I know.

376
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,010
I know how much you've been training.

377
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,852
<i>I don't know anyone else</i>

378
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,439
who likes <i>karuta </i>as much as you.

379
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,446
Please,

380
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,406
Sota.

381
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,203
<i>As I turn around</i>

382
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:47,123
<i>To behold the sky above</i>
<i>Mikasa's mountain</i>

383
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,209
- Switch it up, Hokuoh!
- All right!

384
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,421
Sorry I'm so fast.

385
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,309
You are fast.

386
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,771
However…

387
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,862
my friend…

388
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,199
is even faster.

389
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,915
<i>You're right.</i>

390
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,543
<i>I love </i>karuta<i>.</i>

391
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,547
<i>Even though I always lose.</i>

392
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>But even if I'm weak,</i>

393
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,594
<i>even if I'm pathetic…</i>

394
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,851
<i>getting a flow going…</i>

395
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,814
<i>is something I can do too!</i>

396
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,524
<i>The white beads of dew…</i>

397
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,832
Snatched it!

398
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,084
Nice!

399
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,591
- Stole it!
- Nice!

400
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,760
- Took it!
- Snatched it!

401
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,261
- Kept my streak!
- Nice!

402
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,598
They found their flow!

403
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,735
One win for Umezono.

404
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,654
Nice!

405
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,907
Hokuoh…

406
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
this game is ours!

407
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,247
Right!

408
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,333
<i>At this present time…</i>

409
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,250
Stole it!

410
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,752
<i>Looking at the moon…</i>

411
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,007
One win

412
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,301
for Hokuoh!

413
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,303
Nice!

414
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,388
Chieri…

415
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,142
<i>Near Mount Arima</i>

416
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,563
<i>As Ina's bamboo grass fields</i>
<i>Rustle in the breeze</i>

417
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,318
Two wins for Hokuoh!

418
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,277
Nice!

419
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,612
- Way to go!
- Nice!

420
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,738
Nicely done, Hokuoh!

421
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,709
Thank you, Sota.

422
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,170
You played well.

423
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,714
Our backs are against the wall.

424
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,926
One more loss, and it's…

425
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,268
I've got it from here.

426
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,361
<i>Are you trying to take</i>
<i>all the cards as fast as you can?</i>

427
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,114
Huh? Yes, I am.

428
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,866
Is that wrong?

429
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,744
There are plenty of players
with sharper ears and faster reflexes.

430
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,914
You have no hope of out-speeding them.

431
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,585
What should I do, then?

432
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,047
Let them take the cards.

433
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,508
Let them?

434
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,970
<i>You don't need a big lead</i>
<i>to win in </i>karuta<i>.</i>

435
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,181
<i>You just need one more hand</i>
<i>than your opponent.</i>

436
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,433
<i>As such,</i>

437
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,603
<i>it's inefficient to go after</i>
<i>every card on the mat.</i>

438
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,771
<i>Inefficient?</i>

439
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,025
Decide the order
in which you'll prioritize cards.

440
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,404
Let them have the one-
or two-syllable cards on their side.

441
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,575
<i>The trade-off is that you go for all cards</i>
<i>with three or more.</i>

442
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,204
<i>Aim for one corner of the card</i>
<i>you have your sights on</i>

443
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,831
<i>and minimize the distance you reach.</i>

444
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,835
<i>Every millimeter counts!</i>

445
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,220
That kind of <i>karuta </i>should suit you.

446
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,555
Incredible!

447
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,767
Her natural strengths
have been finely honed.

448
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,478
<i>For nary a soul visits</i>

449
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:23,942
<i>And the plants die where they stand</i>

450
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>Alone in my room</i>

451
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,324
<i>As I lament, I wonder</i>
<i>If you know or not</i>

452
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,584
<i>I'm not great at the listening</i>
<i>or the physical side.</i>

453
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,890
<i>But I know that even I</i>

454
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,184
<i>can get stronger.</i>

455
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,608
<i>As long as I don't give up on myself!</i>

456
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,277
<i>Driven by the wind…</i>

457
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,915
Two wins to Umezono!

458
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,917
Nice!

459
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,044
Nice!

460
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,346
Meguru! She brought it back to 2-2!

461
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,390
Which means

462
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,559
it's all down to him now.

463
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,729
<i>Forgotten by you…</i>

464
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,439
All right! I stole it!

465
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,523
Nice!

466
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,693
He's keeping up with Hokuoh's ace.

467
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,573
Haruma's come a long way.

468
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,743
He was always

469
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,163
just in his younger brother's shadow.

470
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,836
<i>If against my will</i>

471
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,546
<i>My time in this world is long…</i>

472
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,339
Okay.

473
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,314
I don't accept him as my older brother.

474
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,943
<i>Haruma gave up fighting</i>
<i>when he couldn't beat me anymore.</i>

475
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,117
I can't lose today, Sho.

476
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,206
Seriously?

477
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,124
You took your time.

478
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,713
You finally remembered, huh?

479
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,175
That you're my big bro.

480
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,556
Big bro?

481
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,777
- Stole it!
- Nice!

482
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,245
I can't afford

483
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,664
to lose either.

484
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,092
Yes!

485
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,426
<i>Haruma?</i>

486
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,013
<i>I hardly recognize you.</i>

487
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,486
Let's go, Umezono!

488
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,787
<i>Who knew you had this in you?</i>

489
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,916
<i>Why, in the course of my dreams</i>

490
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,173
<i>Do you evade detection?</i>

491
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,885
<i>How the wind rustles</i>

492
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,887
<i>The green leaves of the oak tree</i>

493
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,930
<i>By the stream this eve</i>

494
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,068
Yes!

495
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,324
Yes!

496
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,381
Umezono

497
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,884
has three wins!

498
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,874
MIZUSAWA 3-2 ADORE
HOKUOH 2-3 UMEZONO

499
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,752
I can't believe Umezono beat Hokuoh.

500
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,964
Mizusawa, Umezono, and Adore.

501
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,299
They're all still in the game.

502
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,803
But it's Mizusawa versus Umezono next.

503
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,138
Mizusawa's going to take this one home.

504
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,809
I wouldn't be so sure…

505
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:50,893
Huh?

506
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,187
Anything can happen in a team game.

507
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,315
Just like how ten years ago,
a bunch of unknowns like us

508
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,276
<i>made it to the All Japan.</i>

509
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,655
Not you too, Mr. Mashima!

510
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,574
What's going on
with all you Mizusawa alumni?

511
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,661
Are you okay, Haruma?

512
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,455
I'm quite all right.

513
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,839
I'll go buy some ice.

514
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,465
Thanks.

515
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,800
Sorry about this.

516
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,971
The third round will begin
at four o'clock.

517
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,724
Can we even play like this?

518
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,565
Haruma.

519
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,858
Mr. Shirano.

520
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,610
Will you give me

521
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,739
one more chance?

522
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:07,136
I don't have much virtue left to cash in,

523
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,473
but please take it.

524
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,484
I promise not to waste it.

525
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,866
I told you, I'm not <i>not </i>rooting for them.

526
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,953
So just whose side are you on, then?

527
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,915
I guess we're cheering them both on,
aren't we?

528
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,918
Umezono are Kana's kids, after all.

529
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,544
Same difference, right?

530
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,507
Yeah. That is a pickle.

531
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,223
Hurry up, Meat Bun!
The matches will be starting!

532
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,226
Don't rush me! I can't see a thing!

533
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,353
That's…

534
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,939
Anyway, it's happening next month.

535
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,524
…this person right here.

536
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,650
KARUTA QUEEN!
CHIHAYA AYASE

537
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,410
- What is that?
- Walking bags?

538
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,327
What's she wearing?

539
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,954
Did I make it in time?

540
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,332
Not even close, Miss Ayase!
The third game's--

541
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,836
Sorry! They stopped me at customs
and opened up all my bags.

542
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,130
It was so embarrassing
and took ages to put back.

543
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,965
No wonder they stopped you.

544
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,508
And what's that on your head?

545
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,179
This? The kids gave me
all kinds of farewell presents.

546
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,599
It's okay. I have one for all of you too.

547
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,809
Look!

548
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,353
I don't think you know what "okay" means.

549
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
Are these all full of souvenirs?

550
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,025
Yeah. I thought I could share them
with you since you're all here.

551
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,570
Actually, never mind that.

552
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,239
- Where are my kids?
- Miss Aya!

553
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,871
Guys!

554
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,748
I'm so sorry I'm late.

555
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,294
I just got back.

556
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,133
Miss Aya!

557
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,262
You've all done so well
to make it this far.

558
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,930
I'm sorry.

559
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,392
The third round will begin shortly.

560
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,944
We'll go book our place
at the All Japan now, Miss Aya.

561
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,910
Oh, hold on, everyone.

562
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,828
Your sashes are loose.

563
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,165
Help me out here, you guys.

564
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,833
Sure.

565
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,419
There.

566
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,469
Okay. Give it your all.

567
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,596
Go for it!

568
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,571
That's better.

569
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,658
Believe in yourselves

570
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,660
and in your teammates.

571
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,830
Make it the most fun game of <i>karuta</i>
you've ever played.

572
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,958
Yes, ma'am!

573
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,377
Let's do this.

574
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,809
<i>With no </i>karuta<i>,</i>

575
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,813
we never would have met each other.

576
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,357
I hope to be

577
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,445
one of those nameless people
who keeps this epic story going.

578
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,287
Excuse us.

579
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,288
All right.

580
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,457
You fought hard.
Thank you. Are you all right?

581
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,625
Yes, thank you.

582
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,472
Try not to let Shinohara psyche you out.

583
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,515
Got it.

584
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,027
That damn Fuki…

585
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,153
Huh?

586
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,281
What are you doing, Fuki?

587
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,991
Don't be crazy.

588
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,329
I can't win this match
without my right hand.

589
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,539
- Fuki…
- It's fine.

590
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,792
I've been saving it just for this.

591
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,379
And thanks to that,

592
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,007
the pain's almost gone.

593
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,886
You're not lying, are you?

594
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,889
I don't lie anymore.

595
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,434
Not to myself.

596
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,562
Not to you guys.

597
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,564
But what if this

598
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,275
makes the injury worse?

599
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,028
That's just fine.

600
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,617
As long as we win this match,
I don't care what happens.

601
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,956
- All right.
- Meguru?

602
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,501
But, Fuki promise me…

603
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,839
that you'll never say
you don't care what happens again.

604
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,469
Because the six of us

605
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:44,348
are going to keep playing <i>karuta</i>
for a long time after this.

606
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,479
Yeah.

607
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,233
You're right.

608
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,152
I won't say it again.

609
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,702
Okay.

610
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:17,381
I've lived my life till now
thinking I went the wrong way.

611
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,717
But it was by going this way

612
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,052
<i>that I found Miss Oe,</i>

613
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>found </i>karuta<i>,</i>

614
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,684
<i>and got to meet all of you.</i>

615
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,783
That's why

616
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,537
I'm going to prove today
that it was right to go this way.

617
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,039
Let's win.

618
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,125
Win and go to the All Japan.

619
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,003
We'll take everything we've learned

620
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,337
and throw it at Mizusawa.

621
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,382
Here we go.

622
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,178
Let's go, Umezono!

623
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,430
Right!

624
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:23,197
Is that really our girl?

625
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,999
Huh? Oh, it's you…

626
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,633
