1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,963
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,673
Please show me that people who find

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:10,260
their treasure in karuta
are guaranteed to have a bright future

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,721
waiting for them in ten years' time.

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:17,058
All right. I'll do it.
I'll be your evidence!

6
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,602
I will devote myself to it.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,730
I want to join too. The karuta club.

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,149
Maybe I could play it too.

9
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,359
Miss Aizawa has withdrawn her resignation!

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,819
Thank you for having me.

11
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:32,115
At last. At last we have
five members, Miss Oe! Thank you.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,536
Now we can play team games.
Let's all go to Omi Shrine!

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,831
None of this will happen
if you don't learn the poems.

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,958
There'll be a test next week.

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,376
Huh?!

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,215
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,563
CHOOSE THE CORRECT SECOND HALF

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,689
Okay, time's up.

19
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay.

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:09,861
Okay.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,532
-Here you are.
-Okay.

22
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,662
Amazing work, Mr. Okuyama.

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,331
Thank you.

24
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,626
Mr. Shirano, very good.

25
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,836
Miss Aizawa... Oh!

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,338
Not bad.

27
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,881
You all did brilliantly!

28
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,346
What the heck is this?

29
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,224
I'm sorry!

30
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,392
After all the help I gave you!

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,436
Sorry, Haruma!

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,105
Hey! Miss Murata!

33
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,898
Please wait! Miss Murata!

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,610
Right. Left.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,363
Right. Left.

36
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,157
Right. Left.

37
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,244
Right. Left.

38
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,745
Right.

39
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,623
Okay, let's hydrate.

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,962
I guess
this is how school clubs have to be.

41
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,214
Your sweeps have all improved.

42
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,717
Water! Excuse me!

43
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,314
What?

44
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,570
I wonder if we'll make it at this rate.

45
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,030
Everyone, fundamentals
are obviously important.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,490
235 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

47
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,411
But the most effective way to practice
is by playing actual games.

48
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,957
We'll play practice games
as much as time allows on weekdays

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,170
and enter tournaments on the weekends
to build up your match experience.

50
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,421
Yes, Miss Oe.

51
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,047
Miss Oe?

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,007
Yes?

53
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,259
Wouldn't everyone improve quicker

54
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,804
if we joined a karuta society
as well as this club?

55
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,055
A karuta society?

56
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,601
Is that sort of like
what we'd call a gym in boxing?

57
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,644
Precisely, Mr. Shirano.

58
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,648
All the good players
belong to a karuta society.

59
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,609
No idea where we'd find one.

60
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,361
I've never even heard of them either.

61
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,363
Don't you worry.

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:22,619
I found a karuta society
that's just right for all of you.

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,923
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

64
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,186
POEM THREE:
AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT

65
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,687
Here it is.

66
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,524
Fuchu Yugiri-kai.

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,736
We're here a little early.

68
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,655
Hello.

69
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,156
Hello.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,617
-Please, come on in.
-Thank you.

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,495
Since we're here, shall we wait inside?

72
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,663
Yes, Miss Oe.

73
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,873
-Thank you very much.
-Please.

74
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,792
Thank you very much.

75
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,710
-I wonder what it'll be like.
-Yeah.

76
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,879
Here we are!

77
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,464
Wait for me, please.

78
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm sorry, Miss Oe.

79
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,556
-What for?
-The shoes.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,683
Sorry.

81
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,937
It's a ritual of sorts for me.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,314
Ritual?

83
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,568
My mother taught me
that little actions like this

84
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,530
can build into something bigger
and bless me later.

85
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,243
You might call it
investing in virtue, Miss Aizawa!

86
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,912
That's easy to understand.

87
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,416
Not that I have any evidence!

88
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,042
No, that's all right.

89
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,087
Excuse me.

90
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,089
Excuse me.

91
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,467
Hello.

92
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,386
Hello.

93
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,513
Nice to meet you.

94
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,266
Nice to meet you.

95
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,393
Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,894
Nice to meet you.

97
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,856
-Shall we take a seat?
-Yes.

98
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:15,815
Let's.

99
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,651
-Miss Oe.
-Yes?

100
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,487
What's the president like?

101
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,740
Let me see.

102
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,160
Like a reliable big brother, perhaps.

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,164
We eat meat buns on Mondays

104
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,418
We eat meat buns on Tuesdays too

105
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,296
Huh? Meat Bun's not here yet.

106
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,256
Meat Bun's not here.

107
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,424
Meat Bun?

108
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,718
Who was that?

109
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,261
Who said Meat Bun?

110
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,642
Got you!

111
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,354
Hey, at least call me Master Meat Bun.

112
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,897
Master Meat Bun.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,273
That's better!

114
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,650
Get ready. We'll start right away.

115
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,279
-Yes, Master Meat bun!
-Okay. Hey, Kana! Sorry I kept you.

116
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,614
Meat Bun!

117
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,824
Oh, President Nishida, I mean.

118
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,244
Thank you so much
for helping our students.

119
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,206
I ain't decided to help them yet.

120
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,292
They have to pass our entrance test first.

121
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,543
What?

122
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
Another test?

123
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,338
That's right.

124
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,506
There's a lot of you,

125
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,092
so I'll make an exception
and see you two-by-two.

126
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,927
Starting with you two.

127
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,263
Okay.

128
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,143
To qualify for entry,
you need to take three hands from me.

129
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,269
Three?

130
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,480
Just three out of 50?

131
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,731
You got it.

132
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,819
Maybe even we could pull that off, then?
There are two of us.

133
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,571
Now, wouldn't that be nice?

134
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,950
All right! Let's do this!

135
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,120
Kana, do the honors?

136
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,496
Leave it to me.

137
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,044
In Naniwa Bay
Behold how the flower blooms

138
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,339
After winter's sleep

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,343
That's my Kana. What a voice.

140
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,304
And now, with spring's arrival

141
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:16,185
It reveals its full glory

142
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,106
And now, with spring's arrival

143
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:26,070
It reveals its full glory

144
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,366
Blown just a little
See how the plants of autumn…

145
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,951
He's fast!

146
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,203
Awesome.

147
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,715
There ya go!

148
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,647
Huh? You touched the wrong card!

149
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,817
What? You need to study more.

150
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,613
That's a watari-te, isn't it?

151
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,031
Watari-te?

152
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,035
Right. Mr. Orie told me about this.

153
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,204
This is the boundary

154
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,165
that separates your area
from your opponent's.

155
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,920
You're allowed to touch any cards that are
in the same area as the correct one.

156
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,796
I see.

157
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,757
That rule allows a player

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,885
to sweep away two cards
before a distinguishing syllable is read.

159
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,595
YO NO NAKA WA
YO NO NAKA YO

160
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,597
No way.

161
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,058
The mountain hamlet…

162
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,352
-Sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

163
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,492
Alrighty.

164
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,040
-No fair.
-What?

165
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,083
-No fair!
What?

166
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,085
-That's not fair!
-What?

167
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,465
Kakoi-te.

168
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,716
Kakoi-te?

169
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,262
A move for guarding cards
that take a long time to be identified.

170
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,724
You're kidding me.
I've not seen any of these techniques.

171
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,561
He's just too good.

172
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,563
Mr. Yusei Nishida.

173
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,857
A top player, even at the national level.

174
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,026
What? We have to take
three cards from him?

175
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,282
At least let me get this one.

176
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,492
FOR BEHIND A SINGLE CLOUD
THE MOON THAT NIGHT DID VANISH

177
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,411
There it is!

178
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,249
His hands are so low.

179
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,876
He snuck his in under hers to take it.

180
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,594
Well, little lady?
Still think you can pull it off?

181
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,897
All right!

182
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,902
-You touched the wrong card.
-What?

183
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,363
Wrong card.

184
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,699
Thank you.

185
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,704
Thank you.

186
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,417
We didn't win a single hand.

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,545
There are two of you.

188
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,423
You should have used your heads more.

189
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,012
You're a great reader.
You must be qualified.

190
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,723
No, not all. I'm really not very...

191
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,686
Are you...?!

192
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,580
So what are we going to do?

193
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,917
In the end, only Shirano passed.

194
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,669
Sorry.

195
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,295
Sorry.

196
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,381
And as for you, Okuyama,

197
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,966
you had a problem
none of us could've expected.

198
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,889
Behold how the flower blooms
After winter's sleep

199
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,643
And now, with spring's arrival…

200
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,312
Whoa. Wait up, Kana. Stop there.

201
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,357
What's up, Haruma?

202
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,736
I'm terribly sorry.

203
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,366
This always happens to me
when I play a match.

204
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,202
What? Are you putting me on?

205
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,121
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

206
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,749
It's just, I really can't help it.

207
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,335
Right. Got you.

208
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,339
Sorry, Kana. Once more from the top.

209
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,591
-Sorry.
-If you would.

210
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,055
In Naniwa Bay…

211
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,893
-What's going on?
-What is this?

212
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,895
I like you.

213
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,647
Do it again--

214
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,982
Meat Bun!

215
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,193
Okay.

216
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm so sorry.

217
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,992
No, that's not what I meant.

218
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,870
-Sit down.
-I've disgraced myself.

219
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,374
Still,

220
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,210
what was that all about?

221
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:38,174
The thing is, I'm not even sure myself.

222
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,179
When a game begins,
I just get all dizzy for some reason.

223
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,805
Dizzy?

224
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,474
Like the yips?

225
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,683
Perhaps.

226
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,143
The yips?

227
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,774
It's a psychological thing
where your body won't do what you tell it.

228
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,692
You see it in baseball.

229
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,235
And in boxing.

230
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,490
Don't worry about
getting into the society though.

231
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,367
I'm already a member of another one.

232
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,410
What?

233
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,496
-You are?
-Why didn't you say?

234
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,042
Well… you didn't ask.

235
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,877
Hold on.

236
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,338
So what class are you?

237
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,423
Well, I'm sort of C-class.

238
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,842
-No wonder you know so much.
-That's really good!

239
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,138
Or at least I might be,
if only I could play matches.

240
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,356
As such, I'm thinking I could
act as manager for the time being.

241
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,566
I can practice just fine.

242
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,111
And I do know a thing or two about karuta.

243
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,825
That is, if you'd all be happy
with that, of course.

244
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,745
Of course we would be. Right?

245
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,748
It would be my honor!

246
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,542
In any case,

247
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:58,295
we need the two of you
to get into the Yugiri-kai somehow.

248
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,881
Shall we see what Miss Oe says?

249
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,426
Oh, about her…

250
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,555
-Yes.
-What? Is something up with her?

251
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,808
It's just, when we came
to practice at lunch…

252
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,644
Beyond Mount Oe
Goes the road to Ikuno

253
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,105
The journey is long

254
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,401
And my eyes are yet to spy

255
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:25,614
Amanohashidate

256
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,370
Miss Oe.

257
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,747
Oh, Miss Murata and Mr. Okuyama.

258
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,499
How nice to see you.

259
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,211
-Did something good happen?
-Can you tell?

260
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,172
Just about.

261
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,426
It was just like a dream!

262
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,512
I mean, the one and only Izumi Nakanishi

263
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,516
deigned to grace me with some pointers
to improve my reading!

264
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,019
Izumi Nakanishi?

265
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
Izumi Nakanishi…

266
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,695
-You mean the professional reader?
-Yes, that's right!

267
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,199
Like a wizard?

268
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,828
-You're thinking of a different word.
-Huh?

269
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:18,834
It's a kind of specialist who has
the highest level of skill for a reader.

270
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,879
There are only seven
in the whole of Japan.

271
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,922
Moreover,

272
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,717
I have even been blessed
with an invitation to dinner.

273
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,345
Thank you, Meat Bun!

274
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,222
Blessings be upon the Yugiri-kai!

275
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,976
Okay, let's forget about Miss Oe for now.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,270
-Right.
-What do we do, then?

277
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,945
I have an idea.

278
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,284
PRACTICE SCHEDULE

279
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,622
I planned your training
in advance of your retest in two weeks.

280
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,293
We're going to overcome each of the issues
President Nishida brought up.

281
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,213
It will also prepare us
for the All Japan Championship.

282
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,714
You're right.

283
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,134
As Haru Bun says,
let's do anything we can.

284
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,929
You said "Haru Bun."

285
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,222
-Oh!
-Sorry.

286
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,724
I mixed "Meat Bun" with "Haruma"!

287
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,810
-Sorry.
-Not at all.

288
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,480
Just a little more, everyone. Keep it up.

289
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,112
Your memory's good. You know the poems.

290
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,781
But you don't move your body.

291
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,493
Did you attack my territory once
in that game just now? Huh?

292
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:38,414
Your body's axis is weak,
so you unconsciously don't reach out.

293
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,584
Start by building your strength
and doing core exercises!

294
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,378
I can't do it anymore.

295
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,172
I didn't expect this in karuta.

296
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
Firstly, "mu."

297
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
"Mu" is for muscular.

298
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,429
-Muscular?
-Yes.

299
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,431
Next, "su." A dream of su.

300
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
You're the opposite.

301
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,602
You move well,
and I can't fault your reflexes. But!

302
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,398
You don't know the cards' position at all
and constantly touch the wrong ones.

303
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,235
And it's all down to your shoddy knowledge
of the actual poems.

304
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,237
Go back and learn them!

305
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,159
Memorization is fundamental.

306
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,836
Momo, tago, fu, kaku, ima wa. Time!

307
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,088
-You passed.
-All right!

308
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,927
Fifteen seconds to go.

309
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,972
What was this one again?

310
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,475
What was it?

311
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,646
And this is a cultural club?

312
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,567
It's a sports club at this point!

313
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,449
Meguru, your bath's ready.

314
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,370
Meguru?

315
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,081
I'm opening the door.

316
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,378
Megu--

317
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,023
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

318
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,149
I signed this for you.

319
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,150
Right.

320
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,278
Hey, I didn't know you
were in a karuta club.

321
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,489
I just forgot to leave it.

322
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,406
Oh, really?

323
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,968
OKONOMIYAKI NISHIDA

324
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,220
Whenever I have business in Tokyo,

325
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,181
I always stop by
at Mr. Nishida's Yugiri-kai

326
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,934
and this restaurant of his.

327
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,019
Right!

328
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,479
Right?!

329
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,774
-Here.
-Thank you ever so much.

330
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,569
I've read all of your essays.

331
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,990
I know you're a leading researcher
of classical literature by day.

332
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,118
You're too kind.
I'm just a slave to the classics.

333
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,122
Actually,

334
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:31,086
I once applied
to work at your research institute.

335
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,590
But it wasn't meant to be, unfortunately.

336
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,051
Oh! We must have had
no eye for talent, then.

337
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,761
Don't be absurd.

338
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,889
I just wasn't good enough.

339
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,474
Okay, yours is all done, Izumin.

340
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,310
Oh, here it is!

341
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,729
The house specialty, yaemugura-yaki.

342
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,815
You can't get it anywhere in Kyoto.

343
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,484
-Here.
-Thanks.

344
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
And now…

345
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,869
These two go so well together,

346
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,455
they must have been married
in a past life.

347
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,789
Try it.

348
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,292
Don't mind if I do.

349
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:20,928
I… don't suppose there were
any other shortcomings in my recitals?

350
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,016
Your speaking volume,
rhythm, sense of stability,

351
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,937
use of pauses,
understanding of the waka themselves,

352
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,607
they're all at a very high level.

353
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,942
Really?

354
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,571
-However…
-However?

355
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,951
…your nasal sonants
aren't quite there yet.

356
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,619
My nasal sonants?

357
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,121
Ga-gi-gu-ge-go.

358
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,499
If a reader
can't pronounce them correctly,

359
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:55,045
I don't consider them a true reader,
even if I recognize their other talents.

360
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:04,638
Could you… tell me a good way
to practice them at all?

361
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,101
Let me see.

362
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,813
I would recommend… that thing?

363
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
Yeah, that.

364
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,067
-Huh?
-Yeah.

365
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,319
That!

366
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,643
Has brought me to understand

367
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:57,357
How empty I was before

368
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,152
Loud the crickets chirp

369
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,612
On this dark and frosty night…

370
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,407
Thank you.

371
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,119
Thank you.

372
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,746
Only one sleeve over me

373
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:16,126
Will I sleep alone tonight?

374
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,967
-Miss Oe?
-Yes, Mr. Okuyama?

375
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,346
Do you think you could teach me
how to be a reader?

376
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,264
Yes. What?

377
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,769
You're not able to be here
every day when we practice,

378
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:39,608
and I thought I might like to make myself
at least a little useful at those times.

379
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:45,030
Of course. I'd do so gladly,
if I'll suffice as a teacher.

380
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,033
-Thank you very much.
-The pleasure's all mine.

381
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,410
Aw, man…

382
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,704
How do you guys remember the poems?

383
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,498
Miss Aizawa?

384
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,835
I use these.

385
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,756
What is this?

386
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,468
For some reason,
each card has its own unique number.

387
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,554
I never noticed these before.

388
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,099
That's the poem number.

389
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,101
-Poem number?
-Yeah.

390
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,438
Poems in the Hyakunin Isshu are
sorted chronologically by number.

391
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:22,275
"In the autumn field," thought
to have been composed circa 600,

392
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,903
is the oldest poem and so is Poem 1.

393
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,699
Composed circa 1200,
"The emperor's court" is Poem 100.

394
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:35,247
Maybe even I could remember them
using that method.

395
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,166
Miss Aizawa, you can't mean

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,087
that you didn't learn them
through the second halves or wordplay,

397
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,006
but through the poem numbers?

398
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,926
Yes. I thought it'd be more efficient.

399
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,177
What have I done?

400
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,470
Is that bad?

401
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,514
Yes. No, I don't mean that.

402
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,935
What a novel approach.
Genius, even? Wait. No, not that.

403
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,895
But it's better than not learning…

404
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,857
No. Permitting this will disgrace me.

405
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,402
-She's speaking out loud.
-No, I can't overlook this.

406
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,864
Let's study the backgrounds to the poems.

407
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,367
I'll take responsibility
for teaching it all from the ground up.

408
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,952
What?!

409
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,919
REACTION BALL: AIZAWA
(GOAL: TEN CATCHES)

410
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,630
Here we go!

411
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,634
What is this? It goes different ways.

412
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,635
Miss Aizawa!

413
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,639
-You too, Haruma!
-Me too?

414
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,766
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

415
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,143
Parted we may be

416
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,354
But if on Mount Inaba
I hear the pine trees

417
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,400
Tell me that you wait for me
I shall hasten to return

418
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,112
"Parted We May Be" is a farewell poem.

419
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:55,076
It means, "If you're waiting for me,
I'll come straight home,"

420
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,289
and has been used as an incantation
since ancient times.

421
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,125
Here we go.

422
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,502
-Bring it on.
-Okay.

423
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,213
Nice.

424
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,006
Yes!

425
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,883
All right.

426
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,970
Bad luck! Here it comes.

427
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,805
Okay.

428
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,247
I borrowed them from the baseball club.

429
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,917
-Is this "borrowing"?
-As long as I give them back--

430
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,711
-Oh crap!
-Those balls!

431
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,506
-I wondered where they were.
-I only borrowed them.

432
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,466
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

433
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,969
But what did you want them for?

434
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,637
Want to play baseball again?

435
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,639
We used them for karuta practice.

436
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,933
You're in the karuta club, Chieri?

437
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,184
I am.

438
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,688
I wondered why you left so suddenly.
Karuta club, huh?

439
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,649
That really doesn't suit you.

440
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,067
Shut up.

441
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,444
I like it.

442
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,654
More than baseball?

443
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,658
That's right.

444
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,660
Even more than baseball.

445
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,329
You're lying for sure.

446
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,165
You're the last person who'd say that.

447
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,835
You're baseball crazy.

448
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,593
Shut up!

449
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,928
-Hey, quit it!
-Shut up!

450
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,431
-Hey, Chieri!
-Miss Murata!

451
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,100
-Excuse me.
-Man!

452
00:26:59,034 --> 00:26:59,993
Are you okay?

453
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,414
Why wouldn't I be? Let's go.

454
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,254
At this present time

455
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,341
If I can see you no longer
I wish for a way

456
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,428
I could tell you in person
That I'll cease to think of you

457
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,558
Fujiwara no Michimasa had been
in an unacceptable love affair,

458
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:28,021
and he put the thoughts
he was unable to express in this poem.

459
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:33,234
"With great sadness,
I am giving up on you."

460
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:39,324
"If only I could express my regret
to you in person."

461
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,759
Miss Murata.

462
00:27:58,968 --> 00:27:59,886
Huh?

463
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,516
You…

464
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,892
What?

465
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,687
Maybe you should…

466
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,901
You're right.

467
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,278
What is this?

468
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,414
It's a good poem, isn't it?

469
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,252
It's all Michimasa's fault.

470
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,257
Sorry, Miss Oe.

471
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,384
I'm leaving early today.

472
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,783
Miss Murata was devoted to being
a pitcher ever since she was a kid.

473
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,038
She and her childhood friend,
Mr. Yuki Nagashima,

474
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,041
were batterymates since Little League.

475
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,670
What? Is that the same Nagashima
who's with me in Class B?

476
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,589
Yes, that Mr. Nagashima.

477
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,257
I see.

478
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,176
They both dreamed

479
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,596
of going to Koshien together
after they started at Umezono.

480
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,350
Boys and girls can't play together
in high-school baseball,

481
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,896
but they believed
that rule would change one day.

482
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,315
Nice pitch!

483
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,691
One more time!

484
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,443
Little by little, though,

485
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,987
the situation changed.

486
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:46,701
She went to practice each morning,
went through the same drills,

487
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,873
only for the gap between the boys and her
to keep widening.

488
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,294
Despite that, she managed
to hang in there somehow

489
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,214
because of her promise to Mr. Nagashima.

490
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,549
Then, one day…

491
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,884
Haruma!

492
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,637
I'm sick of baseball.

493
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:07,972
I'm quitting.

494
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,183
See you later.

495
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,894
The physical difference was just too much.

496
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:19,108
Knowing Miss Murata, though,
that doesn't explain everything.

497
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,612
Her answer changed every time I asked,

498
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,198
and in the end,
she would just make a joke out of it.

499
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,661
Even I don't know the true reason.

500
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,704
I see.

501
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,668
CRAM SCHOOL

502
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,634
I have to get going now.

503
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,262
You've got it rough.

504
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,976
Sorry. Can I leave the books to you?

505
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,310
See you tomorrow, then.

506
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,521
-See you.
-Goodbye.

507
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,821
Hey, Haruma.

508
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,197
Yes?

509
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,244
Do you think
Miss Murata went straight home?

510
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,616
-Lift the bat up high.
-High?

511
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,660
-Lower your hips more.
-Right.

512
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,996
Look forward and tuck in your chin.

513
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,789
-Tuck in my chin?
-That's it.

514
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,587
Imagine you're smacking down
from high to low.

515
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,923
How do I swing it from here?

516
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,470
-The balls are coming!
-What? I can't do this!

517
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,725
And the next one. Swing!

518
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,021
Look at the ball and don't think.

519
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:21,856
Swing!

520
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,527
-Empty your head.
-I don't think I'll hit any.

521
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,488
Swing!

522
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,331
How am I going to face
the clubroom tomorrow?

523
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,000
Nothing's changed from before.

524
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,294
That reminds me.

525
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,841
Here. I came to give you this.

526
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,432
I know what Miss Oe says,
but it's better than not knowing them.

527
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:02,438
Some people are visual learners,
so I tried making illustrations.

528
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,858
Did you do all this yourself?

529
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,860
Well, you know,

530
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,656
the numbers worked for me.

531
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,036
You really are

532
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,206
a master artist, aren't you?

533
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,420
I'll have it back, then!

534
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,172
No! It's mine!

535
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,719
I won't give it--

536
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,972
Thanks.

537
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,935
-Yeah.
-For not asking any questions.

538
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,396
Yeah.

539
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,444
I'll tell you all about it
once I've got my head straight.

540
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,030
Just give me a little bit of time?

541
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,119
Yeah.

542
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,923
PRACTICE SCHEDULE

543
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:20,349
President Nishida is a top player,
the kind who is invited to title matches.

544
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,311
And you need to take three hands from him.

545
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,938
To put it another way,
you only need three.

546
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:30,026
If you narrow down the cards
you'll go for and forget the rest,

547
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,445
you both stand more than a chance.

548
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,322
Fifteen seconds to go.

549
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,034
Meguru.

550
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,499
President Nishida gave us a hint too.

551
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,586
"If you're working as a pair,
use your heads more."

552
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,965
With that in mind, I spoke with Miss Oe,
and we devised a strategy.

553
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,553
FRIEND CARDS

554
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,138
Friend cards?

555
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,307
CRAM SCHOOL

556
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,728
There's a study camp
over the long weekend in November.

557
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,941
It will be very important for your exams,
so be sure to join us.

558
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,359
SPECIAL FALL STUDY CAMP

559
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,619
This means, "If I were a bird,
I could fly all over the world."

560
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,622
"Chi ha" is crimson. Chi ha.

561
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,211
WORK

562
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,512
Full marks!

563
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,721
I did it!

564
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,391
Straight.

565
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,393
CRAM SCHOOL

566
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,524
Right.

567
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:55,736
Take a deep breath
and read it out in a relaxed way.

568
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,904
Right.

569
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:03,161
After the shower
The dew still has not dried up

570
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,662
WORK

571
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,748
I'd like to quit.

572
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,917
What? You're leaving? Really?

573
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,294
You're kidding!

574
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,461
Please reconsider!

575
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,629
I'll up your pay!

576
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,423
I've already made up my mind.

577
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,591
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,433
-I did it!
-Congratulations!

579
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,851
Incredible!

580
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,228
To a heart that wata no hara speaks of.

581
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,565
What? Yes!

582
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,691
Miss Murata.

583
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,048
Okay.

584
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,984
You know what the coach told me?

585
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:24,325
"Nagashima has the skills
to be on the starting team."

586
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,870
"There's just one problem."

587
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,165
He's too hung up on being in a battery
with you.

588
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,920
"He refuses to work with anyone but you."

589
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,467
"You understand what I'm trying
to say here, don't you, Murata?"

590
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,391
"Be the club manager."

591
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,810
That's what he said.

592
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,525
That's why I decided
I might as well just quit.

593
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,821
Yuki…

594
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,826
doesn't know any of this.

595
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,832
Because if he did,
I'm sure he'd stop playing baseball.

596
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,586
That's the kind of guy he is.

597
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,676
At this present time

598
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,387
If I can see you no longer
I wish for a way

599
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,932
I could tell you in person
That I'll cease to think of you

600
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:36,439
If only I could express
My regret to you in person.

601
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,658
That's why Yuki

602
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,953
absolutely can't know about it.

603
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,464
Karuta's something else, isn't it?

604
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,094
I was really inspired

605
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,056
back when I first saw Sota compete.

606
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,226
I feel bad for saying this,

607
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,606
but that pink-haired girl who beat Sota

608
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,983
really inspired me too.

609
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,363
Boy or girl, it really doesn't matter.

610
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,368
Is there any other kind of sport
like that?

611
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,465
Just you wait, competitive karuta.

612
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,594
I'm gonna be Queen of Karuta
and take all the masters down.

613
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,269
Cold and unfeeling

614
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,527
A cuckoo cries out

615
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,243
With nothing but the dawn moon
Remaining still in the sky

616
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,291
Thick patches of weeds

617
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,253
I see not a single soul

618
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,255
But autumn is surely here

619
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,007
At this present time

620
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,219
I hit it!

621
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,806
Meguru. You hit it!

622
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,475
-I hit it!
-You hit it!

623
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,106
Awesome.

624
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,736
FUCHU YUGIRI-KAI

625
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,990
Shall I drop it to two hands?

626
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,616
Three is just fine.

627
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,660
And in return,

628
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,247
if we win,
you show us your high-school yearbook.

629
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,292
Huh? What kind of a deal is that?

630
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:05,087
I want to find
an embarrassing photo of you.

631
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,466
-Whoa, hang on there--
-Is that a no?

632
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,845
There's no way
you'd lose to the likes of us, right?

633
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,602
All right!

634
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,780
In Naniwa Bay

635
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,074
Behold how the flower blooms

636
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,536
After winter's sleep

637
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,415
And now, with spring's arrival

638
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:46,921
It reveals its full glory

639
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,381
All right. It's just another game.

640
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,093
And now, with spring's arrival

641
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:58,182
It reveals its full glory

642
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,644
Fleeing solitude

643
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,104
I step outside of my home…

644
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,441
Well, that was a given.

645
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,821
Of course.

646
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,742
This is fine though.

647
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,998
I spoke with Miss Oe,
and we devised a strategy.

648
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,667
The key to victory

649
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,793
is this.

650
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,752
FRIEND CARDS

651
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,965
Friend cards start the same way
before they can be distinguished.

652
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,759
For instance, poems that can be
distinguished by their third syllable…

653
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,927
IMA WA

654
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,513
…like "At This Present Time"
and "You Said You Would Come"…

655
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,472
IMA KO

656
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,100
…are friend cards
that are especially ripe for watari-te.

657
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:49,149
Decide who will take each card
and go for both the moment you hear "ima."

658
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,237
That way, you can be
one step ahead of President Nishida.

659
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,200
The leaves of the maple tree

660
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,579
At this present time

661
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,622
If I can see you no longer

662
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,082
I wish for a way

663
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,417
We did it!

664
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,378
-Yes!
-You did it!

665
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,629
It worked.

666
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,600
Looks like you didn't waste
the past two weeks.

667
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,436
Of course not.

668
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,191
The match is
only just getting started though.

669
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,530
All right.

670
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,782
Come on!

671
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,203
That's what I'm talkin' about!

672
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:53,672
Your specialty card is "After the shower"
and yours is "Going round the path," yes?

673
00:43:54,757 --> 00:44:00,387
President Nishida will react to both
on hearing the opening "M" consonant.

674
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,557
As such, you'll split them between you.

675
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,769
MU

676
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,688
ME

677
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,774
Nothing but this ritual

678
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:17,404
Reminds me it is summer

679
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,995
After the shower

680
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,623
The dew still has not dried up

681
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,375
On the fern pine's leaves

682
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,459
Got it!

683
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,544
Nice cover!

684
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,004
Very nice!

685
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,256
She swept it out of his territory.

686
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,929
One more hand.

687
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,192
Awesome!

688
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,997
That one hand's a long way off.

689
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,084
Hang in there.

690
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,222
Cards distinguished on the sixth syllable
are great mountain cards.

691
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,226
President Nishida is sure
to use kakoi-te for them.

692
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,981
You favor different hands,
so reach out from both sides.

693
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,326
I see not a single soul

694
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,373
But autumn is surely here

695
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,670
Night fades into dawn

696
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:07,306
Then an opening is sure to appear
in President Nishida's guard.

697
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,099
That's when…

698
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,319
I call it the double kakoi-te breaker,
type zero!

699
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,362
How edgy.

700
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,448
We did it!

701
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,992
We did it, Meguru!

702
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,619
We did, Chieri!

703
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,464
Thank you.

704
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,510
You got me!

705
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,431
You both qualify for the Yugiri-kai!

706
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,059
-We did it!
-You did it!

707
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,061
You did! Amazing work, you two!

708
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,356
-We did it!
-I knew you could!

709
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,400
-They did it, Miss Oe!
-Yes!

710
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,613
Although "After the shower"
and "Going round the Path"

711
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,324
aren't friend cards, technically speaking.

712
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:08,951
That's right.

713
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,454
Looks like the two of them are though.

714
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,248
Friends, I mean.

715
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,818
CLOSED FOR PRIVATE EVENT

716
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,152
Right. Yeah.

717
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,738
Yeah. I won't be too late.

718
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,490
See you.

719
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,620
-Hey, Meguru! Did you see the yearbook?
-Huh?

720
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,331
