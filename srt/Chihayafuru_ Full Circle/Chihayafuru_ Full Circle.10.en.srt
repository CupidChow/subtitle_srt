00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,838
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,339
I didn't get it.

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,802
<i>Why cry that much</i>
<i>when you went out in the first round?</i>

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,097
If I could beat her at just one thing,

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,599
then maybe I would cry

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,602
like the girls from the <i>karuta </i>club.

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,565
Yes!

8
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,112
Umezono

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,573
has three wins!

10
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,827
<i>I can't believe Umezono beat Hokuoh.</i>

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,413
Mizusawa, Umezono, and Adore.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,082
They're all still in the game.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,959
Oh, hold on, everyone.

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,878
Your sashes are loose.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,880
<i>Let's win.</i>

16
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,965
<i>Win and go to the All Japan.</i>

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,843
<i>We'll take everything we've learned</i>

18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>and throw it at Mizusawa.</i>

19
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,306
Now, please deal the cards.

20
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,933
Let's have a good game.

21
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,521
Your reader is Kanade Oe,
an A-class official reader.

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,632
Now commencing the first round…

23
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,591
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

24
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,760
…Adore Girls' Academy
versus Umezono High School

25
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,180
and Hokuoh High School
versus Mizusawa High School.

26
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,905
READERS' WAITING ROOM

27
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,033
Coming in.

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:07,043
You don't need to hide just because
you're going to be the reader.

29
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,337
No, I'm quite happy in here.

30
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,840
This way, they're able to focus.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,218
I don't want to be a distraction.

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,681
I'll sit down, if you don't mind.

33
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,192
<i>Me? The reader for the final qualifier?!</i>

34
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,111
Yes.

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,074
I had planned to read,
but now I'd like you to do it instead.

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,662
But that would mean
I'd be reading for my own students'…

37
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,296
Or is that the point?

38
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,839
Miss Oe.

39
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,551
I'm thinking of retiring from reading
in the near future.

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,511
What? Seriously?

41
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:03,308
As such, I have a strong desire
to cultivate a professional reader

42
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,560
to succeed me.

43
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,315
You remain the top candidate to do so.

44
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,820
Your recital of "O leaves of crimson"
at the readers' screening, however…

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,866
<i>When I heard</i>
<i>your personal feelings creep in,</i>

46
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,580
my confidence in you
was a little shaken, quite frankly.

47
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,957
Errors like that

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,128
are completely unacceptable
in games where the title of Meijin

49
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
or Queen of Karuta is at stake.

50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,884
I am truly sorry about that.

51
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:45,016
A reader is to remain impartial
in any situation and to all players.

52
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,311
Professional readers
must be the epitome of that.

53
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:55,026
Let me put you to the test
to see if you are fit

54
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,695
to take up my baton.

55
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,033
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,245
I understand.

57
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,939
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

58
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,490
<i>We will now begin the third round.</i>

59
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,325
POEM TEN:
IN NANIWA BAY

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,077
Let's have a good game.

61
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,291
Let's have a good game.

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,052
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,638
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

64
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,015
Let's go, Umezono!

65
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,933
Right!

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,187
<i>And now, with spring's arrival…</i>

67
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,857
She's taken it up yet another level.

68
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,484
That's our Kana.

69
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,653
Mi-zu-sa-wa!

70
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,613
Let's go!

71
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,240
Right!

72
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,452
<i>Mizusawa's yelling too.</i>

73
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,205
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

74
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,752
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

75
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,669
<i>Here it comes!</i>

76
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,131
Snatched it!

77
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,924
Nice!

78
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,303
So quick. Is Umezono gonna be okay?

79
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,637
Meguru…

80
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,516
- Three in a row!
- Me too!

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,726
Stole it!

82
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,651
Let's all take the next one too.

83
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
Right!

84
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,908
They're as tough as ever.

85
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,201
Yes, they are.

86
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,665
<i>The hearts of others</i>
<i>May change without my knowing…</i>

87
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,959
<i>If the meaning of</i>

88
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,961
<i>Mount Osaka's kadsura</i>

89
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>Is "to share a bed"</i>

90
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,762
And there I thought we could be friends.

91
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,558
Telling lies, though…

92
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,063
That's unforgivable.

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,906
<i>I do not lament</i>
<i>From a moonstruck reverie…</i>

94
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,866
<i>Looking at the moon…</i>

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,828
What's this? I remember you being better.

96
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,628
It's all Mizusawa.

97
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,340
We need to get the momentum
back with us somehow.

98
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,978
"The shallows run swift."

99
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,711
<i>Nagi.</i>

100
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,258
<i>I… was always so scared</i>
<i>of sitting opposite you.</i>

101
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,263
<i>Because it reminds me</i>
<i>that I'm one of the losers.</i>

102
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,689
<i>Bright the moon still shone</i>
<i>As that night turned into dawn</i>

103
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>Upon our parting</i>

104
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>So</i>

105
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,488
<i>why is it</i>

106
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,992
<i>that I'm not scared at all now?</i>

107
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,831
<i>Everyone's names are in these cards.</i>

108
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,375
MEGURU, YAKUMO, YONO,
SHIRANO, OKUYAMA, OE, MURATA

109
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,797
<i>They're here with me too.</i>

110
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>And what's more…</i>

111
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,519
<i>And now the first light of day…</i>

112
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,687
<i>There's that reassuring sound.</i>

113
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,482
<i>It's just like being back at…</i>

114
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>Please don't forget.</i>

115
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,280
Forever and wherever,

116
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,575
I'll be cheering you on.

117
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>Into Mika's fields…</i>

118
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,081
Snatched it!

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,374
All right!

120
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,384
One card at a time, guys, as always.

121
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,885
Right!

122
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,595
As always?

123
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,312
That's right.

124
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,066
Miss Murata.

125
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,861
Look.

126
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>Right.</i>

127
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,666
<i>As always.</i>

128
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,712
<i>Haruma's always been by my side.</i>

129
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,596
<i>And the way</i>

130
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,182
<i>he fought like his life depended on it</i>

131
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,977
<i>was so damn cool.</i>

132
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,108
<i>Why does my heart long for you…</i>

133
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>And I want Haruma</i>

134
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,903
<i>to see me</i>

135
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,239
<i>in a new light too!</i>

136
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,951
<i>Deep in the mountains</i>
<i>Parting red leaves underfoot</i>

137
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,494
<i>Crying, a deer's voice</i>

138
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,760
<i>If your love for me</i>

139
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,970
<i>Will last for long, I know not</i>

140
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>And now my feelings</i>

141
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,099
I'm truly sorry for what I did.

142
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,185
Huh? What's this?

143
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,895
Trying to trick me--

144
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,979
However…

145
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,068
I can't let you win this match.

146
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,114
After all…

147
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,409
Everyone's waiting for you
to come back, Yaku Moku.

148
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,162
See our determination with your own eyes.

149
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,835
I am Umezono's captain.

150
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,339
<i>Niwano.</i>

151
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>We did our research on you.</i>

152
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,721
<i>You're easily baited by your opponent.</i>

153
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
<i>That's why…</i>

154
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,644
<i>I'll reach out first!</i>

155
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,816
Streak!

156
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,818
Nice!

157
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,321
Yono!

KOTA NIWANO
USUAL ARRANGEMENT

159
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,914
<i>You worked so hard.</i>

160
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,752
<i>The waterfall's sound…</i>

161
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,630
<i>Blown just a little</i>
<i>See how the plants of autumn…</i>

162
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,425
Kenshin Orie's as good as his reputation.

163
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,719
Is he still too much for Shirano?

164
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,971
Ordinarily, he couldn't win.

165
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,265
But he's not ordinary.

166
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,647
His left-handed training
is beginning to bear fruit.

167
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,817
<i>What is this?</i>

168
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,404
<i>Orie looks wide open compared to before.</i>

169
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,533
It's easy for a left hand to exploit
a right hand's openings.

170
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,076
It can get in like this.

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,536
I see.

172
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,288
He had a taste of that,

173
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,623
so he's changed
how he reaches his hand out.

174
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,836
<i>Mr. Shirano has excellent</i>
<i>dynamic visual acuity as well.</i>

175
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,718
Sneaking a punch through your foe's guard
is boxing's bread and butter.

176
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,682
<i>Is known as devastation</i>

177
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,144
<i>Thick patches of weeds</i>

178
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,480
<i>Grow everywhere around</i>

179
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,731
<i>This lonesome dwelling</i>

180
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,899
Snatched it!

181
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,446
Incredible, Mr. Shirano!

182
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,241
He's a natural-born <i>karuta </i>player.

183
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
On a streak!

184
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,996
Nice!

185
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,957
The momentum's with Umezono!

186
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,506
Very good!

187
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,382
Now I'm getting excited.

188
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,386
I was excited from the get-go.

189
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,564
Kept it!

190
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,610
I've never seen Fuki
having so much fun before.

191
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,655
<i>These two sleeves of mine…</i>

192
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,906
- Took it!
- Kept it!

193
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,949
Nice!

194
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,334
I can't believe
we're the ones being pressed!

195
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,505
- Let's all get the next one too!
- Right!

196
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,556
<i>The momentum's against us.</i>

197
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,642
<i>What was it Miss Aya said?</i>

198
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,727
<i>At times like these…</i>

199
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,730
Excuse me.

200
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
Excuse me.

201
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,224
<i>Remember it.</i>

202
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,020
The most fun you ever had playing <i>karuta</i>.

203
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,685
Sorry about that.

204
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,063
<i>It's as if</i>

205
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,149
<i>time has stood still since that moment.</i>

206
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,202
<i>I feel like</i>

207
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,372
<i>I've always been waiting for this day.</i>

208
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,833
<i>Waiting to be face-to-face</i>

209
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,128
<i>with Meguru again.</i>

210
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:10,177
<i>The most fun I've had playing </i>karuta<i>?</i>

211
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,183
<i>That would be</i>

212
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,560
<i>right now!</i>

213
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,441
Let's go, Mizusawa!

214
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,695
To Omi Shrine!

215
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,780
Right!

216
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>Never did I pray for you</i>

217
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:41,291
<i>To grow so distant from me</i>

218
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,335
<i>After the shower…</i>

219
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,461
Snatched it!

220
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,047
Kept it!

221
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,180
Stole it!

222
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,193
Yes!

223
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,914
Why are you smiling, Miss Ayase?

224
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,957
What?

225
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,627
Don't you think it's amazing, Sumire?

226
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,545
What is?

227
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:31,216
Every single person here loves <i>karuta</i>.

228
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,679
You're <i>karuta </i>crazy.

229
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,697
<i>One card left.</i>

230
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,536
<i>If he takes the next one, it's over.</i>

231
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>But we're gonna go.</i>

232
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,211
<i>To the All Japan!</i>

233
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,049
<i>That's what we promised each other!</i>

234
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,844
<i>Sleeves never grow faint</i>

235
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,394
One win for Mizusawa!

236
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,231
Nice!

237
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,818
Two wins for Mizusawa!

238
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,195
Nice!

239
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,369
Not Yakumo too.

240
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,579
We're on the ropes now.

241
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,624
I guess it's to be expected
when facing Mizusawa.

242
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,835
It's not over yet.

243
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,923
We still have plenty.

244
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,425
Well played, Yaku Moku.

245
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,594
You too, Chieri.

246
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,267
Just you watch.
We'll get those three wins.

247
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,396
Plenty of people
who don't know when to give up.

248
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,108
We're just getting started, Umezono!

249
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,192
Right!

250
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,654
<i>They aren't just good at </i>karuta<i>.</i>

251
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,158
They make their whole team stronger too.

252
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,749
Let's go, Mizusawa!

253
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,381
Huh?

254
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,884
Did I get the timing wrong?

255
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,303
No.

256
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,265
Right!

257
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,183
Right!

258
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,185
Kenshin's rallying his team!

259
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,812
Kenshin…

260
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,828
46TH ALL JAPAN
HIGH SCHOOL KARUTA CHAMPIONSHIP

261
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,623
<i>I know not my place</i>
<i>But as I look out upon…</i>

262
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,041
Three wins for Hokuoh!

263
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,752
- Nice, Hokuoh!
- Way to go!

264
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,671
The Hokuoh versus Adore game is over.

265
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,007
Hokuoh won 3-2.

266
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,675
What does that mean?

267
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,970
If Umezono can score a comeback
against Mizusawa,

268
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,181
it'll be them going to the All Japan!

269
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,479
Sho gave us a chance!

270
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,410
Three wins from this situation?

271
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,163
Fuki!

272
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,750
<i>Oh man.</i>

273
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,796
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I can't feel my right hand anymore…</i>

274
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,301
- Lab?
- Yeah.

275
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,846
I want to do some research
into regenerative medicine.

276
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,725
To give someone
who helped me his sight back.

277
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,148
<i>They say there's no way to cure it.</i>

278
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,360
But nothing's impossible, right?

279
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,405
As long as there's
one person who won't quit.

280
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,038
<i>At the time, I didn't understand what</i>
<i>"the true meaning of youth" meant.</i>

281
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,501
That word was never
about describing a period of time.

282
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,129
"Youth"

283
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,007
doesn't describe a period of time.

284
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,017
<i>It's about how you live your life.</i>

285
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,685
<i>Right, Dr. Mashima?</i>

286
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>Parted we may be…</i>

287
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,688
Stole it!

288
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,490
- Kept it!
- Me too!

289
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,242
<i>That I might please you…</i>

290
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,327
Kept it!

291
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,621
All the cards being read are on our side.

292
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,292
The more cards you have,
the likelier that one of yours is read.

293
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:20,255
That's what makes <i>karuta </i>so interesting.

294
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,342
Huge comebacks are part of the game.

295
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,427
- Kept it!
- Got it!

296
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,596
Four cards between them!

297
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>Night fades into dawn…</i>

298
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,016
Kept it!

299
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,392
Three cards between them!

300
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,603
<i>At this present time…</i>

301
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,520
Streak!

302
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,981
You're kidding! A two-card gap?

303
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,120
One card between them!

304
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,210
- Kept it!
- Me too!

305
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,169
Nice!

306
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,088
They caught up!

307
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,884
- Stole it!
- Nice!

308
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,350
Moving my card.

309
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,032
Umezono has two cards left.

310
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,451
Mizusawa has one.

311
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,246
If we don't get the next one,

312
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,750
we… lose.

313
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,388
<i>I shall not moisten my sleeves</i>

314
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,768
<i>With tears for one unfaithful</i>

315
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,355
<i>Fleeing solitude</i>
<i>I step outside of my home…</i>

316
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,273
Kept it!

317
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,607
Nice!

318
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,950
A three-way battle of fate.

319
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,395
What a turn of events!

320
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,399
Mizusawa saw this coming?

321
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,901
Huh?

322
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,360
What? What is it?

323
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,905
They've got us.

324
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,283
Mizusawa's split their cards.

325
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,373
A card split.

326
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,917
Card split?

327
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,672
Mizusawa already has two wins,
so they just need one more.

328
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,634
It's far better to guard your own card
in a battle of fate.

329
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,843
YO WO, ME, ME
ME, YO WO, YO WO

330
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:16,723
So Mizusawa split their cards so that
they can win no matter which is read.

331
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,775
So we're in dire straits?

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,568
Yes.

333
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,821
We're done for!

334
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,792
<i>I am met with the same sight</i>

335
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,880
<i>The lonely dusk of autumn</i>

336
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,474
<i>In Yura's channel</i>
<i>A boatman's rudder is lost…</i>

337
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,809
A dead card!

338
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,245
We're saved!

339
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,997
I can hardly breathe!

340
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,833
Is there nothing they can do?

341
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,585
At this point…

342
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,296
Nothing.

343
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,095
<i>Just as floundered as one is</i>

344
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:43,018
<i>Who has lost their true love</i>

345
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,731
<i>How cruel you are, world</i>
<i>Providing us no refuge…</i>

346
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,608
Another dead card.

347
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,547
Thank you.

348
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,594
Thank you.

349
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,186
One win

350
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,189
for Umezono!

351
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,068
Nice!

352
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,820
- Huh?
- For real?

353
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,700
Mr. Yono pulled it off!

354
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,662
- He baited him into fouling?
- A miracle.

355
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,664
What an incredible miracle.

356
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,666
They've turned a terrible position

357
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,211
into a fifty-fifty showdown!

358
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,342
Now it's a true battle of fate.

359
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,405
<i>Five practice sweeps.</i>

360
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
This is…

361
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,288
A code.

362
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,207
Code?

363
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,836
We all agreed on it together.

364
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,423
That's the code to attack
the enemy territory.

365
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,093
They're going on the attack?

366
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,220
How many cards are left?

367
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,472
Three more to be read.

368
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,516
"Yo mo" is the dead one.

369
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,518
Miss Aizawa knows that.

370
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,103
Seriously?

371
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,355
<i>Why did you reach over here just now?</i>

372
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,192
After considering what cards
have been read and what cards are left,

373
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,530
something in me felt that
it was slightly more likely

374
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,031
that it'd be one of these.

375
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:08,747
Knowing what cards are left in a game?
That's hard even for an A-class player.

376
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,584
This is where her skill comes into play.

377
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,463
<i>Guarding my own territory</i>
<i>is the safer option.</i>

378
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,089
<i>But,</i>

379
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,051
<i>if I'm going to go for</i>
<i>"Going round the path," it's now or never.</i>

380
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,929
<i>Would that be crazy?</i>

381
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,349
<i>Maybe.</i>

382
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,729
Excuse me.

383
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,577
<i>Fate.</i>

384
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,705
<i>It must be fate.</i>

385
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,723
Pardon me.

386
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,907
<i>If it's "Deep into the night,"</i>
<i>Umezono wins.</i>

387
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,077
<i>If it's "Going round the path,"</i>
<i>Mizusawa wins.</i>

388
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,123
<i>Who knew a single card</i>
<i>could feel so heavy?</i>

389
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,502
<i>It's the weight of destiny.</i>

390
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,924
<i>Murasaki Shikibu</i>

391
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,885
<i>and Sei Shonagon.</i>

392
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:52,934
<i>Though they lived in the same age</i>
<i>a millennium ago, they never met.</i>

393
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,728
<i>But, Miss Aizawa,</i>

394
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,147
<i>it's my belief</i>

395
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,110
<i>that if they could transcend time</i>
<i>to meet now,</i>

396
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,279
<i>the two of them</i>

397
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>would be the best of friends.</i>

398
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,955
<i>For even in mountains deep</i>

399
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,210
<i>The deer cry out in sorrow</i>

400
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,300
- One moment, please.
- An outage?

401
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,510
- Please wait where you are.
- A blackout?

402
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,988
<i>Are you trembling, Miss Oe?</i>

403
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:14,993
Our apologies.

404
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,705
We will now resume the match.

405
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,838
<i>Miss Oe.</i>

406
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,258
<i>Are you celebrating?</i>

407
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,554
<i>Or are you despairing?</i>

408
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,099
<i>Don't worry, Miss Oe.</i>

409
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,646
<i>Whatever the outcome,</i>

410
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,898
<i>I'll be all right.</i>

411
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,402
<i>Because now I can believe.</i>

412
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,033
<i>For even in mountains deep</i>

413
00:33:55,116 --> 00:34:00,413
<i>The deer cry out in sorrow</i>

414
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,175
<i>Failure.</i>

415
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,718
<i>Success.</i>

416
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,635
<i>Hope.</i>

417
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,762
<i>Regret.</i>

418
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,308
<i>I am who I am today</i>
<i>because they've all built up inside me!</i>

419
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>Going round the path</i>

420
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,020
<i>If it is you whom I met</i>

421
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,773
<i>I cannot be sure</i>

422
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,532
Who is it?

423
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,868
Who won?

424
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,517
It's Mizusawa. It's…

425
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,394
Mizusawa that won.

426
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,830
Thank you.

427
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,713
Thank you.

428
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,477
Mizusawa…

429
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,606
has three wins.

430
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,611
Mizusawa has… four wins!

431
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,829
<i>For behind a single cloud</i>

432
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:10,501
<i>The moon that night did vanish</i>

433
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,421
Kenshin!

434
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,924
Kenshin! Thank you!

435
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,251
I wanted to go.

436
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,509
I really…

437
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,013
wanted to go with you all.

438
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,165
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,127
I'm sorry

440
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,588
we only got one lousy win.

441
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,804
Our combined strength wasn't enough.

442
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,514
That's all.

443
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,352
But…

444
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,231
we had a damn good time.

445
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,068
Man.

446
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,487
What a bummer, huh?

447
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,201
We'll make up for it

448
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,954
in the singles games!

449
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,040
Right!

450
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,921
Those really were good matches.

451
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,592
You kept fighting till the very last card,

452
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,053
and I'm proud of you for that.

453
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,182
Hey, you'll have to give me
your contact info.

454
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,394
As if you're going to contact me.

455
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,356
I'll go ask Meguru instead, then.

456
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,697
I never said no.

457
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,701
Why are you smiling?

458
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:20,376
I just never thought I'd see the day
that you wanted a photo with me.

459
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,380
Who doesn't take photos
with their big bro?

460
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,344
I'm so happy!

461
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,055
You did great, Nagi.

462
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,807
Okay!

463
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,478
You guys get all the <i>okonomiyaki</i>
you can eat today!

464
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,397
I'm gonna stuff my face!

465
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,899
Thank you, truly.

466
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,609
Thank you.

467
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,821
Oh? Thank you.

468
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,656
Cut it out.

469
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,949
Everyone.

470
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,493
You were absolutely wonderful.

471
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,954
Thank you.

472
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,291
Your reading was absolutely wonderful too.

473
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,792
Thank you.

474
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,837
I owe that to all of you.

475
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,342
What are we doing for the after-party?

476
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,387
Okay! Who's down for karaoke?

477
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,099
I think I'll react to the <i>karuta </i>lines
faster this time.

478
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,351
Kind of an odd reason to go.

479
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,104
I want to hear
your lovely voice this time.

480
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,441
Huh? Me too!
You didn't sing at all last time.

481
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,109
No, I'll pass, thanks.

482
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,487
I think I'd like to hear it too.

483
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,992
- All right! Let's go!
- Nope. No.

484
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,243
Off we go!

485
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,288
Actually, I did hear him
humming once before.

486
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,332
Oh? What was he humming?

487
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,342
Kana!

488
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,186
Don't mind us. Go.

489
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,232
Thank you.

490
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,027
Kana!

491
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,696
You were so good!

492
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,157
- Thank you!
- I'm going to work hard too.

493
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,619
If you'll read for it, Kana,
I'll have that Queen game

494
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,079
with Shinobu.

495
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,956
All right.

496
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,457
Just hold tight.

497
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,627
- Oh, and I really--
- No. Not at the Yugiri-kai.

498
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,711
I didn't say anything.

499
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,714
- You wanted to play <i>karuta </i>right now.
- Busted.

500
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,342
You only just landed back in Japan.

501
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,385
You're a machine.

502
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:38,347
The paper screens'll get full of holes
if you come to the Yugiri-kai!

503
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,893
I get it.

504
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,648

Meguru.

511

What's up?

512
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,692
That's what she meant?

513
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,491
You mean it was here all along?

514
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,993
What was?

515
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,122
The thing I was looking for.

516
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,293
Hold on a second.

517
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,211
- Huh?
- What is it?

518
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,130
My bangs are messed up.

519
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,550
- Now?
- What's wrong with Meat Bun?

520
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,928
You never change.

- The food's on a whole other level.
- The food?!

531
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:43,175
The classes are interesting, too,
but the food's the best.

532
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,718
Enough with the food already.

What do you make of today's tournament,
