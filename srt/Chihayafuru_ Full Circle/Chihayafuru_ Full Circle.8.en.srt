2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,048
I now declare the Tokyo qualifier

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,635
of the 46th All Japan High School
Ogura Hyakunin Isshu Karuta Championship

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,095
underway.

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,513
UMEZONO

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,514
Let's wear these today.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,268
Shall we save them
till we've checked out the other schools?

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,312
<i>Sorry, guys. I drew us the final boss.</i>

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>We have to face them sooner or later</i>
<i>to go to Omi Shrine.</i>

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,151
So you play <i>karuta</i>, then?

11
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,030
Let's… have a game sometime.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,285
I've… never played
a competitive team game before.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,082
<i>Continue to be impartial</i>
<i>in any and every situation.</i>

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,585
Number 1.
Umezono High School, Miss Aizawa.

15
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,545
Mizusawa High School, Orie.

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,465
Yes! Just as I predicted.

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>Number 5. Umezono High School, Yakumo.</i>

18
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>Mizusawa High School, Miss Tsukiura.</i>

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,346
Incredible, Yono!

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,682
I just did what I could.

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,269
All we can do now is pray.

22
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,823
Sorry we can't be there on your big day.

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,033
That's okay.

24
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,119
It'll throw me off my game
if you're there all the time.

25
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,621
-Good luck.
-See you.

26
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,206
-Take care.
-Wait, sis.

27
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:32,092
Here.
You gave it to me for my entrance exam.

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,344
Remember?

29
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,224
What the heck?

30
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,352
What the heck?

31
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,853
-Do your best, Meguru.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,481
I'll be going, then. Bye.

33
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,446
TALISMAN OF GUIDANCE

34
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,705
Now please deal the cards.

35
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,751
Let's have a good game.

36
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,638
<i>The mountain hamlet</i>
<i>Is a place where loneliness</i>

37
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,557
<i>Prevails in winter</i>

<i>Until the emperor comes</i>

00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,548
You're not working today, Meguru?

46
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,883
No.

47
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>To think I'd be back here,</i>

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,971
<i>playing </i>karuta <i>with you again.</i>

49
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,394
What are the chances?

50
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,940
<i>That was a fun match, wasn't it?</i>

51
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,568
Maybe the best I've had.

52
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,447
Why do you say that?
You must have had better ones.

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,199
No, I really mean it.

54
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,246
Anyway, you Umezono guys sure are wily.

55
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,832
You got the order just right.

56
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,463
There must be some kind
of mastermind in your ranks.

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,678
You can tell? He is our pride and joy.

58
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,684
You're not so bad yourself,
stepping up to play me.

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,978
I don't plan on rolling over.

60
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,106
Then this should be good.

00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,914

63
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,013
Thank you.

64
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,890
All right, thank you.

65
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,350
Next, please.

66
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,560
Yes.

67
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,783
Hello. My name is Kanade Oe.

68
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,831
<i>We will now hold the first round.</i>

69
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,876
Your reader is Ako Higashimura,
an A-class official reader.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,838
Let's have a good game.

71
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,967
Let's have a good game.

72
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,514
<i>In Naniwa Bay</i>
<i>Behold how the flower blooms</i>

73
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,475
<i>After winter's sleep</i>

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,019
Let's go, Umezono!

75
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,145
Right!

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,691
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

77
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:21,946
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

78
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,369
<i>And now, with spring's arrival</i>

79
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>It reveals its full glory</i>

80
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,794
<i>The shallows run swift</i>

81
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,964
<i>And so even if they part</i>
<i>As they hit the rocks</i>

82
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,342
I couldn't see a thing.

83
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,595
-Did they win that one?
-Looks like they all lost that hand.

84
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,766
No wonder they're the favorites.
Can we pull through?

85
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,351
The game's only just begun.

86
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:57,357
Still, I know we need a manager,
but are you sure about not playing?

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,776
This is your last tournament
as a third-year.

88
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,364
Yes. I know.

89
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,869
But my priority isn't my own victory,

90
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,040
but the team's.

91
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Besides,

92
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,256
Umezono has come on leaps and bounds
over the past few months.

93
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,677
First and foremost,
Yakumo is an A-class player,

94
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,597
<i>so he's basically proficient in all areas.</i>

95
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,891
<i>Thanks to him joining us,</i>

96
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,144
Umezono's potential exploded overnight.

97
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,982
Haru Bun's strength is his keen hearing.

98
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,735
<i>Thanks to his reading practice</i>
<i>with Miss Oe,</i>

99
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,531
<i>his ability to distinguish sounds</i>
<i>is razor-sharp.</i>

100
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,909
Fuki's strength is his speed.

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,621
He has outstanding reflexes
honed from boxing,

102
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,581
and a thrust like a straight right.

103
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,919
<i>In terms of sheer speed,</i>
<i>he's a match for Kenshin Orie.</i>

104
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,299
Miss Murata's strength is
her boldness to dive for a card

105
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,260
on the first word of a poem.

106
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,682
While it risks committing a foul,
it also stifles the opponent.

107
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:18,563
Miss Aizawa's strength
is her precise and compact <i>karuta</i>.

108
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,857
There's no wasted movement.

109
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,611
<i>She waits nearby for the right moment,</i>
<i>then reaches straight for the card.</i>

110
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,282
And because she's all about saving energy,

111
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,409
her memorization's sharp too.

112
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,538
Her efficiency-fixated personality

113
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,375
turned out to be
extremely well-suited to <i>karuta</i>.

114
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,544
That being the case,

115
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,714
I'll leave this to you

116
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,467
and go scout the other teams.

117
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,759
You're not watching?

118
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,597
It's my job
to think about what we do next.

119
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,184
You have faith in them, don't you?

120
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,770
Yes.

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,981
Of course I do.

122
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,902
<i>This must be the place</i>
<i>Where those coming and leaving</i>

123
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,447
<i>Go separate ways</i>

124
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,167
How dependable.

125
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,921
<i>Cold and unfeeling…</i>

126
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,464
<i>In Michinoku…</i>

127
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>O winds of heaven</i>
<i>Please, blow shut those passages</i>

128
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,012
<i>That lie between clouds</i>

129
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>He's strong.</i>

130
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:44,899
<i>I couldn't recognize it before,</i>
<i>but now I see just how strong he is.</i>

131
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,695
<i>It stings to admit it, but I've got</i>
<i>no chance against him right now.</i>

132
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,658
<i>My job is to hold out as long as I can</i>

133
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,202
<i>and not let Mizusawa gather momentum.</i>

134
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,121
<i>Haru Bun and Fuki are evenly matched.</i>

135
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,124
<i>Great, just as Sota was aiming for.</i>

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,752
<i>Then if Yaku Moku wins for us…</i>

137
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,671
<i>Huh?</i>

138
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,052
<i>No way. Hold on. He hasn't…</i>

139
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,932
What's up with Yakumo?

140
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,518
Something's a bit off with him.

141
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
Got it!

142
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,775
Let's get the next one too!

143
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,904
That girl he's playing is good.

144
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,614
Yes.

145
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,494
She gave me a big warm hello
back at the entrance this morning.

146
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,289
She really is a nice young lady.

147
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,376
No, I don't mean
she has a nice personality.

148
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,461
I mean she has a good feel.

149
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,422
Right. Huh?

150
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,468
In <i>karuta</i>, the keenness
of your ability to tell sounds apart

151
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,429
is called your "feel."

152
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:02,602
<i>That refuse to bring me light</i>

153
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,771
Snatched it!

154
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,523
With a feel as good as hers,

155
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,528
you can recognize the key syllable
by its consonant, like "s" or "k."

156
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,864
That's superhuman!

157
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,326
Moving half a syllable
faster than your opponent, in other words?

158
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,243
Yes.

159
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,412
And what's more,

160
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,916
her body bounces around like a spring,
so each of her movements is light.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,961
Her enjoyment of the game shines through.

162
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,506
Apparently, she shot up to A-class
over a short period,

163
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,259
but with that natural-born sense
for <i>karuta</i>,

164
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,386
it's hardly surprising, is it?

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,097
How do you know
all this stuff, Mr. Shirano?

166
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,435
If my boy plays it,
I'm gonna take it seriously too.

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,815
After you left that day,

168
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,611
we all went to talk to
Kota's lawyer relative.

169
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,154
Hilarious, right?

170
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,823
About that…

171
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,454
I was just enjoying talking to you all
and got carried away…

172
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,123
No, I'm relieved it was a lie.

173
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,918
I'm glad to know
everyone at Umezono's so nice.

174
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,549
There's something kinda sad
about it too though.

175
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,804
Like when you find out

176
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:25,434
that kitty you've been looking after
is getting fed someplace else,

177
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,520
you know?

178
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,737
<i>These two sleeves of mine</i>
<i>Like the rocks in the offing</i>

179
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,282
<i>Unrevealed by tides</i>

180
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,333
<i>Yaku Moku's in trouble.</i>

181
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,752
<i>I need to say something.</i>

182
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,045
I took that one!

183
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,630
Nice! Me too.

184
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,090
-Nice one, Haru Bun!
-Nice.

185
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,467
Let's get the next one, Yaku Moku!

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,389
Yaku Moku!

187
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,058
Please refrain from excessive shouting.

188
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,644
Sorry.

189
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>He's far.</i>

190
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>So far away!</i>

191
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,860
<i>What do I…?</i>

192
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,698
<i>That's it!</i>

193
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,623
A foul?

194
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,839
Calm down, Yaku Moku.

195
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,091
Just focus on your own game.

196
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,220
Now I get it.

197
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>No! Now he's panicking!</i>

198
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,119
<i>I can't keep doing this over and over.</i>

199
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,124
<i>Come on, Fuki. Notice him!</i>

200
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:43,864
<i>Reminds me it is summer</i>

201
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>O leaves of crimson</i>
<i>High atop Mount Ogura</i>

202
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,747
<i>If you have a heart</i>

203
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,793
<i>Let yourselves be scattered not</i>

204
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:01,632
<i>Until the emperor comes</i>

205
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,426
<i>The nights in summer…</i>

206
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,136
<i>Forgotten by you…</i>

207
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,390
<i>How can I decide</i>
<i>Who I should choose as my friend?</i>

208
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,559
<i>Old as they may be</i>

209
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,187
<i>I can't let Mizusawa gather momentum.</i>

210
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,818
<i>If I can just take even one more hand…</i>

211
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,574
<i>Bright the moon still shone</i>
<i>As that night turned into dawn…</i>

212
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,742
Nicely done.

213
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>No way! Fuki's up against it too!</i>

214
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,019
<i>It must be my imagination.</i>

215
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,104
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

216
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,112
<i>If in the future</i>
<i>It proves difficult for you</i>

217
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,532
<i>To remember me</i>

218
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,911
Sorry!

219
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,245
I'm fine.

220
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,456
-But your hand--
-I said I'm fine, damn it!

221
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,186
<i>Then I would wish for this day</i>

222
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:43,275
<i>To be the last of my life</i>

223
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,444
<i>Night fades into dawn</i>

224
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,279
<i>And as light dispels the dark</i>

225
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,490
<i>I see as the moon</i>

226
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,200
Ow!

227
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,410
Time-out, please!

228
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,580
Fuki?

229
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,499
What's up?

230
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,585
-What is it?
-That same old injury?

231
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,505
Let me see, Fuki.

232
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,135
This ain't good.

233
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,971
I can still play.

234
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,097
You can't.

235
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,855
That's it for you, Fuki.

236
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,402
What about my left hand?

237
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,531
I can play with my left.

238
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,785
It's against the rules

239
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,788
to switch hands halfway through a game.

240
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,586
I know it sucks.

241
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,088
Mr. Shima.

242
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,631
He forfeits.

243
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,968
Hey! Who do you think you're speaking for?

244
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,888
I know it's an important match.

245
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,142
But it's not worth your right hand.

246
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,310
I won't let you sacrifice that.

247
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,149
Umezono's number 4 player… forfeits.

248
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,110
Straight to the clinic, Fuki.

249
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:29,298
Are you… ready to continue the match?

250
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,384
Yes.

251
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,304
What do we do?

252
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,516
We just have to play with four.

253
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,083
Three wins with four players…

254
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,797
Not to mention that we're playing
Mizusawa, the strongest team.

255
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,819
It's no good. I can't get through.

256
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,908
I already had
somebody else take a look at it.

257
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,870
Take me to him.

258
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,000
<i>I cherish people</i>
<i>Just as I also loathe them…</i>

259
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,918
Got it.

260
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,628
<i>Looking at the moon…</i>

261
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,921
Yes!

262
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,757
<i>How the wind rustles…</i>

263
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,094
-Okay!
-You're persistent, Meguru.

264
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:03,684
<i>As an afterlife keepsake</i>

265
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,980
Thank you.

266
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,993
Thank you.

267
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,123
-Two wins for Mizusawa.
-Nice, Nagi.

268
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,299
Yaku Moku

269
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,551
got trounced?

270
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,101
<i>Our backs are against the wall now.</i>

271
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,398
<i>Nothing but this ritual</i>

272
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:57,237
<i>Reminds me it is summer</i>

273
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,573
<i>Loud the crickets chirp</i>

274
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,535
<i>On this dark and frosty night</i>
<i>Lying on my bed</i>

275
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,413
You did well despite being outnumbered.

276
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,087
Thank you.

277
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,300
Three wins to Mizusawa.

278
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,469
Nice.

279
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,268
Mizusawa High School wins 5-0.

280
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,855
Thank you.

281
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,693
Thank you.

282
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,799
46TH ALL JAPAN
HIGH SCHOOL KARUTA CHAMPIONSHIP

283
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,050
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,347
It's my fault that Mr. Shirano…

285
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,683
It's not your fault, Yaku Moku.

286
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,103
The whole idea was that I had to win--

287
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,146
It's not your fault.

288
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,402
Guys.

289
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,365
We haven't lost all hope
of going to the All Japan.

290
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
Let's change our attitude.

291
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,578
-You're right.
-Yes.

292
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,667
We're now in the repechage tournament.

293
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,130
If we can get through that, we'll be
in the final qualifier in three weeks.

294
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,217
But if we lose even once…

295
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,555
The moment that happens,

296
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,265
our summer is over.

297
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,857
Let's come out on top. For Fuki too.

298
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,569
-Yeah.
-Yes.

299
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,535
<i>All right.</i>

300
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,331
Shall we huddle round?

301
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,584
Hold on a second.

302
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,127
Mr. Yakumo isn't here.

303
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,629
-Huh?
-That's weird.

304
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,466
-What?
-Where did he go?

305
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,552
All teams, please submit
your playing orders.

306
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,056
I'll go and look for him.

307
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,307
Thanks.

308
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,440
SOTA: WE DREW MIZUSAWA AND LOST.
NOW FOR THE REPECHAGE.

309
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,941
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP!

310
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,576
<i>Order submissions will close shortly.</i>

311
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,661
All teams in place, please.

312
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,249
But Haru Bun and Yaku Moku
aren't here yet.

313
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,049
Everyone!

314
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,135
-Huh? He's not with you.
-How'd it go?

315
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,721
I couldn't find him anywhere.

316
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,847
What?

317
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,850
Not at the vending machines? Or outside?

318
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,686
I looked everywhere.

319
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,480
-What?
-No way.

320
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,315
He's gone?

321
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,483
But why?

322
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,236
Maybe…

323
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,573
maybe I was too firm with him?

324
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,451
I don't know.

325
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,913
Maybe he felt responsible for Mr. Shirano?

326
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,958
<i>He was acting odd even before the game.</i>

327
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,877
<i>And he seemed kind of uneasy during it.</i>

328
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,338
Right.

329
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,715
I hope he's okay.

330
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,136
It's no good.
He won't answer the phone either.

331
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,846
Announcing the orders.

332
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,141
What now?
We'll just have to play with four.

333
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,018
Even if we scrape by in this match,

334
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,148
we need Yaku Moku
if we're going to win the tournament.

335
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,067
I…

336
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,570
I'll go look for him now.

337
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,696
What?

338
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,324
I… might have driven him away.

339
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,827
So let me go.

340
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,997
If you go too, we'll be down to three!

341
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,001
There's 15 minutes of memorization.
I'll bring him back before it's over.

342
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,295
Yes,

343
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,174
players are free to use
memorization time as they like.

344
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,010
Yeah. He can't have gotten far yet.

345
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,804
-Now's the only time to find him.
-Yeah, but…

346
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,184
This gamble's our only chance now.

347
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,904
Thirteen minutes to go.

348
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,551
Let's have a good game.

349
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,942
An almost even matchup,
just based on class.

350
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
Yes.

351
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:36,034
Thinking back,
maybe we relied on Yaku Moku too much

352
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,788
just because we were excited
about him being A-class.

353
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,500
A-class Yaku Moku will be the captain.

354
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,711
You'll be our point-getter,
sure to bag us a win.

355
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,838
We're counting on you, Yaku Moku.

356
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:55,053
<i>Our strategy didn't even allow</i>
<i>for the possibility of Yaku Moku losing.</i>

357
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,598
<i>We just took it for granted</i>
<i>that he would win.</i>

358
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,601
And that put pressure on him.

359
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,145
Perhaps.

360
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,067
It probably wasn't a good idea

361
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,319
<i>to put him on the end either.</i>

362
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,364
<i>We isolated him.</i>

363
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,701
I wish we realized sooner.

364
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,497
I wonder if Miss Aizawa
will make it back in time.

365
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,376
The rules allow for joining
a game already in progress.

366
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,255
But until that happens,
they'll keep reading the cards.

367
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:34,467
So Meguru will be starting at
a disadvantage even if she does come back.

368
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,805
If we lose now, it's all over.

369
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,975
Let's get those three wins
between the three of us.

370
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,310
For Mr. Shirano too.

371
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,492
Ten minutes.

372
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,554
You're having a hard time too, Yakumon.

373
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,557
I get it!

374
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,603
You started playing <i>karuta </i>for fun,

375
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,564
but then the fun wasn't enough?

376
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,360
Don't you have a match?

377
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,780
I have this round off.

378
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,243
It's our tradition to let younger members
get match experience for next year.

379
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,162
Here.

380
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,875
And you? Should you be here?

381
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,550
The senior members…

382
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,846
wanted me to be strong.

383
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,436
They don't need someone like me

384
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,481
who's no good at <i>karuta</i>.

385
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,905
It's tough being A-class, huh?

386
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,909
Win and it's expected,
lose and you're a pariah.

387
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,495
Anyone would want to run away.

388
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,877
But I don't think
that's how Umezono sees you.

389
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,715
I mean, Meguru's on the team, after all.

390
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,386
Are you a friend of Miss Aizawa's?

391
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,224
Good question.

392
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,270
Though I will decline to comment
for various reasons.

393
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:57,026
Only, you seem to think
very highly of her.

394
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,447
Well,

395
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,366
that's because nobody knows it,

396
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,828
but the real Meguru is, like…

397
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,874
an amazing person.

398
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,045
Really?

399
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,844
Sure, maybe I'm
a little further ahead of her

400
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:27,849
when it comes to our <i>karuta </i>ranks
or how fast we can run 50 meters.

401
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,936
But that's not what makes her special.

402
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,525
She has courage when it counts.

403
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,694
Recognizes the decisive moment.

404
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,448
<i>Knows how to persuade people.</i>

405
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,619
<i>She has a kind of magnetism</i>

406
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:51,873
<i>that can't be expressed</i>
<i>through numbers on a chart, you could say.</i>

407
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,920
It's called non-cognitive skills,
apparently.

408
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,964
Don't you see that in her too, Yakumon?

409
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:12,435
<i>It seems she doesn't notice it herself,</i>
<i>but I do.</i>

410
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,276
<i>That immeasurable power she has.</i>

411
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,913
Mizusawa may have won this time,

412
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:37,126
but if she unleashes her potential,
I don't know how the next match will go.

413
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:48,179
I haven't really experienced
all this stuff you say about Miss Aizawa.

414
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,184
Do you have any better examples?

415
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,065
Yeah, I guess
I didn't explain it all that well.

416
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,902
How about this, then?

417
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,702
They way she'd sacrifice herself

418
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,874
just to find a teammate
whose feelings had been hurt.

419
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,259
Nagi.

420
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,763
Wait! No way!

421
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,694
Are you all right?

422
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,821
-Yaku Moku!
-Sorry.

423
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,158
Let go of me!

424
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,035
Like hell!

425
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,663
Who's playing the match if you're here?

426
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,083
Those three are doing their best.
So we need to get back now!

427
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,085
You go back alone.

428
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,754
I can't do that.

429
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,256
I can't leave you here.

430
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,346
We're sorry we left you out on your own.

431
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,394
Everyone's waiting for you
to come back, Yaku Moku.

432
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,481
You don't have to play.

433
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,443
But at least see our determination
with your own eyes.

434
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,532
Please.

435
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,543
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,591
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,304
Come on.

438
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,101
I'm sorry.

439
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,111
-Got it.
-Took it.

440
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,613
-Nice.
-You too.

441
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,829
Everyone looks…

442
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,462
like I knew they would.

443
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,801
Totes adorbs to the max!

444
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,946
You watch from here
while we bring the win home.

445
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,586
Let's have a good game.

446
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,757
Let's have a good game.

447
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,279
Now, how far can I get with this?

448
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,633
Crazy focus.

449
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,719
Meguru…

450
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,894
<i>Her center of gravity's to her left.</i>

451
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,398
<i>She's trying to guard all those cards</i>
<i>in the left of her territory.</i>

452
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,777
<i>Her line of sight's to her left,</i>

453
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,073
<i>so I'll move "sa" and "tsuki" to my left…</i>

454
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,912
<i>and now the cards she's after are here.</i>

455
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,793
<i>We encourage you to work on this.</i>

456
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,919
-Yes.
-That's all.

457
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,462
Thank you.

458
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,257
May I ask one question?

459
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,800
Yes.

460
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,469
Unless I was imagining it,

461
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,515
<i>it seemed your tone rose a little</i>
<i>just for "O leaves of crimson."</i>

462
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:46,185
Inconsistent reading will cost you points,

463
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,022
but as your voice was relatively stable
for the other poems,

464
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,984
it made me wonder, why just that one?

465
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:58,072
If you can explain that at all,
please take this opportunity to do so.

466
00:35:58,781 --> 00:35:59,615
Certainly.

467
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,746
If there was a discrepancy,

468
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,418
it was wholly because
of a prayer I was making.

469
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,837
A prayer?

470
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,340
As we speak,

471
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,761
<i>my students are competing</i>
<i>in the Tokyo qualifier.</i>

472
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,475
Ordinarily, I should have been there,

473
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,938
<i>but it was nothing other</i>
<i>than their encouragement</i>

474
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:36,110
that allowed me to take part
in this screening.

475
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,821
If they

476
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,451
<i>can work together</i>
<i>to make it through the qualifier,</i>

477
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,496
then I want to make sure
I'm there for the next one.

478
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:54,086
<i>O leaves of crimson</i>
<i>High atop Mount Ogura…</i>

479
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,172
<i>"Red leaves on Mount Ogura,</i>

480
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,800
if you have a heart…

481
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,970
then please…

482
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,392
please wait before you scatter,"

483
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,605
I couldn't help but pray.

484
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,070
This is a strict and impartial screening.

485
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,075
Whatever the circumstances,
you must still lose points.

486
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,786
I understand.

487
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,247
However,

488
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:36,420
as an appreciator of <i>waka</i>,
I cannot begrudge your attitude.

489
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,810
<i>The flower's color…</i>

490
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,853
One win for Umezono!

491
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,647
Nice!

492
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,690
All right!

493
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,068
<i>Cold and unfeeling</i>
<i>As the wind blowing down from…</i>

494
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,070
Two wins for Umezono!

495
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,488
<i>In the autumn breeze…</i>

496
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,906
Three wins for Umezono!

497
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,825
Nice!

498
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,751
A battle of fate.

499
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,629
You caught up from there?

500
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,048
That's remarkable, Miss Aizawa.

501
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,845
<i>The real Meguru is, like,</i>
<i>an amazing person.</i>

502
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,848
She has courage when it counts.

503
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,100
<i>Recognizes the decisive moment.</i>

504
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,520
Miss Aizawa!

505
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,072
<i>As an autumnal wind blows</i>

506
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:50,369
<i>On a humble hut of reeds</i>

507
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,667
<i>Fleeing solitude…</i>

508
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,585
All right！

509
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,046
Huh? No way.

510
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,757
In a battle of fate…

511
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,425
She took her opponent's card!

512
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,889
Thank you.

513
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,559
Thank you.

514
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,356
Umezono win four!

515
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,609
Very cool!

516
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,198
Umezono High School win 4-1.

517
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,700
Thank you.

518
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,537
Thank you.

519
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,542
We did it!

520
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,214
That was awesome, Meguru!

521
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,925
How did you know
it'd be your opponent's card?

522
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,094
I don't know.

523
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,304
I just had a feeling.

524
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,807
Incredible!

525
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,435
Yaku Moku!

526
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,105
I'm so glad you came back!

527
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,190
You put them on.

528
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,983
-Yeah.
-That makes me happy.

529
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,903
I'm sorry we let you down.

530
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,656
We'll do our best with four
in the next one too.

531
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,990
No.

532
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,786
That would just be sad.

533
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,250
You won't be able

534
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,754
to make it all the way through
without me there, will you?

535
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,385
Meaning?

536
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,511
Well?

537
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,980
-Why, you!
-No, don't!

538
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,678
SOTA: BELIEVE IN US, FUKI!
CHIERI: WE'LL KEEP ON WINNING!

539
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:16,807
MEGURU: FUKI! THE SIX OF US ARE GOING
TO THE ALL JAPAN FOR SURE!

540
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,184
Sorry about the wait.

541
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,524
<i>We will now begin</i>
<i>the second repechage matches.</i>

542
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,486
Let's have a good game.

543
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,947
Let's have a good game.

544
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,337
<i>Bright the moon still shone…</i>

545
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,672
<i>Snatched it!</i>

546
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,466
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

547
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:54,970
<i>On a streak!</i>

548
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,769
Umezono High School wins 3-2.

549
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,854
Thank you.

550
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,358
-We did it!
-Yay!

551
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,943
Of course we did!

552
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,699
All right!

553
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,952
Two wins for Umezono!

554
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,204
We did it!

555
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,006
Goodbye.

556
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:44,270
SOTA: IT'S A MIRACLE! UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL
IS HEADED FOR THE FINAL QUALIFIER!

557
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,337
<i>Unfortunately, it won't be healed</i>
<i>in time for the final qualifier.</i>

558
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,548
What?

559
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,971
You're joking, right?

560
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,101
You're doing that thing
where you say that,

561
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,103
but really it will work out.

562
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:30,357
Like with this taping
that Miss Tsukiura taught me.

563
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,153
That's a temporary measure.
It's not the same as treating it.

564
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,786
Damn it!

565
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,012
What? Mizusawa and Hokuoh both lost?

566
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,347
That's right.

567
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,932
A dark horse ended up
as the first representative.

568
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,145
Nobody could've predicted this.

569
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,313
No.

570
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,732
I asked one of the umpires,

571
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,611
and apparently this kind of upset
happens once every few years.

572
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:20,157
What? So the final qualifier
to decide the second team

573
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,201
will have Mizusawa and Hokuoh in it?

574
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,744
That's right.

575
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,788
It's hell.

576
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,290
And we don't even have Mr. Shirano.

577
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:33,504
If we win the final qualifier, Fuki could
make it back before the All Japan.

578
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:41,762
An old injury flared up,
so I have to stop on doctor's orders.

579
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,976
I know it's a crucial time,

580
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,896
so I'm truly,

581
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,524
truly sorry.

582
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,655
We need to give it our all,
for Mr. Shirano's sake as well.

583
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,577
Right! Let's put our hearts
and souls into this.

584
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,579
Let's.

585
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,665
Hearts and souls!

586
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,709
Right!

587
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,253
Goodbye.

588
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:49,496
<i>That's why</i>

589
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,665
I started playing <i>karuta</i>.

590
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,751
Now I'm kinda having fun.

591
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,809
Hello? Everything okay, Fuki?

592
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,187
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

593
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,940
What is it?

594
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,234
Sorry it's out of the blue.

595
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,904
There was actually

596
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,907
something I wanted to ask you.

597
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,202
Oh?

598
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,248
All right.

599
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,175
KARUTA CLUB

600
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:47,429
19 DAYS UNTIL THE FINAL TOKYO QUALIFIER!

601
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,640
Where's Kenshin today?

602
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,726
At that friend
of Miss Aya's again, apparently.

603
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,936
Again?

604
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,255
Fuki!

605
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,262
What's this about
playing <i>karuta </i>with your left hand?

606
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,224
I've only just begun,
so I don't know if it'll work.

607
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,018
But you're left-handed, right?

608
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,520
Yeah.

609
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:40,232
So I was advised to ask you
to practice with me.

610
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,485
By who?

611
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,322
The doctor who's taking care of my hand.

612
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,119
He's a Mizusawa alumnus, like Miss Oe.

613
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,838
I hear you didn't make the first team.

614
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,508
No.

615
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,471
I bet you took team games lightly.

616
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,811
I did win all of my games though.

617
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,900
There you go.

618
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,446
That's what I mean by taking them lightly.

619
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,545
Please teach me…

620
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,050
more about <i>karuta</i>…

621
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,386
sir!

622
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,696
Our left-handed player's here.

623
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,911
I'm Taichi Mashima.

624
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,957
Hello.

625
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,875
I'm Meguru Aizawa.

626
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,336
Nice to meet you.

627
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,671
Nice to meet you.

628
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,094
Dr. Mashima

629
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,222
is the current Jun-Meijin.

630
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,187
As in, second only to the Meijin?

631
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,943
MIZUSAWA ALUMNI ASSEMBLE!

632
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,361
Make it the most fun game ever.

633
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,405
-I'm back.
-Make your teammates strong too.

634
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,614
Press them to the end.

635
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,491
THE CURTAIN LIFTS ON THE FINAL SHOWDOWN!

636
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,702
<i>-Let's go, Umezono!</i>
<i>-Right!</i>

637
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,161
We can't lose.

638
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,622
<i>I'm sure I can get stronger</i>
<i>if I don't give up on myself.</i>

639
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,832
YOUTHHOOD IS PUT ON THE LINE

640
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,791
