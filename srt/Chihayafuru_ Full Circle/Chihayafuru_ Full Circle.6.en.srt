00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,921
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,673
Please show me that people who find

3
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:10,427
their treasure in karuta
are guaranteed to have a bright future

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,929
waiting for them in ten years' time.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,181
All right. I'll do it.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,058
I'll be your evidence!

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,351
I will…

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,728
devote myself to it.

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,105
Teach her all the karuta
she wants to learn.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,233
I'll take good care of Miss Meguru.

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,526
Meguru!

12
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,446
Yay!

13
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,282
Your contract with us

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,285
will be terminated after this year.

15
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,202
What?

16
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,331
From the next academic year,
Mr. Shima will be resuming his duties,

17
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,419
including his role with the karuta club.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,270
Let's go to the Nationals together.

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,688
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENROLLMENT

20
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,398
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

21
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,406
Whoa, Chieri! You got
your coming of age or something?

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,450
No!

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,662
It really suits you.

24
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,081
Sorry about that.

25
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,209
Excuse us.

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,044
Excuse us.

27
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,004
Excuse us.

28
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,964
Excuse us.

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,847
Congratulations to all of you
on your enrollment.

30
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,225
Congratulations.

31
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,561
We're the competitive karuta club.

32
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,315
We're a small club, with just
the five members you see here.

33
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:54,906
With a view to winning the Tokyo
Qualifier Tournament this summer,

34
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,199
we're active every day.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,624
This is for the All Japan Championship,
which is held each summer…

36
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,625
OE SILKS

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,295
…at a place called Omi Shrine
in Shiga Prefecture.

38
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,094
Yes? Go ahead.

39
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,097
Who's the club advisor?

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,184
Well, our advisor should be here any…

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,187
Here they are now.

42
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,109
Sorry I'm late.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,904
I'm Mr. Shima,
competitive karuta club advisor.

44
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,699
I'm a classics teacher. Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,909
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

46
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,548
POEM SIX:
PARTED WE MAY BE

47
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,925
What's up with you three?

48
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,721
Not right now.

49
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,558
Please take the hint.

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,354
I want to talk with the coach.

51
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,522
Strictly no men allowed!

52
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,903
Just how many layers did people
used to wear in the past?

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,531
It looks beautiful, but it's a nightmare
to put on and take off.

54
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,077
It's easy to think that way
when you're not used to it.

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,620
-Please help me.
-Certainly.

56
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:09,207
It has a funny way
of making you tighten up though.

57
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,627
It supports the upper body
around one's navel,

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,671
naturally improving posture.

59
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,092
They provide more stability
than one might think for karuta.

60
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,427
Who'd have thought?

61
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,308
Everyone wears hakama
for competitive karuta title matches.

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,061
There's no harm
in getting used to them now.

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,481
I also wore them in my Mizusawa days.

64
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,610
Sota told me about that.

65
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,864
Mizusawa High School has a tradition
of wearing hakama for big games.

66
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,954
Wait, I don't suppose the one
who started that tradition is…?

67
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes.

68
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,543
It's me.

69
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,086
I knew it!

70
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,212
Here you are.

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,880
Thank you.

72
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,258
So how was it?

73
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,968
Are you glad you wore them?

74
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,052
Yes!

75
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,805
-We got a great response, didn't we?
-Yeah.

76
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,100
We might get lots of new members, Miss Oe.

77
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,103
I mean…

78
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,813
Coach.

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,565
Coach Oe.

80
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,277
I hope so.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes, Coach!

82
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,163
WELCOME TO UMEZONO COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

83
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,833
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

84
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,174
This is odd.

85
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,597
The concert band club
is this way, freshmen!

86
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,560
CONCERT BAND CLUB

87
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,313
Whoa! Hey.

88
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,399
This must be some kind of mistake.

89
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,278
Like the clubroom map
being wrong or something?

90
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,281
Don't be ridiculous.

91
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,331
It is wrong!

92
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,791
What?

93
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,834
Who made this?

94
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,184
Hello, Okonomiyaki Nishida.

95
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,936
Yes.

96
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,896
A reservation?

97
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,524
Madam Nakanishi?

98
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,577
Okonomiyaki?

99
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,454
Right now? Okay.

100
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,958
Right. I'll see you soon, then.

101
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,419
Goodbye.

102
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,510
-Goodbye, Miss Oe.
-Goodbye.

103
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,722
Not this one.

104
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,602
Not this one!

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,691
Not this one.

106
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,242
Are you a new student?

107
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
Are you looking for something?

108
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,416
I wanted to go check out a club.

109
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,544
Where is this?

110
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,340
Oh?

111
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,967
Still, though,

112
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,053
I can't believe Miss Oe
isn't a teacher anymore.

113
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,350
Well, it seems the arrangement was always

114
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,396
that she would only cover for Mr. Shima
while he was on paternity leave.

115
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:05,234
Mr. Shima returned
sooner than planned, however.

116
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,156
But she's volunteered to
come to the club on her own time,

117
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,159
so that shouldn't change, right?

118
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,621
Well, yeah…

119
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,665
That's true, but…

120
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,083
What?

121
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,547
I just really liked Miss Oe's classes.

122
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,094
Huh?

123
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,180
Who are you,

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,016
and what have you done with Meguru?

125
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,268
When did you replace her?

126
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,104
What's going on? Calm down.

127
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,065
The Miss Aizawa we know

128
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,068
would never say that she liked classics.

129
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,486
"It's not time-effective."

130
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,655
Really?

131
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,075
I mean, is there even any point
to classic literature?

132
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,537
These days, AI can draw pictures
and make videos.

133
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,623
Even write apologies.
What place is there for classics?

134
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,543
I said that, didn't I?

135
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,379
You have to put it down
to Miss Oe's influence.

136
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,548
Maybe so.

137
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,633
-He's right.
-Yep.

138
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,302
Or you're an impostor.

139
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,929
Enough with that joke.

140
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,108
Not this one.

141
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,070
No!

142
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,697
What's his deal?

143
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,620
Are you the girls who were in the hakama?

144
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,928
Have you ever played
karuta before, Yakumo?

145
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,638
Nope.

146
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,683
I'll start from the beginning, then.
The game of karuta--

147
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,437
There's no need for that.

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,399
I just want to wear hakama.

149
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,067
Hakama?

150
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,779
Beautiful ones, like you two were wearing.

151
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,324
No can do.

152
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,368
Coach Oe already left for the day.

153
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,831
I'll be going home, then.

154
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,625
Wait!

155
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,044
Since you're here, you may as well…

156
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,464
You might like it
if you just give it a try. Yes?

157
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,007
Please.

158
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,556
You start by dealing 25 cards
to each territory, and the reader--

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,893
Hold on. Is it okay if I rearrange them?

160
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,854
Huh? Sure.

161
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,619
Okay. Go ahead.

162
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,747
Right.

163
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,501
And now, with spring's arrival

164
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:13,881
It reveals its full glory

165
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,886
In Yura's channel
A boatman's rudder is lost

166
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,888
Listlessly he drifts

167
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,934
Parted we may be
But if on Mount Inaba

168
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,062
I hear the pine trees

169
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,732
What? Didn't you just say
you've never played karuta?

170
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,278
I've only ever played competitive karuta.

171
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,031
How is that possible?!

172
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,452
Well, I didn't like it,
so I'll be going home.

173
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,329
-Hey!
-No!

174
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,540
-Wait!
-Hey!

175
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,418
If I don't get to wear hakama,
I'm going home.

176
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,253
I get enough karuta at the society.

177
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,381
You'll get to wear them.
We'll work something out.

178
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,550
-Really?
-Yeah.

179
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,052
Count me in, then.

180
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,807
Let's get straight to my welcome party.

181
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,851
What? You're welcoming yourself?

182
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
Strong-style.

183
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,062
Welcome party? Welcome party, Chieri?

184
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,189
-Welcome party? Oh…
-Welcome party!

185
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,608
-Any ideas?
-I can't think of anything!

186
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,026
OKONOMIYAKI NISHIDA

187
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,279
I'll be in Tokyo awhile

188
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,157
between my meeting
with the Agency for Cultural Affairs

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,074
and my lectures,

190
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,579
but I'm going to miss
Mr. Nishida completely.

191
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,247
He was upset about that.

192
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,375
Yes, and so he should be. Quite right.

193
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,464
I'm sorry to call you
out of the blue like this.

194
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,798
Not at all.

195
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,177
I'm just honored that you remembered me.

196
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,472
Excuse me.

197
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,389
Yes?

198
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,726
So

199
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,187
how has the reading been going?

200
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,566
I've been practicing every day
with the method you so kindly taught me.

201
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,443
If you like, Miss Oe,

202
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,528
I can listen to you later.

203
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:00,946
What?

204
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,824
Yes, please.

205
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,126
No.

206
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,796
It's "ngi." Ngi.

207
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,092
Yes. Again.

208
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,388
Yes. Again.

209
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,524
You've improved a great deal!

210
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,151
I was right about you.

211
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,611
-Huh?
-Miss Oe.

212
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,907
You have what it takes
to be a professional reader.

213
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,701
-Do you really mean that?
-I do.

214
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,664
Nevertheless,

215
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,334
a high wall still stands before you.

216
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,586
A wall?

217
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,380
Three, two, one!

218
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,012
Hey, what's this all about?

219
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,932
Just wave your hand in time
to the karuta lines.

220
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,561
It's common practice
for any karuta fanatic!

221
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,067
Sorry. I'm going to get a drink.

222
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,653
See you later!

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,245
What's the matter, Yakumo?

224
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:36,709
The nice person who told me
where the karuta club is

225
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,836
is in there.

226
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,506
Mr. Shima, by any chance?

227
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,969
There's only one karaoke place,
so maybe he's here too.

228
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,307
Miss Oe!

229
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,394
-I heard you're no longer teaching?
-Yes.

230
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,980
-The contract expired.
-She's…

231
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,691
No, not all. I'm really not very…

232
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,570
In that case…

233
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,867
come and live in Kyoto.

234
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,535
Huh?

235
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,203
Me?

236
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:18,459
You said that you once applied to work
at our research institute, didn't you?

237
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,546
We have a vacancy for a female researcher
for the first time in five years.

238
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,840
Miss Oe.

239
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:30,429
You can't scale the wall that prevents you
from being a professional reader alone.

240
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,390
If you come to Kyoto,

241
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,644
I can help you with your reading
in between research.

242
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,063
What do you say?

243
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,609
That's a very generous offer.

244
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,819
Truly more than I deserve.

245
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,323
Kyoto, eh?

246
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,450
I'd love some yatsuhashi.

247
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,375
Maybe ya boy Yakumo will have
yatsuhashi with y'all.

248
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,919
That's so original, isn't it?

249
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,631
So dope, right?

250
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,135
You know that goldfish scooping thing…?

251
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,430
Here they are!

252
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,598
You're back!

253
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,309
-Oh! I like this song!
-You do?!

254
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,533
But, I mean, you became
a classics teacher, Miss Oe.

255
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,329
I'm… not the same.

256
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,376
What I really wanted to do
was research work in Kyoto.

257
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,712
But there were no openings.

258
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,928
Meguri, meguru…

259
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,933
I won't rush you for an answer,

260
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,269
but we are short-staffed at the moment,

261
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:04,398
so I can't keep
the position free forever either.

262
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,315
Of course.

263
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,152
I hope you'll take me up on it.

264
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Yes.

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,128
-You take care of yourself, now.
-Thank you.

266
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,715
PRESCRIPTIONS DISPENSED
KOMANO PHARMACY

267
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,896
Found it!

268
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,940
It was right at the back of the closet.

269
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,567
It's a little dusty.

270
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,153
What did you want it for?

271
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,031
If you don't mind…

272
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,126
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB
ALL JAPAN VICTORY

273
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,253
This, huh?

274
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,130
This takes me back.

275
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,761
Mr. Komano.

276
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,349
Do you think…
Miss Oe still wants to achieve this dream?

277
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,017
BECOME A PRO READER AND READ THE POEMS

278
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,727
AT CHIHAYA-CHAN'S QUEEN GAME
KANADE OE

279
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,819
Well, there was that business
with her family, then COVID,

280
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,571
so there was a period
that the dream was put aside.

281
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,992
Seeing her friend play
in the Queen game every year

282
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,246
seemed to make her both happy and sad.

283
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,499
Maybe she felt guilty

284
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,751
about not being there as the reader.

285
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,841
You're talking about Miss Chihaya, right?

286
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,426
Yeah.

287
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,597
Chihaya Ayase.

288
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,891
Back then,

289
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,978
we were desperately trying
just to keep up with her.

290
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,858
Actually, we're still
trying to keep up now.

291
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,695
But, you know,

292
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,656
I think Kana has changed recently.

293
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,286
I'm thinking of taking another shot
at being a professional reader.

294
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,371
I see.

295
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,748
You're starting over?

296
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,753
Seeing those kids, it makes me
realize I have to go for them too.

297
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,673
The things I've left undone.

298
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,303
It's as if she's not just
trying to keep up anymore.

299
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
I was really pleased to hear it.

300
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,603
It felt like Kana was on the move again.

301
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,400
As such, I'm grateful to you
and your friends, Miss Aizawa.

302
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,990
It's just a shame it wasn't me
who made her do this.

303
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,595
We're not just imagining it.

304
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,222
No.

305
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,058
You really are an excellent player.

306
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,728
Hey, what class are you, Yaku Moku?

307
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,688
I'm A-class.

308
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,399
A-class?!

309
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,235
Yes.

310
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,653
You're kidding me.

311
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,322
Umezono finally has an A-class of its own!

312
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,574
This bodes well!

313
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,909
Sorry I'm late!

314
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,953
Thanks for the other day!

315
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,706
Have you settled in yet?

316
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,708
It's like a home from home.

317
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,840
Anyway, thanks to you, Coach,
I came up with a new tongue-twister!

318
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,717
What? Thanks to me?

319
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,304
When that lady was inviting you to--

320
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,765
To…!

321
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,558
Today!

322
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,520
Today's no day for that, Yakumo.

323
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,146
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

324
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,898
That is right.

325
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,195
Now, everyone, today's the day
of that twice-a-year occasion.

326
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,783
This is so refreshing!

327
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,746
Airing tatami mats in the sun like this
makes them last longer.

328
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,459
I can smell the sun.

329
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,132
Spring passes me by

330
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,718
And now the summer is here
I see that white cloth

331
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,013
Hangs to dry on the slopes of
Amanokaguyama

332
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,140
Miss Murata!

333
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,100
You're like a different person!

334
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,769
Hey! You're making too much fun of me.

335
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,105
No, I'm not making fun.

336
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,191
-Now, let's get them moving.
-All right.

337
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,570
And lift.

338
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,662
-Miss Oe.
-Yes?

339
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,417
Why do you want to be
a classics researcher?

340
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:16,918
Come again?

341
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,922
No, it's just…
I never really asked you before.

342
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,927
I don't so much want to be a researcher

343
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,222
as I do a connector, per se.

344
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,933
A connector?

345
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,853
Yes. The Hyakunin Isshu, for instance,

346
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,858
is a collection of poems from each era,
like what we'd now call a "best of" album.

347
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,903
A "best of" album? I see.

348
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:48,325
And thanks to that,
it's reached us here in the present day.

349
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,660
Classics only exist to this day

350
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,456
because of the nameless people
who wanted to preserve them

351
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,419
and so passed that baton on
little by little.

352
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,465
With no poems,
there'd be no Hyakunin Isshu.

353
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,426
With no Hyakunin Isshu,
there'd be no karuta.

354
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,553
With no karuta,

355
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,432
we would have never met each other.

356
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:23,360
To me, research, education,
and karuta are all the same.

357
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,239
It's through doing them that I hope to be

358
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:32,452
one of those nameless people
who keeps this epic story going.

359
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,250
You want to be
a part of history, in other words?

360
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,293
The ultimate classics nerd.

361
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,297
We can't compete with that!

362
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,010
You're goated, Coach.

363
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,597
Am I now?

364
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,160
This poem's been around for 1,000 years.

365
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,878
You might call it investing in virtue,
Miss Aizawa!

366
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,339
I'll take good care of Miss Meguru.

367
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,223
I will…

368
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,144
devote myself to it.

369
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,035
Please wait in seat one.

370
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,369
-Thank you.
-Okay.

371
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,039
Welcome--

372
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,253
-If you don't mind.
-Certainly.

373
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,424
-Your mother has the flu?
-Yes.

374
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,176
Oh dear.

375
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,054
You must have your hands full
with the silk shop.

376
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,889
I bet you can hardly go to Umezono.

377
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,307
That's right.

378
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,603
I'm worried the clubroom
will get all messy without me.

379
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,355
I'm sure.

380
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,899
I can go instead if you like.

381
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,983
Oh?

382
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,195
Thanks. That would be a help.

383
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,323
-Okay, please wait in seat two.
-Yes.

384
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,285
Oh, and…

385
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,165
do you have a minute to talk?

386
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,796
Sure. It's nearly time for my break.

387
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,102
What's with you guys?

388
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,981
I don't know where to begin, Meguru.

389
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,820
I think you'd best take a seat first.

390
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,421
Yaku Moku told us what happened.

391
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,467
I think I really put my foot in it.

392
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,470
-Told you what?
-Don't act dumb.

393
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:42,684
About Miss Oe being offered the job
at the Kyoto research institute.

394
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,439
Why didn't you say anything?

395
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:52,193
Well, it didn't seem like
it was set in stone or anything.

396
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,947
I didn't want to get you
worrying for no reason, right?

397
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,331
No. I'm sorry.

398
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,752
I couldn't come to terms with it myself.

399
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,755
That's what I thought.

400
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,633
And neither can I.

401
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,968
So I'll talk to her.

402
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,305
What? Wait. Talk about what?

403
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,265
Isn't it obvious?

404
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,225
I'll ask her not to go.

405
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,354
We'll be in a fix if Miss Oe leaves now.

406
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,273
If we're going to win the Tokyo qualifier,

407
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,402
we need someone with
All Japan experience like her to guide us.

408
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,573
I won't get to wear hakama
if Coach is gone.

409
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,952
Let's at least wait
until she talks to us about it.

410
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,580
It'll be quicker if we bring it up first.

411
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,668
Wait, everyone.

412
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,717
I want to hear what Aizawa thinks too.

413
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,056
I…

414
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,562
I want Miss Oe to go to Kyoto.

415
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,607
No, I think she should go.

416
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,446
So that's what that was about.

417
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,614
What was?

418
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,325
Huh? Oh, nothing. Ignore me.

419
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,078
-Sorry. Here.
-Thanks.

420
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,583
This is great news, though, isn't it?

421
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,127
At least I think it is.

422
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,837
The timing's good.

423
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,340
Most importantly, it's your dream job.

424
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,219
And you even get coached in reading
by Ms. Nakanishi to boot.

425
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,222
Logically, there's no reason not to go.

426
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,143
You're… right.

427
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,813
That's what my head tells me.

428
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,859
Umezono Karuta Club?

429
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,576
Abandoning everyone right now would be…

430
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,372
I appreciate how you must feel.

431
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,125
But it's your life we're talking about.

432
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,169
Nothing can come before that.

433
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,595
All right. Let's go.

434
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,817
Think about it.

435
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:42,197
This is the perfect chance for Miss Oe
to make her dream come true.

436
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,531
I'd take it in a second.

437
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,825
But if she's hesitating,

438
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,287
it must be
because she's concerned about us.

439
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,457
I don't want that.

440
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,627
I don't want to be a burden.

441
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,973
So what do we do now, then?

442
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,853
We'll take over where Miss Oe leaves off.

443
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,232
Develop the skills to win the tournament
even without her.

444
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,943
I'd like to do that

445
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:24,447
and wait until she eventually talks to us.

446
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,867
What about my hakama?

447
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,121
Don't worry.
I haven't forgotten about that, Yaku Moku.

448
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,998
I'll take care of that as well.

449
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,792
All right!

450
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,421
I find it hard to believe
Miss Oe would leave us for Kyoto.

451
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,423
He's right, Meguru.

452
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,218
Would you be okay with that?

453
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,230
GET IN TOUCH ANYTIME
IF YOU'RE UNSURE OF ANYTHING. ―OE

454
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,274
Parted we may be

455
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,734
But if on Mount Inaba

456
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,154
I hear the pine trees

457
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,158
Tell me that you wait for me

458
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,952
Let me introduce you to everyone.

459
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,205
This is Mr. Komano,
our substitute coach for today.

460
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,625
He was Miss Oe's teammate
back in high school.

461
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,836
Nice to meet you.

462
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,130
Nice to meet you.

463
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,756
That's our strategy.

464
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,760
And this goes without saying,
but you'll all need to improve

465
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,262
to win the Tokyo qualifier.

466
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,016
Let's all play plenty of singles games
and aim to get promoted.

467
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,936
Yes. It'll be a level-up
for all of Umezono.

468
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,399
I'm fond of collecting certificates,
so I'll do it.

469
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,360
Now let's work on
your individual strategies.

470
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,528
Yes, Coach.

471
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:51,159
It looks like Miss Oe negotiated
practice times and locations

472
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:55,371
with clubs that make a lot of noise,
like the concert band and music clubs.

473
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,706
Did she?

474
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,585
I guess we can't practice
if we can't hear the poems.

475
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:05,173
She did so much to support us
that we weren't even aware of.

476
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,425
So I spoke with them.

477
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,762
But I haven't spoken
with the dance club yet.

478
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,514
Haru Bun, Fuki, Yaku Moku.

479
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,142
Is there anyone in dance club
you could talk to?

480
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,560
No.

481
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,854
There isn't.

482
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,486
I know someone.

483
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,908
I'll go talk to them.

484
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,452
Chieri!

485
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,207
I still don't agree with all of this.

486
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:45,213
But… I don't want to be a burden either.

487
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,592
TOURNAMENT PREP CHECKLIST
TOURNAMENT INFORMATION

488
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,182
Miss Aizawa!

489
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,226
Oh! Miss Oe.

490
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,396
Is your mother feeling better?

491
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,857
Yes, thankfully so.

492
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,608
That's good.

493
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
How come you're here?

494
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,238
It was just morning practice today.

495
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,617
I was free, so I thought
I'd just do some cleaning…

496
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:03,207
You always wiped the mats like this
after weekend practice, didn't you?

497
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
Yes.

498
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,755
Well, I'll be doing it from now on.

499
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,300
What? Where's this come from
all of a sudden?

500
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,345
I started doing it. Investing in virtue.

501
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,684
Hopefully, I'll get
a good return on it one day.

502
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,264
TELL ME THAT YOU WAIT FOR ME
I SHALL HASTEN TO RETURN

503
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
"Parted we may be" is a farewell poem.

504
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,980
It means, "If you're waiting for me,
I'll come straight home,"

505
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,901
and has often been used
as an incantation since ancient times.

506
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,988
The second half would be pasted
or hidden by the front door

507
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,827
with a wish
that someone would one day return.

508
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,457
What's the matter?

509
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,210
Nothing.

510
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,884
Huh? Miss Oe's here too!

511
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:41,097
-Oh my! It's been a while.
-It has.

512
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,142
-Shall we get started?
-Yeah.

513
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,521
Oh? What's going on, everyone?

514
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,695
-Goodbye, Miss Oe.
-Take care.

515
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,780
-Thank you.
-Bye.

516
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,532
Let's all get a fortune slip--

517
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,660
I'm hungry.

518
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,037
-Shall we get a bite to eat?
-Yeah.

519
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,707
You guys go on ahead.

520
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,417
-All right.
-Got it.

521
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,634
-Miss Oe.
-Yes?

522
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,269
They have a souvenir stamp!

523
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,521
-Do you collect them?
-No.

524
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,690
-What the heck?
-A souvenir stamp!

525
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,068
Wait, guys.

526
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,864
We were waiting for you.

527
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,033
Miss Oe has…

528
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,244
What about her?

529
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,372
She's made up her mind.

530
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,416
About what?

531
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,835
That she won't go to Kyoto.

532
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,171
She's staying here!

533
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,506
What do you mean?

534
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:02,345
So she'll stay on as coach
until the Tokyo qualifier, she says.

535
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,971
Sota.

536
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,140
Did you ask her?

537
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,768
Yeah.

538
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:14,982
What?

539
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,778
What's with you all?

540
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,988
Aren't you happy?

541
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,450
I am.

542
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,329
I'm really happy.

543
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,999
-Right?
-But it's wrong, Sota.

544
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,461
-What is?
-It's totally wrong. Not like this.

545
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,922
Why not?

546
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,550
-Isn't it a good thing?
-I wanted her to decide for herself.

547
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,510
And she did!

548
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,054
No! It's wrong, Sota!

549
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,557
We can't approach her about it.
Why don't you get it?

550
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,437
No, I don't get it.

551
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,067
It never made sense, Miss Aizawa.

552
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,237
It's cold.

553
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,074
It's almost as if

554
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,494
you want to get rid of Miss Oe.

555
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,124
I want to get rid of her?
What are you talking about?!

556
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,418
She's so kind.

557
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,169
So responsible.

558
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,589
She denies her own feelings
just for our sakes.

559
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,717
But that's not right.

560
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,512
Yes, I'm really sad about it too.

561
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,184
But Miss Oe is a human being too.

562
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,062
She ought to be allowed
to chase her own dreams.

563
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,565
She's the same as us, after all.

564
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,363
Please understand, Sota.

565
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,509
Maybe that darn Sota's
not planning on showing up.

566
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,388
It's already time we checked in.

567
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,184
I guess this is as far as we go.

568
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,437
Guys.

569
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,107
Let's adjust our mindset.

570
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,446
If all of us manage to get promoted,

571
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,949
maybe Miss Oe can go to Kyoto
with peace of mind.

572
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,580
We may be in different arenas today,
but our hearts will be as one.

573
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,842
Let's do this, Umezono!

574
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,677
Right!

575
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:53,891
D-CLASS MATCHES VENUE

576
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,771
Let's have a good game.

577
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,201
Let's have a good game.

578
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,145
Hello.

579
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,563
Hello.

580
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,360
Oh?

581
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,407
Coach Oe! You're enthusiastic,
coming here on a Sunday.

582
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,743
There's something
I wanted to discuss with everyone.

583
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,122
Huh? I don't think
they're here today though.

584
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,290
What?

585
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,667
I thought they had practice.

586
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,923
They got in touch earlier
to say they're going for the singles.

587
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:13,304
Something about getting a promotion
for Coach Oe's sake.

588
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,889
What?

589
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,143
What is in fact Yoshino

590
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:24,440
Under a snow-white blanket

591
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,277
Loud the crickets chirp
On this dark and frosty night…

592
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,987
Thank you.

593
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,990
Thank you.

594
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,992
All right.

595
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,255
Good work, everyone.

596
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,340
How'd it go?

597
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,342
We won. Both of us.

598
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,552
-Congrats!
-And you guys?

599
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,970
We won.

600
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,097
-Nice!
-Congratulations.

601
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,358
Miss Aizawa.

602
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,153
I'm sorry.

603
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,739
No.

604
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:19,495
I realized I said too much too.

605
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,705
I'm sorry.

606
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,293
I said a lot of stuff…

607
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,381
but to be honest,

608
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,302
I was just sad about the idea
of losing Miss Oe too.

609
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:42,309
I've also denied my own feelings
in the past.

610
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,061
So I get it.

611
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,359
I'll get that promotion.

612
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,823
So Miss Oe can have peace of mind.

613
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,996
Me too.

614
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,625
Let's give it our all.

615
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,550
Yes!

616
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:25,936
Unfortunately, only one of us
can be promoted.

617
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,689
No holding back.

618
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,276
I'd have it no other way.

619
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,572
From high atop Mount Hiei

620
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:41,577
I shield it behind my sleeve

621
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,791
TOKYO KOKONOE TOURNAMENT

622
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,590
-You won the tournament?
-Yeah.

623
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,467
You were tough, Shirano.

624
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,469
That's awesome!

625
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,763
Miss Oe!

626
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,557
Miss Oe?

627
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,434
Everyone,

628
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,730
I'm truly sorry to have caused you
all this trouble.

629
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,941
I should have consulted you sooner.

630
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,403
No need to fret though.
I'm not going anywhere--

631
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,780
Hey, Miss Oe.

632
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,657
Get a load of this.

633
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,369
We got promoted.

634
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,495
That's right!

635
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,666
-What?
-So go to Kyoto with peace of mind.

636
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,378
You have nothing to worry about with us.

637
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,005
Huh?

638
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:39,551
We don't want to be a burden to you.

639
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,387
-But--
-Listen.

640
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,058
People who find their treasure in karuta
are sure to have a bright future, right?

641
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,064
We can't have you not getting that.

642
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,785
Miss Oe!

643
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,664
Look at this.

644
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,416
Mine too.

645
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,167
I got promoted.

646
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,382
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

647
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,300
Let's go to the after-party!

648
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,094
Where are we having it?

649
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,853
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

650
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,187
-Here?
-Yes.

651
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,982
Very good.

652
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,358
I did it!

653
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,818
And you're all done!

654
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,904
Thank goodness.

655
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,745
This folding screen.

656
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,916
We used it at the school festival.
Good memories.

657
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,503
Looking at it more closely,
it's kind of beautiful, isn't it?

658
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:01,467
It depicts the chapters "Sekiya"
and "Miotsukushi" from The Tale of Genji.

659
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,052
-"Miotsukushi"?
-Do you remember?

660
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,347
I did a class about it back then.

661
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,392
You said it, didn't you?

662
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,519
That you'd be my miotsukushi.

663
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,396
Huh? No, I didn't.

664
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,523
I said I'd devote myself.

665
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,942
No, you said you'd be
my navigation marker.

666
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,944
Huh? That's strange. Hold on a sec.

667
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,571
It works either way.

668
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,408
In other words, I'll devote myself
to being your marker…

669
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,702
Now it's just confusing.

670
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,954
This kind of wordplay is just puns.

671
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,207
Yes, it is a pun, isn't it?

672
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,210
Maybe people in the past just liked puns.

673
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,421
It's true.

674
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,015
Miss Oe.

675
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,939
Look after yourself in Kyoto.

676
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,501
Even though it was me
who had to be your marker…

677
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,934
it became the other way around
at some point.

678
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,820
Thank you.

679
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,675
Well, I'll be going, then.

680
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,177
Please take care.

681
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,931
-Safe travels.
-Thanks.

682
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,787
You like Miss Oe, don't you, Mr. Komano?

683
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,832
Of course I do.

684
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,960
We've been seeing each other
for a little while now.

685
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,170
What?

686
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,964
It just took me ten years to tell her.

687
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,051
But she just left for Kyoto!

688
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,427
She sure did.

689
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,138
Don't say it so casually!

690
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,723
It looks like

691
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,060
this game's going right down to the wire.

692
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:58,977
What?

693
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,063
-Huh?
-Whoa!

694
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,192
-It's really beautiful.
-Thank you.

695
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,568
MIZUSAWA HIGH SCHOOL

696
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,529
Please tell us why you
joined the karuta club.

697
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,447
KARUTA CLUB

698
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,742
I saw Miss Nagi's videos,
and it looked really cool.

699
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,204
I was also invited by Miss Nagi.

700
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,623
She gave me the hard sell as well.

701
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,707
Miss Nagi asked me.

702
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,378
Stop it, all of you!
You're making me sound like a weirdo!

703
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,756
You're not a weirdo. Just karuta crazy.

704
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,218
-Huh?
-Okay, next person.

705
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,680
Well, as for me,

706
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,140
I wanted to wear a kimono,

707
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,561
and I couldn't decide between
archery club and tea ceremony club,

708
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,314
but I settled on karuta club!

709
