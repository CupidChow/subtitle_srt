PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,258
There's a study camp
over the long weekend in November.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,635
So you can all improve even more,

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,304
I'm planning a karuta training camp
for the long weekend this fall.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,265
KARUTA CLUB TRAINING CAMP
2–4 NOVEMBER

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,725
SPECIAL FALL STUDY CAMP
2–4 NOVEMBER

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,226
Please discuss it with your parents.

8
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,270
What the hell?!

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:25,859
A famous club has kindly allowed us
to join them on their training camp.

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,195
It's the perfect chance to soak up
all of their knowledge.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,448
What? She's not at the study camp?

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,616
Where is she?

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,494
She won't answer the phone.
She's not reading texts.

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,996
The police!

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,251
Huh?

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,919
Mom?

17
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:49,966
Toko!

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,313
I can't apologize enough.

19
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,109
Well, the main thing is that she's safe.

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,820
So we'll be going now.

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,031
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

22
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,462
Meguru.

23
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:48,525
It seems that Miss Aizawa's cram school
had a camp at the same time as this one,

24
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:53,488
and she led her parents to believe
that she went to the cram school camp.

25
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,534
I wonder why she didn't tell them.

26
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,497
I feel like it's too good for me.

27
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,791
My parents' care for me,

28
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,337
the money, the time, the friends…

29
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,715
I couldn't forgive myself
for wasting them all.

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,260
So you decided there's no room for youth?

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,223
She couldn't tell them.

32
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:28,231
Everybody's got one or two things
they can't tell their parents, right?

33
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,236
That's true.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,740
I couldn't tell my old man
about karuta at first either.

35
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,494
Then Aizawa gave me the push I needed.

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,790
Or rather,

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,085
it went that way
because that's just who she is.

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,173
Me too.

39
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,634
It went that way in the end.

40
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,222
Me too.

41
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,395
In hindsight.

42
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,564
Thinking about it now,

43
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,400
the seniors having their retirement game,

44
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,070
the fact that this karuta club
is still going,

45
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,241
it's all because Miss Aizawa
was there for us.

46
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,663
That's Miss Aizawa, isn't it?

47
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,960
Always quietly by the side
of those who need help.

48
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,214
I wonder what's going

49
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,050
to become of us now?

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,985
Sorry, Susumu.
I'm going to get some sleep.

51
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,196
My head's swimming.

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,749
I call it the kind-of-amazing ochazuke.

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,923
Thank you.

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,703
This reminds me

55
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,373
of back when you were in sixth grade

56
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,084
and you went missing
after going out with a friend.

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,629
There was a big fuss.
The police got involved.

58
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,216
They brought you home.

59
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,902
I remember it was
the kind-of-amazing udon that time.

60
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,997
That's most of the reason
your mom was in such a panic yesterday.

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,914
The police!

62
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,586
Meguru's a high-schooler now.

63
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,713
It's not like back then.

64
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:43,801
She was afraid
you might really disappear this time.

65
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,359
Your mom and I aren't angry.

66
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,530
We just want to know
what's going on in that heart of yours.

67
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,880
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

68
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,725
POEM FIVE: BEYOND MOUNT OE

69
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,397
We're not trying to take
anything away from you, Meguru.

70
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,401
We're just asking if this is
something you should really be starting

71
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,152
as a sophomore.

72
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,407
Right. You can always start it
once you're in college, can't you?

73
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:53,538
I promised everyone at karuta club
that we'd go to the All Japan together.

74
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,792
Why do you have to go
to the All Japan Karuta Championship?

75
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,420
Because…

76
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,590
I don't know.

77
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,640
You could've at least talked to us sooner.

78
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,854
I couldn't.

79
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,480
Why not?

80
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,816
Because I thought you'd say

81
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,986
exactly what you're saying right now.

82
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,744
What you're both trying to say

83
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,373
really does make sense to me.

84
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,876
That's why

85
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,753
I want the two of you to decide.

86
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,424
What do you

87
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,179
want me to do?

88
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,109
200 DAYS UNTIL THE TOKYO QUALIFIER

89
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,709
Meguru!

90
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,794
Miss Aizawa! Was everything okay?

91
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,255
Yeah.

92
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,216
I'm…

93
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,886
sorry, everyone.

94
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,099
I spoke with my folks, and…

95
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,480
Well, this all started
with Miss Aizawa telling a lie,

96
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,691
and apparently they don't intend
to make anything more of it.

97
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,363
However, the school
has an obligation to explain.

98
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,199
So would you mind joining us?

99
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,618
Of course not.

100
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,205
One more thing.

101
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:04,252
About Miss Aizawa's membership
of the karuta club.

102
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:10,216
They'd like the next tournament
to be her last.

103
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,638
Last? You mean she'll be leaving the club?

104
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,848
Regrettably, yes.

105
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:25,398
But if that's what her parents wish,
it's out of our hands.

106
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,567
I don't believe it!

107
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm sorry, guys.

108
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,621
I can't go to
the Tokyo qualifier with you.

109
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,458
I'm truly sorry.

110
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,171
My karuta career

111
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,550
will end at the Musashino Tournament.

112
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,720
Or I should say,

113
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,973
it will start and end.

114
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,437
But even so,

115
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:09,317
all the more reason to use
my time left to train just as hard…

116
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,612
No, train even harder than before.

117
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,075
I want to go far as we can
in the tournament.

118
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,873
Because I want to play
as many matches as possible with you all.

119
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,464
I know it's selfish.

120
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,507
But please

121
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,387
let me do this.

122
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,362
Miss Aizawa.

123
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Miss Oe.

124
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,287
Please.

125
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,927
Man, it's freezing.

126
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,764
-Miss Murata?
-Miss Murata.

127
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,350
No way! Morning practice too?

128
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,687
You too, then, I take it?

129
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,399
Yeah, after everything Meguru said.

130
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,903
We feel the same way as Miss Aizawa too.

131
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,862
Yes.

132
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,866
How about that?

133
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,914
I guess he had the same idea as well.

134
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,298
Morning.

135
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,092
-Morning.
-Good morning.

136
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,053
Shall we?

137
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,150
What the…?

138
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,027
I wonder how long they've been going.

139
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,035
If Aizawa's going this far,
we've gotta give it our all too, right?

140
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,457
We can do better
than "as many as possible"!

141
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,003
If we're gonna do it, we'll blow Hokuoh
and Mizusawa away to win the title.

142
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,715
That way, we'll get to play
the most matches.

143
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,177
How sneaky, practicing without us.

144
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,846
We'll join you.

145
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,182
All right. Let's get changed.

146
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,266
Let's.

147
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,947
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

148
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,076
Last one.

149
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,496
-Last one.
-Good work.

150
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,708
Sweep in more of a straight line,
taking the shortest route possible.

151
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,918
A straight line.

152
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,838
That's it. Okay, one more time?

153
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,757
Let's go, Umezono!

154
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,178
Let's go, Umezono!

155
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,265
Let's go…

156
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,684
This is yours, Miss Aizawa. Here.

157
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,895
And lastly, Mr. Shirano.

158
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,648
We'll start with you, Miss Aizawa.

159
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,610
Your specialty card
is here on the middle left,

160
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695
and cards that can be identified early…

161
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,949
The sweet scent of the flowers

162
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:50,788
Remains the same as ever

163
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,417
-Got it!
-Nice one, Aizawa!

164
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,586
Nice!

165
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,845
It's finally time.

166
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,971
Yes.

167
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,514
Let's enjoy it.

168
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,766
I'm getting nervous now.

169
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,476
Let's give it our all.

170
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:20,150
And now, with spring's arrival
It reveals its full glory

171
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,863
Going round the path…

172
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,325
-Look at this!
-Huh?

173
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,412
She's worn the knees out from kneeling?

174
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,706
She asked us to buy her a new tracksuit.

175
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,503
I can't believe how serious
she's gotten about karuta.

176
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,213
It surprised me too.

177
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,464
Tell me about it.

178
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,515
I'd like you to let me
keep playing karuta, please.

179
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:57,646
I've dealt with most things
by telling myself it was for the future

180
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,733
and that one day, it will come in handy.

181
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,736
But this, though…

182
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,698
this is the one thing I can only do now.

183
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,701
This is the first time I've felt that way.

184
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,500
Thinking about it, though,

185
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:23,339
I feel like the old Meguru
used to be more like this.

186
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:28,052
Then at some point, she started talking
about efficiency this and evidence that.

187
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,180
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

188
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,934
I paid it no mind
and just took it as her growing up.

189
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,356
Maybe I used words like those
in front of her too much.

190
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,483
I said them sometimes too.

191
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,696
But looking back now,
it started all of a sudden.

192
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,993
Maybe her failing her exam
played a big part in it.

193
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,704
It was after getting the results

194
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,083
that Meguru went missing.

195
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,463
Well, that is a possibility, but…

196
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,924
But?

197
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,844
I don't know.

198
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,316
Please accept our sincere apologies.

199
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,276
We are truly sorry.

200
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
-No, we're sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

201
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,866
We'll strive to ensure
nothing like this happens again.

202
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,620
Shall we go, then?

203
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,585
-Oh, Miss Oe?
-Yes?

204
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,462
If you don't mind me asking,

205
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,718
how did Meguru come
to start playing karuta?

206
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,555
Yes…

207
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,725
Only, it's very hard to imagine

208
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,937
her actively seeking it out
with the way she's been lately.

209
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,735
Forgive me.

210
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,322
I may have put undue pressure
on Miss Meguru.

211
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,491
I overstepped a boundary.

212
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,953
No. That's not what I mean.

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,210
It's embarrassing to admit,

214
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:31,008
but we've always hoped
we were understanding parents.

215
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:38,932
So… we just can't understand
what was going through Meguru's head

216
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,436
when she felt she couldn't say to us

217
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,023
that she wanted to play karuta.

218
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,238
I'm putting you in an awkward spot.

219
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,782
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,659
Anyway, we'll be leaving now.

221
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,871
Wait.

222
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,879
Would you like to take a look
before you go?

223
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,094
UMEZONO COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB
UMEZONO KARUTA CLUB

224
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,887
-They're kind of plain, aren't they?
-Oh?

225
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,182
Then what did you come up with,
Miss Murata?

226
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,977
I made… this!

227
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,270
HEART AND SOUL INTO EACH POEM!!

228
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,772
Another school has one like that.

229
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,149
-What?
-Done!

230
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,443
Let's see.

231
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,321
I did a good job, if I do say so myself.

232
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,577
What is that?

233
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,663
Dayu Koume?

234
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,456
Murasaki Shikibu, obviously!

235
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,375
What about yours, Mr. Shirano?

236
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
He totally ignored it!

237
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,629
Don't worry about mine.
It's kind of boring.

238
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,256
Just show us.

239
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,719
This isn't my strong suit.

240
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,972
I kind of like it.

241
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,306
Yeah.

242
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,559
-Nice and simple.
-Yes.

243
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,435
It's very Umezono.

244
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,646
It's good. I'm jealous.

245
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,939
Are you serious?

246
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,441
You're not all going
to joke about it later?

247
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,611
-No, this'll be the joke for sure.
-Hey! Chieri!

248
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,907
It's Murasaki Shikibu, darn it!

249
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,916
There's one thing Miss Meguru said

250
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,045
that really stayed with me.

251
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,465
Devoted their youths?

252
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,722
Isn't that indulgent?

253
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,851
Having a youth is indulgent?

254
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,311
Yes.

255
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:52,399
When I heard that, I couldn't help
but do something about it.

256
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:58,488
Our generation all had the choice
to have a youth or not.

257
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,450
We took that fact for granted.

258
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,869
But if

259
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,623
kids today don't even have that choice,

260
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,168
it really breaks my heart.

261
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,465
I behaved presumptuously.

262
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,925
Not at all.

263
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:27,434
Will you be attending
the upcoming tournament?

264
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,562
I can walk you through it, if you'd like.

265
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm afraid we have work that day.

266
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,736
I see.

267
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,282
It does look like Murasaki Shikibu,
doesn't it?

268
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,619
Doesn't it, Haru Bun?

269
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,539
Meguru? Are you awake?

270
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,349
37TH MUSASHINO TOURNAMENT
HIGH SCHOOL TEAM GAMES

271
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,644
Huh. So your dad was against
you playing karuta too, Shirano?

272
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:39,232
Yeah. He was reluctant at first,
but now he's cool with it.

273
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,488
Hey! Fuki!

274
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,659
-Fuki!
-Please, no.

275
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,328
UMEZONO FOR THE WIN!!!

276
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:54,331
Good morning, everyone.
Thanks for looking after Fuki.

277
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,582
What are you doing?

278
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,709
What? I'm here to cheer you on.

279
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,753
Not that. This getup!

280
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,589
You're embarrassing me.

281
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,383
Everyone does stuff like this.

282
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,303
Besides, I heard…

283
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,350
I heard that Teacher is leaving
karuta club after today.

284
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,604
Get a grip, man.

285
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,653
Excuse me. I'm Oe, club advisor.

286
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,321
-Miss Oe!
-Nice to meet you.

287
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,324
-I'm Shirano. Nice to meet you.
-Thank you for coming.

288
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,367
Thank you.

289
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,494
So this is an official tournament.

290
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,372
They all look like good players.

291
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,920
Mizusawa sure have the look of champions.

292
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,141
Look, everyone!

293
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,727
We have these, don't we?

294
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,901
We're gonna win this.

295
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,653
-Yes.
-Right.

296
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,041
Shouldn't you be heading off?

297
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,669
Yes, you're right.

298
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,797
I was just wondering
if Meguru had arrived yet.

299
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,383
It'll be the opening ceremony
right about now.

300
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,385
Uh-oh. I need to get going too.

301
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,098
What a pain in the butt,
playing karuta on a Sunday morning.

302
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,059
It's a total 180 from her old personality.

303
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,938
You take it too easy because you go
to a combined middle and high school.

304
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,566
I'll give you that.
I've got free time aplenty.

305
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,152
I'm not sure which one was right now.

306
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,948
I've done you a favor just by not
sending cram school fees down the drain.

307
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,038
What did you just say, Kakeru?

308
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,666
Huh? Did I say something?

309
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,006
37TH MUSASHINO TOURNAMENT

UMEZONO
ADORE GIRLS' ACADEMY

311
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,769
What is it, Sota?

312
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,772
This is terrible.

313
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,066
We're up against Adore.

314
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,360
Are they strong?

315
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:29,986
Yeah.

316
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,573
They're the third best in Tokyo
after Mizusawa and Hokuoh.

317
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,118
You've worked really hard
over this past year.

318
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,623
-Leave it all out there on the mats.
-You're kidding me.

319
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,043
Haruma.

320
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,880
Adore have traditionally
always argued a lot.

321
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,967
Be careful not to let them
dictate the pace.

322
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,135
Sho.

323
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,389
All right. We doing this?

324
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,974
Yeah!

325
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,518
So your kid brother does have a nice side.

326
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,526
I mean, I did ask Sis once.

327
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,113
"FIRE's all well and good,
but what comes after that?"

328
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,699
And what did she say?

329
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,120
That it wasn't her
who was going to FIRE. It was you guys.

330
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:25,959
That she was going to put your life plan
back on track after she had delayed it.

331
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,963
Meguru said that?

332
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,298
Yeah.

333
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,471
I can't believe it.

334
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,899
Their club advisor is famous
for her passion as a coach.

335
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,030
They're always in the running
for the title with each generation.

336
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,991
Umezono must not stand a chance, then!

337
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,494
Ordinarily, yes.

338
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,829
However,

339
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,499
Umezono can't afford
to complain about that today.

340
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,836
Because after all, the moment they lose,

341
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,883
their time spent playing karuta
with Miss Aizawa is over.

342
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,889
Umezono!

343
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,390
Let's go!

344
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,392
Right!

345
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,271
And now, with spring's arrival

346
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,692
It reveals its full glory

347
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,738
We won't let it end!

348
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,786
Got one!

349
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,953
Nice!

350
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,206
All right!

351
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,250
Still in the lead!

352
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,585
Get the next one too!

353
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,003
Will do!

354
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,631
Yes!

355
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,718
-Kept the streak!
-Nice!

356
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,930
-Kept it!
-Nice!

357
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,807
-Me too!
-And me!

358
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,018
Hang in there!

359
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,365
They're tough.

360
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,952
But then again,

361
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,330
President Nishida and Hokuoh

362
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,792
were even tougher!

363
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,754
Took it!

364
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,839
Nice!

365
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,564
Chieri.

366
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,983
Let's get the next one together.

367
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,697
Here we go.

368
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,119
Okay!

369
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,621
I got it!

370
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,499
-Same here.
-I got it too!

371
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,128
The white beads of dew

372
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,255
Buffeted so by the wind

373
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,632
Scattered in this way

374
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,512
He matched the speed
of the number one high-schooler!

375
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,517
Impressive.

376
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,646
He's come so far.

377
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,984
Mr. Shirano might be
a phenom in the making.

378
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,780
Nice, Shirano.

379
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,656
-Thanks.
-Nice one.

380
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,408
One moment, please.

381
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,286
Huh?

382
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,371
I think I took that one.

383
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,751
But my hand was like--

384
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,253
I swept it first, didn't I?

385
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,589
What's this?

386
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,549
Yono's in a dispute.

387
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,805
It was me who touched it directly.

388
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,600
My fingertips touched it
before you swept it away, Mr. Yono.

389
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,478
Is this going to be settled?

390
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,772
In karuta,

391
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:19,359
it's standard for players to settle
these things between themselves.

392
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:24,864
It's a game that relies
on the sportsmanship of both players.

393
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,325
Stay strong, Mr. Yono.

394
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,121
Don't let her win, Sota.

395
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,338
All right, then.

396
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,465
It's your hand, Miss Tokuda.

397
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,641
Take the next one, Adore.

398
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,725
Yes, ma'am!

399
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,896
Across the autumn meadow

400
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,608
Like jewels that defy the thread

401
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,791
Then if only I could go

402
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:22,380
To you without being seen

403
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,803
Near Mount Arima

404
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,680
As Ina's bamboo grass fields

405
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,683
Rustle in the breeze

406
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,777
Streak!

407
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,333
Aizawa.

408
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,518
Please turn off your phones.

409
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,395
Sorry.

410
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,522
Sorry.

411
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,526
Mr. and Mrs. Aizawa!

412
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,362
Miss Oe! Hello.

413
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,822
Nice to meet you. I'm Fuki Shirano's dad.

414
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,408
-Thank you for taking care of Meguru.
-Thank you.

415
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,202
You came!

416
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:39,082
I thought… we ought to come see her play
for the last time for ourselves.

417
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,710
-Please follow me.
-Thank you.

418
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,776
Thank you.

419
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,821
-Miss Oe?
-Yes?

420
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:14,701
It doesn't look like Meguru's team
is in a very good situation.

421
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,746
To be honest, they've drawn
a top school in the first round.

422
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,583
But… but they're doing
incredibly well though.

423
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,545
Hangs to dry on the slopes of

424
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:30,967
Amanokaguyama

425
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,395
Umezono!

426
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,025
One win!

427
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,694
Incredible, Mr. Shirano!

428
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,571
That's my boy!

429
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,282
Nicely done, Mr. Shirano!

430
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,160
Nice, Shirano!

431
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,956
Let's follow his lead!

432
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,125
All right!

433
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,585
All right!

434
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,961
All right!

435
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,592
They're getting into a rhythm.

436
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,014
-Kept my streak!
-Nice, Meguru!

437
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,724
Took it!

438
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,726
Go, Umezono!

439
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,686
I took it!

440
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,192
The fewer the cards
in the opponent's territory,

441
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,361
the greater the chance
a card in one's own will be read.

442
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,864
Miss Meguru is aware of that.

443
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,949
That's why she hasn't given up.1

444
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,870
Streak!

445
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:46,417
Seeing her now, it's hard to believe
she was unsure about joining till the end.

446
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,422
She was unsure about joining?

447
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,633
Yes.

448
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,346
Would you like to play karuta with us?

449
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,431
I can't.

450
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,850
If I indulge myself now,

451
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,062
everything will go down the drain again.

452
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,981
Down the drain?

453
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,733
Yes.

454
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:27,583
Who'd have thought all that time and money
would just go down the drain?

455
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,420
Maybe the entrance exam
was a bit too soon for her.

456
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,842
Huh? Was there a sound just then?

457
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,844
Huh? Was there?

458
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,928
Yeah.

459
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,513
It's me!

460
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,765
I'm the reason

461
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,478
Meguru got lost!

462
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,982
It's not just you, Toko. It's me too.

463
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,569
Meguru may have come home that day,

464
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,363
but she's stayed lost

465
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,658
ever since.

466
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,888
Snatched it!

467
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,349
Toko!

468
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,986
THE JOURNEY IS LONG

469
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,781
AND MY EYES ARE YET TO SPY
AMANOHASHIDATE

470
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,134
And my eyes are yet to spy

471
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,511
Amanohashidate

472
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,023
Are you well versed in waka?

473
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,777
The two of us did a little studying
since we last met.

474
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,861
Just basic stuff.

475
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,529
BEYOND MOUNT OE
GOES THE ROAD TO IKUNO

476
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,365
THE JOURNEY IS LONG
AND MY EYES ARE YET TO SPY

477
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,741
AMANOHASHIDATE

478
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,701
This poem really left an impression on us.

479
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,578
AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPETITIVE KARUTA

480
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:33,209
"Beyond Mount Oe" was composed on the spot
by a girl as a response to being mocked

481
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,836
for still being dependent on her parents.

482
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,383
"I stand on my own two feet

483
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:45,513
without the help of my parents," it means.

484
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,683
Did that girl

485
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,812
compose that poem

486
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,564
in order to reclaim her pride?

487
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,069
I… believe so.

488
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,330
And is she…

489
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,962
playing karuta…

490
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,385
to reclaim… herself?

491
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,306
Got it!

492
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,861
-Nice one, Chieri!
-Nice!

493
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
Nice, Miss Aizawa!

494
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,990
Let's take the next one too!

495
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,199
Yeah!

496
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,628
Wow.

497
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,465
This is fun!

498
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,011
I don't want it to be over.

499
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,433
Can this just last forever, please?

500
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,064
Maybe that's indulgent.

501
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,318
It is, isn't it?

502
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,532
Thank you.

503
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,410
-Adore win one!
-Nice!

504
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,080
Is this how

505
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,832
the club seniors felt?

506
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,338
And we're already

507
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,757
hurting so much.

508
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,055
Thank you.

509
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,848
Thank you.

510
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,186
-Adore, two wins!
-Nice!

511
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:01,190
I wish I could go back to that day
and punch myself.

512
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,863
Thank you.

513
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,534
I'm definitely being punished for it now.

514
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,036
-Three wins to Adore!
-Nice!

515
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,002
I should have invested more.

516
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,049
Like Miss Oe.

517
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,886
I should have invested in virtue.

518
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,950
THE MOON THAT NIGHT DID VANISH

519
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,210
Going round the path

520
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,004
If it is you whom I met

521
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,631
I cannot be sure

522
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,556
I wish I could have met you sooner.

523
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,643
Thank you.

524
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,605
Thank you.

525
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,773
Thank you.

526
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,112
Thank you.

527
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,407
-Four wins to Adore!
-Nice!

528
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,368
For behind a single cloud

529
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,873
The moon that night did vanish

530
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,246
Mom! Dad!

531
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,833
Thank you for coming.

532
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,462
Starting tomorrow…

533
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,426
Welcome home.

534
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,310
Welcome home, Meguru.

535
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,440
Okay.

536
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,443
I'm… home?

537
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,947
Welcome home.

538
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,837
Miss Oe.

539
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,802
Please take care…

540
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,682
of Meguru.

541
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,978
Teach her all the karuta

542
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,523
she wants to learn.

543
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,858
Please.

544
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,527
Are you sure?

545
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,572
We are.

546
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,785
Certainly.

547
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,248
I'll take good care of Miss Meguru.

548
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,003
Meguru!

549
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,715
-Yay!
-We did it, Mr. Shirano!

550
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,967
What a relief, Miss Aizawa!

551
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,844
Are you crying?

552
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,933
-We can keep playing together.
-Are you crying, Mr. Shirano?

553
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,852
What? No.

554
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:22,451
FINAL
MIZUSAWA VS. HOKUOH HIGH SCHOOL

555
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,670
Thank you.

556
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,131
Thank you.

557
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,591
One win to Mizusawa.

558
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,926
Nice!

559
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,720
He beat Hokuoh's vice-president
by more than ten cards.

560
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,846
That's crazy.

561
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,892
-Even Hokuoh is in trouble.
-Yes.

562
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,354
And we couldn't get
a single win against them.

563
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,316
The other regulars need to be
watched out for, not just Orie.

564
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,860
Yosuke Shinohara,

565
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,570
a sophomore B-class.

566
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,116
Dynamic takes that make use
of his frame are his weapon.

567
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,535
Miss Oto Yoshino.

568
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,580
An A-class sophomore,
she's Mizusawa's number two player.

569
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,333
Kota Niwano is B-class,

570
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,920
but as their only freshman regular,
he's not to be taken lightly.

571
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,340
Then there's Miss Nagi Tsukiura.

572
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,721
She's improved her game significantly
since that singles match.

573
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,981
So Mizusawa won it, as expected.

574
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:38,736
But if we're going to go to the All Japan,
we'll have to face them sooner or later.

575
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,030
Yep. We just have to practice
so we can catch up.

576
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,073
That's right.

577
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,241
Darn it!

578
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,161
-I left my towel.
-Huh?

579
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,496
Sorry. You go on ahead.
I'll go look for it.

580
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,581
All right.

581
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,689
Wrong one.

582
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,769
I think that's my towel.

583
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,729
Thank you.

584
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,695
Hey, Nagi!

585
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,405
Hurry up!

586
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,907
Okay.

587
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,543
So you play karuta, then?

588
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,341
Let's…

589
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,057
have a game sometime.

590
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,020
Going round the path

591
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,648
If it is you whom I met
I cannot be sure

592
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,652
For behind a single cloud
The moon that night did vanish

593
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,703
Just as she thought she saw
someone dear from her past,

594
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,663
they disappeared.

595
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:59,001
Just like the moon
being concealed by the clouds.

596
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,223
UMEZONO HIGH SCHOOL

597
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,729
Is that right?

598
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,649
How nice that Miss Aizawa
is staying in the club.

599
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,775
Yes.

600
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:28,780
I'll devote even more energy to my role
as club advisor from now on.

601
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:35,329
Actually, about that…

602
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,626
I'm afraid to inform you

603
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,131
that your contract with us
will be terminated after this year.

604
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,051
-What?
-Don't misunderstand.

605
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,136
It's not about the training camp.

606
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:53,680
It's nothing to do with that. It's--

607
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,933
-Yes?
-Excuse me.

608
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,769
Excuse me. Please, come in.

609
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,521
-I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
-No, no.

610
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:06,443
I was just about to talk
about you, Mr. Shima.

611
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,240
Mr. Shima here

612
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:17,871
is now going to be
returning from paternity leave.

613
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:22,459
Thankfully, I'm able to start work again
sooner than expected.

614
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,128
Thank you for covering for me.

615
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,838
Oh, not at all.

616
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,385
From the next academic year,

617
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,846
Mr. Shima will be resuming his duties,

618
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,601
including his role with the karuta club.

619
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,817
