1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,963
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,007
Would you like to play karuta with us?

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,468
At last. At last we have
five members, Miss Oe!

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,179
Now we can play team games.
Let's all go to Omi Shrine!

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,306
What was that all about?

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,393
When a game begins, I just get all dizzy.

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,394
Like the yips?

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,813
I'm thinking I could act as manager.

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,191
FALL STUDY CAMP
2–4 NOVEMBER

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,402
There's a study camp
over the long weekend in November.

11
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,279
So you can all improve even more,

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,948
I'm planning a karuta training camp
for the long weekend this fall.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,908
KARUTA CLUB TRAINING CAMP
2–4 NOVEMBER

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,120
2–4 NOVEMBER

15
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,414
What the hell?!

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,420
Man, I'm hungry.

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,131
After all those snacks you ate?

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,801
-What's this?
-Gotta have fireworks at training camp!

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,845
I've got rockets, and…

20
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,100
Is this school that's hosting us
a big deal, then?

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,520
Yeah. It's a powerhouse
rivalling the champions, Mizusawa.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,773
They're always vying for the top ranks.

23
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,943
Their karuta club may well have
the longest history in Tokyo.

24
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,655
I'm sure there'll be plenty
for you to learn from them.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,074
Right.

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,289
How much longer do we have to walk?

27
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,666
It's just past this shrine.

28
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,377
Let's go say hello to the god first.

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,587
Yes, Miss Oe.

30
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,469
Are you okay?

31
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,471
Thank you.

32
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,556
I always tell you to say
if you're frazzled.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,891
No, no.

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,812
If I can't play karuta,
I mustn't hassle you in any other way.

35
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,772
Why the vegetables?

36
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,941
That's a secret.

37
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,445
What was that?

38
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,822
A bird?

39
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,574
Deep in the mountains

40
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,952
Parting red leaves underfoot
Crying, a deer's voice

41
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,746
Imparts on me the sorrow
That always comes with autumn

42
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,374
That's right, Mr. Okuyama.

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,043
So that was a deer just now?

44
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,504
-Is that what deer sound like?
-Yes.

45
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,594
HOKUOH HIGH SCHOOL

46
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,054
We're finally here.

47
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,058
It really does look the part
for boys' boarding school dorms.

48
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,726
Listen up, guys.

49
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,187
For the next three days,

50
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,064
it'll be nothing but learning.

51
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,316
Let's steal whatever we can!

52
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,028
Okay, say it with me.

53
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,531
Let's go, Umezono!

54
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,366
-Come on.
-What's it like inside?

55
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,701
Yeah.

56
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,077
Huh?

57
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,663
Where were you all?

58
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,582
Hey.

59
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,543
Say it with me!

60
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,968
CHIHAYAFURU: FULL CIRCLE

61
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,149
Hello?

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,859
POEM FOUR:
DEEP IN THE MOUNTAINS

63
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh?

64
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,487
Is nobody here?

65
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,406
Louder!

66
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,866
Yes, sir!

67
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,117
Seventy-five!

68
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,493
Yes, sir!

69
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,553
HOKUOH

70
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,058
Kinashi!

71
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,812
-Long time no see, Miss Oe.
-It's been a while.

72
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,689
Thank you for letting us join you.

73
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,651
Umezono in the house, guys!

74
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,153
Fall in!

75
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,576
Greeting!

76
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,789
Welcome to Hokuoh High School
Competitive Karuta Club!

77
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,376
Thank you.

78
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,420
Sho Okuyama, club president.

79
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,304
Going for hill sprints, Mr. Lanky.

80
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,806
All right. Off you go.

81
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,935
-Hokuoh!
-Off you go.

82
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,979
What about introductions?

83
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,898
Now, you guys from Umezono
aren't to waste a second either.

84
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,316
Get changed in there.

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,776
Yes, sir.

86
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,821
-On the double!
-Yes, sir!

87
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,533
I'd expect no less of Hokuoh!
You've taken it to the next level.

88
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,912
We alumni take it in turns to supervise.

89
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,416
The spirit of Hokuoh lives forever!

90
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,835
Miss Oe?

91
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,546
The endurance to fight to the end!

92
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,348
The explosiveness to react!

93
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,813
Let's beat three seconds! Three!

94
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,274
The core strength to reach the cards.

95
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,400
Near Mount Arima

96
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,360
As Ina's bamboo grass fields
Rustle in the breeze

97
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,738
Shall I ever forget you?
I do not believe I will

98
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,871
Five sets of sweeping,
focusing on your abs.

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,050
And this will be the year
we shut our enemies at Mizusawa up!

100
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,634
Team games right after this.

101
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,303
-Yes, sir!
-What?

102
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,304
No break?

103
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,390
-It makes our training look like a joke.
-Let's rest.

104
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,148
This is the new Umezono's first team game.

105
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,068
There's something nice about that.

106
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,445
You call it a team game,

107
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,449
but isn't it basically
just four singles games?

108
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,455
It's basically just singles games,
you say?

109
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,414
Pardon?

110
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,500
It seems to me

111
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,669
that you don't understand team games.

112
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,517
Are you sure about him reading?

113
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,018
Yes.

114
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,687
He's a good reader.

115
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,816
Well, it works in our favor,

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,610
but it's the best of five to win it.

117
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,778
Play as normal.

118
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:47,031
So you'd stand a better chance
with five players.

119
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,994
To tell you the truth, there's
a particular reason he can't play.

120
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,207
Now please begin.

121
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,127
Let's have a good game.

122
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,926
In Naniwa Bay
Behold how the flower blooms

123
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,971
After winter's sleep

124
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,224
And now, with spring's arrival

125
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:17,145
It reveals its full glory

126
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,439
-Let's go, Hokuoh!
-Right!

127
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
What was that?

128
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,527
They're so loud.

129
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,656
And now, with spring's arrival

130
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,535
It reveals its full glory

131
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,040
Got it too!

132
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,126
So fast!

133
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,141
Next time.

134
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,395
Two in a row!

135
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,611
Nice! Still in the lead.

136
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,214
Another! Get a flow going!

137
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,382
Snatched it again!

138
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,218
I'm still leading!

139
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,264
So this is Hokuoh.

140
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,144
Let's all win again.

141
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,362
I knew playing with four would be tough.

142
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,338
Though the people know this place

143
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:12,218
As a mount of recluses

144
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,638
O thread of my life

145
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,807
If you must end, so be it

146
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,060
For should I survive

147
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,728
Thank you.

148
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,815
Hokuoh win four!

149
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,692
Nice!

150
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,195
HOKUOH A LOSSES: 0-4
UMEZONO LOSSES: 4-0

151
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,032
The new generation's just as strong.

152
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,410
Traditional schools have
a deep talent pool.

153
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,580
And Tokyo's full of guys like them.

154
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,916
Hokuoh's club president
is the one to watch out for.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,753
Is he the one I played?
Who was in the center, shouting?

156
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,671
Yes.

157
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,174
Both of his parents were top players.

158
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,093
He's a bona fide thoroughbred.

159
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,305
He was educated in karuta from a young age

160
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,266
and reached A-class
in his first year at middle school.

161
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,813
Along with Kenshin Orie of Mizusawa,
he's one of the top prospects.

162
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,399
So he is someone special.

163
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:13,487
He can't sleep with a different pillow,
so he brought his own here.

164
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,783
He doesn't like red bean paste,
so he only eats the skin of dorayaki.

165
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,369
And to keep his hair glossy,

166
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,247
he orders his favorite shampoo
from the salon.

167
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,917
Due to his smart aura,
Mr. Kuroda calls him Okita Soji--

168
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,002
Hold on.

169
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,838
You know way too much about him.

170
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,133
Well, Sho is
my younger brother, after all.

171
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,426
Huh?

172
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,804
Younger brother? What?
You mean you're twins?

173
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,224
What the hell? Why didn't you say before?

174
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,185
Well,

175
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,228
because you didn't ask?

176
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,946
DAD

177
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,493
Hello. What's up?

178
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,410
Meguru?

179
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,789
You forgot your electronic dictionary.
And your charger.

180
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,918
Um…

181
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,171
Right. It's fine. I can borrow one.

182
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,006
You can? That's good.

183
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,884
You didn't read my texts,
so I thought you must be busy,

184
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,719
but I didn't want you to be in a fix.

185
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,971
Right. Thanks.

186
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:27,269
Also, I don't think I'll be able to talk
on the phone or text while I'm here.

187
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,938
It's a schedule from hell.

188
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,775
I feel for you. Got it.

189
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,530
Class starts in a minute,
so I'll head back now.

190
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,532
Thanks again.

191
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,867
-What is it?
-Just come.

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,952
What is it?

193
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,537
Why, Haruma?

194
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,913
Why are you here?

195
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,542
Why? Because I'm a member
of Umezono Karuta Club.

196
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,918
You never told me that.

197
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,088
Well, you didn't ask.

198
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,091
There's that Haruma speak again.

199
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,262
-You're going home, then?
-Huh? What?

200
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,639
I can't have you here.

201
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,142
I'm Hokuoh's ace. The club president.

202
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:11,605
If I'm gonna lead that army in there,
I need to be the toughest at all times.

203
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,942
Plus, I told everyone
my whole family's A-class.

204
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,402
But I'm C-class.

205
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,319
Exactly.

206
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,364
There is no C-class Haruma.

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,326
I'll lose my standing if this gets out.

208
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,703
All right.

209
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:31,333
I promise not to tell anyone else
that I'm your big brother.

210
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,753
That way I can stay, right?

211
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,298
If they start suspecting,
you go straight home.

212
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,133
Got it.

213
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,779
As you heard,

214
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:05,075
please keep the twin thing a secret
from the Hokuoh people.

215
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,538
I think you're allowed

216
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,334
to be more angry
at your brother, though, Haru Bun.

217
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,961
There's no need for anger.

218
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,547
Sho is truly remarkable.

219
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,217
He was a great player
from such a young age.

220
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,221
I'm not sure
if that's relevant to anything.

221
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,765
Oh no! It's time I started making dinner.

222
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,850
-Let me--
-Don't be silly.

223
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,853
At least let me do this much.

224
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,898
I'm already such a nuisance to everyone.

225
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,275
I couldn't even play in the team game.

226
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,694
Now, then…

227
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,668
You sure are a good reader, Miss Oe.

228
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,294
-It caught me off guard.
-No, no.

229
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,713
Have you taken your grading?

230
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,716
You always seemed
to put effort into reading.

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,222
Well, between family stuff,
finding a job, and COVID,

232
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,890
it ended up on the back burner.

233
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,517
I get that.

234
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,395
But it's a waste to leave it like that.

235
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,022
Maybe so.

236
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,986
Something smells good. Garlic?

237
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,656
Oh no!

238
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,949
Ow! Huh? Miss Oe?

239
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,954
I'm so sorry I left it all to you!

240
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,707
No, not at all. It's fine. I'm used to it.

241
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,667
No, we can't have that.

242
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,461
Now, tell me whatever you need me to do.

243
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,007
May I leave this onion to you, then?

244
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,258
Of course you may.

245
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,302
-If you'd be so kind.
-Right.

246
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,762
-Dice it?
-Yes, please.

247
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,225
You dice the veggies in your curry, then?

248
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,979
No. I'm actually a chunky veggie person.

249
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,063
Oh?

250
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,444
My little brother's eating with us today,
so I'm making his favorite keema curry.

251
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,157
-Aren't you the considerate big brother?
-No, not at all.

252
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
Was it circumstances like these

253
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,596
that inspired "Deep in the mountains"
1,000 years ago?

254
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,558
As the poet walked over a silent mountain?

255
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:40,522
Did you interpret it as a person
who's walking, Mr. Okuyama?

256
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,150
Is that wrong?

257
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,697
In waka, where a poem is separated
can change its meaning.

258
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,415
Deep in the mountains

259
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,001
Parting red leaves underfoot

260
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,670
Crying, a deer's voice

261
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,172
Imparts on me the sorrow

262
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,882
That always comes with autumn

263
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
In this poem,

264
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,680
if we break after
"parting red leaves underfoot,"

265
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,683
then it's a person who's walking.

266
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,396
If we break after
"crying, a deer's voice,"

267
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,482
then who is it who's walking?

268
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,651
The deer!

269
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,111
That's right!

270
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,071
That makes sense!

271
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:34,410
Being able to read so few words
in so many ways is waka's appeal.

272
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,703
It is.

273
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,999
I thought I knew a thing or two
about this,

274
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,542
but you're something else.

275
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,043
You're too kind.

276
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,294
So, Mr. Okuyama,

277
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,966
you're a chunky veggie person, you say?

278
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,967
I am.

279
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,679
Hokuoh win four!

280
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,680
Hokuoh win four.

281
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,015
Hokuoh win four!

282
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,391
Nice!

283
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,107
They thrashed us.

284
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,110
I feel bad for letting Hokuoh down.

285
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,611
What makes them different?

286
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,573
They're so different,
I don't know where to begin.

287
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,742
Why do they yell so much?

288
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,493
I couldn't shout that loud.

289
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,831
There are only four of us. I think
our problems begin before the yelling.

290
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,042
We need to do something.

291
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,796
Huh? What's up, Haru Bun?

292
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,049
Oh, nothing.

293
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,178
Everyone! Dinner's ready!

294
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,929
Thank you!

295
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,848
Thank you!

296
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,810
I got seconds!

297
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,438
This keema curry's crazy good.

298
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,940
I never knew curry could taste like this.

299
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,528
Everyone! There's plenty more
for second helpings!

300
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,989
Thank you!

301
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,992
-Big helping, please.
-Sure.

302
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:01,872
OKUYAMA

303
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,415
-There you are.
-"Okuyama."

304
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,716
All right! We've finished tidying up.

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,135
-Just baths then bed now.
-Yes.

306
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,806
-There are fireworks.
-No, we're not doing that now.

307
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,352
Let's go, Hokuoh!

308
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,317
Huh? They're still practicing?

309
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:36,824
At Hokuoh, we all do chores like sorting
the cards and cleaning the mats together.

310
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,410
My mother taught me
that little actions like this

311
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,539
can build into something bigger
and bless me later.

312
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,043
You might call it investing in virtue,
Miss Aizawa!

313
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,088
Investing in virtue?

314
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,678
It's kind of amazing, this sense of unity.

315
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,432
Team games are most certainly not
just a bunch of singles games.

316
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,310
We work together outside of games,

317
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,189
coordinate with
and understand one another.

318
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,986
By doing so, each individual
can push past their limits.

319
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:20,617
A C-class beating an A-class
is by no means unusual in a team game.

320
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,911
Low conquers high.

321
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,667
That's what makes team games interesting.

322
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,548
Low conquers high.

323
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,092
Indeed.

324
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,346
Excuse me.

325
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,729
Would you mind letting us do it?

326
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,940
Please.

327
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,652
Please.

328
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,990
Do we use seven?

329
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,284
Yeah. Zero, one, three, four, and seven.

330
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,243
Right.

331
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,288
-I've finished this one.
-You're done already?

332
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,123
Please help me, Haruma.

333
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,583
-Sure.
-Thanks.

334
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,838
-Follow the grain of the mats.
-Okay.

335
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,260
All right, this is the last one!

336
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,637
Everybody coordinate.

337
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
Three, two, one!

338
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,646
I'm beat.

339
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,236
So it's not just about the matches, huh?

340
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,405
We didn't play as a team today.

341
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,868
Tomorrow, we're gonna
put up a good fight for sure.

342
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,370
Yeah?

343
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,085
-You too, Haruma.
-No, no.

344
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,295
I'm not a player.

345
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,214
That doesn't matter.

346
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,340
That's right.

347
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,941
DAD

348
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,361
HAPPY STUDYING!
DON'T WORRY ABOUT REPLYING

349
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:30,789
I'M SORRY

350
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,968
-I'm back.
-Hi.

351
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,054
What's this?

352
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,516
Oh yeah. I was gonna talk to you
about that when you got home, Toko.

353
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,726
GRADE: D
DEVIATION VALUE: 63.2

354
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,436
Oh boy. Lib arts are through the floor.

355
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,481
-Let's talk to the cram school, maybe.
-The bath's ready.

356
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,169
You okay?

357
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,879
Sorry.

358
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:33,060
There really is something sad
about a deer's cry, isn't there?

359
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,645
Like in "Deep in the mountains."

360
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,898
Yes.

361
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,363
Separated from the rest of its herd,
a deer cries out in loneliness.

362
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,367
That's one interpretation of the poem.

363
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,328
Is that right?

364
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:59,044
I wonder if the one crying just now
was separated from its herd as well?

365
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,969
What? She's not at the study camp?

366
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,723
What do you mean?

367
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,435
Well, she's actually been absent a lot
as of late

368
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,563
and canceled the camp at the last minute,

369
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,109
so we've been concerned ourselves.

370
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,362
I see. Thank you.

371
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,115
Yes. I understand.

372
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,325
Okay. Goodbye.

373
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,703
Where is she?

374
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,664
She won't answer the phone.

375
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,291
She's not reading texts.

376
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,670
The police!

377
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,383
Meguru's a high-schooler now.

378
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,385
It's not like back then.

379
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,430
Let's wait a little longer.

380
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,557
Yeah?

381
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,436
Hokuoh win four.

382
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,271
Nice!

383
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,607
-Let's take a break.
-Yes, sir!

384
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,068
Thank you.

385
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:14,035
This feels more like teaching a class
than getting some practice, huh?

386
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,163
Keep your voice down, Sho.

387
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,166
I said it out loud on purpose.

388
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,379
Sho, there's something written
on that bottle.

389
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,091
HARUMA

390
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,427
Cute handwriting.

391
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,555
-You got a kid brother or something?
-Huh?

392
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
Well, yeah.

393
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,146
I bet he's a solid karuta player.

394
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,939
Of course he is.

395
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,150
He's an Okuyama, after all.

396
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,653
Haruma.

397
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,615
Yes? What is it?

398
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:56,328
He's a Haruma too, right?
Don't know his family name though.

399
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,247
It's Okuyama.

400
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,707
What?

401
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,920
Well, it was written on his bandana, see.

402
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,717
Talk about a coincidence!

403
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,969
That's crazy.

404
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,231
I've been thinking about this for a while,

405
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,276
but let's look for another member
once we're back in Tokyo.

406
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,278
Huh?

407
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,573
Carrying on like this
is just too reckless.

408
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,494
We can't expect to win team games
with just four people.

409
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,705
And the Musashino Tournament is coming up.

410
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,748
Then Haruma can--

411
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,791
I mean,

412
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,378
I'd also like to play with Haru Bun
if possible.

413
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,631
But there's only so much time
till the Tokyo qualifier,

414
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,301
and I'm not sure we can afford
to just sit around hoping

415
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:58,306
that Haru Bun's dizziness
will be cured at some point.

416
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
For sure.

417
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,938
You might be right, Sota.

418
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,486
This can't have been an easy decision
for you to make.

419
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,299
Haruma.

420
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,511
Go home like you promised.

421
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,596
Huh?

422
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,850
-I didn't tell anyone else.
-It's still gonna come out.

423
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:47,188
-But--
-You're a nuisance to Umezono too.

424
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,983
-What?
-Come on, man.

425
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,360
You can't even play matches.

426
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,448
And they're trying their damnedest
with just four people.

427
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,452
You must know how tough it is
to win three games with four players.

428
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,622
They're so admirable it makes me cry.

429
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,875
Don't you feel bad at all?

430
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,297
I feel… really bad.

431
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,509
What Umezono really want
isn't a damn manager.

432
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,678
It's a fifth player!

433
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,557
Read between the lines.

434
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,812
They're all just too nice to say it.

435
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,902
I see.

436
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:39,658
I suppose… you're right.

437
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,497
Okay, back to it!

438
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,374
-Right.
-Okay.

439
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,796
Huh? The reader's not here.

440
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,466
Where'd Haruma go?

441
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,302
Sota.

442
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,390
-Have you seen Haruma?
-Huh? He wasn't in the bathroom.

443
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,601
-That's weird.
-Huh?

444
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,773
Haru Bun!

445
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,693
Hey! Haruma!

446
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,197
Haru Bun!

447
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,951
Mr. Okuyama?

448
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,162
Haru Bun?

449
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,679
Where could he have gone?

450
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,889
Did you find him?

451
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,103
Sota?

452
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,403
"I'm sorry I didn't realize.
I've been a nuisance."

453
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,780
I HOPE YOU FIND A NEW MEMBER
AND GO ON TO GREATER THINGS.

454
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,365
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

455
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
I'm sorry, Haru Bun.

456
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,203
I'm sorry, everyone.

457
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,832
-There's no need for that.
-It's not your fault.

458
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,709
That's right, Sota.

459
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,379
He could still be nearby.

460
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,839
I'll go and check.

461
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,137
I'll take another look around.

462
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,306
-Yeah.
-Go sit down, Sota.

463
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,033
Can I have a word?

464
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,086
Change the practice schedule?

465
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,965
Yeah. We'll forget the team games
and do singles instead today.

466
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,383
-Huh?
-What?

467
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,178
I mean, there are only four of you,

468
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,931
so team games are worthless to us.

469
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,724
-You can't be serious.
-Wait.

470
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,977
That's just rude.

471
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,897
-They have a right to practice too.
-No.

472
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,274
We're talking about beating Mizusawa here.

473
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,693
-We don't have time for this.
-All the same…

474
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,238
What, then? Keep playing a team of four?

475
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,710
SOTA:
WHERE ARE YOU, HARU BUN?!

476
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,128
CHIERI:
PICK UP, HARUMA

477
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,006
MEGURU: WHERE ARE YOU, HARU BUN?
WE'RE ALL WORRIED

478
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,803
CHIERI
SOTA

479
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,763
FUKI
MEGURU AIZAWA

480
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,692
-We'll train together--
-This isn't training--

481
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,777
Excuse me.

482
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,905
Aizawa? What is it?

483
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,576
You know something about it, don't you?

484
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,203
About Haru Bun leaving.

485
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,581
I mean,

486
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:16,916
he is your--

487
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,001
Whoa, hold on.

488
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,461
He is your big brother, after all.

489
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,563
Mr. Okuyama?

490
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,608
Miss Oe.

491
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,572
There are… lots of different ways
to interpret poems, aren't there?

492
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,868
Including "Deep in the mountains."

493
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,746
Yes. That's right.

494
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,918
I always wondered if,

495
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,254
deep in those mountains,

496
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,633
it really was just a deer

497
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:12,013
that was crying out of loneliness.

498
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,774
Miss Oe.

499
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,949
I…

500
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,207
CHIERI

501
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,333
Where'd you go, dummy?

502
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,710
I said to say if you get frazzled.

503
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,756
What am I supposed to do without you?

504
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,174
I'm sorry, Haru Bun.

505
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,052
We'd be lost without the Karuta Professor.

506
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,099
You've taught me so much.

507
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,893
I want to pay you back somehow.

508
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,187
Come back, Haruma.

509
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,149
You said before

510
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,610
that there's no need to rush.

511
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,698
We'll wait as long as it takes.

512
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,908
Let's play karuta!

513
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,622
All five of us together.

514
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,964
Haruma gave up fighting
when he couldn't beat me anymore.

515
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,716
Haruma

516
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,760
doesn't want to fight anyone.

517
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,179
He just wants to be helpful.

518
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,391
His brother should understand that.

519
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,977
It's you who doesn't understand.

520
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,646
If you want to be helpful in karuta,

521
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,065
winning is everything.

522
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,695
Did you say something to Haru Bun?

523
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:57,160
He can't play matches. What difference
does it make if he's here or not?

524
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,122
Seriously.

525
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,543
Let's start stretching, everyone.

526
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,923
Then singles games. Let's get ready.

527
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,634
All right.

528
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,219
Come on, let's go.

529
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,058
Yes, sir.

530
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,784
Please…

531
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,666
please let me play karuta too!

532
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,216
Is it all right

533
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,886
if I join you?

534
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,891
Of course it is!

535
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,440
-You're drenched!
-We were waiting.

536
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,443
Haruma. I'm sorry.

537
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,365
We can't play a team game together
without you here.

538
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,616
That's right.

539
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,744
I'm sorry I kept you.

540
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,498
Thank you.

541
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,333
Okay, then.

542
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,379
Now there are five of you, there's
no reason not to play a team game.

543
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,880
Let's do it.

544
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,384
Right!

545
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,569
Please deal the cards.

546
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,113
Let's have a good game.

547
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,580
You're not taking a single hand.

548
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,684
Haruma.

549
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,270
Don't push yourself.

550
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,024
I'm fine.

551
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,111
I want to push myself.

552
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:45,203
In Naniwa Bay
Behold how the flower blooms

553
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,997
After winter's sleep

554
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,375
And now, with spring's arrival

555
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,713
It reveals its full glory

556
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,923
Let's go, Hokuoh!

557
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,466
Right!

558
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,970
And now, with spring's arrival

559
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:08,559
It reveals its full glory

560
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,109
-Keep this going, Hokuoh.
-Right!

561
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,117
See? You were better off quitting.

562
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,675
One hand.

563
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,762
Just one hand.

564
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,058
I do not lament

565
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,436
From a moonstruck reverie
But I blame these tears

566
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,080
That's ten in a row.

567
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,495
Haru Bun!

568
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,291
Let's go!

569
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,840
That's the first time they've yelled.

570
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,926
Let's go, Haruma!

571
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,553
Go for it, Haruma!

572
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,639
The next one's yours, Haru Bun.

573
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,727
Guys!

574
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,789
Let's go, Umezono!

575
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,874
Right!

576
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,089
You think that's gonna make you win?

577
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,758
No.

578
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,594
All I want to do…

579
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,682
is win against myself.

580
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,077
I wonder if the one crying just now
was separated from its herd as well?

581
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,203
CRYING, A DEER'S VOICE

582
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,956
That one will be just fine now.

583
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:22,253
Because it found the courage
to cry out, "Here I am!"

584
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,510
I'm sure its voice will be heard.

585
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,138
Heard by whom?

586
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,896
Its new friends.

587
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,025
Then may the waves overcome

588
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,905
Suenomatsuyama

589
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,250
Deep in the mountains
Parting red leaves underfoot

590
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,502
Crying, a deer's voice

591
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,172
Got it!

592
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:09,967
I got it!

593
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,219
Nice!

594
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,391
I took it too.

595
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,517
Me too!

596
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,852
-Me too.
-Got it too.

597
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:20,853
Nice!

598
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,695
Got it!

599
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,405
-I see.
-The streak's on!

600
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,490
Nice!

601
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,991
So that's how it works.

602
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,620
And another. Let's take the next one too.

603
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,787
Right!

604
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,585
These shouts aren't something you force.

605
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,961
They just come out!

606
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,508
Let's go, Umezono!

607
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,675
Right!

608
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,183
Low can conquer high in team games.

609
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,935
And that means…

610
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,900
strength you can't muster on your own
can be brought out by others.

611
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,276
Me too.

612
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,736
Nice!

613
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,946
Team games

614
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,114
are amazing!

615
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,037
Thank you.

616
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,288
Thank you.

617
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,668
Thank you.

618
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,419
Thank you.

619
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,218
-Hokuoh. Let's break that down.
-Right.

620
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,595
That was amazing!

621
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,597
You okay?

622
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,765
Way to go, Haruma.

623
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,310
You played a whole game, Haruma!

624
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,522
It's thanks to all of you.

625
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,440
You did great.

626
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,527
-We all got "Deep in the mountains."
-Yeah.

627
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,280
Sorry about before, guys.

628
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,285
He really is my big brother.

629
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,413
Just for the record.

630
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,593
-Really?
-Everyone.

631
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,305
You were magnificent!

632
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,432
Thank you.

633
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,809
Miss Oe.

634
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:29,273
Thanks to you,
my dizziness has improved a little.

635
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,067
Thank you.

636
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,869
My pleasure.

637
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,666
And thank you.

638
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,795
KOMANO PHARMACY

639
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,507
Is that right?
You're working hard at a training camp?

640
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,884
That takes me back.

641
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:02,389
And about that movie we were
going to see together next week.

642
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,851
Could we make it the following week?

643
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,771
Of course. Why though?

644
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:13,233
There's… a karuta reading seminar
that day.

645
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,069
Huh?

646
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,404
You mean…?

647
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:24,411
I'm thinking… of taking another shot
at being a professional reader.

648
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,373
I see.

649
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,708
You're starting over?

650
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:37,424
Seeing those kids, it makes me
realize I have to go for them too.

651
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,344
The things I've left undone.

652
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,304
Right.

653
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,307
Good luck, Kana.

654
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,143
Yeah.

655
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,120
Come to think of it…

656
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,413
What?

657
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,711
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
COMPETITIVE KARUTA CLUB

658
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:19,591
Well, I didn't think it was worth
bringing up before, but…

659
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,009
Yes?

660
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,991
Sorry, Chieri.

661
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,635
STRAWBERRY MILK

662
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,473
NATURAL MINERAL WATER

663
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,809
I pressed the wrong one!

664
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,860
You're up.

665
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,740
And you, Shirano?

666
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,283
Oh, I just…

667
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,498
heard the stars out here were beautiful.

668
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,209
Stars?

669
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,673
I can't see a single one.

670
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,841
Nope.

671
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,512
It was worth coming, then.

672
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:47,930
Huh?

673
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,563
Oh?

674
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,190
You always drink water.

675
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,025
I pressed the wrong button.

676
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,446
Wanna swap, then?

677
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,656
What?

678
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,033
I like those, believe it or not.

679
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,578
Here. One man's trash.

680
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,998
Thanks.

681
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,794
Looking back, though,

682
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,590
all we've done at this camp
is play karuta.

683
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,968
Like, was it worth the long trip?

684
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,386
Exactly.

685
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,890
Even so, for some reason,

686
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,435
I feel like I'll never forget it.

687
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:43,318
Even those stars we couldn't see.

688
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,956
I doubt I'll forget it too.

689
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,047
There you are! What are you doing here?

690
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,173
Huh? Why…?

691
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,926
I woke up, and you weren't there.

692
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,345
-I was looking for you.
-You're all up too?

693
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,389
For the fireworks.

694
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,558
-We forgot to do them, didn't we?
-Yeah.

695
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,519
We found an open space over there.
Shall we?

696
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,313
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

697
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,398
What have you got in there again?

698
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,068
Huh?

699
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,280
I thought you didn't like sweet stuff.

700
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,824
Well,

701
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,452
I guess you wouldn't know.

702
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,370
Huh?

703
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,040
What? There are no hebidama in here.

704
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,000
What are hebidama?

705
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,836
You might be surprised at what I like.

706
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,346
Huh? What do you mean? Sweet stuff?

707
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,444
Crap! Meguru!

708
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,655
Meguru! We overslept!

709
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,156
Wake up!

710
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,786
What happened to my alarm?
And what time is it?

711
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,163
Hold on.

712
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,290
It's not charged!

713
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,877
Sorry! I thought you had enough,
so I switched them.

714
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,462
Miss Aizawa? I'm coming in.

715
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,838
Okay.

716
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:31,969
Huh?

717
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,637
Mom?

718
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,559
Toko!

719
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,900
