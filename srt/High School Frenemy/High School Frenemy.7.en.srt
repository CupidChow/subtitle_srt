1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,856
If we don’t expel this kid named Shin,

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:03,747
the parents will take action against the school.

3
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:05,856
Are you a student or a thug?

4
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:07,202
You only know how to use violence.

5
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,649
This is what they call a delinquent,

6
00:00:08,678 --> 00:00:10,336
If someone like me is a delinquent.

7
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,347
Then what does that make

8
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,605
a piece of trash like you?

9
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:14,663
Even if you don't want me to fight them,

10
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,074
you can punch them on my behalf.

11
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,072
I'm glad you didn't fight them.

12
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,072
I could protect you.

13
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:33,812
What the hell are you talking about?

14
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:40,343
Shin.

15
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:42,816
Let’s skip school.

16
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:46,532
What are you doing?

17
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:49,245
If I go into the class looking like this,

18
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:50,860
there could be a problem.

19
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,940
You might also get into trouble.

20
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:54,932
I don’t care.

21
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,732
Shin is really here.

22
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:02,125
Shin, Miss Jan told me to come and get you.

23
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,842
Saint, what happened?

24
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,238
Who hurt you?

25
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,232
You again, Shin?

26
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:10,918
You misunderstand him.

27
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:13,856
He didn’t hurt me.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,398
Why are you so protective of him?

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,172
Why are you so submissive to him?

30
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,758
I’m telling you the truth.

31
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:20,729
Shin didn’t do it.

32
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:24,940
Yes, I did it. Why?

33
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:26,162
Do you have a problem with me?

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,162
Yes.

35
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,114
Fight me one on one.

36
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:35,362
I’d rather skip school.

37
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,256
Why are you running away?

38
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,252
Shin, don’t do it.

39
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,929
Shin, I’m coming with you.

40
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,107
I’m coming too.

41
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,972
What should we do?

42
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,118
Our class president skips school.

43
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:05,558
THE IMPORTANT FRIEND

44
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,289
Do we need to make a big deal out of it?

45
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,638
Principal firmly told me that

46
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:15,020
our school must be free of violent students.

47
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,456
I know this boy well.

48
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,543
Last year, Naruebet was fighting

49
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,369
with Udon Pithak students almost every day.

50
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,627
Now, he’s involved with a mafia gang.

51
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,249
We need to get rid of him.

52
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,092
Get rid of him?

53
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,460
Isn’t it too harsh?

54
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,354
No.

55
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,267
The survey clearly shows that

56
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,311
Thep Burapha classmates are afraid of him.

57
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:45,500
But the survey isn’t enough to expel a student.

58
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,852
I know that.

59
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,296
Tomorrow, I’ll interview students of Class 2

60
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:51,180
one by one.

61
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:58,663
Is it true that Shin bullies other classmates?

62
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,834
Yes.

63
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:04,452
I saw him force Saint to be his gofer.

64
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:06,743
Shin seems to really hate Saint.

65
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,162
Did you force him to do it?

66
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:09,638
He did it on his own.

67
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,612
Kids from Udon Pithak especially Shin

68
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:13,958
always have problems with other students.

69
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,100
I was hit by him. If you don’t believe me,

70
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,634
you can ask other students.

71
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:18,278
Did you provoke him first?

72
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,914
Miss Wimol told me

73
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,332
that he pushed you to the ground?

74
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,431
Is it true?

75
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,271
It was an accident.

76
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,987
Whether he did it intentionally or not,

77
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,871
his action was an act of violence.

78
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,685
I heard that he killed someone.

79
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,802
You’ve been helping Naruebet.

80
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,031
It seems you were close friends.

81
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,249
Why now he hates you so much?

82
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:42,191
Your classmates said he often hurt you.

83
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,398
Is that true?

84
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:44,627
No.

85
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,162
Is the wound on your face caused by him?

86
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,085
That’s…

87
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,442
Has he been threatening you?

88
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:54,183
Is he acting like a leader of a gang?

89
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,431
You can believe whatever you want.

90
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,067
I told you I didn’t do it.

91
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,398
It was nothing.

92
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,082
Why does Thamnithit always help you?

93
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,187
How would I know that?

94
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,714
I just want to be good to him.

95
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:07,754
That’s all.

96
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,009
Why do you want to be good to him?

97
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,442
Shin and I,

98
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,845
we were best friends.

99
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,242
Aren’t you two friends anymore?

100
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,242
He’s not my friend.

101
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,129
He’s my best friend.

102
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:47,652
I told you he’s not my friend.

103
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,652
Shin, can we talk?

104
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,652
Are you playing a victim now?

105
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:06,772
Shin.

106
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,322
What the hell do you want from me?

107
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,394
Shin, stop it.

108
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,271
If you have another fight,

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,616
you can be expelled.

110
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:20,576
I don’t care.

111
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,558
They already think I’m a bad guy.

112
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,900
Shit. They are going to have a fight.

113
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:31,682
Let’s tell the teacher.

114
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,922
Shin, don’t do it.

115
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,696
Shin, stop it.

116
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,863
If you keep doing this,

117
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,369
you will be expelled.

118
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:42,365
Fine.

119
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,362
I want to be expelled.

120
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:45,842
F♪ck you, Saint.

121
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,282
Shin.

122
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:48,496
Shin.

123
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:49,965
Shin.

124
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:50,649
Shin.

125
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:51,602
Shin.

126
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:53,645
Shin, stop it.

127
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:54,707
Shin, stop it.

128
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:55,587
Shin.

129
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,129
Stop it.

130
00:06:58,302 --> 00:06:58,991
Hey.

131
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,874
Shin, stop it.

132
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:01,580
Stop it.

133
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,071
Can’t you listen to me for once?

134
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,442
I said stop it.

135
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,358
Stop it.

136
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:07,551
Shin, stop it.

137
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,282
Naruebet.

138
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:10,889
Naruebet!

139
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:14,358
Stop it.

140
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,602
I said stop it.

141
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:17,289
Stop it.

142
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:17,936
Hey.

143
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:18,823
Miss Jan.

144
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:22,183
Miss Jan.

145
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:27,049
What the hell are you doing?'

146
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:32,627
Are you hurt?

147
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,969
Why are you doing this?

148
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,183
Don’t you want to graduate high school?

149
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,114
It’s not your business.

150
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:29,980
But I’m worried about you.

151
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:31,871
You have no right to worry about me.

152
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:35,862
How many times do I need to apologize

153
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:37,914
for you to forgive me?

154
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,303
Stop trying.

155
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,332
You’re wasting your time.

156
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,951
Don’t act like you don’t remember.

157
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,354
You ruined my life.

158
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,342
Why are you so sure…

159
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,022
if you are being nice to me,

160
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:06,205
protecting me and apologizing to me,

161
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:09,951
then I will forgive you?

162
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,132
Don’t tell anyone again

163
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,662
that we were best friends.

164
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:32,089
Friends don’t ruin their friend’s life.

165
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:32,314
Don’t overuse your wrist in the meantime.

166
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:40,467
How are you, Miss Jan?

167
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,067
Is the injury serious?

168
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:46,009
How dare these kids hurt the teacher?

169
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,652
They all should be expelled.

170
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:49,740
I’m okay.

171
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:51,551
It was an accident.

172
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:54,198
Even though it was an accident,

173
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,409
it shouldn’t have happened.

174
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:01,129
This makes Shin’s situation even worse.

175
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:04,147
He’s acting like a leader of thugs.

176
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:07,049
Assaulting a teacher is a big deal.

177
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,834
You two need to stop protecting this boy.

178
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:12,889
I’ll tell the principal to expel Naruebet.

179
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,340
He deserves it.

180
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,187
If we let this slide,

181
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,100
I’m not sure what he will do next time.

182
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:22,002
Vice Principal,

183
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,452
I’m asking you to give him another chance.

184
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,212
I’m sure that he didn’t mean to hurt me.

185
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,300
Shin is not a bad kid.

186
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,351
It’s not my call.

187
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,740
Principal Praphada will make the final decision.

188
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,838
Jan, you should reconsider it.

189
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:49,063
Yes.

190
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,547
Reconsider it.

191
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,038
Does it hurt?

192
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:10,271
I’m okay.

193
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:52,591
Can you tell me why you were fighting?

194
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,991
I want to help you.

195
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,780
But if you tell me nothing,

196
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:09,180
I don’t know how to help you.

197
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:16,831
How is your wrist?

198
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:23,267
It hurts.

199
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,714
I’m sorry.

200
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:38,096
Thank you for worrying about me.

201
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:42,176
But next time, can you stop fighting?

202
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,085
Yes.

203
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:04,045
Can I ask you something?

204
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,278
You pretend to hate and fight each other.

205
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,976
But I can feel that deep down

206
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,354
you don’t hate each other.

207
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,594
Am I right?

208
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,592
You don’t need to answer me.

209
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:39,034
But as a result of what happened,

210
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:43,274
you two will be suspended for one week.

211
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:53,645
In the meantime, you should take distance.

212
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:56,111
Don’t have another fight.

213
00:14:58,672 --> 00:14:59,623
This is my request.

214
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:48,249
Why do you look so down?

215
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,474
You got suspended, didn’t you?

216
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,671
You like boxing.

217
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:03,696
I’m fine with it.

218
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,147
But if you like brawling,

219
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,449
I’m not okay with it.

220
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:19,660
I want you to focus more on school.

221
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:23,652
Work hard and get good grades.

222
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,307
Then you will get a better chance in life.

223
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:28,838
In the future,

224
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,762
you won’t have to sell noodles like me.

225
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:33,769
Do you hear me?

226
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:37,492
I’m sorry.

227
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,432
I didn’t mean it to end up this way.

228
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:54,103
You already got suspended.

229
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:57,703
There’s nothing we can do.

230
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,692
Forget it.

231
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,387
If you’re hungry, go get something to eat.

232
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,707
I already prepared a meal for you.

233
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:20,576
Thank you, Dad

234
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:24,132
Aren’t you hungry?

235
00:17:25,332 --> 00:17:25,965
Yes.

236
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:26,954
Then go eat.

237
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:54,329
[Saint]

238
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,300
How was your class? Did you enjoy it?

239
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:05,340
Yes.

240
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,285
Are you hungry?

241
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:07,405
Yes.

242
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:08,707
What do you want to eat?

243
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:09,776
Noodles.

244
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,463
You want to eat noodles?

245
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:13,798
What kind of noodles?

246
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:14,787
Rice noodles.

247
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:15,834
Rice noodles?

248
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:20,620
Okay, I’ll buy you a big bowl.

249
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:36,445
[I want to talk to you.]

250
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,660
I want to talk to you.

251
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,929
Miss Jan told us to take our distance.

252
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:32,925
Are you going to school tomorrow?

253
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,322
That’s none of your business.

254
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,663
You need to go.

255
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:39,754
Otherwise, I’ll beat you.

256
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,832
You came here to tell me that?

257
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:58,380
Yes. That’s what I’m here for.

258
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,009
I just want to see your face.

259
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,682
Girls.

260
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,478
Big news. Do you hear the rumor about Shin?

261
00:21:38,242 --> 00:21:40,445
I heard that Principal Praphada

262
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:42,132
is going to expel Shin from school.

263
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:47,274
Expel Shin? Are you sure?

264
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:49,272
I don’t know. People are buzzing about it.

265
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:51,565
I overheard Miss Wimol talking to Miss Ning.

266
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:52,649
Good.

267
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,038
Otherwise, there will be a fight every day.

268
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,136
I’m sick of it.

269
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:58,365
I’m not surprised if he will be expelled.

270
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,772
He always throws a fist at everyone.

271
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,372
Saint.

272
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:07,572
What’s up?

273
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,311
Is Shin being expelled?

274
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:14,743
I don’t know the final decision.

275
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:17,922
His situation is not looking good.

276
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:22,125
There’s a high chance that he will be expelled.

277
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,754
If I can fix the misunderstandings

278
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:26,947
my classmates have about him,

279
00:22:28,712 --> 00:22:30,445
he won’t be expelled, right?

280
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,329
Don’t think it’s hard.

281
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:39,907
It’s very easy.

282
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,740
You just need to write sentences

283
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:42,682
that are rhyming.

284
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:44,722
Let’s give it a try.

285
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,663
Come up with a short poem.

286
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,951
Just five lines.

287
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:51,151
It doesn’t have to be the same story.

288
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:54,183
You can write about your experience.

289
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:59,143
When learning the Thai language,

290
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:00,925
don’t worry about making mistakes.

291
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:04,314
All you need to do is have the courage

292
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,052
to use and speak it.

293
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:14,300
I’ll do it.

294
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:19,871
Yes.

295
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:22,212
But I’m not writing a poem.

296
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,423
I just have something to tell everyone.

297
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,576
Sure.

298
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,027
Say what you want.

299
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:52,518
When he was 16,

300
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,722
his dream was to become a soccer player.

301
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:03,972
I was the leader of a gang.

302
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:06,845
I often caused brawls.

303
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:10,662
I was proud of my nickname ‘Tsunami’.

304
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:12,692
I was never defeated.

305
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:17,820
I told him to join my gang.

306
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,812
I wanted him to be my right-hand man.

307
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,692
But he really loved soccer.

308
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:33,645
In every game he played,

309
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:35,871
he always scored a goal.

310
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,862
His coach told him

311
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,362
if he wanted to join the national team,

312
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,209
he needed to leave my gang.

313
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:55,863
He needed to stop getting in a fight.

314
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:09,609
So I told him if he wanted to leave the gang,

315
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:20,242
he would be beaten by us.

316
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,165
He needed to endure it.

317
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:48,074
Are you sure?

318
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:57,376
Yes.

319
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:06,772
Fine.

320
00:26:09,562 --> 00:26:11,172
Then you need to follow the rule.

321
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,263
(Don’t act like you don’t remember.)

322
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,311
(You ruined my life.)

323
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,369
If you want to leave the gang,

324
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:58,423
you need to endure this.

325
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,369
F♪ck you, Shin.

326
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:02,285
Watch this.

327
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:03,791
If you want to leave the gang,

328
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:05,485
this is what will happen to you.

329
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:21,420
Shin, you’re assh♪le.

330
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,742
Shin, will you give up?

331
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:32,082
Ouch!

332
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:46,292
Shin.

333
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:50,823
Ambulance.

334
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,634
Call an ambulance.

335
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:54,460
Call an ambulance!

336
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:56,569
Go! Now!

337
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,142
(Why are you so sure…

338
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,792
(if you are being nice to me,

339
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:38,932
( protecting me and apologizing to me, )

340
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:43,987
(then I will forgive you?)

341
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:48,252
(Don’t tell anyone again)

342
00:28:48,954 --> 00:28:50,952
(that we were best friends.)

343
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:57,711
(Friends don’t ruin their friend’s life.)

344
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,951
I was too rough on him.

345
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:08,125
I broke his leg.

346
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,692
He couldn’t play soccer anymore.

347
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:28,002
Shin hates me so much.

348
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:36,183
Because I destroyed his dream.

349
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:45,223
I believe that everyone in this room,

350
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:49,342
if your dream was destroyed like that,

351
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,882
you would act the same way Shin does.

352
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:20,394
The person who did wrong is me.

353
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,409
It was all my fault.

354
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:41,056
It was not Shin’s fault.

355
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,227
He didn’t do anything wrong.

356
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:50,140
I was the one who did wrong.

357
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:05,762
I was the worst friend.

358
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:20,903
I was the most selfish.

359
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:42,423
That’s all I have to say.

360
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,049
Miss Jan and I just learned about

361
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:49,209
Naruebet and Thamnithit’s past.

362
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,732
It was just a misunderstanding.

363
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,562
Naruebet did not intentionally bully Thamnithit

364
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:56,140
like their classmates believed.

365
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,594
What about the wound on Thamnithit’s face

366
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,302
that looks like he was beaten.

367
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:00,252
Who did it?

368
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:04,162
Thamnithit insists that Naruebet didn’t do it.

369
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,372
Is it true, Thamnithit?

370
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:07,471
Yes.

371
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,754
I don’t want to say who did it.

372
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:12,452
Because I deserved it.

373
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:16,452
He doesn’t seem to reflect on what he did.

374
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:18,336
He also hurt Miss Jan.

375
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,445
It was an accident.

376
00:33:22,474 --> 00:33:24,362
Naruebet didn’t mean to hurt me.

377
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,132
He already apologized to me.

378
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:29,878
But he did use violence in school.

379
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:31,362
That’s right.

380
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:39,245
He has always been involved in a fight

381
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:41,398
since he studied at Udon Pithak campus.

382
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,118
He has never shown respect to anyone,

383
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,769
not even the teachers.

384
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:48,547
Although he has caused trouble,

385
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:51,725
he’s not a troubled kid.

386
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:55,231
I believe that we can change him

387
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:57,222
if we give him another chance.

388
00:33:57,943 --> 00:34:01,020
Miss Jan, are you sure

389
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:03,594
that you can change his attitude?

390
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:05,027
To tell you the truth,

391
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:07,980
I don’t think we can change kids like him.

392
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:09,143
It’s a difficult task.

393
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:14,729
Expelling him from school is the best option.

394
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,045
I think giving him demerit points

395
00:34:18,082 --> 00:34:22,380
and community work would be enough for him.

396
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,820
We don’t need to expel him.

397
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:25,296
What if he commits a more serious crime

398
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,416
in the future?

399
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,376
Who will take responsibility for it?

400
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,962
I don’t want to have a problem

401
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:30,925
with the parent association.

402
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:35,085
I think you should focus on the students

403
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:36,700
rather than their parents.

404
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:41,412
You, why are you smiling?

405
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,092
Is this the time for you

406
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,831
to smile and make a cheeky face.

407
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,783
I’m smiling because you’re judging me.

408
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:50,525
You are beyond repair.

409
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,602
Then expel me.

410
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:52,474
Shin.

411
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:54,132
How could you say that?

412
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:54,700
Aren’t you afraid that

413
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,343
the principal will expel you for real?

414
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,202
That’s enough.

415
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,740
You two can leave.

416
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,732
The teachers will discuss the issue.

417
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:13,332
What are you going to do with Naruebet?

418
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,882
Are you going to expel him?

419
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:18,067
At this point, I think we should expel him.

420
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:25,180
Please have a seat.

421
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,114
Miss Jan.

422
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,711
Can I ask you something

423
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:34,118
since you’re their homeroom teacher?

424
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:35,732
Yes.

425
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,056
Are you sure

426
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:42,322
you can change Naruebet’s attitude?

427
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:46,038
Yes.

428
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,405
What about you, Mr. Sung?

429
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:52,809
What do you think about this?

430
00:35:58,802 --> 00:36:00,140
I think…

431
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:07,711
Miss Jan can’t control or change his attitude.

432
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,336
I know that kids at this age are stubborn.

433
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,332
They are strong-willed.

434
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:23,740
Only Miss Jan can’t change him.

435
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:29,231
But I believe…

436
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:32,202
if Miss Jan and I work together,

437
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,394
we can help him become a better kid.

438
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,300
If that’s what you think,

439
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,780
I hope you can do what you said.

440
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,867
Huh? We will not expel Naruebet?

441
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:54,489
At Siamwit,

442
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,583
we believe in giving people chances.

443
00:36:56,612 --> 00:36:58,903
Back you said…

444
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:02,576
Right now, I changed my mind.

445
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:04,656
Because of what Miss Jan said.

446
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:08,714
I will give this kid another chance.

447
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:19,318
I’ll let Miss Jan and Mr. Sung

448
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,005
decide about his punishment.

449
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,063
If he causes another trouble,

450
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:28,336
my decision will be different.

451
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:31,943
- Yes.
- Yes.

452
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:06,332
Shin, we need to talk.

453
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:07,842
Shin.

454
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:08,707
What?

455
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,765
What do you want from me?

456
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,562
You can drop your act now.

457
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,860
Confess the truth to everyone? Gross!

458
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:19,754
I did that so you wouldn’t get expelled.

459
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,752
Did I ask you to help me?

460
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:23,798
Whether I get expelled or not,

461
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,507
it’s none of your business.

462
00:38:29,102 --> 00:38:30,452
You need to stay here.

463
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:32,998
I won’t let you go anywhere.

464
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:34,983
You need to be with me.

465
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,372
Why do I need to be with a guy like you?

466
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:50,831
I’ll do everything to make it up to you.

467
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:54,002
You can do anything to me.

468
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:55,151
I’ll let you.

469
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:56,969
All I want is that you…

470
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:58,460
Shut up.

471
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,172
I can’t stand to listen to you anymore.

472
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:06,867
You beat me so badly

473
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,547
that I can’t play soccer anymore.

474
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:14,620
Then you disappeared.

475
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:22,212
Do you think what you are doing can help me

476
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,427
get drafted into the national team?

477
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,994
I did those things to get expelled.

478
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,052
Because I don’t want to give you

479
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:43,507
a chance to make it up to me.

480
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,583
You have to live with guilt.

481
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,231
Everything that happened,

482
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:52,902
It was all because of you.

483
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:21,703
Cable, did you finish your extra class?

484
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:24,249
If you do, you need to go straight home.

485
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:26,991
I’ll hire a math tutor to teach you at home,

486
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,982
don’t make him wait for you.

487
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,216
Yes, honey.

488
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:34,794
Principal.

489
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:37,958
Why didn’t you expel Naruebet?

490
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:41,522
Didn’t you say we need to expel him?

491
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,838
What will the parent association say about it?

492
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:48,365
We don’t need to care about them

493
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,594
What about their financial support?

494
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:53,972
We already have enough

495
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,194
financial support we need.

496
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:57,192
We no longer need their help.

497
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,274
Where did you get it?

498
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,023
From Chadjen’s father.

499
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:04,022
Huh? Chadjen?

500
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:06,911
Chadjen again?

501
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,482
I don’t get

502
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:12,322
why Chadjen’s family is helping this kid.

503
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:15,645
But Chadjen’s father insisted

504
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,642
that we should give him another chance.

505
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:21,522
Excuse me.

506
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:24,052
Yes.

507
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,965
Chadjen.

508
00:41:52,322 --> 00:41:55,165
First, can you contact Shin?

509
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:55,972
He hasn’t answered any of my calls

510
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,347
since yesterday.

511
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,856
Did something happen to him?

512
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:02,249
What about you, Chadjen?

513
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:04,242
Can you contact him?

514
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:06,394
No.

515
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:10,438
He didn’t answer my calls.

516
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:13,187
I went to his house this morning

517
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:14,576
but he wasn’t home.

518
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:26,780
[Please come to school.]

519
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,158
[Shin, I talked to Principal Praphada.
You can come to school.]

520
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:40,802
I don’t get why you care so much

521
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,925
about the students.

522
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,067
Because it’s my job.

523
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:48,569
But we are not their parents.

524
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,216
We don’t have control over their lives.

525
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,336
We have no right

526
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:55,071
to meddle in their personal life.

527
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:57,107
I’m not meddling in their life.

528
00:42:57,143 --> 00:42:58,605
I’m just paying attention to them.

529
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:01,645
Okay.

530
00:43:07,662 --> 00:43:08,758
Mr. Sung.

531
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:12,802
Why did you help Shin?

532
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:18,991
Because I wanted to protect my student

533
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:20,982
like you do.

534
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:25,114
I care about them just like you.

535
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:28,852
Thank you.

536
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:31,565
It’s not a big deal. It’s my job.

537
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:48,794
Where are you going?

538
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,223
Do my job as a teacher.

539
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,489
Saint.

540
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,187
Did you come to see Shin?

541
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:14,743
Yes.

542
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:18,016
But he isn’t home.

543
00:44:23,682 --> 00:44:24,787
Saint.

544
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,434
How long have you been friends with him?

545
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:36,896
I first met him in the elementary school.

546
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,558
Back then, we were too big

547
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:43,034
to play with other kids.

548
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:46,649
So we had to play with each other.

549
00:44:50,892 --> 00:44:53,747
You guys must have been chaotic.

550
00:44:56,532 --> 00:44:58,242
We were more like troubled kids.

551
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:01,587
I was not a good kid.

552
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:05,572
Shin put the brakes on me.

553
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,274
At the time,

554
00:45:11,769 --> 00:45:13,762
I often came to his house.

555
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:16,183
If I had free time, I came to hang out with him

556
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:18,612
or have a meal at this place.

557
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:21,332
When he practiced soccer until late,

558
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:26,780
I would wait to walk him home.

559
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:34,096
He was a very talented soccer player.

560
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:37,242
He was scouted by many teams.

561
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,892
He told me he would practice hard.

562
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:44,634
He wanted to join the national team.

563
00:45:45,652 --> 00:45:46,947
He wanted to be a good son.

564
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:50,714
He wanted to earn a lot of money

565
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,936
so his mom and sister would live comfortably.

566
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:00,060
But he can no longer do it.

567
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:03,456
Because of me.

568
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:17,129
Why didn’t you let him leave the gang?

569
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:19,245
Was it the tradition that the member

570
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:22,292
needed to be beaten if they wanted to leave?

571
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,256
Yes.

572
00:46:27,602 --> 00:46:31,209
It was a crazy tradition that I made.

573
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:37,471
It was a stupid idea of an immature kid.

574
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:44,322
I was angry at him.

575
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,532
I felt like he was leaving me.

576
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:59,871
Anyone can make a mistake.

577
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,718
Though we can’t undo the past,

578
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:11,223
we can make our present and future better.

579
00:47:13,332 --> 00:47:16,729
Can you talk and persuade him

580
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,314
to come to school?

581
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:23,143
I think he’ll listen to you more than me.

582
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:25,376
Yes.

583
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:28,162
I already have an idea.

584
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:31,565
I’ll let you handle it.

585
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:36,460
Bye.

586
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:05,965
I know you’re in the house.

587
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,562
Come out to see me.

588
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,023
Why would I do that?

589
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,769
I want to fight you.

590
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,431
Come out to see me.

591
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:56,882
You want to fight me?

592
00:48:57,732 --> 00:48:58,642
Why didn’t you come to school?

593
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,543
It’s none of your business.

594
00:49:00,002 --> 00:49:00,867
Damn it.

595
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:03,165
Can you stop acting nonsense?

596
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:06,342
What right do you have to say that to me?

597
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:08,300
I do have the right.

598
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:11,820
The right as your best friend.

599
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,209
Bastard, Saint.

600
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:15,267
Don’t you listen to what I told you?

601
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,002
No.

602
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:18,903
I’m a bastard.

603
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:21,362
I don’t listen to what you told me.

604
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:24,612
Why do you waste your life on me?

605
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:27,689
I already ruined your life once.

606
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:33,318
Do you want to drop out of school

607
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:34,016
because of me?

608
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,274
F♪ck you.

609
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:40,162
If you don’t come to school,

610
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,165
it means you let me ruin your life again.

611
00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:44,816
You are so stupid.

612
00:49:45,542 --> 00:49:47,412
Because I don’t want to see you.

613
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,529
Every time I see you,

614
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:52,103
it reminds me of the shitty thing you did to me.

615
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:58,416
So what?

616
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:00,103
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

617
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,102
You were the one who avoided me.

618
00:50:09,462 --> 00:50:11,092
But I’m not avoiding you this time.

619
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:13,565
I’ll be here.

620
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,460
I’ll wait for you to take revenge on me.

621
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:20,169
You can punch or kick me.

622
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:22,762
You can do anything to me.

623
00:50:26,462 --> 00:50:28,496
But I’ll never run away from you again.

624
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:31,507
So…

625
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:36,182
you can’t run away from me either.

626
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:40,111
Do it.

627
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:42,867
Go for it.

628
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:46,496
Take your revenge.

629
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:54,932
Take revenge?

630
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,576
What will I get from doing that?

631
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:01,878
Do you have anything

632
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:03,660
as important as soccer to me?

633
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:10,983
Can you do it?

634
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:14,982
Give up on the most important thing to you.

635
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:18,467
If you can do it,

636
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:24,358
I’ll pretend to believe that you feel very guilty.

637
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:27,703
If you can give it up,

638
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,434
I’ll go back to school.

639
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:07,432
Saint.

640
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:13,740
How are things with Shin?

641
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,482
He still refuses to come to school.

642
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:22,045
Can you call him again?

643
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:26,372
Tell him to come to school now.

644
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:30,736
Otherwise, the principal may change her mind.

645
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:00,183
(What?)

646
00:53:00,576 --> 00:53:02,182
Come to school right now.

647
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,507
No.

648
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:08,387
I’ll give up the most important thing to me.

649
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:11,951
I’ll do what you said.

650
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:40,612
Although you are late, I’ll mark you as present.

651
00:53:41,132 --> 00:53:43,543
From now on, you need to attend every class

652
00:53:43,572 --> 00:53:45,325
if you don’t want to get expelled from school.

653
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,452
Do you get it?

654
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:49,216
Yes.

655
00:53:52,582 --> 00:53:53,863
Mr. Sung and Miss Jan,

656
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:55,478
please monitor his community work.

657
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,649
Your community work starts tomorrow.

658
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:09,332
You need to clean the school every evening.

659
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:10,976
Do you get it?

660
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:33,820
So what are you giving up?

661
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:57,754
[Resignation letter.]

662
00:55:03,994 --> 00:55:05,492
Are you happy now?

663
00:55:32,802 --> 00:55:34,460
Why are you resigning from school?

664
00:55:35,362 --> 00:55:36,678
What’s the problem?

665
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:41,085
I have a personal reason.

666
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:45,522
You can tell me.

667
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:53,805
It’s okay.

668
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:13,711
[Resignation letter.]

669
00:56:27,702 --> 00:56:29,274
What are you doing here?

670
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:36,227
What the hell are you doing?

671
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:40,489
I’m giving up on my most important thing,

672
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:43,180
just like you told me to do.

673
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:49,085
Is school your most important thing?

674
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:53,696
Resigning from school is not enough.

675
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:57,878
You need to give up on a more important thing.

676
00:56:58,205 --> 00:57:02,620
Do you think what I’m giving up is school?

677
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:03,972
Then what is it?

678
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,972
Do you really not know?

679
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:17,871
The most important thing that I’m giving up.

680
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,074
It’s not school.

681
00:57:27,822 --> 00:57:31,049
It’s you, Shin.

682
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:40,452
I’m giving up on the chance to be with you.

683
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:14,336
Saint didn’t come to school again.

684
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:17,158
He probably ran away to cry because of Shin.

685
01:00:17,187 --> 01:00:19,152
Why the hell did you hit the desk?

686
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:20,860
It’s obvious that Saint doesn’t come to school

687
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:22,067
because of you.

688
01:00:22,103 --> 01:00:23,696
You need to take responsibility for it.

689
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:25,245
Thank you for worrying about me.

690
01:00:25,282 --> 01:00:26,729
But I won’t go back to school.

691
01:00:26,758 --> 01:00:28,292
He doesn’t want to go to school.

692
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,972
So he just quits?

693
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:33,100
I’m here to submit my son’s resignation.

694
01:00:35,062 --> 01:00:37,020
Is this really what you’re going to do?

695
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:38,460
Are you telling me…

696
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:41,769
to come back to school?
