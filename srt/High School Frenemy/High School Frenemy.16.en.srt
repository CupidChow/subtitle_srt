5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,150
We came to pick Ken up to go to school.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,850
Why the hell do you want him to go back to school?

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,710
You’re wasting your time.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,220
You are the one who is wasting his time.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,500
Are you done talking?

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
We will really miss you, Chadjen.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,110
I’m glad that I attended this school.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,350
Saint, you started it.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,370
You will fall.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,700
Don’t do this.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,590
Chadjen, help me.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,800
Mom, I can’t do it anymore.

17
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,370
Peeta.

18
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,830
Peeta.

19
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,610
If a kid like Peeta can get access to it,

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,040
I’m worried the drug may be spreading in our school.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,190
What should we do?

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,400
Good morning.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,200
My bestie.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,790
Ever since my mom gave you permission,

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,470
you've been in such a good mood, huh?

26
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,180
I bought noodles for you.

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,390
And for Mom.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Who did you call Mom?

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,770
Hey, don't act all distant now.

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,780
We can finally be together openly.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,220
The hell we’re together?

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,580
I haven’t finished saying.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,780
Together as friends.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
What did you think of?

35
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,130
The heck did you think, huh?

36
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,490
You jerk.

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Hello, aunty.

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Good morning, Saint.

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,690
Morning, Chingching.

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,230
Study hard today, okay?

41
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,250
Um.

42
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,230
Thanks for giving Shin a ride.

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,390
No sweat.

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,200
Mom, here.

45
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,560
Saint brought you this.

46
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,270
Thanks.

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,056
I’ll take Chingching to school first.

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,600
Okay.

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,420
Let’s go.

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,520
Goodbye.

51
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,720
Bye bye.

52
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
See you.

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Go, go.

54
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,350
You're smiling so wide, huh?

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,281
My mom's not totally over being mad at you yet, you know.

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
Just this is enough to make me really happy.

57
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,100
Pretty soon, I’ll probably win your mom over.

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
When your mom calls me son again,

59
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,580
you better not be upset with her.

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,160
Man, you're such a bragger.

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,840
Oh, shut it.

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,380
You're not even giving me any support.

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,316
Hurry up and get to school, or we'll be late, idiot.

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,750
Yeah, yeah. I still gotta pick up Ken too.

65
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,690
I’ll quickly grab my stuff first.

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,290
Hurry up, dude.

67
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,100
Quick, quick.

68
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,130
Yeah.

69
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,240
Quick, quick.

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,120
Yeah.

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,670
Even quicker.

72
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,050
Hey, Shin, quick.

73
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,090
Shin, you’re so damn slow.

74
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,410
Let’s go.

75
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,330
Let’s go, lil bro.

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,810
Let’s go, friend.

77
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,010
KEEP GOING.

78
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,500
The heck is this checking?

79
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,180
Why do they have a check today?

80
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,380
Hey, what happened?

81
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,770
They suddenly checked our bag today.

82
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,980
See that? They checked thoroughly.

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,770
Bet it’s about the drug.

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,660
Do you think this stuff’s starting to spread in our school, Ken?

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,970
From what I know,

86
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,900
no one’s brought it into school yet.

87
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,750
Honestly, I’m also confused about where Peeta even got it.

88
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,030
Do you think this means there will be more trouble in school?

89
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,070
Last night I saw kids from another class posting statuses online,

90
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,500
blaming our class for causing drama again.

91
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,890
What can we do? We’re from Class Two.

92
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,700
Just gotta live with it, I guess.

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,650
If something bad happens at this school,

94
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
everyone’s quick to blame our class first.

95
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,620
This is not fair.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,290
Damn, bet they gonna check it till noon.

97
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,980
This is all the money Ken owes you:

98
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,450
both the principal and the interest.

99
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,270
I’m paying it myself.

100
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,680
I really don’t get you.

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
Why go this far for Ken?

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,060
It’s not a small amount of money.

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,990
Ken is my student,

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,520
and I won’t let anyone harm my students ever again.

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,710
Got it?

106
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,080
From now on, don’t ever bother Ken or any other students again.

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,700
If I don’t do what you said,

108
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,750
what will you, the teachers, do?

109
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,080
You can try.

110
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,360
But you’ll regret it for sure, Jeng.

111
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,870
Ken, sit here.

112
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,970
Regarding your debt with the Dragon Fang,

113
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,210
we already took care of it.

114
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,500
Thank you, teachers.

115
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,911
I’ll find the money to pay you back the soonest possible.

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,910
It’s totally fine, Ken.

117
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,050
We’re more than happy to help you.

118
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,800
But that’s a lot of money, Miss Jan.

119
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,800
If you really want to repay us,

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,960
I want you to do it by focusing on your studies.

121
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,300
Graduate, and stay away from those people.

122
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,570
That’s all we ask. Can you do that?

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Yes, sir.

124
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,710
But I’ll still find a way to pay you back.

125
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I promise.

126
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,810
I’m just scared this won’t be the end of it.

127
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,010
Jeng never lets anyone leave his gang.

128
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
You don’t need to worry about that.

129
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,980
Leave it to the police to handle.

130
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,420
The police can’t touch Jeng, sir.

131
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,570
Trust me, Ken.

132
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,950
This time, Jeng won’t get away.

133
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Ahem.

134
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,600
The minced pork Kaprao with a fried egg,

135
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,580
Mr.Saint’s recipe, is here.

136
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,740
Here, this is Chadjen’s.

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,690
Here’s yours.

138
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,510
Tell me if you don’t feel full, there’s some more.

139
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,890
What’s the matter, Chadjen?

140
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,910
Is it not yummy?

141
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,910
No.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,620
It’s very yummy, Saint.

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,060
Then why don’t you eat?

144
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,800
When you’re abroad,

145
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,970
it’ll be hard to find the real Kaprao like this.

146
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,580
Well, actually, I don’t want to move abroad.

147
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,090
Why so?

148
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,780
Because you wanna eat Kaprao?

149
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,590
Oh, Saint, you jerk.

150
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,950
Should I hit you for real once?

151
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,530
You dummy.

152
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,780
Then, what’s the reason, Chadjen?

153
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,570
Because…

154
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,170
I’m afraid I won’t have any friends.

155
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,190
Chadjen, though you live there,

156
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,110
you’re still our friend.

157
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,490
Um, you can call me anytime.

158
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,910
No matter how late it is,

159
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,750
I’ll pick up your call.

160
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,330
We’re not gonna let you feel alone, no way.

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,800
Hey, why are you crying?

162
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,520
My parents moved there already.

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,730
Now, I only live with my butler.

164
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,330
I can’t hold on any longer, Shin.

165
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,590
I’ve tried to come up with excuses to stay here,

166
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,390
tried to buy more time,

167
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,980
but I really have to go now.

168
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,310
I’m scared I won’t have any friends over there.

169
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,760
I don’t want to be alone again.

170
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,610
I just want to have friends, Shin.

171
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Chadjen.

172
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,840
Do you remember our promise?

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,370
I do.

174
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,690
You told me to stay strong.

175
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,340
Yes, I want you to stay strong

176
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,410
and confident.

177
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,590
You’re a nice person.

178
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
You’ll definitely have friends.

179
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,320
Yeah, that’s right.

180
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,970
I feel very lucky to get to meet you,

181
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,530
and be your friend.

182
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,790
I also believe that your new friends will feel the same way.

183
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,970
Really?

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,590
Yes, of course.

185
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,370
Stop crying.

186
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,400
Let’s dig in.

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,450
Shin. Saint.

188
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,560
Tears got into my mouth.

189
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,460
My Kaprao is all salty now.

190
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,460
Oh, Chadjen.

191
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,950
No worries, eat Shin’s instead.

192
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,010
What? Saint, you jerk.

193
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,020
You must sacrifice.

194
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:13,170
But Saint, what’s salty is my tears,

195
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,930
not the Kaprao.

196
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,260
Maybe it’s because the dish was made by this dummy.

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,190
Are you talking trash about me?

198
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,550
I was just saying it randomly.

199
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,570
You did it again.

200
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,720
Since Chadjen’s heading to England soon,

201
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,816
eat as much as you want today.

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,480
Uh… I can’t finish all this.

203
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,410
You’re always messing with Chadjen.

204
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,560
Shin, you can have this.

205
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,390
It’s mine.

206
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,950
Whoa, this is really salty.

207
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,010
Stop complaining.

208
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,410
You’re not helping with anything.

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,370
Just sitting around being useless.

210
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,910
You don’t believe me, huh?

211
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,200
Fine, try it yourself. Here.

212
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,110
Holy crap, it’s amazing.

213
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,510
Listen, if we weren’t close,

214
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,290
I wouldn’t even make Kaprao for you.

215
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,760
Before, it was just Shin.

216
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,980
Now it’s you too, Chadjen.

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,260
Don’t say it.

218
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,520
What’s that again?

219
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,520
Out of nowhere, the cops just showed up, boss.

220
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,340
They’ve got the whole factory surrounded.

221
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,570
All the drugs and stuff are in there.

222
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,300
We couldn’t get them out in time.

223
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Damn it, how the hell did they find out?

224
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,420
I bet there’s a rat among us, boss.

225
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,760
Should we run now, boss?

226
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
What should we do, boss?"

227
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,400
Not yet. I’ll handle that bastard first.

228
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,190
Hey.

229
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,860
Hey.

230
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,460
The heck is this?

231
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,490
The heck is this?

232
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
What happened?

233
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,520
You’re back, Ken?

234
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,690
I’ve waited for so long.

235
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Jeng.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You and I have some matters to clear up.

237
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,390
Jeng, didn’t Ken pay back all the debt?

238
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,690
Hey.

239
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,340
The heck are you doing?

240
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:58,860
Let me go.

241
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,630
Let me go, bastard.

242
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,970
The hell you capture me?

243
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,590
You’re a real piece of work, huh?

244
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,020
You betrayed me.

245
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,870
My factory’s ruined because of you.

246
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,070
What are you talking about, boss?

247
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,020
I don’t know anything.

248
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,206
You don’t know anything, huh? You jerk.

249
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,810
Hey, stop it.

250
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,190
You jerk.

251
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,300
Jeng.

252
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,020
You don’t know?

253
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,540
You bastard, let me go.

254
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,390
Ken.

255
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,430
Stop it.

256
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Ken.

257
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,030
You dare leaving my gang?

258
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,080
Sure,

259
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,420
you’ll get to leave as you wish, you jerk.

260
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,450
You piece of shit.

261
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,290
Hey, stop it.

262
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,330
Stop it.

263
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,680
Enough, you bastard.

264
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,060
Stop it. Why are you capturing me, jerk?

265
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,210
Take him.

266
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,190
Will that be okay, boss?

267
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,690
Don’t we have to escape first?

268
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,630
No way. I’ll manage it according to our rules.

269
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,280
Go.

270
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,210
Hey.

271
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,090
Ken.

272
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,090
Jeng, what are you doing?

273
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,230
Where are you taking him to?

274
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,930
Ken.

275
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,370
(Hello, Knot. What’s the matter?)

276
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:42,770
Saint.

277
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Shin.

278
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,130
Ken is in trouble.

279
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,010
You know what the only way

280
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,760
to get out of the Dragon Fang gang is?

281
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
You need to die if you want to leave my gang, you little shit.

282
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,310
Shoot me.

283
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,190
My friends will take revenge on you.

284
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,690
Friends?

285
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
Does a person like you have friends?

286
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,010
I guess they’re upstairs.

287
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,350
Shin, are you sure you’ll go with me?

288
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,750
Yeah, I will never leave you.

289
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,820
But your mom and Chingching…

290
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I’ll be fine.

291
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,690
And you, too, Saint.

292
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,610
We’ll definitely get Ken out.

293
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,050
Let’s go.

294
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
Oh, man.

295
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,600
What’s wrong?

296
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,470
There are so damn many of them.

297
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
What should we do?

298
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,960
Hey, isn’t that First?

299
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,930
The heck is he doing here?

300
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,720
Better check him out first.

301
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,670
He might walk around and get beaten up to death.

302
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
First.

303
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,820
The heck are you here?

304
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,780
Chadjen called me to help Shin.

305
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,390
You come to help but you come alone?

306
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,670
Where’s Tew?

307
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,330
I can handle it alone.

308
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,260
Is it a big mess?

309
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,490
Asking if it’s a big mess?

310
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,170
Look at us first.

311
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,060
What about you two?

312
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,240
We’re here to help Saint and Shin.

313
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,120
Both of them are here to help Ken.

314
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,040
Hey, did you see Chadjen?

315
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:31,970
Chadjen?

316
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,940
Hey, don’t tell me…

317
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,446
He was the one who sent me the location.

318
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,740
Damn it.

319
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,670
Wait.

320
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,760
What are you doing?

321
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,060
Going to save our friends.

322
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,900
You nice guy, jerk.

323
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,540
Fine. Just do it.

324
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,780
Let’s take them down, bro.

325
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,460
Hey, don’t go empty-handed.

326
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,280
What the heck?

327
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,990
Shin, move.

328
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,110
Follow them.

329
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,250
Hey, stop.

330
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,910
Stop there.

331
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Hey!

332
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,990
The hell are you doing here?

333
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,490
Damn it.

334
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Just do it.

335
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,440
Shin, just go.

336
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,030
Shin.

337
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Ken.

338
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,590
Ken.

339
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,810
Ken.

340
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
You bastard.

341
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,620
Shin, just go.

342
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Let me go.

343
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,560
You jerk, let me go.

344
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:33,156
Come here.

345
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Shin.

346
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,640
I’ve waited for today for ages.

347
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,770
I’ll make you suffer even more than what happened to my brother.

348
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
Come at me then.

349
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Ken.

350
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,310
Ken, you okay?

351
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Slowly, man.

352
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,140
You bastard.

353
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
You jerk.

354
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,200
Jeng, you jerk.

355
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,080
You dare messing with Jeng?

356
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,960
Damn it. Mr.Sung is so dope.

357
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Where are the others?

358
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,100
They should be inside, sir.

359
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,680
Still okay?

360
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,440
Yeah.

361
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
We’re fine.

362
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,850
Great. Then, let’s go.

363
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Hey.

364
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,970
Don’t hurt Shin.

365
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,590
Jeng, you jerk.

366
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,330
Ken.

367
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,370
Ken, you okay?

368
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,970
You better go help Shin.

369
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,830
Didn’t I tell you not to mess with my friend?

370
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,530
You and me, let’s settle this right now.

371
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Sure.

372
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,320
Jeng, you jerk.

373
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,180
Let’s end it, dude.

374
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
You okay?

375
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
Chadjen.

376
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,210
Chadjen, you okay?

377
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,480
How are you?

378
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,210
I feel winded.

379
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,300
Ken.

380
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,300
Spread out and search. Move fast.

381
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
They’re students.

382
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Sit first.

383
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Ken, be careful.

384
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
Are you guys okay?

385
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Yes, Miss Jan.

386
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,220
How can you be here?

387
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,390
Thanks to Chadjen for calling me.

388
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,180
Don’t do things like this next time.

389
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,170
Got it?

390
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Saint.

391
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,060
Shin.

392
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,400
Jeng, you piece of shit.

393
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,120
Jeng, you jerk.

394
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,310
Shin.

395
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,710
Shin.

396
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Shin.

397
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,780
Hang in there.

398
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,370
Stay with me.

399
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,270
The heck you do to my kids?

400
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,290
Huh?

401
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,840
Enough. That’s enough.

402
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
That’s enough.

403
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,090
Let me go.

404
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,310
- That’s enough. - Let me go.

405
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
That’s enough.

406
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,740
That’s already enough.

407
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
That’s enough.

408
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,190
Shin.

409
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,000
Shin.

410
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,290
Shin.

411
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,310
Shin.

412
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,620
Shin.

413
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,910
Saint.

414
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,260
I really cannot.

415
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
Shin.

416
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Shin.

417
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,210
You brat, Shin.

418
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,140
Shin.

419
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,810
Shin.

420
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Shin.

421
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,950
Shin.

422
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,990
Shin.

423
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Shin.

424
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Shin.

425
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
Saint.

426
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,840
Shin.

427
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,860
You woke up.

428
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,600
Why do you have to be so loud?

429
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
- Oh my. - Shin.

430
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,780
Saint, you brat.

431
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,770
Damn, I forgot. Sorry.

432
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Does it hurt a lot?

433
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,350
Want me to call the doctor here?

434
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,590
No need.

435
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,030
I’m fine already.

436
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,050
Don’t worry.

437
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,600
The hell you’re fine.

438
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,900
You were stabbed.

439
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,410
I’m glad though.

440
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,380
I got to see you when I woke up.

441
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,010
It’s what I’ve wanted all my life.

442
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,890
Shin.

443
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,370
From now on, no matter what happens,

444
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,100
I’ll never leave you again.

445
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I promise.

446
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,930
Yeah, me, too.

447
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,580
Why the heck are you crying?

448
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,010
I’m not dying, man.

449
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,290
When you suffer, I also suffer.

450
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,930
Oh, man.

451
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,000
You dummy.

452
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,690
Oh, you crybaby.

453
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,250
Crybaby doggo.

454
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,100
Let me hit you once, little brat.

455
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,580
Doc, someone bullies the patient.

456
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,950
You dummy.

457
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,410
Sorry. I’m sorry, Brother Shin.

458
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,880
What a crybaby. You’re a grown-up, man.

459
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,640
Watch your mouth, dude.

460
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,670
Damn.

461
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,090
Bruh.

462
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,500
THE FOLLOWING WEEK.

463
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,680
You okay?

464
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Wanna sit first?

465
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,840
Of course.

466
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,840
We’re here to give Chadjen a surprise.

467
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
Chadjen’s moving so far away.

468
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,810
It kinda feels heartbreaking, doesn’t it?

469
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Yeah.

470
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,000
He’s such a good friend.

471
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
He’s coming.

472
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,060
How come you guys are here?

473
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,020
Are you all recovered now, Shin?

474
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,450
I was about to visit you before I went to the airport.

475
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,450
Shin wants to give you a surprise.

476
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,120
No need for that.

477
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,420
I worry about you, Shin.

478
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,970
Chadjen, I want to tell you something.

479
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,500
Keep going, Chadjen.

480
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
No matter what changes you face in life.

481
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,740
You must keep going.

482
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,230
Don’t be scared.

483
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,980
You must stay strong.

484
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,420
Saint and I will be your friends forever.

485
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,480
You won’t be alone, Chadjen.

486
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,370
You’ll survive.

487
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,400
I believe in you.

488
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
That’s right.

489
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,240
You’ll have plenty of friends there

490
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,610
because you’re a good friend.

491
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,070
Everyone surely wants to be friends with you.

492
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,240
Thanks, guys.

493
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,060
Better get going.

494
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,190
You might miss your flight.

495
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,070
Both of us will send you off here.

496
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,800
Good luck.

497
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,120
Fine. But before I go,

498
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,850
can I ask for one thing?

499
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,770
Yeah, sure.

500
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,380
What do you want?

501
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,510
A hug.

502
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,370
Be careful of Shin’s wound.

503
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,694
We’ll miss you, dude.

504
00:44:40,363 --> 00:44:41,447
Good luck, guys.

505
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,790
Shin.

506
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,950
What’s the matter?

507
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,069
I think we need to keep going, too.

508
00:45:53,178 --> 00:45:56,763
Yeah, we have school tomorrow.

509
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,323
But I promise you.

510
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
The two of us will keep going together.

511
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,829
I’ll never leave you for sure.

512
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,740
Um.

513
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,540
Thanks.

514
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:18,000
Let’s go.

515
00:46:18,043 --> 00:46:19,469
The one who leaves first is a dog.

516
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,750
Oh.

517
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,865
You jerk.

518
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:23,832
I knew it.

519
00:46:23,861 --> 00:46:24,465
You want it?

520
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:26,370
No, don’t. Wait.

521
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:28,370
No. Are you bullying the patient?

522
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,468
Brat, you have the excuse, huh?

523
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,112
You’ll see me later.

524
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,890
Let’s go.

525
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,843
Where should we go?

526
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:39,861
Wanna go for a ride?

527
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:40,883
Yeah.

528
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:47,469
Or should we follow Chadjen to send him off at the airport?

529
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,040
Why the heck we’ll be there, jerk?

530
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,076
Oh, shit.

531
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:52,974
Sorry, sorry.

532
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,380
Go.

533
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:24,814
FEW MONTHS LATER.

534
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,530
Oh, Saint.

535
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,540
Saint, wake up.

536
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
Saint.

537
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,069
Lemme sleep a bit more.

538
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:40,814
The hell you can sleep.

539
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,185
I’m telling you to wake up, Saint.

540
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:44,814
Wake up.

541
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,770
Wake up already.

542
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,672
Shin, why do you have to be harsh with me?

543
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:50,596
Cause you don’t get up.

544
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,196
I’m about to be late, dude.

545
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:54,014
Don’t you want to see my soccer match?

546
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:55,803
I might miss it because of you, jerk.

547
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:58,661
Damn. Why didn’t you wake me up early?

548
00:47:58,683 --> 00:48:00,850
I’ve done that but you wouldn’t wake up.

549
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:02,392
Hurry up, you bastard.

550
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:06,800
Damn it.

551
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,974
Saint, why are you running like that?

552
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,263
Will you have breakfast first, kiddo?

553
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:29,840
Got no time, Mom. Saint woke up late.

554
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:31,381
We’re leaving first, aunty.

555
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,123
Bye bye, Chingching.

556
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:33,236
Take this with you, dear.

557
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:35,345
You might not have the energy for the match.

558
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,374
Thanks.

559
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,058
I’m leaving first.

560
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:39,072
Bye bye.

561
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,494
Bye bye.

562
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,432
Oh, don’t run, dear.

563
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,052
- Hurry up, Shin. - You might fall, Shin.

564
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:43,818
Don’t run.

565
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Oh my.

566
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,110
He keeps running though I told him not to, right?

567
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:53,730
Saint, ride faster or else I’ll miss my match.

568
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,461
Fine. You said it yourself.

569
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:56,654
Faster, right?

570
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,927
Damn, Saint. Ride properly.

571
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,676
Don’t you ride it yourself, man?

572
00:49:00,712 --> 00:49:01,614
Deserved it.

573
00:49:01,636 --> 00:49:02,636
Jerk.

574
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,149
You cannot lose today.

575
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:06,007
Why?

576
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,418
If you lost,

577
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,309
you had to buy me food for 49 days.

578
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,300
Fine. But if I won,

579
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,300
you had to buy me food for 50 days.

580
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:15,992
Okay?

581
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:16,610
Sure.

582
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:16,945
Yeah.

583
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:17,774
Let me add another thing.

584
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:18,574
What’s that?

585
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:19,890
If you lost,

586
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:21,920
you had to eat a stewed pork leg without garlic.

587
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:23,561
No way. I cannot accept this, you bastard.

588
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,207
Don’t. I might fall for real.

589
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:28,350
Saint, you brat, ride properly.

590
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:29,825
Damn… Hey.

591
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,741
Look at the road.

592
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,447
Yeah, yeah.

593
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,170
One more time, man.

594
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,952
Hey.

595
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,843
Be careful. Beware of others.

596
00:49:44,872 --> 00:49:46,312
Yeah, not gonna hit them.

597
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:47,778
Hit them?

598
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,109
Let’s go, Saint.

599
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,243
Hold me tight then.

600
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,989
Hey, Saint.

601
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,487
(Dad, I think I’m starting to succeed.)

602
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,069
(I’ve become a good teacher)

603
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:22,123
(like what I’ve promised you.)

604
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,894
(I’ve helped my students find happiness)

605
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,280
(in their school life)

606
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:29,367
(and enjoy the journey)

607
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,105
(of chasing their dreams.)

608
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,832
(Becoming a homeroom teacher for Class 2)

609
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,185
(alongside Mr. Sung)

610
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,578
(has helped me grow)

611
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,952
(and learn so much.)

612
00:51:02,989 --> 00:51:03,430
1, 2.

613
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:04,461
That looks nice.

614
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,480
- Wanna try? - I’ll go for 3.

615
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:08,400
I’ll go for 1.

616
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,563
I’ll put it on for you.

617
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,476
Everyone has to pay me.

618
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:13,258
Hey, isn’t it 6?

619
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:14,272
It’s 5 now.

620
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,400
Are you this kind of person?

621
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,672
- Fine, I let you have it, kiddo. - Take it.

622
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,880
We make an appointment a year in advance.

623
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:23,207
We’ll buy you food in return.

624
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:25,200
Never mind. My family is rich.

625
00:51:25,454 --> 00:51:27,200
Yeah, I know.

626
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,403
He got you, man.

627
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,025
He’s joking.

628
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,952
Quickly buy it from me.

629
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:37,192
Oh, finally you came.

630
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:38,640
We’re late.

631
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:39,760
I was wrong.

632
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:41,218
Hey.

633
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,029
Did you celebrate last night?

634
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,840
Of course.

635
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:49,469
Shin scored six goals.

636
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:50,894
That’s a double hat trick, man.

637
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:52,785
A scout even asked for his number.

638
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,494
Damn.

639
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:57,461
So, aren’t you gonna try out for the club?

640
00:51:57,483 --> 00:51:59,680
That was my plan all along, kid.

641
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:00,960
Damn.

642
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,749
Whoa, if you make it,

643
00:52:04,778 --> 00:52:06,516
we’ll come watch every game.

644
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,720
Us, too.

645
00:52:08,749 --> 00:52:10,058
Let’s go together.

646
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:11,792
Will do a live session for Chadjen as well.

647
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,538
Chadjen doesn’t answer me these days.

648
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,869
He must be with his friends.

649
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,621
He got quite a lot.

650
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:19,723
Chadjen lives a better life now,

651
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,437
so, he won’t be friends so, he won’t be friends with someone like you anymore.

652
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:23,054
Yeah.

653
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,901
You’re right. Very accurate.

654
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:25,938
Someone like you, too.

655
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:31,940
Class.

656
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,432
Good morning.

657
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,185
Good morning, everyone.

658
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:44,370
I’m not sure if it’s gonna be good or bad news for you guys.

659
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,170
But all of you will be with

660
00:52:50,116 --> 00:52:52,110
Miss Jan and me again.

661
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,116
We’ll be your homeroom teachers.

662
00:53:06,385 --> 00:53:08,380
Will you teach us for one more year?

663
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,901
Actually, I’ll teach here from now on.

664
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,472
Alright, alright.

665
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,854
Let’s focus on studying hard this year, okay?

666
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,396
Okay.

667
00:53:27,425 --> 00:53:29,985
I’ll study hard, teachers.

668
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,360
It’s your last year.

669
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,756
Therefore, enjoy it to the fullest.

670
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,756
Miss Jan and I will support you as always.

671
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,014
So, if you need help or want to consult us,

672
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,636
you can always come to us.

673
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:49,810
Except for money issues.

674
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,498
Oh, man.

675
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:53,047
You blocked us real quick.

676
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:55,032
Let me have it once.

677
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:57,738
Do you have like 200 baht for me?

678
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,367
I don’t.

679
00:53:59,396 --> 00:54:00,800
50?

680
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:01,829
I do.

681
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,985
Good teachers must be like this.

682
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,192
(Mr. Sung shared with the students)

683
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:12,647
(the reason behind the conflict)

684
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:15,178
(between the two campuses.)

685
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,330
(It stemmed from his past actions, )

686
00:54:17,374 --> 00:54:19,556
(where he used force to solve problems, )

687
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,570
(only to end up creating even more issues)

688
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,338
(and endless resentment.)

689
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,000
(Dad, I’m so proud of the students in Class 2.)

690
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,032
(They truly understood what Mr. Sung was saying)

691
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,374
(They’re really starting to grow up.)

692
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,058
Nobody’s here.

693
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,770
Let’s go.

694
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,760
Go.

695
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:42,610
Go, go, go.

696
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,170
Got it, man.

697
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:44,392
Let’s snook!

698
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,370
Ken, Knot, and Nate,

699
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,189
are you skipping class?

700
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:53,792
Let’s go.

701
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,101
Let’s go, man.

702
00:54:56,247 --> 00:54:59,461
(Even though some of them aren’t in a hurry, )

703
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:00,967
(not thinking too much, )

704
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,061
(maybe because they still want to stay kids, )

705
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:04,654
(they still make mistakes)

706
00:55:04,683 --> 00:55:06,650
(and cause some trouble sometimes.)

707
00:55:06,698 --> 00:55:09,345
(But that’s where Mr. Sung and I come in.)

708
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,396
(We’re here to guide our students)

709
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:13,120
(down the right path.)

710
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:19,698
Can you understand it?

711
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:21,181
Nah.

712
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:22,080
What about this?

713
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:23,109
Nah.

714
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,829
Then when will you stop?

715
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,520
But I need to read it.

716
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:28,312
Enough, enough.

717
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:29,985
You should rest, too.

718
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:30,894
Play soccer with me.

719
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,174
I’m not going, Saint.

720
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,014
You jerk, I need to study.

721
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,425
Just passing the exam is fine.

722
00:55:35,454 --> 00:55:36,421
Should I hit you once, huh?

723
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,218
I told you to study. Take it.

724
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,792
Here, read. Read.

725
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:41,821
Read it.

726
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,032
You think someone like me will get anything out of reading?

727
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:46,785
Yeah, so you won’t be dumb anymore.

728
00:55:47,374 --> 00:55:48,625
Why so many?

729
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,243
Sci, maths, and English.

730
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:55,054
Here, I’ll let them flow into my brain.

731
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,309
Seems to have no future.

732
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,243
You bastard.

733
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:06,101
Whoa, I got 100% of it.

734
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,338
Thanks for hitting me, dude.

735
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,360
Let’s go.

736
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,607
Damn, Saint.

737
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,081
I’ll let you copy mine. I’ll let you do it.

738
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:12,138
You brat.

739
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,316
Let’s go. Let’s go.

740
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:15,403
Trust me. I’m 100% smart.

741
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,109
Smart, you jerk.

742
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:17,138
Saint, let me go first.

743
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,436
See? See? You’re getting dizzy.

744
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,469
You’ve been sitting there reading too much.

745
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,443
The blood’s not going to your brain.

746
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:23,512
Wake up, wake up.

747
00:56:23,534 --> 00:56:24,534
Come on, let’s go.

748
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:28,670
Oh my.

749
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,396
Come on.

750
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:30,460
You can’t be serious.

751
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,800
What will they test you on? I’ll help you.

752
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:35,240
Which one? Penalty Kick? Free kick?

753
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:36,974
Get the ball from me.

754
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,392
Show me what you’ve got.

755
00:56:38,945 --> 00:56:40,109
Are you boxing, man?

756
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:52,363
Whoa, you tried doing a pose?

757
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,160
Come on.

758
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:00,727
You jerk.

759
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,432
You brat, Saint.

760
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,036
No.

761
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,210
You’re a soccer player, you need to be strong.

762
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,101
Make sure you make it.

763
00:57:34,138 --> 00:57:35,138
Yeah.

764
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,927
I’ll cheer for you.

765
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,981
(Dad, )

766
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,200
(I promise you)

767
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,094
(I’ll take care of my students the best)

768
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:16,516
(because I know they love)

769
00:58:16,552 --> 00:58:18,312
(and respect me so much.)

770
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:22,540
(Just like you told me, Dad, )

771
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,385
(once we become someone’s teacher, )

772
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,061
(we’re their teacher for life.)

773
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,060
(You were right, Dad.)

774
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,340
Damn it.

775
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,650
Can’t believe we almost finished Grade 12.

776
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,425
Yeah, have you thought of what you’ll do next?

777
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,203
Um, I’ll probably help my dad

778
00:58:56,705 --> 00:58:58,700
but I’ll try submitting uni applications as well.

779
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,360
What about you?

780
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,214
I think…

781
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,411
I’ll be serious about being a professional soccer player.

782
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,100
Um.

783
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,556
Then, can I play with you?

784
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,349
Oh, someone like you will play soccer?

785
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:24,290
So sloppy. You’re not gonna make it.

786
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:25,425
Teach me then.

787
00:59:25,454 --> 00:59:28,589
Oh, how many years do I have to teach you till you become skillful?

788
00:59:28,618 --> 00:59:29,730
Not a problem.

789
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:31,767
I will be with you for the rest of my life anyway.

790
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,872
What a smooth talker.

791
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:34,603
Lemme kick you once. You annoying brat.

792
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:35,090
Wanna fight?

793
00:59:35,112 --> 00:59:35,498
Hey.

794
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,807
Gonna hit your neck, man.

795
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,910
So random, brat.

796
00:59:39,585 --> 00:59:39,956
Hey.

797
00:59:39,985 --> 00:59:41,950
Hey, it’s raining.

798
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,080
I have an umbrella.

799
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:57,090
Seeing rain like this

800
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,585
reminds me of the day I first met you.

801
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,690
Out of nowhere, you ran over to my umbrella.

802
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,614
Yeah, now that I think about it,

803
01:00:07,643 --> 01:00:09,003
it’s kind of a coincidence.

804
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,636
It’s called destiny.

805
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,980
You’re being cheesy again, you jerk.

806
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,580
If it’s too cheesy, are you gonna stop being my friend?

807
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,567
Give it to me, you bastard.

808
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:20,378
You just talk nonsense all the time.

809
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:21,861
You jerk.

810
01:00:22,145 --> 01:00:23,145
Damn.

811
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:24,589
Wait for me, I’m all soaked.

812
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:25,301
No.

813
01:00:25,323 --> 01:00:26,916
Do you hate me?

814
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:29,007
Nah.

815
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,527
If not, then…

816
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:32,800
It means you like me.

817
01:00:36,872 --> 01:00:38,123
I don’t like you.

818
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,778
I love you, Saint.

819
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,080
Yeah, I love you, too, Shin.

820
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,396
Damn, the heck you talked about.

821
01:01:09,418 --> 01:01:10,669
Jerk, I’m soaked.

822
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,465
Hold it properly.

823
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,676
What the heck did you just say?

824
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:19,578
I didn’t expect you to have this sweet side.

825
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,352
But I like it, though.

826
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,621
Well, try saying you love me again.

827
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:24,741
No way. No, no.

828
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:25,360
What?

829
01:01:25,396 --> 01:01:26,396
No.

830
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,690
What’s wrong?

831
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:29,490
You just said it a moment ago.

832
01:01:29,512 --> 01:01:30,581
Say it again.

833
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,283
Saint, don’t pester me.

834
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,461
Quickly, quickly.

835
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:34,981
I won’t say it. I’m soaked already.

836
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,396
Damn, I’m all soaked, dude.

837
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:39,120
Me, too cause you pulled it that way.

838
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:40,647
Oh, man. Isn’t it my umbrella?

839
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:42,640
Why don’t you buy a big one?

840
01:01:42,669 --> 01:01:43,854
You’re so big like a giant.

841
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,130
Bastard, it’s because I’m big or what?

842
01:01:46,356 --> 01:01:47,287
You’re the one who’s big.

843
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,349
My umbrella is just right.

844
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,018
It’s mine.

845
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:50,047
Hey.

846
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,029
Shin.

847
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:54,974
My umbrella.

848
01:01:54,996 --> 01:01:56,970
Yeah, I’ll go like this then.

849
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,425
Shin, wait for me.

850
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,690
Damn it.

851
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,087
Do you think our umbrella can make it?

852
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,076
I think it’s kind of okay.

853
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,192
Hold it. I’ll try to fix it.

854
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,610
Not like the more you grab, the more you mess it up, Saint?

855
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:23,690
Does it work?

856
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,549
The umbrella works but not you.

857
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,643
You bastard, wait for me.

858
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:30,665
That’s my umbrella, dude.

859
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:37,672
Shin, please.

860
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,116
Don’t come. I’ll be soaked.

861
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,203
(So, I promise you)

862
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,258
(that you and me)

863
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,247
(will be friends forever.)

864
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:07,460
(From now on, no matter what happens, )

865
01:03:17,883 --> 01:03:19,880
(I’ll never leave you again.)

866
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:25,410
THE END.
