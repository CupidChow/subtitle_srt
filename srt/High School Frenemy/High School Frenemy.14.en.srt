1
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,079
Right now, Cable, our friend,

2
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,287
has been missing since the night before.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,116
I can’t find Cable anywhere.

4
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:23,871
I don’t know where he is.

5
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,343
You’ve grown up so much that you can take care of Cable.

6
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,617
You let him stay at your house without telling us.

7
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:29,562
Mr. Sung.

8
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:31,562
I want to talk to you about Ken.

9
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:32,642
You should leave.

10
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:33,721
Don’t come here again.

11
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:34,382
Do you hear me?

12
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:35,774
Ken.

13
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:40,801
I don’t think I’m suited to be the homeroom teacher of Class 2 anymore.

14
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,641
CRY TOGETHER.

15
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,469
(Sigh.)

16
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,153
What’s wrong with you?

17
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:18,176
Look so damn tense.

18
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,459
You act as if you’ve never stayed over at my place before.

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,276
I’m just happy

20
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:27,771
that you suddenly asked me to stay over.

21
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,342
You got to do so

22
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:32,228
because Chingching asked me for it though.

23
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,850
If my mom didn’t go upcountry,

24
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,679
you wouldn’t get to be here.

25
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:39,213
Yeah.

26
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:42,774
And, what party will we have tonight?

27
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:44,866
Saint.

28
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,537
Chingching.

29
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:54,121
I want to play with Rabbit the Runner you made for me back then.

30
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,476
What?

31
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,048
Rabbit the Runner?

32
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:58,524
Um.

33
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,312
Okay.

34
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,377
Brother will make Rabbit the Runner for you.

35
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,573
Yay.

36
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,436
What are you drawing?

37
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,116
The rabbit’s ears.

38
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,983
Are those the rabbit’s ears?

39
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:21,831
Yeah.

40
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:23,198
Oho…

41
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:26,007
I thought they were dried bananas.

42
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:29,276
Who would draw those dried bananas?

43
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,891
Chingching draws them nicely though.

44
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,509
Right?

45
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:33,758
Yeah.

46
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,882
Chingching, can I have scissors, please?

47
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:51,629
Here, the pink one is yours.

48
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:53,525
Blue is mine.

49
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,247
Why do I get the pink one?

50
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,542
Because the blue color is suitable for a cool and charismatic person like me.

51
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,371
As the pink color is pretty,

52
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,530
suitable for a cute person like you.

53
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:09,099
Hm? Am I cute now?

54
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,441
Shin, don’t tease Saint.

55
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:13,614
Yeah.

56
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:15,665
Come on, Chingching.

57
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:16,951
Are you ready?

58
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,831
Wow.

59
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:19,568
Let’s begin the race of Rabbit the Runners.

60
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:22,462
3, 2, 1. Go.

61
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:23,832
What?

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,748
Yay. I won, I won.

63
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,786
Look at this, look.

64
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,811
Why did Chingching’s move backward?

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,875
1, 2, 3.

66
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,183
Hey, Chingching won again.

67
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:37,713
Woooo.

68
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:40,399
Yay.

69
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,173
1, 2, 3.

70
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,472
Phew.

71
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,333
Oho, Shin. Did you cheat?

72
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:50,719
Yay.

73
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:51,829
Chingching won.

74
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,810
Go tickle Saint.

75
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,340
Hurry up and tickle Saint.

76
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,361
Chingching.

77
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,059
Chingching, help me.

78
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,657
Chingching, you need to side with me.

79
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,788
Right? We’re the same team.

80
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,271
Right? So…

81
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:23,711
Don’t.

82
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,171
Let me go.

83
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,214
Chingching.

84
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:30,379
This is Mr.Wolf who comes to kill the rabbit.

85
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,143
Kill him. Kill him.

86
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:32,903
Take him down.

87
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:33,993
Or else he will kill us.

88
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:55,546
Thanks so much

89
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,576
for asking me to stay over tonight.

90
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,380
I told you it’s Chingching who wanted it,

91
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,650
not me.

92
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,143
But you agreed to this.

93
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,752
Well, Saint,

94
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:18,247
I think we need to do something.

95
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,279
About Ken and Miss Jan.

96
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,980
But what can we do?

97
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,688
He didn’t even listen to the twins, his close friends.

98
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:34,506
(Sigh.)

99
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:44,174
Then, should we do something about Miss Jan first?

100
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:47,293
Yeah, so…

101
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,186
Should we see her at her place tomorrow?

102
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,386
Huh?

103
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,542
Do you know where her house is?

104
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:55,838
Of course.

105
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,619
I delivered food there before.

106
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:01,857
Um.

107
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,241
Let’s talk again tomorrow.

108
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:31,454
After resigning, instead of getting to rest,

109
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,479
I have to organize my house.

110
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,091
Quite tiring.

111
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,073
I’m sorry, dad.

112
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:30,642
Guessed I really could not be a teacher like you.

113
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,032
But I won’t disregard my students.

114
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:13,448
I’ll definitely help my students.

115
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,439
Saint, wait.

116
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:50,056
Not the time yet.

117
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,377
Huh?

118
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,991
Do we need to wait for a lucky time?

119
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,057
Hey, Chadjen, Cable.

120
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,879
This way.

121
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,290
Have you waited for so long?

122
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:05,986
Not at all.

123
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:07,275
We just arrived here, too.

124
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:08,173
Oh.

125
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,734
You invited them, too?

126
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,176
You didn’t tell me.

127
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,183
You don’t need to know everything, right?

128
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:14,928
You just messed with me.

129
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,174
At first, Shin invited only Chadjen.

130
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,211
I was the one who wanted to come along.

131
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:21,851
I also want to talk to Miss Jan.

132
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,810
Actually, I invited many people.

133
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,993
I invited Tew, First, Airy, and Tangmay.

134
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,993
Also Peeta and Eve.

135
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,993
But nobody came.

136
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,519
Then, I’ll ring it now.

137
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,711
Hey, not yet.

138
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,122
Not everyone’s here yet.

139
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:47,312
Huh?

140
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:48,393
Who’s else?

141
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,245
Hey, bro.

142
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,106
We’re here.

143
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,736
Shin, you can even invite these two?

144
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,093
Yeah, aren’t I fabulous?

145
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:05,192
We want Miss Jan to teach again.

146
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,896
We also want her to help with Ken’s issue.

147
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:11,857
Um.

148
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,628
Then I’ll ring the bell for real this time.

149
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:19,265
Yeah.

150
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,174
No need to do that.

151
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,740
You guys talked so loud, I heard it all.

152
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,724
Why don’t we study at a coffee shop?

153
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:05,293
Why do we come to school?

154
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:06,589
So boring.

155
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,931
There’s a library at school.

156
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:09,774
You can search for whatever you want.

157
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,133
Does a coffee shop have one?

158
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:13,884
But school is boring.

159
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,485
Also, I don’t like the library.

160
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,179
If you’re bored,

161
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:20,479
why did you follow me?

162
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:21,872
Huh?

163
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:23,979
Well…

164
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,620
I’m afraid that you might not have anyone tutoring you.

165
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,737
Believe me. If you have me tutor you,

166
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,876
you’ll definitely win the competition.

167
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,152
Fine. I believe you.

168
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:36,636
Oh,

169
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,417
last night, Shin messaged me about Miss Jan.

170
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,028
Yeah, he sent it to me as well.

171
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,340
But I won’t go.

172
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,235
I’m surprised that a person like Shin

173
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,540
actually does something like this.

174
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:57,900
Though Shin seems cold and harsh,

175
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:00,327
actually, he’s very kind.

176
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,614
And this is why

177
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,085
everyone at Udon Pithak loves him.

178
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,205
At first, I was so scared of him.

179
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:08,851
He got into fights every day.

180
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,201
But when he got close to Saint,

181
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:13,953
He changed into a whole new person.

182
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:17,884
I still remember that, at first,

183
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,233
Shin and Saint were on really bad terms.

184
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:21,933
Just like you and me, Eve.

185
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,282
At first, I was so annoyed with you.

186
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:27,475
You always picked a fight with us.

187
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:30,244
It was you who picked a fight with me.

188
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:30,786
What?

189
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,339
Do you still feel annoyed now?

190
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:35,158
Well…

191
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:36,712
Well?

192
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,654
Sometimes.

193
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,598
But when I really get to know you,

194
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:43,968
you’re pretty fine.

195
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,294
Feel quite comfortable when I’m with you.

196
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:49,728
Um,

197
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:52,334
I feel the same.

198
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:59,373
Back then, I thought I only had Peeta as my close friend.

199
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:01,745
But now,

200
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:03,793
seems like I got one more.

201
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,188
Hm? Who told you?

202
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,546
I didn’t want to be your close friend.

203
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:10,478
Or do you want to be my girlfriend?

204
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,105
Are you crazy?

205
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,428
What are you talking about?

206
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:16,981
Don't tell me you're blushing because of me.

207
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,671
No, I’m not.

208
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,032
Then why are your cheeks so red?

209
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:24,642
I’m not blushing.

210
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:25,980
I put some blushes on.

211
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,143
Let me wipe some off then.

212
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:28,791
Hey.

213
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:29,993
No, Eve.

214
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,359
No, don’t touch my pretty face.

215
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:33,854
You guys seem to be close these days.

216
00:15:55,136 --> 00:16:00,076
Never in my life that I have these many guys in my house.

217
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:08,773
Well, what do you want to talk about?

218
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,278
Hey, Shin.

219
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:16,386
You said you wanted to talk with Miss Jan, didn’t you?

220
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,725
What?

221
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,779
Don’t you have one, too?

222
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:21,359
But you started this.

223
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:22,293
You go first.

224
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:23,836
Why do I have to go first? You do it.

225
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:24,487
Say it.

226
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,148
If you are here to talk about my resignation,

227
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:29,712
then…

228
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,247
Don’t resign, Miss Jan.

229
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,179
You are a very good teacher.

230
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,989
All of us want you to continue teaching us.

231
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:51,371
That’s right.

232
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,783
You’re not like other teachers I’ve met.

233
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,293
You don’t judge me.

234
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:01,688
You make me believe that I can be a better person.

235
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:05,013
If you resigned,

236
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,579
who’d help us when we faced problems?

237
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
Without you,

238
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,180
we don’t know who to consult.

239
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:20,580
You are actually the only person in school who cares about us.

240
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,451
What makes you sad?

241
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,383
Why are you crying?

242
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,029
Because I’m glad.

243
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,248
I’m glad that I’m still useful to you guys.

244
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,479
I feel that I still have values.

245
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:18,829
Previously, I felt that I was useless.

246
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:28,091
Though I’m good at and like Thai,

247
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,345
I cannot speak Thai clearly

248
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,008
to the point that it annoyed you.

249
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:46,884
I cannot help my own students either.

250
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:50,785
I’m not the person you guys can trust

251
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,676
and reply to like Mr. Sung.

252
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:05,182
I also did an injustice to Eve and Peeta.

253
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,672
But you didn’t mean to do it.

254
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,641
I know very well that

255
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:17,779
you were pressured by my mom

256
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,779
to change Eve to Peeta.

257
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:25,182
I’ll explain and make them understand.

258
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,751
We really need you, Miss Jan.

259
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:31,943
Please don’t resign.

260
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,090
Thanks so much, everyone.

261
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,287
But I’ve made up my mind.

262
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:00,681
If you weren’t a teacher,

263
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:03,183
what would you do next?

264
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,562
I have no idea right now.

265
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,439
One thing is for sure,

266
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,450
I’ll start with organizing my house.

267
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:17,411
Since I began working as a teacher,

268
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:18,807
I’ve got no time.

269
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:22,481
So, I’ll take this chance

270
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,632
to clean my place a bit.

271
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,792
Well, all of us will help you, Miss Jan.

272
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,447
If you finish cleaning early,

273
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:37,675
you’ll have time to rethink about resignation.

274
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,348
Yeah.

275
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:43,134
Nice idea, Chadjen.

276
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,173
Where is a broom?

277
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,336
Chadjen and Cable, you sweep the floor.

278
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:49,426
Knot, you wipe it later.

279
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:50,868
I’ll clean the windows.

280
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,842
What? Is there anything left for me to do?

281
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:55,343
There are 2 of them.

282
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,940
Do we have to keep this, Miss Jan?

283
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:58,441
Keep it then.

284
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:00,195
Wait, guys.

285
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:01,331
Before cleaning,

286
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,485
should we organize them first?

287
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:05,487
Oh, okay. Quickly organize them then.

288
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,307
Miss Jan, what about these books here? Where should I put them?

289
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,700
I think it’d be messy if they’re kept here.

290
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,071
Never mind.

291
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,065
Where to put this bag?

292
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,493
(Sigh.)

293
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:33,814
(Sigh.)

294
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,783
(Sigh.)

295
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:42,866
(Sigh.)

296
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,300
Hey, why are you sitting in the same spot as her?

297
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:47,977
I'm so uncomfortable.

298
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:52,672
Don’t pay attention to her then.

299
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:56,831
How can I? She is right in front of me.

300
00:21:58,848 --> 00:21:59,848
Hey,

301
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:02,204
can I go and drive her away?

302
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:06,177
Airy, I told you not to mind her.

303
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:07,931
What?

304
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:16,749
Hey, after we finish studying,

305
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,905
should we find something to eat together?

306
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:20,376
I want to have some snacks.

307
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:22,592
Didn’t you say you have to go on a diet

308
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:24,296
because you’re preparing for an audition?

309
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:25,905
Well,

310
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:27,776
I can start tomorrow.

311
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:29,890
But a few days ago,

312
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:31,823
you said the same thing.

313
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,170
Forget it.

314
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,377
Anything yummy is 0 calories.

315
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:36,764
Please, please.

316
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,137
Let’s eat together, Eve.

317
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,108
Please, Eve.

318
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:40,673
- Eve. - Yeah, yeah.

319
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,893
- Really? - Choose the shops then.

320
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:43,933
I can choose now?

321
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,441
Then, when will we go?

322
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:55,441
I just understand 1 question.

323
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,167
But I’m hungry already.

324
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:00,542
My stomach's growling now.

325
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:01,989
It hurts. It hurts.

326
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,791
Can we go now?

327
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,988
2 more questions.

328
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:08,988
2 more?

329
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:10,996
Just 1 more.

330
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:11,740
2 more.

331
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,758
1 more.

332
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:15,192
Eve, girl, I’m hungry.

333
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,266
Oh.

334
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,407
Hi, teachers.

335
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:45,653
Yeah,

336
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,158
hi.

337
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,694
Hi, Mr. Sung and Mr. Jo.

338
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:51,426
Hi.

339
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,370
Why are you here?

340
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,534
We help Miss Jan clean the house.

341
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:01,903
Hm?

342
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,133
Cleaning?

343
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:04,663
Yes.

344
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,339
They’ve pestered me to go back.

345
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,342
Are you two here for the same reason?

346
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:27,672
Please don’t resign.

347
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:32,654
Please come back, Miss Jan.

348
00:24:38,131 --> 00:24:40,888
As you are here,

349
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,779
help us clean and organize the house.

350
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:45,796
Come.

351
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:47,679
Mr. Sung.

352
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:48,742
What?

353
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,288
Let’s go, Mr. Jo.

354
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:51,419
Me too?

355
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:52,516
Come on.

356
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:10,499
Let me do it.

357
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,497
Thanks so much, everyone

358
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,402
for helping me organize my house.

359
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,145
Chadjen.

360
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,543
If I do it alone, it might take many days.

361
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:40,737
As you will have many free days,

362
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:46,239
you’ll have time to rethink about teaching again, right?

363
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:51,958
You’re not going to resign anymore, right?

364
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:57,991
I stand by what I said.

365
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:00,805
I’m not suitable for it.

366
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:06,878
If you were not,

367
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:11,041
then nobody was suitable to teach Class 2.

368
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:16,435
As for me, I can only teach this semester.

369
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:19,642
Without you,

370
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:23,373
the school will have to find someone.

371
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:29,221
Though the homeroom teacher of Class 2 has changed every semester,

372
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:33,044
they are way more behaved this semester.

373
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,181
That’s right.

374
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:39,688
Miss Jan and Mr. Sung were the first ones

375
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,391
who made me realize the real meaning of the term “teacher”.

376
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,091
Thank you.

377
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,383
But I have made up my mind.

378
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:44,380
Airy.

379
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:47,755
Hm?

380
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:48,942
You are done?

381
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,626
Yeah.

382
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:55,081
And will we still go to have snacks?

383
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,745
Let’s go.

384
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:58,376
I know 1 cake shop.

385
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:01,174
Sure.

386
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:20,336
Peeta.

387
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,779
Airy and I will have some snacks,

388
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:37,352
do you want to come with us?

389
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,414
No. You guys can go.

390
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,180
But we’ll go to your favorite cake shop.

391
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,482
So, what?

392
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:50,392
If you want to go there with Airy, just go.

393
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:52,795
Why do you have to say this?

394
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:55,585
Are you done? I’ll continue reading.

395
00:28:57,373 --> 00:28:59,479
I’m trying to make up with you.

396
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,341
Really?

397
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:04,589
But from what I see,

398
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,078
you've replaced me with someone else.

399
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,988
What’s wrong with you, Peeta?

400
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,690
Are you upset only because

401
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:16,591
I’m close to other people?

402
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:19,450
Based on what happened,

403
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:23,771
shouldn’t I be the one mad at you?

404
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:29,256
About the representatives, I was wrong.

405
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,376
I’m sorry.

406
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,191
But I’m also hurt

407
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:33,617
that you’re no longer close to me.

408
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:38,796
I’m not mad about the representatives at all.

409
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:45,555
I’m mad that though you’re my closest friend,

410
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:46,991
You don’t care about me.

411
00:29:47,112 --> 00:29:48,632
You don’t understand me at all either.

412
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,152
Eve, calm down.

413
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,174
Peeta, you know what?

414
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:00,537
Though I just got close to Airy,

415
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,116
she understands me more than you do.

416
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:04,127
Hey.

417
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:06,377
What kind of friends are you?

418
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:11,681
Fine.

419
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,082
From now on,

420
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:14,885
you and I are no longer friends.

421
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,383
Peeta, what did you eat?

422
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:25,679
Nothing.

423
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,128
I saw you ate something.

424
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,798
Can you not bother me?

425
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,540
Just delivering stuff.

426
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,853
Even this easy task, you cannot do it?

427
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,282
I tried, bro.

428
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,282
But someone saw me.

429
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:50,577
He also called the police.

430
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,454
So, I quickly ran away.

431
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,177
You can neither deal with Shin

432
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,365
nor deliver stuff.

433
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:57,893
What the hell can you do?

434
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,278
Huh?

435
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:02,276
I’m sorry, bro.

436
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,614
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

437
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:06,525
Look at me.

438
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:09,500
I’ll give you one last chance.

439
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:12,321
If you fail again,

440
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,291
I’ll get rid of you.

441
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:22,485
Sell these drugs for me.

442
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,528
Sell them to whoever,

443
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:25,724
wherever.

444
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,361
But you have to sell them all out

445
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:28,792
and bring me the money.

446
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:42,906
Go.

447
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:57,091
Being in debt to Jeng like this,

448
00:32:58,501 --> 00:32:59,661
Ken will have it really hard.

449
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:02,588
So he must stay there

450
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,201
until he pays off his debt.

451
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,188
Ken cannot get away from there.

452
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,542
Though he pays off everything,

453
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:19,448
Jeng won’t allow him to leave.

454
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:24,636
Then, what should we do, Mr. Sung?

455
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:27,051
Report to the police?

456
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,391
Doing that will be just a drop in the bucket.

457
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,450
They can't do much about it.

458
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,297
Jeng has a lot of connections

459
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:35,893
and he's really slick.

460
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,296
So tough to catch him.

461
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,545
How can we help Ken then, teachers?

462
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,039
If we let this go on,

463
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,773
I'm afraid we'll never get him back.

464
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:49,422
That’s right.

465
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,992
I’m so scared of the Dragon’s Fang.

466
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,490
I don't want anyone else to get involved with them.

467
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,180
You all don’t have to worry.

468
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:09,780
I’ll find ways to get Ken out of the gang.

469
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,537
Eve, wait.

470
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:49,901
Eve, wait for me.

471
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:51,457
Eve, hey.

472
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:57,734
Are you okay?

473
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:04,490
I know you worry about Peeta.

474
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,082
Why did you poke my lips?

475
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:23,971
To turn on the audio mode.

476
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:26,185
I thought you muted yourself.

477
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,105
Really?

478
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:30,351
I’ll mute you as well then.

479
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:31,691
Hey.

480
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:33,395
I won’t let you mute me easily.

481
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,551
I’ll keep talking, talking, and talking

482
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,589
till your ears bleed.

483
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,593
Oh, no.

484
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,593
You cannot mute me.

485
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:42,068
I’m the one who's gonna mute you.

486
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,313
Stop it.

487
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:56,284
I didn’t want it to turn out this way.

488
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,991
I didn't want to cut ties with Peeta.

489
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:04,788
I cannot do it anymore.

490
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,170
Um, it’s okay.

491
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:11,983
Just cry.

492
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:10,079
Stop over there.

493
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:10,953
Mom might see us.

494
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,413
Can be a bit closer though.

495
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:14,906
Oh, damn.

496
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:15,977
Ride properly, can’t you?

497
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,636
- Just like a kid. - Jerk.

498
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,066
Damn.

499
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,081
I was just kidding.

500
00:37:23,561 --> 00:37:25,451
If mom sees us, it’s gonna be a big problem.

501
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,543
I won’t let you stay over anymore.

502
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,345
I’m sorry, Mr. Shin.

503
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,284
Please let me stay over at your place.

504
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:39,946
It’s paramount to my life.

505
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:42,788
You’re annoying.

506
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:47,604
Shin.

507
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:49,374
(Sigh.)

508
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:50,593
What else?

509
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:52,484
Let me ask you something.

510
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,315
What’s that?

511
00:37:58,497 --> 00:37:59,497
About Ken.

512
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,991
Do you think you can be friends with him?

513
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,783
Friend?

514
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:09,321
You better ask him yourself

515
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,981
if he wants to be my friend.

516
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,825
Ken really hates the Udon Pithak.

517
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,839
I think we need to make him understand

518
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:23,973
that we’re all Class 2.

519
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:27,091
Neither Thep Burapha

520
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:29,324
nor Udon Pithak.

521
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:32,945
We’re classmates.

522
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:44,079
Just like what I did to you?

523
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:51,933
Um.

524
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,176
We can do it little by little.

525
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,090
Yeah.

526
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:05,644
But I don’t think he’ll agree to this.

527
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,188
I don’t even know how to get him out.

528
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,182
I’ll fix everything, dad.

529
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:23,773
I’ll correct all the wrongdoings I’ve done.

530
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,250
Where’s the money?

531
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,242
Hey, you only give me this many?

532
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:56,296
Why do you need so many?

533
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:58,081
You pay only this much,

534
00:43:58,382 --> 00:43:59,462
so that’s all you can have.

535
00:44:02,288 --> 00:44:03,288
Give me more.

536
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,642
(Sigh.)

537
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:06,933
Why do you need so many?

538
00:44:07,066 --> 00:44:07,924
Isn’t it my business?

539
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:09,010
I give you the money

540
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,374
so give me the drugs already.

541
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:11,511
You little brat.

542
00:44:11,828 --> 00:44:12,599
You’re messing with me?

543
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,662
I’ll give you this much,

544
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:15,078
what’s your problem, jerk?

545
00:44:15,254 --> 00:44:16,785
Get lost, you bastard.

546
00:44:25,836 --> 00:44:26,836
Hey, Ken.

547
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:28,481
Are you selling drugs?

548
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,236
Don’t butt in.

549
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,838
Both of you get away from my house.

550
00:44:36,269 --> 00:44:37,391
The hell are you doing?

551
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,038
This is too much.

552
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:40,528
Stop it.

553
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:44,847
I tell you to leave.

554
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,210
We’re not leaving.

555
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,242
We won’t let you be like this.

556
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,647
Why do you two keep bothering me?

557
00:44:56,136 --> 00:44:57,136
Don’t you hate me?

558
00:44:58,848 --> 00:44:59,848
I don’t hate you.

559
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:02,651
We want to be friends with you now.

560
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:08,582
We’re trying to help you.

561
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,042
We know you don’t want to do this.

562
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:13,211
It’s that bastard Jeng who forces you.

563
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:16,576
You have the choices, Ken.

564
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:19,516
But you have to walk away from there.

565
00:45:20,462 --> 00:45:21,462
What f*cking choices?

566
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:23,142
I have none.

567
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,176
There’s no way you two will understand me.

568
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:29,328
We’ll help you earn money to pay off your debt.

569
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,633
How do you know about my debt?

570
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:34,736
The twins told you?

571
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:36,105
Not just me.

572
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:38,028
Mr. Sung and Miss Jan know about this.

573
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:41,685
The twins, bastard.

574
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
They betrayed me.

575
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:45,589
They didn’t betray you.

576
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:47,943
They love you, Ken.

577
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:49,937
That’s why they do this.

578
00:45:51,108 --> 00:45:52,108
You bastard.

579
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:54,251
- Ken, stop. - Don’t bother me, you jerk.

580
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:57,109
Go ahead.

581
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:00,078
You can punch us all you want.

582
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:02,542
We won’t fight you.

583
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:04,850
Sure.

584
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:06,379
You said it yourself, you jerk.

585
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,033
Hey, Ken.

586
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:09,062
Twins, jackasses.

587
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:10,177
Let me go.

588
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:12,102
You guys betrayed me, you bastard.

589
00:46:12,155 --> 00:46:13,377
You told my secret to others.

590
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:15,979
We want to help you.

591
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:19,079
It’s the only way to help you.

592
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:21,776
Help?

593
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:24,225
You call this help, you assh*le?

594
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:24,836
Ken.

595
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:25,496
Huh?

596
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,829
- Get a hold of yourself. - Ken.

597
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:30,253
I’ll help you.

598
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:33,487
You stay out of this.

599
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,888
Ken, I’ll get you out of the Dragon’s Fang.

600
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,398
You guys cannot do anything.

601
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:47,977
Ken, stop it. I beg you.

602
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:51,988
Stop bothering me already, you jerk.

603
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,023
Ken.

604
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:02,022
Go after him.

605
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:03,521
In that bottle, he has Jeng’s drugs.

606
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:04,752
He’s going to sell them.

607
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:21,798
Ken.

608
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:28,265
Ken.

609
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:30,247
Everyone tries to help you.

610
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,361
Ken,

611
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,878
don’t go that way.

612
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,100
If you choose to walk down that path,

613
00:47:43,431 --> 00:47:45,308
you’ll never get to see your friends again.

614
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,690
Please don’t do that, Ken.

615
00:47:50,345 --> 00:47:51,345
Don’t bother me.

616
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:53,456
I’m no longer your student, Miss Jan.

617
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:55,839
But you still call her Miss Jan.

618
00:47:57,561 --> 00:48:00,001
It means you still respect her as your teacher, right?

619
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,879
I don’t study anymore.

620
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:07,985
You guys stop bothering me already.

621
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:09,542
I’m no longer a teacher, either.

622
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:12,872
I’ve resigned from school.

623
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,736
Why did you resign?

624
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,589
Maybe I… have some life problems just like you, Ken.

625
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,250
But I don’t think of wasting my whole life

626
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:39,195
like what you’re about to do.

627
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,053
But I cannot do it that way.

628
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,186
I have to end it myself.

629
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,076
Or else I’ll die.

630
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,847
Nobody can help me.

631
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:01,275
Ken, listen to me.

632
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:05,291
There are still many more things you have to handle them by yourself.

633
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:10,675
Especially what you’ve done yourself.

634
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:15,872
But if you cannot handle them anymore,

635
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,832
you can ask for help.

636
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,321
You still have friends who love you,

637
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:28,751
and those willing to listen to you

638
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:30,505
and support you.

639
00:49:33,543 --> 00:49:34,743
You are not alone, Ken.

640
00:50:06,668 --> 00:50:07,668
Ken.

641
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,540
You can cry.

642
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,828
We’ll cry with you.

643
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:32,968
Ken.

644
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,183
Please don’t go.

645
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,179
Stay with us.

646
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:41,579
Please?

647
00:54:27,051 --> 00:54:28,051
What drug is this?

648
00:54:35,534 --> 00:54:39,088
Jeng named it “The Dragon’s Fang” after the gang’s name.

649
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,340
It’s a new drug

650
00:54:44,121 --> 00:54:45,679
that is popular among the kids.

651
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:47,783
It makes people energized

652
00:54:47,894 --> 00:54:48,894
and don’t feel sleepy.

653
00:54:52,669 --> 00:54:55,832
Well, should we give this to the police?

654
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,542
So, they will take down Jeng’s gang.

655
00:55:02,097 --> 00:55:03,377
I think it’s gonna be difficult.

656
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,386
Jeng is very cautious about this.

657
00:55:07,106 --> 00:55:10,776
Also, nobody knows where the factory is.

658
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:14,651
But the most important thing now is

659
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,319
we must get you out of the Dragon’s Fang.

660
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:24,090
Ken, I’ll pay off all your debt.

661
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:27,408
No way.

662
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:28,631
I cannot do that.

663
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:33,653
Yes, you can. I’ll pay for you.

664
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:39,719
Like I said, though Ken pays off his debt,

665
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:44,088
Jeng won’t let him go.

666
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:48,693
He’ll find ways to keep Ken in his gang.

667
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,019
(Sigh.)

668
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:54,982
So, what can we do, Mr. Sung?

669
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:57,851
Should we just go and attack them?

670
00:55:58,697 --> 00:55:59,752
I’m not afraid of them.

671
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:01,469
That’s a big no, Saint.

672
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:03,177
You cannot do that.

673
00:56:03,617 --> 00:56:05,893
Yes, stop that thought.

674
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,660
Let’s do it this way.

675
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:11,536
Leave the Jeng issue to me.

676
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:15,801
As for you,

677
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:18,983
I want you to go back to school.

678
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,582
Jeng will kill me for sure

679
00:56:27,057 --> 00:56:28,445
if he knows I’m gone.

680
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,236
What if they come to harm my dad

681
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:36,428
when I’m not around?

682
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:38,699
You don’t have to worry.

683
00:56:39,953 --> 00:56:42,250
I seriously won’t let things like that happen.

684
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,217
Thanks for giving me a ride.

685
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,153
It’s okay. No sweat.

686
00:57:22,404 --> 00:57:23,872
Yeah, go inside already.

687
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:24,887
See you.

688
00:57:25,186 --> 00:57:26,186
See you.

689
00:57:26,828 --> 00:57:27,328
Let’s go.

690
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:28,476
Well…

691
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,248
Saint and Shin.

692
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:35,103
Wanna stay over at my place tonight?

693
00:57:38,475 --> 00:57:41,278
So, we will go to school together tomorrow.

694
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:46,214
Anything else to do?

695
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:47,577
Nothing.

696
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,756
And you?

697
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:51,613
Yeah, me neither.

698
00:57:53,186 --> 00:57:54,186
Okay.

699
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:23,884
Hey, let me help.

700
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,730
Sure.

701
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:34,059
Well, Shin, Saint.

702
00:58:35,319 --> 00:58:37,273
You won’t sleep on the bed with me?

703
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:40,675
As if your bed is that large.

704
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:46,391
Uh, actually, if we sleep closely, we can make it.

705
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:52,140
Or one person can sleep on the bed and…

706
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:53,850
Let’s sleep already.

707
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:56,094
I can sleep on the floor with Saint.

708
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,139
Oh,

709
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,351
you want to sleep next to Saint, right?

710
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,042
That’s not it.

711
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:09,121
Hey.

712
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:10,586
I got you.

713
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,831
It’s because I’m too charming, right?

714
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,285
Like hell you’re charming.

715
00:59:15,862 --> 00:59:17,585
Is this charming, jerk?

716
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:19,512
- Charming? - You’re great, huh?

717
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:24,189
Are you the Tsunami?

718
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,078
You dare hit me?

719
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,124
You dare?

720
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,623
It’s heavy, Saint.

721
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:31,807
Let me go.

722
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:32,955
You’re done.

723
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:35,263
Let me go.

724
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:37,788
Uh, Shin, Saint.

725
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,783
Thank you for staying over at my place.

726
00:59:53,482 --> 00:59:54,482
That’s not right.

727
00:59:54,819 --> 00:59:56,659
It’s us who have to thank you for inviting us.

728
00:59:57,503 --> 00:59:58,503
Um,

729
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:00,788
the air con here is so refreshing.

730
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,191
Actually,

731
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,777
I have something important to tell you.

732
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:15,712
What’s that?

733
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:29,484
My time has run out.

734
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:45,247
I have to go abroad now.

735
01:00:50,124 --> 01:00:52,383
I won’t get to see you guys again.

736
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,287
Shin, will you play soccer again?

737
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:50,739
I have no idea.

738
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,125
Maybe?

739
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:54,303
Can I be the first to play soccer with you?

740
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:57,183
If I ever play soccer again, I’ll tell you first.

741
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,145
I’ll wait for that day.

742
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,082
This week is the last week that Chadjen will come to school.

743
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,792
Why is this so sudden?

744
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:06,792
We’re here to get you back.

745
01:02:06,985 --> 01:02:11,487
I want you to be a homeroom teacher for Class 2 again.

746
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:15,282
I think I cannot help the kids at all.

747
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:18,371
I’m not suitable to teach again.

748
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:20,422
Peeta, have you slept at all?

749
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:22,487
You’ll win the first prize for sure.

750
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:24,331
Because everyone thinks so,

751
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,999
I have to work even harder.

752
01:02:26,805 --> 01:02:27,525
Hey. Peeta.

753
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:28,032
Peeta.

754
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:28,715
Peeta, what’s wrong?

755
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:29,205
Peeta.

756
01:02:29,284 --> 01:02:30,284
Peeta.

757
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:32,299
It’s Jeng’s drug.
