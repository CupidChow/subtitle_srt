5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,980
Ken.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,170
Have you heard of Shin’s story

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,500
when he was in Udon Pithak?

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,300
The Tsunami cannot dominate here

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,720
because I’ll get them.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,300
Shin. Don’t.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,770
Saint, aren’t you embarrassed

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,790
being his gofer?

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,460
Since you’re rich enough to pay the fine

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,380
for your friends,

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,900
What are you doing, Chadjen?

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,850
From now on, you better pay for us too.

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,440
The heck are you doing?

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,390
Everyone, stop.

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,590
Everyone, I told you to stop.

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,480
Besides improving our curriculum,

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,860
We think the school environment

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,590
is also important.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,690
We have renovated the buildings

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,030
to look modern and beautiful.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,020
Shall we continue?

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,190
Thamnithit!

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,370
What happened, Saint?

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,040
Who trashed the room?

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,820
Tell me, did you do it, Saint?

30
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,740
Explain it before things get out of hand.

31
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,390
Why does the classroom look like this?

32
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,700
Did you do it?

33
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,700
What were you thinking?

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,920
Class 2 is unbearable.

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,160
All they do is cause trouble and chaos.

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,540
They never pay attention in class.

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,090
Now, you vandalized school properties.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,260
Yes.

39
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,690
I did it.

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,830
You live up to the reputation of Class 2.

41
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,680
That’s right.

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,170
I’m the president of Class 2.

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,340
I need to set an example

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,850
for my classmates, Principal.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,300
What do you mean?

46
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,730
Isn’t Cable the president of Class 2?

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,610
The year, the class voted

48
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,840
to select a new president.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,670
Saint received the highest votes.

50
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,780
A troubled kid like him

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
is selected to be the class president.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,820
Ms. Jan and Mr. Sung, what criteria

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,470
did you use to select the new president?

54
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,590
For you, Saint.

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,940
You’ll be punished and take responsibility

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,900
for all the damages.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,110
A BIG WAR

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,970
Shin.

59
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,490
How do you go home?

60
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,870
Do you want me to give you a ride?

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,370
I can go home by myself.

62
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,080
Do you have any problems?

63
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,650
You can always tell me.

64
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,280
If you have problems with Ken,

65
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,500
I can help you.

66
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,610
You are our class president.

67
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,850
But I don’t need to tell you anything.

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,650
I’m glad.

69
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,890
About what?

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,660
At least, you accept me as your class president.

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,990
Nonsense.

72
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,920
I chose you to be the class president

73
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,560
because I wanted you to learn

74
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,010
about responsibility.

75
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,020
So you won’t treat others like sh*t,

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
the way you did to me.

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,220
I’m sorry.

78
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Hey!

79
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,700
Stop saying you’re sorry.

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,560
Your apology is irresponsible.

81
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,470
Stop trying to be nice to me and my friends.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,350
Everything that you do,

83
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,610
It’s useless.

84
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,410
Saint.

85
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,700
Yes, Ms. Jan.

86
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,240
Did you finish cleaning the toilet?

87
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,930
Yes.

88
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,350
Can I ask you something?

89
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,950
What happened in the classroom?

90
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,830
What was the problem between you guys?

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,540
You can tell me.

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,110
Why do you want to know it?

93
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,470
So I can help you.

94
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,710
Help me?

95
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,200
Why?

96
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,790
I think there is more than what I saw.

97
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,530
Why do you want to know the truth?

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,930
Every teacher in this school

99
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,050
sees Class 2 as trouble kids.

100
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,090
I’m asking you.

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,130
Let it end with me.

102
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,400
Can you take responsibility for all the damages?

103
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,600
It’s a lot of money.

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,200
Tell me the truth.

105
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,050
So I can talk to the principal about it.

106
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,380
If I can’t pay it, you can expel me.

107
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,730
That’s not a solution to the problem, Saint.

108
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,800
So what?

109
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,280
You can’t fix the problem for us.

110
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,940
Then explain to me.

111
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
So I can help you.

112
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,180
Can’t you figure it out by yourself?

113
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,010
Don’t you say you have more life experience?

114
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,530
You know everything.

115
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,760
You can judge everything from your perspective.

116
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,900
Saint.

117
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,110
You don’t need to understand us

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,610
if you already judge us.

119
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,590
Hello, Dad.

120
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,710
Huh? Police station?

121
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,810
What happened?

122
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,330
Okay, I’ll be right there.

123
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,890
I can give you a ride.

124
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,380
No, I can go by myself.

125
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,550
You didn’t bring your motorcycle today.

126
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,730
Let me give you a ride.

127
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,270
I want to help.

128
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,800
Stairs ahead.

129
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,850
Watch your steps.

130
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,830
I got it.

131
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,920
Slowly.

132
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,990
When are you going to get it, Saint?

133
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,210
Huh?

134
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,180
Listen to me.

135
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,880
From now on, don’t take a blow for me.

136
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,300
The debt is mine. I’ll take responsibility for it.

137
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,910
Even if they hit me to death, let them do it.

138
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,920
You don’t need to take the hit for me.

139
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,960
Dad.

140
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,390
Everything that you did,

141
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,720
It’s useless.

142
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,950
It hurts me even more.

143
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,620
Go thank your teacher for giving you a ride.

144
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,490
I’ll take Pok home.

145
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,350
Watch your steps.

146
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,090
I got it.

147
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,990
My dad told me to thank you for the ride.

148
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,900
It’s not a big deal.

149
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,810
Where is your house?

150
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,120
I can give you a ride.

151
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,420
It’s okay.

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,410
My dad and I have to take Pok home.

153
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,800
Pok?

154
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,900
Our noodle cart.

155
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,210
You’re creative with the nickname.

156
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,710
Take your dad home safely.

157
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,360
Yes.

158
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,010
Saint.

159
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
You can carry the weight of the world

160
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,000
on your shoulders.

161
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,290
You have a future.

162
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,110
You need to prepare yourself for it.

163
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,990
It’s okay.

164
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,590
I want to do it this way.

165
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,830
Just let it be.

166
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,490
Are you sure you can take

167
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,990
all the responsibility for what happened?

168
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,330
If I take the blame,

169
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,930
the problem will be over.

170
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,560
This is the best solution.

171
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,650
Thank you for giving me a ride.

172
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,500
Why is that trouble kid your class president

173
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,420
instead of you?

174
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,910
Whose idea was it, Cable?

175
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,370
I…

176
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,200
I stepped down.

177
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,400
Stepped down?

178
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,990
Cable, what were you thinking?

179
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,100
I…

180
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,410
I want to focus on my study.

181
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,130
Being a class president took a lot of my time.

182
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,990
I told you besides your grades,

183
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,560
activities are also important for your portfolio.

184
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,990
It’ll increase your chances

185
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,820
for admission interviews.

186
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,520
It’s not easy to get into a law school.

187
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,770
I’m sorry, Mom.

188
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,990
Go study.

189
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,650
Mom.

190
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,210
Can’t you put Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak

191
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,790
students in separate classrooms?

192
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,740
If they are put in the same class,

193
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,500
there will be more problems.

194
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Some students will be bullied.

195
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,690
Some will get hurt.

196
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,710
But it’s the plan that the school board and I have.

197
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,210
Your only job is to focus on your study.

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,380
You don’t need to hang out with those kids.

199
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,230
You will be the top student in that class.

200
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,420
Do you get it?

201
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,580
Yes.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,060
Go.

203
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,970
Hey, they are here.

204
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh, they brought sticks for us.

205
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,070
I’ll take one. You’re so kind.

206
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,350
I’ll take one.

207
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,000
I’ll take another one.

208
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,100
Thank you.

209
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,140
You, let’s be my partner.

210
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,700
I want to compete with you for some time.

211
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Hey.

212
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,400
You’d better watch out.

213
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,690
If I see you try to mess up with Chadjen again,

214
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,950
I’ll hit you.

215
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,800
So scary.

216
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
Please don’t start a fight.

217
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
That’s right.

218
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,810
Otherwise, we all will be punished.

219
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,300
Go away, Principal’s son.

220
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,890
Don’t butt in.

221
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,670
You guys are assh*les.

222
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,010
You bully even your friends.

223
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,310
Thep Burapha friendship is so fake.

224
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,270
Watch your freaking mouth!

225
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,630
Should I hit your mouth?

226
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,060
No.

227
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,190
You? Ptooey!

228
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,730
- Assh*le.
- Bring it on.

229
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,480
What’s going on?

230
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,070
Nothing.

231
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,240
We are just practicing.

232
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,100
I’m practicing this attack move.

233
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,490
Bang, bang, bang.

234
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,720
I almost broke his head.

235
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,030
I told you to pair up and practice,

236
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,010
not gang up.

237
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
I don’t have a partner.

238
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,830
Is there anyone wanting to be his partner?

239
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,290
Ken.

240
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,390
Do you have a partner?

241
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
I don’t want to be his partner.

242
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,910
I’ll do it.

243
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,960
Okay. Go practice with your partners.

244
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,460
The girls, too.

245
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,200
Practice what I taught you.

246
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,810
Don’t just sit around.

247
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,890
I’ll give you 20 minutes to practice.

248
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,400
I’ll be back and start the test.

249
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,690
Go.

250
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,280
Come on, Shin.

251
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,790
I’ll be your partner.

252
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,130
Bring it on.

253
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,110
I think Shin really hates Saint.

254
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,100
Fight back, Saint.

255
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,210
No.

256
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,820
Are you sure?

257
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,110
Yes.

258
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,190
I’ll never hurt you again.

259
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,390
If this is not enough for you,

260
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,000
you can hit me.

261
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,710
Then I’ll do what you said.

262
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,480
Hey, stop it!

263
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,790
Do you want to be punished?

264
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,760
It’s so hot.

265
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,400
Damn. I feel so sticky.

266
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,400
Let’s go play video games.

267
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,620
I don’t have money. Do you have money?

268
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,830
Don’t worry.

269
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,450
We can find money around here.

270
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,240
Good idea.

271
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,320
You can find money from anywhere.

272
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,970
But don’t try to get it from my friends.

273
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,800
So what?

274
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,000
I kind of like your friends’ money.

275
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,990
It’s easy to get.

276
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,910
I don’t need to work hard to get it.

277
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,750
Stay away from Udon Pithak kids.

278
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,420
All of them.

279
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,900
Why do I need to do that?

280
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,460
I warned you.

281
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,400
Are you my dad?

282
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,710
Why do I need to listen to you, assh*le?

283
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,020
If you are the boss of Udon Pithak,

284
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,150
I’m the boss here.

285
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,300
If you are that worried about your friends,

286
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,240
I can arrange it for you.

287
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,670
I’ll arrange a match for you.

288
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,750
I’ll make you and your friends crawl to me,

289
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,970
begging me to leave your retarded friend.

290
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,850
Assh*le.

291
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,510
Come here.

292
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,640
Stop it.

293
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,730
Go away, jack*ss.

294
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,990
Stop it.

295
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,590
Guys, stop it.

296
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,240
Shin.

297
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,490
Stop it.

298
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,690
Stop it.

299
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,060
Stop it.

300
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,000
That’s enough.

301
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,550
Udon Pithak is such a pr*ck.

302
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,190
You think you are better than us?!

303
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,220
Things turn out this way

304
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,700
because your friend started it.

305
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,800
Don’t start another fight.

306
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,140
We should stop them first.

307
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,950
What the f*ck?

308
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,310
Who do you think you are to order me around?

309
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,050
Then why did you blame us?

310
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,750
What the hell is wrong with you?

311
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,770
Stop it.

312
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,700
Drop your act. It’s so annoying.

313
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,010
Shin, stop it. I’m begging you.

314
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,350
Let me go.

315
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,400
Let me go first.

316
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,370
- Let me go.
- You let go first.

317
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,390
Let me go.

318
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,290
Another hot content, everyone

319
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,840
They are brawling.

320
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,410
This is live entertainment.

321
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,970
Come on.

322
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
This way is also fun.

323
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,170
Let me go.

324
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,590
Let me go, Eve.

325
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,679
Peeta, let me go.

326
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,020
This way is also fun.

327
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,220
You’re an idiot.

328
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,640
Shin.

329
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,850
Stop it, assh*le.

330
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,110
Your job is studying,

331
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,200
not fighting.

332
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,860
Tell me, who started it.

333
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,920
They started it.

334
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,990
Yes, they picked up a fight with us.

335
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,810
It wasn’t my fault.

336
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,500
These b*tches provoked me.

337
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,340
Yes.

338
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,310
Stop lying.

339
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,390
You two hit us first.

340
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh.

341
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,690
Oh.

342
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,940
How did you control your friends?

343
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,450
Why did they hit our girls first?

344
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,780
How did you control your friends?

345
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,120
Why did they badmouth my friends?

346
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,300
But they shouldn’t hit our friends.

347
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,900
Teachers, they attacked us.

348
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,730
Why the hell did you hit my friends?

349
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,360
Teachers, they hurt my friends.

350
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,050
I’ll slap you.

351
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,590
Everyone, that’s enough.

352
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,570
Stop arguing.

353
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,710
Ging, what did you do?

354
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,600
I was filming them.

355
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,530
Do you want to see it?

356
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,820
I recorded everything.

357
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,120
Why didn’t you try to stop them?

358
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,030
Then I wouldn’t get new content.

359
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,790
Fine.

360
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,020
Do you want to get new content?

361
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,020
I’ll punish all of you.

362
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,580
I don’t care who started it.

363
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,360
Since you had a fight,

364
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,300
all of you will be punished.

365
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,630
But I wasn’t a part of the fight.

366
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,936
This way, you will get new content.

367
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,120
Isn’t it good?

368
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,890
In the end, you take your students’ side.

369
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,910
That’s not true, Shin.

370
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,790
We aren’t taking anyone’s side.

371
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,950
But you didn’t listen to us.

372
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,990
You believe what they said.

373
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,380
You only care about Thep Burapha kids.

374
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,510
Shin, we are now one.

375
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,010
There’s no us or them.

376
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,790
All of you are Siamwit students.

377
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,710
No way.

378
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,260
Udon Pithak will never become one

379
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,790
with Thep Burapha.

380
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,140
We can never live in harmony.

381
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,180
That’s right.

382
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,870
Why do we need to be with them?

383
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,710
We don’t want to be with you either.

384
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,010
Enough!

385
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,300
Why are you following me?

386
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,400
I’m not.

387
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,680
My house is also this way.

388
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,100
Stop lying.

389
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,900
You are not good at lying.

390
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,490
You know me well, Shin.

391
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
What are you talking about?

392
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,700
Come on.

393
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,610
We are alone.

394
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,400
You don’t need to be shy.

395
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,900
Shy about what?

396
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,790
I’ll punch you.

397
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,970
Sorry. I’m kidding.

398
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,020
Why are you so quiet when you’re at school?

399
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,900
It’s so not you.

400
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,190
Why are you acting like that?

401
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,910
You talk so much when you are with me.

402
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,890
I talk a lot

403
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,840
only with people I feel comfortable with.

404
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,600
But I don’t feel comfortable with you.

405
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,810
But you once did.

406
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,690
Then I still have a chance to make up with you.

407
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,420
Damn it.

408
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,400
Shin.

409
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,590
Don’t worry about Chadjen.

410
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,560
I’ll take care of it.

411
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,900
I’ll help your friend.

412
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,390
I’m not asking for your help.

413
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,240
If you were me,

414
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,520
you would have done the same.

415
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,190
Stop acting like you know me well.

416
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,030
My friends are upset because Ken

417
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,080
and his minions are picking on Chadjen.

418
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,700
I know that.

419
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,300
That’s why I’m doing this.

420
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,710
Do you think if Ken is punished

421
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,510
for picking on Chadjen,

422
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,310
will the problem be solved?

423
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,080
They will be even angrier at Udon Pithak kids.

424
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,800
I’m doing this

425
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,210
for you and your friends.

426
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,160
What you are doing is useless.

427
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,100
Udon Pithak and Thep Burapha

428
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,040
can never live in harmony.

429
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,690
Just like you and me.

430
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,550
You are here.

431
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,890
I’ve been looking for you.

432
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,200
Looking for me?

433
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,110
Why?

434
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,200
I want to thank you.

435
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,530
Thank me?

436
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,300
For what?

437
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,170
You took the blame for me.

438
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,590
Otherwise, I would have been suspended.

439
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,220
My dad would be mad at me.

440
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,810
You don’t need to thank me.

441
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,990
It’s not a big deal.

442
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,910
No.

443
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
If someone helps me,

444
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,790
I need to thank them.

445
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,720
To repay your friendship

446
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,180
When we are friends with someone,

447
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,500
friendship is the most important thing.

448
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,490
Shin told me that.

449
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,010
Are you close with Shin?

450
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,050
Yes.

451
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,730
Shin is my best friend.

452
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,430
He always protects me

453
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:05,950
when someone teases or bullies me.

454
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,870
But you are often bullied here.

455
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,060
Wouldn’t it be better to move to a new school?

456
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,200
No.

457
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,480
I want to be with Shin.

458
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,610
I guess Shin is your only close friend.

459
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,460
Yes.

460
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,630
He is the best friend I’ve ever had.

461
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,090
That’s true.

462
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,560
He’s the best friend.

463
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,970
Saint.

464
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,690
Should I tell the teachers?

465
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,570
That I threw the chair out of the window.

466
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,810
Don’t do it, Chadjen.

467
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,370
It’s best to let them believe that I did it.

468
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
Why?

469
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,440
If you are going to be punished,

470
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,080
Shin will never let it happen.

471
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,000
Things will get worse.

472
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,300
I’m so sick of school lunch.

473
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,570
Look.

474
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,850
Damn it.

475
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,470
What the f*ck are you doing?

476
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,010
Sorry.

477
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,010
I’m just throwing trash into a can.

478
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,760
I guess I missed it.

479
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,810
You can get corky anywhere.

480
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,860
But not with me, jack*ss.

481
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,330
Tew.

482
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,920
Who did this?

483
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,700
Let’s call it an even.

484
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,830
An even? F*ck you.

485
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,290
We didn’t pick up a fight with you this morning.

486
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,070
I’ll make your mouth unable to eat anything.

487
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,500
Assh*le.

488
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,930
Shin.

489
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,570
Stop it. Go away.

490
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,490
Stop it. Let her go.

491
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Don’t butt in.

492
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,070
Don’t do it.

493
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,690
If you have a fight here,

494
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,790
the principal will know it.

495
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,220
F*ck you, Saint.

496
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,160
Are you betraying our fellows?

497
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,170
No, I’m just stopping them.

498
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:06,990
Don’t butt in.

499
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,320
Go away.

500
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
F*ck off.

501
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,380
You, brat.

502
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,890
Did you hit me?

503
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,450
I got another content.

504
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,690
Shin.

505
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,770
You did this to Thep Burapha kids.

506
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,890
You want to start a war,

507
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,250
don’t you?

508
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,240
You also want to start a war, right?

509
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,360
You started it.

510
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,330
Eve and Peeta are being attacked

511
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,290
by your friends in the lady’s room.

512
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,780
That’s Airy’s business, not mine.

513
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,200
But if you mess up with Udon Pithak kids,

514
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,390
I’ll punch you in the face.

515
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,910
That’s easy

516
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,810
After the last class is over,

517
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,170
Come to meet me at the basketball court.

518
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,710
So we will know…

519
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
whether Thep Burapha

520
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,470
or Udon Pithak,

521
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,200
who is the king?

522
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,640
Shin, don’t do it.

523
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,420
Saint, assh*le.

524
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,310
Don’t butt in.

525
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,480
Do you hear me?

526
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,380
I warn you.

527
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,830
If you lose,

528
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,990
you and Thep Burapha kids have to stay away

529
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,920
from Udon Pithak kids especially Chadjen.

530
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,530
Don’t ever come near him.

531
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,400
If you lose,

532
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,800
that dork and you will be crushed.

533
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,270
We’ll see.

534
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,040
Miss Jan.

535
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,280
I was the one

536
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,460
who threw the chair out of the window.

537
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,430
What happened, Chadjen?

538
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,800
Why did you do that?

539
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,000
I…

540
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,780
Ken and his friends extorted money from me.

541
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,190
And…

542
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,490
Shin helped me.

543
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
So they were hitting Shin.

544
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,880
I was scared

545
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,800
and didn’t know how to help him.

546
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,400
So I…

547
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,000
I threw the chair out of the window.

548
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,680
Everyone, get out of the room.

549
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,180
The principal is downstairs.

550
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,380
Go.

551
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,330
Ken, go.

552
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,700
Girls, you too.

553
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,120
I’ll take the blame.

554
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,960
What are you doing this for?

555
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:49,770
You should get out

556
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,090
before the teachers get here.

557
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,070
Take your friends with you.

558
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,040
Go.

559
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,520
It’s okay, Chadjen.

560
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,460
It was not your fault.

561
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,990
I’ll punish Ken and his friends.

562
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,110
Please don’t do that.

563
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,090
Don’t worry.

564
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,290
I’ll make sure they will be punished.

565
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,500
If you do that, things will get worse.

566
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,330
Why?

567
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,270
What did they threaten you?

568
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,210
If you punish them,

569
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,900
they will be mad.

570
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,980
After that,

571
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,000
there will be a bigger war among the students.

572
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,710
A war?

573
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,910
What are you talking about?

574
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,680
Umm…

575
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,070
This evening, Ken and Shin…

576
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,580
They are going to have a fight.

577
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,360
I knew that Saint didn’t do it.

578
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,240
But I didn’t think

579
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,910
that Chadjen was also a part of it.

580
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,790
What are you going to do about it?

581
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,110
I’m thinking.

582
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,600
If I tell Mr. Pokpong about this,

583
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,700
he will tell the principal.

584
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,010
It will become a big problem.

585
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,190
The students might be expelled.

586
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,290
But we should detain Ken and his friends.

587
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,200
At least, we can stop the fight.

588
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,600
It’s just like what Saint did.

589
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,090
We just delay it.

590
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,780
If they want to have a fight,

591
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,880
they can use anything as an excuse to start a fight.

592
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,300
So are we going to do nothing about it?

593
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,980
No.

594
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,390
I’m gathering evidence.

595
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,600
What evidence?

596
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,650
The evidence to convict Ken and his friends

597
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,070
for extorting money from Chadjen.

598
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,810
Shin.

599
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,430
Is there no way for me to stop you?

600
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,930
You know the answer.

601
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,950
What do I need to do for you to stop?

602
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,230
Stop bugging me. It’s annoying.

603
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,970
I’m worried about you.

604
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,090
Don’t worry about me.

605
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,410
Stop it.

606
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,670
I’m begging you.

607
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,870
I told you.

608
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,200
You and I are not friends anymore.

609
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
So I don’t care what you think.

610
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,410
I don’t believe you.

611
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,830
Look at me in the eyes.

612
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,280
Say it again.

613
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,090
Say that you don’t care about me.

614
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,690
I won’t do it.

615
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,610
I hate you.

616
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,460
Let’s find out…

617
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,310
who will rule Siamwit.

618
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,830
Let’s end it today.

619
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,090
I don’t care who will rule this damn school.

620
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,190
Just stay away from my friends.

621
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,200
I’ll break your damn skull.

622
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,360
You’re freaking annoying me.

623
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,290
I’ll hit you.

624
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,550
Hey.

625
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,400
Ken, stop it.

626
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,540
Don’t fight with our classmates.

627
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,620
Saint, assh*le.

628
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,870
What the f*ck are you doing?

629
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,160
Get out of the way.

630
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,350
I’m asking you.

631
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,150
You know whose fault it was for what happened.

632
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,490
Saint, whose side are you taking?

633
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,750
Aren’t you a Thep Burapha student?

634
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,810
I’m not taking anyone’s side.

635
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,500
Saint, if you don’t want your ass to be kicked,

636
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,120
then get out.

637
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,210
If you want to kick someone’s ass,

638
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,090
Then do it to me.

639
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,090
Fine. I can do it.

640
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,990
I’ve been waiting for this chance.

641
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,590
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

642
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,900
You’re a Thep Burapha fellow, jack*ss.

643
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,630
Do you hear me, assh*le?

644
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,160
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

645
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,780
What the heck is this?

646
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,030
They are attacking their own fellow.

647
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,870
Did Saint lose his mind?

648
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,310
Your body is made from steel or something?

649
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,230
Guys.

650
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,250
Stop it.

651
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,300
Stop hitting him.

652
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,480
Miss Jan.

653
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,580
This teacher is f*cking annoying.

654
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,680
Please don’t hurt her.

655
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,990
Get out of my way.

656
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,720
Saint, how dare you?!

657
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,270
Let me go.

658
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,960
You finally show your true color.

659
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,310
Let me go, Saint.

660
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,520
(Kasidit, Nattaphat, Nattakit.)

661
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,810
(Come to meet me in my room now.)

662
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,790
(I repeat come to see me right now.)

663
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,390
What the f*ck is this?

664
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,290
(If you don’t come to my room in three minutes.)

665
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,970
(I’ll call your parents.)

666
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,010
Damn. This is so lame.

667
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,770
Guys.

668
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Let’s go home.

669
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,480
See you.

670
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,400
I’ll call you when I am done.

671
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,890
Come on, assh*le.

672
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,200
Damn it.

673
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,510
Saint, are you okay?

674
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,700
What?

675
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,100
Chadjen, what are you doing?

676
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,920
Where are you going?

677
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,590
Since you’re rich enough to pay the fine

678
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,180
for your friends,

679
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,440
from now on, you better pay for us too.

680
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,260
You extorted money from Chadjen.

681
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,850
Then you had a fight with Shin

682
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,520
when he tried to help Chadjen.

683
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,110
Ging, did you betray us?

684
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,580
I didn’t tell him.

685
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,940
But he thought that

686
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,840
I probably have the video clip of the incident.

687
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,900
A good thing about content seekers,

688
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,100
They’re always present where troubles happen.

689
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,760
Damn it.

690
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,440
Damn you, Ging.

691
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,390
What about you, Eve and Peeta?

692
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,860
Are you telling us off

693
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,970
to get away from your penalty?

694
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,330
I didn’t tell him anything.

695
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,980
Mr. Sung told us to come here.

696
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,080
You not only refuse

697
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,790
to own up to your wrongdoings.

698
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,890
You also threaten your friends.

699
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,920
You guys are so wussy.

700
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,110
If I show this video to the principal.

701
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,800
You will be expelled.

702
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,170
Your parents will be okay with it, right?

703
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,730
What do you want?

704
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,770
It’s simple.

705
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,940
Stop fighting.

706
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:45,350
Stop bullying your classmates.

707
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,710
If I find out that you’re still doing it,

708
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,980
I’ll show this video to your parents.

709
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,030
At least, you will have to pay a fine.

710
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,650
Because you damaged school’s properties.

711
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,780
Are your parents willing to pay for it?

712
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,790
Why did Thamnithit take the blame alone?

713
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,110
He didn’t want Udon Pithak students

714
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,410
to have a fight with Thep Burapha students.

715
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,560
If they both were punished,

716
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,500
Udon Pithak students would never stop

717
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,590
until they got their revenge.

718
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,800
These kids only use force to solve problems.

719
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,990
That’s why Thamnithit took the blame.

720
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,010
To be honest, I was wrong about this kid.

721
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,100
Although his past doesn’t look good,

722
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,100
he’s a good kid.

723
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,700
He’s a good kid?

724
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,300
I don’t believe it.

725
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,170
Just wait and you’ll see

726
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,100
that he will cause another problem.

727
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,420
Are you going to punish

728
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,020
the kids who were involved in the fight?

729
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,900
What about the damages?

730
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,500
The damages have been paid already.

731
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,490
Who paid for it?

732
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Chadjen’s father.

733
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,580
It seems that Chadjen

734
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,100
will not finish this semester here.

735
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,980
He will move to another school.

736
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,890
I have an announcement to make.

737
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,010
From today on,

738
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,910
If you are late for school,

739
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,510
You will be fined 100 baht

740
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,090
and memorize 50 English words with me.

741
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,830
What?

742
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,300
I don’t want to do it.

743
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,009
Or if you don’t want to

744
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,040
memorize 50 English words,

745
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,080
you can memorize Thai poems with Miss Jan.

746
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,890
I don’t want to memorize anything.

747
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:47,930
You are so annoying.

748
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:49,890
Should I increase it to 100 words?

749
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,530
No, I don’t want to do it.

750
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,470
150 words?

751
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,300
Class.

752
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,790
You don’t need to do that.

753
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,990
Class 2.

754
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,010
You know that you caused embarrassment

755
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,610
and damages to our school,

756
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,270
with your fight and vandalism.

757
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,520
You cause trouble almost every day.

758
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,980
This time, we will not punish you.

759
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,780
It’s an exception.

760
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:49,120
But we want to have an agreement with you.

761
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,800
From now on, if any of you use violence,

762
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,000
or start a fight in school,

763
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,960
If you are caught, you will be expelled.

764
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,090
Stay. I’ll leave.

765
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,800
About Ken,

766
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,160
I think you shouldn’t play his game.

767
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,530
It’s not worth it.

768
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,930
I’ll do whatever I want.

769
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,780
If you don’t stop, you will be expelled.

770
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,100
Listen to me.

771
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,680
You have a future waiting for you.

772
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,100
How can you say that?

773
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,050
My future has been ruined since then.

774
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,990
Because of a sc*mbag like you.

775
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,280
I’m sorry.

776
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,350
I’ll do everything you tell me to do.

777
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,100
But can you do one thing for me?

778
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,600
Can you be my friend again?

779
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,480
That friend of mine.

780
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,110
He was honest.

781
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,530
He never abandoned me.

782
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,520
He never ran away from problems.

783
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,630
Jack*ss.

784
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,410
Aren’t you going to pay me back?

785
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,170
Why don’t you pay me back?

786
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,300
Shin.

787
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,100
What are you doing to my friend?

788
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,960
He doesn’t pay me back.

789
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,640
So he’s getting beaten up.

790
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,200
Take my money.

791
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,510
300 baht is not enough.

792
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,230
He owed me over 1,000 baht.

793
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,660
Fine.

794
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,600
I’ll find money to pay you back.

795
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,960
If you can’t pay me now,

796
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,020
I have to kick him as a deposit.

797
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,180
No.

798
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,520
Saint.

799
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Won’t you pay me back?

800
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,610
Jack*ss.

801
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,660
Assh*le.

802
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,750
Get out.

803
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,120
Saint.

804
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,450
Pr*ck.

805
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Bastard.

806
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,460
Come on.

807
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,130
My head.

808
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,210
Are you okay, Shin?

809
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,780
You should worry about yourself first.

810
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,410
Why did you take their kicks for me?

811
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,800
It’s less hurt if we share the kicks.

812
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,060
One more thing, I’m a man of steel.

813
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,830
This can’t do anything to me.

814
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,090
My head really hurts.

815
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,600
Let me take a look.

816
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,790
Okay, it’s not broken.

817
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,520
Come on.

818
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,510
Give me your other hand.

819
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,550
Damn.

820
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,170
Get up slowly.

821
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,000
Stop and sit down.

822
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,100
What are you doing?

823
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,140
I’m carrying you.

824
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,280
Get on.

825
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,760
No. I don’t need it.

826
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,300
I can walk.

827
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,810
Get on.

828
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,420
Saint.

829
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,630
Give me the other hand.

830
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,010
One, two.

831
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,230
Damn it. My back!

832
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,690
Saint.

833
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,280
What?

834
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,230
Thank you.

835
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,230
You don’t need to thank me.

836
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,400
We are friends. It’s not a big deal.

837
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,510
I’m sorry.

838
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,800
You are getting hurt because of me.

839
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,990
It’s okay.

840
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,520
I can take the pain for you.

841
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,000
Jack*ss, don’t act so proud.

842
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,680
I’ll bite your ear off.

843
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,830
Dumb*ss, why didn’t you say anything

844
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,510
when you were beaten up?

845
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,600
You laid on top of me

846
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,570
when they were kicking us.

847
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,070
You were so damn heavy.

848
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,350
Stop talking, assh*le.

849
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,020
Unfortunately,

850
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,020
that friend of mine…

851
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,310
he was dead.

852
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,310
A guy like you can never replace him.

853
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
Hello.

854
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,100
Is this okay?

855
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,180
Hello.

856
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,940
Hello.

857
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,810
Hello.

858
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,200
Did you defeat him?

859
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,870
I hadn’t started yet.

860
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
They stopped the fight first.

861
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,020
I knew you were losers.

862
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,710
Ken, do you want to join my gang?

863
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,120
Of course.

864
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,960
Listen to my words.

865
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,260
If you can’t defeat Udon Pithak kids,

866
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,410
you will never get to join my gang.

867
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,620
I’ll give the three of you another chance,

868
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,560
Defeat Shin.

869
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,130
Crush him.

870
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,340
Do everything to make sure

871
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,560
that he has no place in Siamwit.

872
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,170
Yes.

873
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,190
What the hell are you doing?

874
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:44,950
Nonsense.

875
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,090
What nonsense about it?

876
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,290
My little worm is cute.

877
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,220
Are you and Shin close?

878
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,870
I want you to make Shin shed tears.

879
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,130
If you can do it, I will forgive the debt.

880
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,629
You all will have to suffer

881
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,620
more than my friend does right now,

882
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,490
you bastard.

883
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,570
Beat him up.
