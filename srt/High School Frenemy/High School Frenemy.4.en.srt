Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,977
From now on, if any of you use violence,

6
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,022
or start a fight in school,

7
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,173
you will be expelled.

8
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:24,808
What do I need to do for you to stop?

9
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,702
Udon Pithak and Thep Burapha

10
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:28,008
can never live in harmony.

11
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,413
Ken, do you want to join my gang?

12
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:30,746
Subdue Shin.

13
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,706
Crush him.

14
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,982
Make sure he has no place in Siamwit.

15
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,320
There are 20 questions in total.

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,977
You guys got…

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,644
4 scores.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,084
2 scores.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,257
7 scores.

20
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:51,511
4 scores.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,510
You even guessed it wrong.

22
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,191
You could answer not even half of them.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,457
Mr. Sung and I tested your basic knowledge

24
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,208
in Thai and English.

25
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,910
And the score is not nice.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,115
If this continues,

27
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,866
you guys will definitely get an F.

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,657
From now on,

29
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,995
you have to attend a foundation class

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,088
with me after school.

31
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:16,960
What?

32
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:17,671
No. I won’t study.

33
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:18,231
We don’t want to.

34
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:19,350
We won’t study.

35
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,551
No study.

36
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:22,204
Why do we have to study?

37
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:22,702
If we got an F,

38
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:24,127
we could just remediate it, couldn’t we?

39
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,413
There is no need to study more.

40
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:27,333
Hey, this brat said it nice.

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,546
Besides getting an F,

42
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,111
you might forget that

43
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,933
there is a thing called “IE”.

44
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,328
Pretty wife.

45
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:35,315
Don’t get involved.

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,124
Your mother.

47
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:37,937
What is “IE”, teacher?

48
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,315
Ineligible for Exam.

49
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,822
If any of you got an IE,

50
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,155
be prepared to repeat the grade

51
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,373
and study again.

52
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,982
Homeroom is over.

53
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,822
I’ll leave the test paper here.

54
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,448
Check by yourself what you missed.

55
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,644
Class.

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,782
Goodbye.

57
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,271
I’ll regrade then.

58
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,826
I think the first person who will get an IE

59
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,631
is our class president for sure.

60
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,351
Ging! Quickly take a photo.

61
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:12,275
You passed.

62
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:13,671
How much did I get?

63
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:14,755
10.

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,750
Not over 15, it’s a boo.

65
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:18,275
You, son of the principal.

66
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,937
Shin, you prick.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,600
TSUNAMI.

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,936
COVID POSITIVE.
PLACE THE FOOD HERE.

69
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,444
Aren’t you full?

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,737
You ate 2 cups of ice cream already.

71
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,555
Saint.

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Chingching.

73
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,831
Long time no see.

74
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:42,808
You grew up a lot.

75
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,168
You grew up, too. You looked quite tired.

76
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,884
You started to talk back now.

77
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,422
Have you eaten?

78
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,071
Yes.

79
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,360
You nap a lot during the day

80
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:54,728
because of this?

81
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,071
You must have changed for real.

82
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:06,853
But one's true nature is unlikely to change.

83
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,648
What does ‘true nature’ mean?

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,746
It’s nothing.

85
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,377
Like a bad personality.

86
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,302
Does Saint have a bad personality?

87
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,644
Chingching, listen to me.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,413
Sometimes we know a person.

89
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:31,511
We know his face.

90
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,835
But we don’t know his mind.

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Just your friend, Krapookwhan.

92
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,835
She gave you the milk at lunch,

93
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,075
but in the end,

94
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:46,506
she told the teacher that you stole her milk.

95
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,591
Can you remember? You told me before.

96
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:54,275
This is the meaning of a bad personality.

97
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,075
We don’t know

98
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,924
when our friends might hurt us.

99
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,231
Has Saint told the teacher that

100
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,844
you stole his milk?

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,844
Do you want me

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,038
to send you and your sister home?

103
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:13,182
So you don’t have to walk.

104
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,180
Let’s go. My legs are sore.

105
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:16,391
No.

106
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,422
Why? My legs are sore.

107
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,684
Let me send you home.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,364
No need.

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,253
My sister and I can go back by ourselves.

110
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,377
Chingching, if your legs are sore,

111
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:28,764
then ride on my back.

112
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,435
If you don’t want me to give you a ride,

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,822
then take my bike. I’ll follow you.

114
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,751
Can you stop bothering me?

115
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:42,480
Shin, don’t fight. Saint just wants to help.

116
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Then, let’s go back home.

117
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,946
Ride on my back. Come on.

118
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,884
Okay but Saint has to come along.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,053
I miss Saint.

120
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,311
Cannot.

121
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,391
Then I won’t go back home.

122
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:03,768
Chingching.

123
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:11,760
Sigh.

124
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,653
Fine. Okay.

125
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,933
But follow us from a distance.

126
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:26,364
Don’t let me see your face or speak up.

127
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,644
Okay.

128
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,746
I’ll follow you.

129
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,866
Come on, Chingching.

130
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Huff.

131
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Hey.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,075
Sigh.

133
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,853
Shin.

134
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,208
Hmm?

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,035
Why aren't you friends with Saint anymore?

136
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,608
Did you have an argument or something?

137
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,844
It's an adult matter.

138
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:02,222
Kids wouldn't understand.

139
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:03,768
You are also a kid.

140
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:06,204
Mom said you haven’t grown up.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,382
Hold on, are you negging me?

142
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,840
I won’t buy you snacks.

143
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:10,462
If you won't buy it for me,

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,444
then you cannot sleep with me.

145
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,248
Saint, are you tired?

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,742
I’m good.

147
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,577
Wait. Turn back first.

148
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,730
What for?

149
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a kids' matter, you don’t need to know.

150
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,484
You're good at being sarcastic.

151
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,990
Sigh.

152
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,662
Saint, bye bye.

153
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:57,271
Uh-huh. Bye bye.

154
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,693
Satisfied now, Chingching?

155
00:08:58,728 --> 00:08:59,262
Uh-huh.

156
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,480
Let’s get in.

157
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,106
You should go back now.

158
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,430
Shin.

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Your bag.

160
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,213
Hi, bro.

161
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,728
Hi.

162
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:55,755
Hi.

163
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,337
This month's money.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,280
You owned me more, Ken.

165
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:18,000
I only have this much now, bro.

166
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,650
But I will quickly find the money to pay you back.

167
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,204
I have an offer for you.

168
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,200
What offer?

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,377
I want you to make Shin shed tears.

170
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,937
If you can do it, I will forgive the debt.

171
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,497
Why does it have to be Shin, bro?

172
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,915
Will you do it or not?

173
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,093
I’ll do it.

174
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,090
Such an easy task.

175
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,351
I already hate that bastard.

176
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,520
Girl.

177
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:26,115
What?

178
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:27,840
Have you done your homework?

179
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,888
What about you?

180
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:29,777
Not yet.

181
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,720
Hey.

182
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:31,653
So, you…

183
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:32,577
You neither finished the homework

184
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:34,035
nor read the poem, right?

185
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,968
Yes.

186
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:35,920
Why?

187
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:36,684
Oh my.

188
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:37,711
Is it the first period?

189
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,744
Airy, you have to recite the poem in the first period.

190
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,060
You didn’t practice so you are done.

191
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:41,582
Nah,

192
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,247
I think those in the front will be called.

193
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:43,760
That one in the front?

194
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:44,151
Not us.

195
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,564
Let them do it.

196
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,831
Airy, if you are sleepy,

197
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,537
help me read page 30.

198
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:01,688
Marching troops through the wide area,

199
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:04,560
loud sounds of horses and elephants.

200
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:07,848
Echoing on the highway,

201
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,711
passing through the pagoda.

202
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,155
Ayu…

203
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,168
Ayuttha…

204
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,728
Ayuttha... Ya? Ya?

205
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,177
Hey, teacher. It’s too long.

206
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,928
What language is this?

207
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:29,368
It's too difficult to read.

208
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:33,422
Why do you ask us to read these poems?

209
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,986
I don't see any benefit at all.

210
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,311
I’m about to teach you all how to interpret it.

211
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:42,213
Sigh.

212
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:42,897
Alright,

213
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,573
is there anyone who can interpret the poem

214
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,893
that my friend just read?

215
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,222
Anyone?

216
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,480
Miss Jan. Nobody can answer this.

217
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,337
Can you just teach the important parts

218
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,177
and skip this kind of interpretation?

219
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,000
We're all going to fall asleep.

220
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:21,075
Why do they let the foreigner teach Thai?

221
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,244
Right. I don’t understand anything.

222
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah, I cannot understand what she said.

223
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,680
Miss Jan.

224
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:35,422
I will continue reading then.

225
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,902
I’m sleepy now so I might wake up.

226
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:40,244
Go ahead.

227
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,875
Well, what are we studying now?

228
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,170
Almost perfect, my friend.

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,831
Thai Language.

230
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,244
Oh. Okay.

231
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,151
Which page again?

232
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,071
30.

233
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,213
So stupid.

234
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:48,204
Sigh.

235
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,120
Secretly taking a nap?

236
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,497
Sigh.

237
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,631
It’s you again?

238
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,262
Yeah. It’s me.

239
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,662
Sigh. Stay away from me.

240
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,060
But I’m here before you.

241
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,097
Tsk.

242
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,120
Hey, I’m kidding.

243
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,853
Sit down.

244
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:18,850
If you want to nap,

245
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,337
you come to the right place.

246
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,304
This room has the coolest air conditioning

247
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,053
in the whole school.

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,111
Just go wherever you want.

249
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,755
I’ll sleep.

250
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,591
Good.

251
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,235
I’ll sleep some more, too.

252
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,560
It’s your business and stay quiet.

253
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,368
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:45,591
Well, it’s a paper worm.

255
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,875
You played it with me back then.

256
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:48,924
Remember?

257
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,555
Nonsense.

258
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,008
What nonsense about it?

259
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,813
My little worm is cute.

260
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,213
I KNOW THAT / YOU ARE ANGRY AT ME / ’M SORRY. / I WAS WRONG.

261
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,906
Actually, I want to write longer.

262
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,942
But there isn’t enough space.

263
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,360
You better stop bothering me.

264
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Shin.

265
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:30,177
You can make me apologize for the rest of my life

266
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,524
because I know what I did to you

267
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,346
was really terrible.

268
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Shin.

269
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,506
Let go of my arm.

270
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,822
If you don’t, I’ll punch you.

271
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,844
Then just punch me.

272
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:50,622
I deserve it.

273
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:38,960
Hey, you almost eat all my snacks.

274
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,102
Hmm? Sorry.

275
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,026
Can you take this instead?

276
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,928
Tew.

277
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,968
You… Don’t tease Chadjen.

278
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,826
You always look for troubles.

279
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,400
So protective of him.

280
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,567
Why don’t you change the gang’s name

281
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,280
from Tsunami to Chadjen’s?

282
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,146
What’s wrong with you?

283
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,004
Your face looks so grumpy.

284
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,088
I’m bored. Too lazy to study.

285
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,560
Right. Me, too.

286
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,986
Really hate this place.

287
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,751
If you hate it, then leave.

288
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,750
Why do you have to butt in?

289
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,968
With that smart mouth, can I kiss you once?

290
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,811
How about kissing my feet first, you bastard?

291
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:27,626
Wow, so cool.

292
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:28,871
Kiss your feet?

293
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:31,075
How about you get a punch first instead?

294
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:32,127
I punch you first, you bastard.

295
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:33,048
I'll sock you right in the face.

296
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,675
Hey, hey. Are you a thug, you jerk?

297
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:35,711
Calm down.

298
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:37,360
Don’t bother with them.

299
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,946
What the hell is the Tsunami?

300
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:43,733
Such a coward.

301
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:45,920
I have heard them.

302
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,413
Tsunami was good at fighting.

303
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,755
Even ten against one couldn’t take them down.

304
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,982
Oh wow, are they that good?

305
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,937
The legend of the Udon Pithak

306
00:19:55,964 --> 00:19:57,930
who took down a big gang by himself.

307
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,200
By himself?

308
00:19:59,235 --> 00:19:59,875
So cool.

309
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,635
But when I actually met him,

310
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:02,933
he was just so-so.

311
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,040
Just so-so. Not that great.

312
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,684
Go wherever you want.

313
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,008
Don’t bother with us.

314
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,475
This’s my school.

315
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,315
I can be anywhere I want.

316
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,093
Is your dad the owner of the school?

317
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,471
You don’t look like you have the money.

318
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,128
Oh.

319
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:22,737
Hearing that really gets me fired up.

320
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:24,035
- Stop.
- Wanna fight?

321
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,093
Stop.

322
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:28,088
Sigh.

323
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,833
The class is about to start.

324
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,368
Stop causing trouble already.

325
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:35,380
These bastards are the ones who started trouble with us first.

326
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:38,257
I don’t care who started it.

327
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,168
I told you to prepare for the class.

328
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:43,709
What if I don’t want to study?

329
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:44,893
Then you don’t have to do it.

330
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Nice. Then, we’ll leave now.

331
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,235
Go ahead.

332
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,591
Uh…

333
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:01,590
Wait for me, please.

334
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,693
Hey, what should we do next?

335
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,395
Just keep messing with them.

336
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,048
Eventually, they'll snap.

337
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,671
Mr. Sung.

338
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,635
Did you let the kids leave the class again?

339
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,030
That’s right.

340
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:26,560
I’ve made it clear.

341
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,111
If they don’t want to study, then they don’t have to.

342
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,110
And what do you think?

343
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,893
The kids you let out of the classroom,

344
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:35,890
who knows where they are now?

345
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,084
Well,

346
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:38,687
I have to inform the Student Affairs office

347
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:39,493
and punish them

348
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:41,342
according to the school's regulations.

349
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,346
Instead of letting the kids get punished,

350
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:49,235
teachers like us should prevent this

351
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,924
from happening in the first place.

352
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:54,200
I’ll call them back to class.

353
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,631
What are you laughing at?

354
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,960
Do you know where you can find them?

355
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,173
Sigh.

356
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:11,635
Believe me.

357
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:14,213
No point in finding them.

358
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,937
I told you it doesn’t work.

359
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,213
Where are you going?

360
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,551
I will go bring the kids back to class.

361
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:55,271
Sigh.

362
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,711
Chadjen, why did you tag along?

363
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,604
You cannot even sing karaoke.

364
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,333
You better show respect to the host.

365
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:07,040
Tew, what song should I sing?

366
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,930
I am concerned about Shin.

367
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,528
Chadjen,

368
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,075
why are you concerned only about Shin?

369
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:14,666
You should care about us, too.

370
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,315
Right.

371
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:17,310
You don’t need to worry much about Shin.

372
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,767
You and I sing here often. I can remember.

373
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,884
Don’t overthink.

374
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,177
Chadjen, don’t worry so much about me.

375
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:25,964
I can take care of myself.

376
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,604
But Jom…

377
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,151
Sigh.

378
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,995
Chadjen, Jom is dead.

379
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,422
You don’t need to be scared.

380
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Umm.

381
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,248
The one I’m scared of isn’t Jom.

382
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,444
I’m scared of Jom’s older brother.

383
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,226
I’m afraid that you might be in danger.

384
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,160
Don’t be scared of him.

385
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,266
There are lots of us, right?

386
00:24:32,311 --> 00:24:33,311
That’s right.

387
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:33,840
Yes.

388
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:34,875
What to be scared about?

389
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,930
See? How many of us are here?

390
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,524
Right. Chadjen is so strong, too.

391
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:39,928
Don’t worry.

392
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I have a nice idea.

393
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,871
Let’s sing, Chedjen. Come on.

394
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,000
Let’s sing.

395
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:46,782
Sing.

396
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,071
Sing.

397
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:48,826
Sing.

398
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,408
- Let’s sing.
- Fighting, Chadjen.

399
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,590
I cannot sing.

400
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:54,088
Just sing.

401
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,271
Sing, Chadjen.

402
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:58,391
He cares about me.

403
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,728
He’s also cute.

404
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,106
Confused.

405
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,133
Confused.

406
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,328
Just read it first, Chadjen.

407
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:07,528
Don’t mind him. Come on.

408
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,222
Groove.

409
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,235
He won’t run away. Come on.

410
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:09,840
Groove.

411
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:10,942
Groove more.

412
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,004
Yeah.

413
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:13,315
Good job.

414
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:16,355
I don’t understand. If you wanna go.

415
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,742
Let Chadjen sing, too.

416
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:18,835
Only you got to sing.

417
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,786
Chadjen, keep singing.

418
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:20,328
You, I just…

419
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:21,315
Let Chadjen…

420
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:21,937
Who’s that?

421
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:22,982
Who’s that?

422
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,764
Damn.

423
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,497
Can we join you?

424
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:29,155
I don’t think

425
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:31,617
we’ve lit the incense to summon you.

426
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:35,164
I'm just following the scent of the losers here.

427
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,755
You, Tsunami bastard.

428
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,382
You and I haven’t settled a thing.

429
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,764
You sure? We have more people today.

430
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,610
Girls

431
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,204
and this potato,

432
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,942
I don’t count them in.

433
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:52,675
Watch what you say.

434
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:54,066
Why?

435
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:55,395
Angry?

436
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:56,666
Angry, babe?

437
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:57,876
You're talking a lot, you bastard.

438
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,315
It’s the second you did it.

439
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:00,490
Hey, hey.

440
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:01,760
What do you want?

441
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:02,795
Don’t do it.

442
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:06,240
Chadjen, don’t get in my way.

443
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,982
Don’t do it.

444
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:11,377
Don’t get in my way.

445
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:11,822
Stop.

446
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:12,737
- Stop.
- Don’t fight.

447
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:13,786
Enough.

448
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
Shut your mouth and save it for eating.

449
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,706
Shin, don’t fight, okay?

450
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,591
Can we go back now?

451
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,897
Let’s go home.

452
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:21,795
Why go home?

453
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,773
You bastard.

454
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:23,671
Jerk.

455
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:24,906
Chadjen.

456
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:27,040
What will you do?

457
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,106
You jerk.

458
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,133
Shin.

459
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,137
Baby boy.

460
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:50,862
Give this sister a ride.

461
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,591
Well, sorry. I only deliver food.

462
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:57,191
Not people, aunty.

463
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,631
You have your bike today,

464
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:02,106
will you go to work right away?

465
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,822
Umm. I’ll be going now.

466
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,333
Ride carefully, boy.

467
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:08,213
Yes, aunty.

468
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:08,933
Let’s go, Eve.

469
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,800
We might not make it to extra classes on time.

470
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Miss Jan.

471
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:40,813
Miss Jan.

472
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,235
What are you doing here?

473
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,808
I’m looking for Shin’s and Ken’s group

474
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,337
who skipped the class.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,737
But it’s too late now.

476
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:54,480
They will probably go home already.

477
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,911
That’s true. I forgot to check the time.

478
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,520
Sigh.

479
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:01,422
Do you want me to send you back to school?

480
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,524
Can you?

481
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,573
Of course.

482
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:04,608
Hob on.

483
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,084
That’s Shin.

484
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Quickly follow him.

485
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:37,380
Have you waited for a long time, Chingching?

486
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,368
What happened to your face?

487
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,186
I’m fine. It’ll be gone soon.

488
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:56,364
Did you fight again?

489
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Come on. Let’s go home.

490
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,884
Saint.

491
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,422
Come on.

492
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,697
Hi, pretty girl.

493
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,350
Miss you so much.

494
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,350
You will send me home again, right?

495
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:24,350
Chingching.

496
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
No problem

497
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,822
if Shin agrees to have me send you home.

498
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:28,897
No need.

499
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,510
Shin.

500
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,031
What happened to your face?

501
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,866
Nothing.

502
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,933
You can't skip class

503
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,930
to get into trouble with others like this.

504
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,528
Did you skip class?

505
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,520
Didn’t you say you’ve grown up?

506
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,737
I’m going home with my sister then, teacher.

507
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,088
And you.

508
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,315
Don’t follow us.

509
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:56,946
Come on, Chingching.

510
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,693
Bye bye, Saint.

511
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,380
Are you and Shin close?

512
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Yes.

513
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,288
Shin and I used to be close friends.

514
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,768
You skipped class. Such a naughty boy.

515
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:44,897
You’ll be hit.

516
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:46,275
I’m sorry.

517
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,488
I’ll not do it again. Okay?

518
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Here.

519
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:52,657
What did you and Saint fight about?

520
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,324
Sigh.

521
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,386
Chingching, from now on,

522
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:09,208
don’t get close to Saint.

523
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:10,373
Understand?

524
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,848
I don’t understand.

525
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,053
Don’t be naughty, Chingching.

526
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,462
If mom knows, she will scold you.

527
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:20,071
Why do mom and you hate Saint?

528
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:24,080
Back then, Saint and you were besties.

529
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:35,530
One day when you grow up,

530
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,875
you will understand me.

531
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,137
But for now, you have to shower,

532
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,142
have dinner,

533
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:48,000
and finish your homework.

534
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,035
Let’s go.

535
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,650
I found your weakness, Tsunami.

536
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,564
Jeng, Shin has a younger sister.

537
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:28,826
I’m lazy.

538
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,191
I want to play games at First’s house.

539
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:32,515
Yeah, let’s do it.

540
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,088
Where are Tew and First?

541
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,257
Mr. Jo ordered them to clean the toilet.

542
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,648
Huh? Why so?

543
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,124
What happened?

544
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,351
He found their cig.

545
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:46,462
Game over.

546
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,453
Well deserved.

547
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,564
They keep smoking.

548
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,826
It stinks to high heaven.

549
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,377
You, too, Tangmay.

550
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,111
If you can quit, then quit.

551
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,835
What does this have to do with me?

552
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,017
Damn it.

553
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,800
Class prezy and ex-prezy,

554
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,337
you want us to help?

555
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
It’s okay. Thanks.

556
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,715
No need to thank me. Just asking.

557
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:12,751
I’m not gonna help you.

558
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,555
Hello, little brother Shin.

559
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,591
Jeng.

560
00:33:37,617 --> 00:33:39,777
Your sister’s name is Chingching, right?

561
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:41,422
I'll pick up your sister today.

562
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:42,666
Jeng, you prick.

563
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:44,391
Don’t bother my sister.

564
00:33:46,248 --> 00:33:47,768
What happened, Shin?

565
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,782
Hey, Shin.

566
00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:51,377
Shin.

567
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:52,008
Shin.

568
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:52,480
Shin.

569
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,066
Shin.

570
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,408
- What happened?
- Shin.

571
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:08,444
Where are you going?

572
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,408
Get out of my way, Ken.

573
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,835
You cannot go help your sister.

574
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,253
Are you teaming up with that bastard Jeng?

575
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,857
Talk about brother Jeng nicely, little Shin.

576
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,400
This Jeng is so dangerous.

577
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:27,582
Who is he?

578
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,097
He is the boss of the Dragon Fang.

579
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:33,262
Right now,

580
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:36,551
Shin’s little sister, Chingching, is in danger.

581
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,693
Jeng, you prick.

582
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,302
What are you doing to my sister?

583
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,146
I'm going to do the same thing you did

584
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:42,871
to my brother, you bastard.

585
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,580
What the heck are you waiting for?

586
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,537
Stomp on him.

587
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:54,573
Hah.

588
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,266
Where are you going, Chadjen?

589
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,968
I’m going to the teacher’s office.

590
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:22,964
Hey.

591
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,680
I’ll make you feel hurt.

592
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,324
Even more than what you did to me, Shin.

593
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
You bastard.

594
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:32,995
It’s so hot, Chingching.

595
00:35:33,022 --> 00:35:34,257
Walk quickly, dear.

596
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,364
What should we eat today?

597
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:38,542
Are you hungry already?

598
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:39,744
What do you want then, Chingching?

599
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,149
I’ll cook everything for you, okay?

600
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,733
It's not often that Mom is free, right?

601
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,746
Is there something wrong?

602
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,595
Do you want anything?

603
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:57,200
My boss ordered me to get this girl.

604
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:58,382
What?

605
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,395
Are you crazy?

606
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:00,346
- Come here.
- Don’t come any closer.

607
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:01,226
I will call the police.

608
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:02,106
Let go of her.

609
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,048
Chingching.

610
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:03,591
I’m not going.

611
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,160
Chingching.

612
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:04,640
Ahh.

613
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:05,804
Let go of me.

614
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,604
No.

615
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,080
- Help.
- Let go of me.

616
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:23,462
Do it again.

617
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:24,893
You bastard.

618
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,013
You're really something, aren't you?

619
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:47,368
You must be really proud of yourself

620
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:49,057
for stomping on me like this.

621
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,090
Right?

622
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:51,564
I don’t care.

623
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:54,951
Just taking you down is enough.

624
00:36:55,608 --> 00:36:56,613
Hey.

625
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,155
I think we should stop.

626
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,150
He might die.

627
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,337
Yeah. He’s all beaten.

628
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,471
You’re not as good as your nickname.

629
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,733
You’re so pathetic.

630
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,537
Did I order you to stop?

631
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,471
But Jeng, he is…

632
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,840
You don’t butt in.

633
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,840
If you don’t keep stomping on him,

634
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,253
we will beat you up.

635
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,102
But Jeng, do you want to beat him to death?

636
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,457
Have you seen him cry?

637
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,235
Have you seen any drop of his tears?

638
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,230
I want him to be the most hurt.

639
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,777
The most regretful.

640
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:28,960
Do you all understand?

641
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,915
You all will never see my tears.

642
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
You've got a smart mouth, you bastard.

643
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,417
Don’t you worry about your sister?

644
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,182
Hah.

645
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,008
My sister will be alright.

646
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,715
Why do you think so?

647
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:00,742
Huh?

648
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:11,404
Chingching.

649
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Hey.

650
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,111
- Saint.
- Who are you?

651
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:21,940
If you don’t want to be hurt, then get lost.

652
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,408
Let her go.

653
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:26,097
None of your business.

654
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:27,191
Don’t butt in.

655
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,377
This guy, the chin.

656
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:30,577
This guy, the stomach.

657
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,231
This guy, the temple.

658
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,280
As for you.

659
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,266
I’ll break your arms.

660
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:39,608
What nonsense you just said?

661
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:40,675
Get him.

662
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:41,702
Hey.

663
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,653
Listen, guys.

664
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,737
I want to clarify a few things.

665
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,853
So you stop believing the bullshit.

666
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,248
The heck you are talking about?

667
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:36,266
My nickname is not Tsunami.

668
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:38,890
I’m not the Tsunami.

669
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,671
Then, who is that?

670
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,844
The person I hate the most.

671
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,382
The heck are you ranting about? Annoying.

672
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,620
You bastard.

673
00:39:54,044 --> 00:39:55,120
You bastard, come here.

674
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:56,568
You jerk.

675
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,764
You bastard.

676
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,533
Why don’t you check on your minions?

677
00:40:08,808 --> 00:40:10,530
Aren’t you curious

678
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,128
why haven’t they come here yet?

679
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:22,648
Hey, where are all of you?

680
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,080
Did you get the kid?

681
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:25,782
Damn.

682
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,770
Hello.

683
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Hello.

684
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,586
Where are you?

685
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:33,840
Who are you?

686
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,097
I asked

687
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,551
where are you?

688
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,982
What did you do with my team?

689
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,768
Wait for me there.

690
00:40:50,426 --> 00:40:52,293
Aunty, quickly calls the police.

691
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,342
As for Shin, I’ll bring him back.

692
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,693
Damn. Who the heck are you?

693
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Tsunami.

694
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,422
You jerk.

695
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:22,457
You bastard.

696
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,795
You bastard.

697
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,075
Jeng.

698
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,942
I think we should stop.

699
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:29,920
Shut up.

700
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:31,475
Wanna get beaten again?

701
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,364
I'm starting to be curious

702
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,764
how tough the real Tsunami is.

703
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,613
I’m waiting to see your friend, Shin.

704
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
No.

705
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,008
He is not my friend.

706
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,604
You.

707
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,431
Shin.

708
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,226
Saint, how can you come here?

709
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:16,275
Don’t tell me you are the Tsunami.

710
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:20,270
Do you know…

711
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,800
3 years.

712
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,248
It’s been 3 years that I haven’t hurt anyone.

713
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,315
But today.

714
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:40,310
I promise you.

715
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,240
Every single one of you.

716
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,897
I will beat you up.

717
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,946
You all will have to suffer

718
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,431
more than my friend does right now,

719
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:52,466
you bastard.

720
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,244
Hey.

721
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,715
You dare threaten the Dragon Fang, huh?

722
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:05,586
Damn.

723
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,128
Beat him up.

724
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,875
Do you all know

725
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:18,408
why I was called 'Tsunami' back in the day?

726
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:19,937
Go.

727
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,053
Because no matter where I went,

728
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,715
I would destroy everything.

729
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,920
No matter how skilled they are,

730
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,093
if I decide to go after them,

731
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,271
I’ll take them all down.

732
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,630
Shin.

733
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,688
Are you okay?

734
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,391
Come on, I’ll help you.

735
00:43:58,764 --> 00:43:59,764
Argh!

736
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,164
I’ll help you.

737
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,208
Argh!

738
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,737
You bastard.

739
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,413
Saint.

740
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:40,075
Shin.

741
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,210
But it's because of my craziness

742
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:49,830
that I ended up hurting my own friend.

743
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,955
What happened between you and Saint?

744
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,391
Why did you stop being friends?

745
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:23,208
Do you think doing this

746
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,457
will make up for what you did to me?

747
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:26,373
I’m sorry.

748
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,453
Can we be friends again like before?

749
00:45:28,497 --> 00:45:30,880
The real Tsunami is the Thep Burapha.

750
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,595
The Tsunami is your nickname,

751
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:34,666
why did you let him take it?

752
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,780
What are you two to each other?

753
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:36,755
How did Shin get into trouble

754
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:38,542
with the Dragon Fang?

755
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,248
Shin has been accused of

756
00:45:40,293 --> 00:45:41,884
causing the death of Jom,

757
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:43,644
Jeng's younger brother.
