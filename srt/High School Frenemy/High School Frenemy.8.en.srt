5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,770
Big news.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,620
Principal Praphada is going to

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,960
expel Shin from school.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,920
If I can fix the misunderstandings

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,840
my classmates have about him,

10
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,620
he won’t be expelled, right?

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,910
You can drop your act now.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,250
Confess the truth to everyone? Gross!

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,970
Come to school right now.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,970
I’ll give up the most important thing to me.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,970
Is school your most important thing?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,390
The most important thing that I’m giving up,

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,530
It’s not school.

18
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,860
It’s you, Shin.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,270
The most important thing that I’m giving up,

20
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,950
it’s not school.

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,680
It’s you, Shin.

22
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,820
RESIGNATION.

23
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,720
Shin.

24
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello, Miss Jan.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,270
You’re early.

26
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,010
I just woke up early today.

27
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,750
You already knew about

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,750
Saint resigning from a school, right?

29
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,960
Yes.

30
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,610
I’ll solve this case.

31
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,130
I’ll try to bring Saint back to school.

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,980
You don’t have to worry.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,030
For the time being,

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,350
study hard and come to school every day.

35
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,610
Actually, it’s none of my business.

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,010
I don’t care.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,720
Excuse me then.

38
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,880
You know.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
You say one thing but mean another.

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,610
Me?

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,030
Deep down inside, you don’t hate Saint.

42
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,330
I can see it.

43
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,970
Then you saw it wrongly.

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,960
Thamnithit.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,820
VP, where’s the class president?

46
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,290
I don’t know either.

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,000
Naruebet.

48
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,290
Kasidit.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,690
Absent.

50
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,930
We’re here.

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,340
Kasidit.

52
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,050
Nuttapat.

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,780
Nuttakit.

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,820
Late as usual.

55
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,820
You’ve never made it on time.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,130
Well, Nuttapat.

57
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,820
Your English score is better.

58
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,530
Did you practice on your own?

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,880
Hey, did you betray us?

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,620
I didn’t.

61
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,700
No way.

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,770
He just told us.

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,210
Keep up with a good job.

64
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,780
Okay.

65
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,780
Damn, he acted cool.

66
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,440
And you said “No. No way.”.

67
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,320
You’re not my brother.

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,060
You jerk.

69
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,110
I said I didn’t mean it.

70
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,580
No? You said no?

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,820
Alright. The homeroom is over.

72
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,810
Prepare for the next class.

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,160
Class.

74
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,660
Thank you. Bye bye.

75
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,410
Okay, Oat. I’ll leave my profile on the chat.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,070
Alright. I’ll leave it to you.

77
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,230
Okay. Thank you.

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,690
SAINT.

79
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,620
WHERE ARE YOU?

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,890
WHY DIDN’T YOU COME TO SCHOOL?

81
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,700
What are you doing?

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you care about Saint now?

83
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,800
I just don’t want to do

84
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,360
those tasks on his behalf.

85
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,010
Is that so?

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,010
When I didn’t come to class,

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,820
you didn’t check me out.

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
I always look out for you.

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,820
I know. I’m no longer important.

90
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,500
Eve, don’t get upset.

91
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,660
Please, please, please.

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,970
Forgive me. Forgive me.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,760
Don’t be upset, okay?

94
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,810
Just kidding.

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,810
Why would I be bothered by this little thing?

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,810
Frankly speaking.

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,700
I’m so annoyed that

98
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,490
I have to collect and submit the homework

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,070
to teachers on his behalf.

100
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,120
It’s so heavy.

101
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,980
No problem.

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,220
Look at this.

103
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,100
Strong.

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,460
You call this a muscle?

105
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,050
Why are you laughing?

106
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,600
I was just laughing at ​​your flapping.

107
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,920
Oops, flexing.

108
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,460
What’s it got to do with you?

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,880
Hey, Eve.

110
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,710
Don’t pick a fight with her.

111
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,370
That’s right, Eve.

112
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Don’t pick a fight with me.

113
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,280
What’s your problem with me, Airy?

114
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,120
Nothing.

115
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,120
I just laughed by myself.

116
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,220
Is that a problem?

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,580
Yeah, it is as you do it before me.

118
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,620
I don’t like it.

119
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,300
Hey, stop it.

120
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,690
Why are you picking a fight?

121
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,970
Don’t butt in. I didn’t talk to you.

122
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,700
Talk to my friend nicely.

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,940
Why?

124
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,240
Do you care a lot about her?

125
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,630
Acting like this,

126
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,030
you want to fight me badly, right?

127
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,850
Go ahead.

128
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,430
Go ahead.

129
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,960
Go ahead.

130
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,270
Go ahead.

131
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,810
Stop it, both of you.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,570
Come on, Eve. Let’s go.

133
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,880
What’s wrong, Miss Jan?

134
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,390
Is it about Saint?

135
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,860
Yes.

136
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,220
What should we do?

137
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,250
There’s no need for action.

138
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,210
This resignation letter is invalid anyway.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,030
Judging from the handwriting,

140
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,380
Saint must write it all himself

141
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,690
and forged his dad’s signature.

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,310
I think his dad doesn’t know about this.

143
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,180
That’s right.

144
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,280
Sigh.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,420
Then, we still have some hope.

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,060
If we tell his parents,

147
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,910
they might urge him to come back.

148
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,040
I think we shouldn’t do it that way.

149
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,500
If we do so,

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,650
Saint will just run away from us more.

151
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,050
Okay, bro.

152
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,870
I can start working tomorrow.

153
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,910
Thank you so much for choosing me.

154
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,450
Okay.

155
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,380
Ugh.

156
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,020
Dad.

157
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
I made a steamed egg. Will you have it?

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,890
I already had dinner.

159
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,050
Hey, why are you back early?

160
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,340
Don’t you have an extra class?

161
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,920
They canceled it.

162
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,360
You skipped it again, right?

163
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,580
Saint,

164
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,350
how many times

165
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,900
have I told you to focus on learning,

166
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,170
not on obsessing over work like this?

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,170
Studying just costs money,

168
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,550
but working actually earns it.

169
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,870
So, I can help you.

170
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,700
But knowledge gives you more opportunities

171
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,500
to choose from in the future.

172
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,180
Right?

173
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,200
Or do you want to spend your whole life

174
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,510
selling noodles like me?

175
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,900
What’s wrong with that?

176
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,420
What?

177
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,840
I can eat it for free as much as I want.

178
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,890
It also tastes good.

179
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,900
Saint.

180
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,100
What a nice benefit.

181
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,440
Did you? You just talked back to me?

182
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,970
Go sleep.

183
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,930
I’ll shower first.

184
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,930
Be careful.

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,990
Go to bed early.

186
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,980
Huh?

187
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,250
I’m sorry, dad.

188
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,300
Guys.

189
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,680
Breaking news. Super urgent.

190
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,020
Again? What is it this time?

191
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,890
Saint already quit school.

192
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,740
What?

193
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,540
Yes. I saw him working

194
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,050
at a gas station near our school.

195
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,130
He also told me

196
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,560
he wouldn’t come back anymore.

197
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,690
What is he thinking?

198
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,930
Exactly.

199
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,420
Did he want to quit just like this?

200
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,450
Or were there other reasons?

201
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,320
What?

202
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,120
Good morning, friends.

203
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,580
Sorry.

204
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,080
Hey, sorry.

205
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,460
Saint is not here again?

206
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,100
Maybe he cries in secret because of Shin.

207
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Why the heck did you hit the desk?

208
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,490
Stop it.

209
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,470
You guys cannot fight in class.

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,570
Or else I’ll report Miss Jan and Mr. Sung.

211
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,280
Oh, that’s so scary.

212
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
Miss Vice President.

213
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,490
I’m serious.

214
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
Peeta,

215
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,200
Don’t think just because you’re a girl,

216
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,300
I won’t do anything to you.

217
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,360
Is that so?

218
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,910
Where are you going?

219
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,760
Let go of me.

220
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,930
Let go of me.

221
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,020
- Let her go.
- I told you to let go of me.

222
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,019
Ken, I told you to let go of Peeta.

223
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,060
Let her go.

224
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,830
Eve, why do you have to butt in?

225
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,220
Let her go.

226
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,380
You bastard.

227
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,520
You two come fight with us.

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,210
Oh, you dared push me?

229
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,760
The heck you push me for, you jerk?

230
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,060
Wow. Wow.

231
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,370
Just take them down for real this time.

232
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,370
Been annoyed by them for ages.

233
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,100
Wait.

234
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,040
If you fight, everyone will be in trouble.

235
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,890
We might be expelled.

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,420
My mom set this rule, don’t you remember?

237
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,780
That’s right.

238
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,700
Principal Praphada said

239
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,900
whoever picked a fight again

240
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,160
would be expelled.

241
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,990
Do you want to be expelled,

242
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,610
Shin, Tew, and First?

243
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,650
Do you want to be expelled,

244
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,510
Shin, Tew, and First?

245
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,160
Someone is scared.

246
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,960
Ken, if you aren’t afraid, then do it.

247
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,280
I’ll record a clip as evidence for Shin,

248
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,990
proving that you start the fight.

249
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,670
Hey, Peeta.

250
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,670
The heck you sided with him for?

251
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,720
Can you stop being delusional?

252
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,550
We’re all in the same school.

253
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,050
The campuses are no longer separated.

254
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,730
If you aren’t afraid, then do it.

255
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,330
Oh, we can go ahead?

256
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,620
What will you do?

257
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,300
I’ll put that aside for now.

258
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,860
That’s classic.

259
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,620
Let’s go smoke.

260
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,070
I’ll go smoke first.

261
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,280
So nonsense.

262
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,170
The reason I called both of you here today

263
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,790
is that I want to emphasize

264
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,100
and clarify the reasons I hired you

265
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,890
as homeroom teachers for Class 2.

266
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,010
I assigned both of you to look after Class 2

267
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,500
because I want the students in this class

268
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,970
to improve and become well-behaved,

269
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,750
with better grades.

270
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
But it’s already been several months,

271
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,550
and I haven’t seen any positive progress

272
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,670
in this class at all.

273
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,680
All I see is trouble, day after day.

274
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,680
We’re both sorry.

275
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,160
I want you to be stricter with the students

276
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,100
because this is the model classroom

277
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,100
we need to make successful.

278
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,540
We should also prepare the students

279
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,910
for next year.

280
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Everyone in Class 2 must be able to pass

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,960
the university entrance exams.

282
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,160
Do you understand?

283
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,550
He really works here.

284
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,150
I seriously don’t understand him.

285
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,210
That’s right.

286
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,210
I don’t understand him either.

287
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Why are you here?

288
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
The same reason as you guys.

289
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,820
Do you think we can convince him?

290
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,850
Challenging.

291
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,050
Saint is stubborn.

292
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah, I think so.

293
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,160
But we have to try.

294
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,940
Should we go now?

295
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,260
Let’s go.

296
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,260
Saint.

297
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,500
Oh.

298
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,710
Why are you here?

299
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,990
We’re here to bring you back to school.

300
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,990
I quit it already.

301
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,260
Why did you do that?

302
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,250
I don’t want to study anymore.

303
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,890
Better quit school and start working.

304
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,980
Only because of that?

305
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,870
You didn’t want to study so you quit.

306
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,210
Didn’t your family say anything?

307
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,600
We aren’t wealthy,

308
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,000
so dropping out of school

309
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,800
would help ease our financial burden.

310
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,190
Well, Saint.

311
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,930
I think you better go back to school.

312
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,140
You can work again once you graduate.

313
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,010
My dad once said education…

314
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,740
Thanks everyone for your concern.

315
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,950
But I’ll not go back to school.

316
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,960
I’ll get back to work then.

317
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Uh…

318
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,850
What should we do now?

319
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,300
There’s only 1 person who can help.

320
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,290
Who is that?

321
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,260
It’s Shin.

322
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,390
I asked him to come but he refused.

323
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,350
Can you really just quit school

324
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,350
just because you don’t feel like studying?

325
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,780
MOM.

326
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,090
I want to quit school, mom.

327
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,520
I don’t want to study.

328
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,330
Don’t want to be the principal’s son.

329
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,460
I…

330
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,630
Don’t want to be like my brother.

331
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,630
Yes, mom.

332
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,900
I’m in front of the house.

333
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,460
The tutor school ended late.

334
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,470
Yes.

335
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,940
Cable,

336
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,340
I’ve booked a class with Miss Pha

337
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,540
for you tomorrow.

338
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,540
Be there on time. Don’t be late.

339
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,280
Noted.

340
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,500
The exam period is getting close.

341
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,020
I think you should start

342
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,520
reviewing your lessons.

343
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
I want you to be an example

344
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,920
for others in your class.

345
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,730
I guess if I started with you first,

346
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,420
I’d certainly be able to make

347
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,720
Class 2 a model classroom.

348
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,470
Alright.

349
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,690
Even if it's just a quiz,

350
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,060
the score is still important.

351
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,240
You're the principal's son.

352
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,900
Don't embarrass me, understand?

353
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,600
Okay.

354
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,060
What about your homework?

355
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,060
You submitted everything, right?

356
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,240
Cable.

357
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,460
I’m asking you.

358
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,990
Can you stop, mom?

359
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,410
I can't take it anymore.

360
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,620
Can you please stop doing this to me?

361
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,420
I don’t want to end up like my brother.

362
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,330
Cable.

363
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,790
Why do you have to

364
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,320
pressure us about everything?

365
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,170
Copter was like that…

366
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,270
Stop bringing up your brother.

367
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,470
Because you are like this.

368
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,470
You never care about us.

369
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,640
You only order others to do what you want.

370
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,590
And you never consider our feelings.

371
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,400
Because you are like this,

372
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Copter left me and you.

373
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,870
Cable,

374
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
listen to me.

375
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Stop blaming me for this.

376
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
The reason your brother ended up that way

377
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,070
has nothing to do with me

378
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,820
or with school.

379
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,260
Then can you let me know?

380
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,180
Brother has been gone for three years now,

381
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,120
and you’ve never told me anything.

382
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,930
You still love me, right?

383
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,450
You promised me that you would listen to me

384
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,800
and do everything for me

385
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,120
in place of your brother.

386
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,950
So, you should trust me.

387
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,750
You still trust me, right?

388
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,690
Yes.

389
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,180
Go shower and review today’s lesson.

390
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,450
Alright.

391
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,820
Sigh.

392
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,120
Here is your receipt.

393
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
Thank you.

394
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,220
Safe trip, sir.

395
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,620
Shin.

396
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,940
Do you want to do it this way?

397
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,310
What do you mean?

398
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,300
That you would quit school.

399
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,760
Yeah, I'm serious.

400
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,540
I’ll go back to school.

401
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,460
You’ll never see me again.

402
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,710
Are you trying to annoy me?

403
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,250
Do you think what I'm doing

404
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,110
is just to provoke you?

405
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,940
Yeah.

406
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,390
I’m doing this

407
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
because I want you to finish your studies.

408
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,900
You told me yourself

409
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
if I gave up my most important thing,

410
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,650
then you would return to school.

411
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,610
But…

412
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,160
Make sure you keep your promise.

413
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,630
Make sure you graduate from high school.

414
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,310
Hello, what kind do you want?

415
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,580
B7 for 1,000 THB.

416
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,910
Sigh.

417
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,610
What’s wrong?

418
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,230
About Brother Saint.

419
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,400
That’s right.

420
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,430
You talked to him, how was it?

421
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,470
I told you.

422
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,850
Though I talked to him,

423
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,280
he wouldn’t change his mind.

424
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,520
Well, then did you clear up with Saint?

425
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,760
What to clear up?

426
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,180
Here it is. That’s why it failed.

427
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,990
I went to see him as you told me to.

428
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,580
What else do you want?

429
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,510
Shin, you’re hopeless.

430
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,380
You can’t even make up with your friend.

431
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,290
Huh?

432
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,580
Make up?

433
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,950
Why do I have to make up with him?

434
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,950
I didn’t do that.

435
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,270
You are stubborn.

436
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,430
I better finish my homework. Boohoo.

437
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,970
Yeah, finish your homework.

438
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,840
So, mom won’t scold me.

439
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,230
Chadjen, you should go home now.

440
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,330
What?

441
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,710
You failed to make up with him

442
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,080
and blamed it on me.

443
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,960
I told you I didn’t do that.

444
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,220
Why don’t you get it?

445
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,580
I think we need to change

446
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,730
our teaching method.

447
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,340
We should try to focus more

448
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,600
on the practice tests.

449
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,170
I think it's too soon.

450
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,160
Teaching focused on exam drills

451
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,490
might work well for students

452
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,120
who already have a solid foundation,

453
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,800
but many of our students

454
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,810
are still struggling with the basics.

455
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,870
I think we should start teaching

456
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,890
from the basics instead.

457
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,370
I'm afraid we won't have enough time,

458
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,860
and the principal won't be pleased.

459
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm worried that if we rush too much,

460
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,540
the kids will give up.

461
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,140
I understand your concern

462
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,190
that the kids might give up on learning,

463
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,080
but the quiz season is coming up soon.

464
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,240
If we want to see quick results,

465
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,530
we have to try a different teaching approach.

466
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,920
Mr. Sung and Miss Jan.

467
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,850
What the matter?

468
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,400
We know where Saint is.

469
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,130
We found Saint working at the gas station

470
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,180
near our school.

471
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,350
A gas station?

472
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,560
That’s right.

473
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,700
We tried to convince him to come back

474
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,510
but he didn’t listen to us at all.

475
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,110
I’ll be there shortly then.

476
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,500
You don’t have to do that.

477
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,180
I’ll go there.

478
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,460
Thank you, sir. Here’s your receipt.

479
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,700
Kiddo, throw away the trash for me.

480
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,340
Okay.

481
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
Hello. What kind of gas do you want?

482
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,810
Mr. Sung.

483
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,460
What’s up, class president?

484
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,730
Skipping school to work instead?

485
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,180
Yes.

486
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
I left school to help my dad make a living.

487
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,600
What do you think

488
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,900
you’ll be doing ten years from now?

489
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,080
What do you mean?

490
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,410
I mean,

491
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,560
how do you picture yourself in the future?

492
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,570
Doing this kind of work,

493
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,090
or something different?

494
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,730
I can handle my own future.

495
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,610
Without even having a high school diploma?

496
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,490
Are you sure about this?

497
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,480
I'm warning you out of goodwill,

498
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
class president.

499
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,910
Don’t do anything you might regret later,

500
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,920
because we can’t go back and fix it.

501
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,510
And you think that

502
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,160
if I go back to school and graduate,

503
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,800
my life in the future will really be different

504
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,740
from what it is now?

505
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,010
I can’t predict the future,

506
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,790
but I know you’ll have options

507
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,670
if you focus on finishing your studies.

508
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,910
Also, class president,

509
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,300
I know you forged your parent's signature.

510
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,030
If you really want to drop out,

511
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
go get the real signature.

512
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,050
But think it through,

513
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,380
your future could depend on it.

514
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,420
Shin.

515
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,290
When will you quit smoking?

516
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,660
Why?

517
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,820
It’s bad for your health.

518
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,890
I don’t want you to get sick.

519
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,810
I’m gonna be fine.

520
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,270
Hey, Chadjen.

521
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,380
What are you doing?

522
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,710
You said it’s fine.

523
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,560
So I want to try it, too.

524
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,500
You cannot. It’s bad for kids.

525
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,810
It’s also bad for adults.

526
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,170
Bad for people around them, too.

527
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,040
So, if you can, please quit it.

528
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,750
Fine, fine.

529
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,120
I won’t smoke today.

530
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,690
It’s best if you don’t smoke every day.

531
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,040
Shin, have you talked to Saint?

532
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,390
Sigh.

533
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,080
Um, I talked to him.

534
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,450
But he insisted on quitting.

535
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
Then you go talk to him again.

536
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,160
He only listens to you.

537
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,500
Why does it have to be me?

538
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,610
You go there yourself.

539
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,610
It's clear that his absence from class

540
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,660
is because of you.

541
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,210
You need to take responsibility.

542
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,010
Can’t you guys be friends again?

543
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,460
That’s right.

544
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,860
Just talk and clear things up.

545
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
No need to sulk like a child like this.

546
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,060
It has nothing to do with you.

547
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,260
It has.

548
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,770
His absence troubles me.

549
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,880
I have the right to say.

550
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,880
Be kind to him a little, Shin.

551
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,700
You know it well

552
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,040
how much he tries to make up with you.

553
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,560
The exam is coming. So annoying.

554
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,630
F♪cking boring.

555
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,180
I’m too lazy to review the lessons.

556
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,810
Well, here’s a change.

557
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,120
Let’s go back and play games.

558
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,350
Yeah, let’s go.

559
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,150
Saint.

560
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,530
Yes, sir.

561
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,400
There are lots of customers today.

562
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,810
Yeah, pretty much.

563
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,320
Are you sure you won’t go back to study?

564
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,570
Yes, sir.

565
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,740
And you’re sure your dad won’t complain?

566
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,530
It’s okay.

567
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,890
I’ll go home now.

568
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,800
Goodbye.

569
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,300
Why are you here?

570
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I brought the car to refuel.

571
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,910
How did you end up here?

572
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,490
Why didn’t you tell me?

573
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,280
Do I have to find out from your teachers?

574
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,450
You don't want to study anymore, right?

575
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,510
Didn’t you tell me you wanted to graduate?

576
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,200
So what's going on?

577
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,610
Why do you suddenly want to drop out?

578
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,480
I…

579
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,200
I'm asking seriously,

580
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,020
why have you changed your mind?

581
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,880
Did someone do something to you?

582
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
No one did anything to me, Dad.

583
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,630
I just want to drop out.

584
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,570
Just want to drop out?"

585
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,620
Yeah.

586
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:04,560
Well, you really are just like your mom.

587
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,370
In what way?

588
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,110
You can't lie for crap.

589
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,970
Sigh.

590
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,940
Come on,

591
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,590
will you tell me why you want to do this?

592
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,840
Fine, fine.

593
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,770
If you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

594
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,670
It's your choice.

595
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,500
If you want to drop out,

596
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,930
I won’t stop you.

597
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,740
Go to school with me tomorrow.

598
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,830
Why?

599
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,260
Well, to sign the resignation letter.

600
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,130
It's clear that his absence from class

601
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,130
is because of you.

602
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
You need to take responsibility.

603
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,380
Who would believe a brat like you?

604
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,469
You were planning to smash the glass

605
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,329
and steal from my store, weren't you?

606
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,170
I already told you that it wasn't intentional.

607
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,010
Open your bag for me to see right now.

608
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,010
Hey, hey, hey.

609
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,690
And your pants pocket too.

610
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,450
I'm not a thief.

611
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,360
Sigh.

612
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,960
Oh, you brought your friend.

613
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,350
Here's the cost for the glass.

614
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,370
Ouch, this isn't enough. It's ridiculous.

615
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,370
I’ve lost so much,

616
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,370
and you're giving me just this?

617
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,800
Shin.

618
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,440
What the hell are you doing?

619
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,130
So we can leave now, right?

620
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,160
Don't set foot in my store again,

621
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,590
you little thieves!

622
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,450
If you say another word about my friend,

623
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,040
I’ll call the police on you

624
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,480
for selling cigarettes to kids.

625
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,890
Saint, let’s go.

626
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,123
You little brat.

627
00:39:58,254 --> 00:39:59,156
Come on.

628
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:00,283
Hey, Shin.

629
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,945
Why did you pay for me?

630
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,858
Damn, just this once.

631
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:05,905
What the hell is wrong with you?

632
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:06,916
I’m just joking.

633
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:07,840
I’m just joking.

634
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,741
Well, you broke the glass,

635
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,789
so what do you expect me to do?

636
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,352
That’s all my savings.

637
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:14,981
I was so close to getting new soccer cleats.

638
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,236
And did I ask you to pay for it?

639
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:18,785
Do you think I can’t pay for myself?

640
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,418
So you can owe me a favor.

641
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,792
For what?

642
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:23,476
Haha.

643
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,083
Wait.

644
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,163
Why do you have to protect me?

645
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,600
Well, I was born before you,

646
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,352
so I’m older by several months.

647
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,350
I have to be your big brother,

648
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:36,210
and big brothers protect their little siblings.

649
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,272
Dude, no way, that gives me the creeps.

650
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:39,767
Hey.

651
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:40,843
I don't want you to be my big brother.

652
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:43,832
Then what do you want me to be?

653
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,392
Your boss?

654
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,367
Umm.

655
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,225
Okay, I guess I can let you be my boss.

656
00:40:58,567 --> 00:40:59,600
But just for one person.

657
00:40:59,636 --> 00:41:01,025
I’ll allow it just for you.

658
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,341
Then call me 'brother, ' you little one.

659
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,054
And say “Thank you, brother Shin.” as well.

660
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,647
Haha.

661
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,058
Thank you.

662
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,770
Thank you, brother Shin.

663
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:13,978
Good job, little brother.

664
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:14,901
That’s how it should be.

665
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:16,756
Hey, you’re cute too.

666
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,178
Good job, little brother. You’re the best…

667
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:19,541
Ouch.

668
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,090
That’s enough from you.

669
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,760
Hey.

670
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,138
Ouch.

671
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,010
Come here.

672
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:29,280
You little one.

673
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,498
I’ll bite your ear off.

674
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:33,687
Sure, boss.

675
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,487
What now?

676
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:48,770
You admit that I’m your boss, right?

677
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,785
From now on, don’t ditch me, okay?

678
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,076
Yeah, I got it.

679
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,338
That’s how it should be, little brother.

680
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,650
Today, you’re treating me to noodles.

681
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,230
Sure.

682
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:14,509
Tell your dad to give me a lot.

683
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,396
I know I can't change the past.

684
00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:18,909
I just played soccer.

685
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:19,970
I might get a cramp.

686
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,632
I don't believe you.

687
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,160
You're lying again this time, aren't you?

688
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,178
- No, I’m not.
- Even if I have to follow you around

689
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,247
for the rest of my life,

690
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:25,170
it’s still better

691
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:26,829
than having to walk away from you again.

692
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,494
If that day hadn’t happened,

693
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:43,316
if I hadn’t done

694
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:44,545
all that messed-up stuff to you

695
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,829
what would things be like between us?

696
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,029
Would we still be best friends like before?

697
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,021
Shin, you jerk.

698
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:02,020
We would probably still eat together.

699
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:03,265
You’re shameless.

700
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:05,505
Ride motorcycles.

701
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:06,683
Why the hell do you do that?

702
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:07,774
It annoys others.

703
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,127
What a stupid question.

704
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,025
I do it so they know the Tsunami is here.

705
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:12,698
I'm really fed up with you.

706
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,785
Go. Just go, damn it.

707
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,236
Play football together.

708
00:43:17,272 --> 00:43:18,945
Hey. Hey.

709
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,192
Damn, that was so great.

710
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:25,345
- My friend did it.
- I really miss those times

711
00:43:25,374 --> 00:43:26,938
when you were by my side.

712
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,574
The most important thing that I’m giving up.

713
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:36,029
It’s not school.

714
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,094
It’s you, Shin.

715
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,094
I’m giving up on the chance

716
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,047
to be with you.

717
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,069
Hello, Mr. Chai.

718
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,254
- Hello, teacher.
- Hello.

719
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:18,109
I’m here to process

720
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,100
my son’s withdrawal from school.

721
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,138
Alright.

722
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,836
Want to say goodbye to your friends, Saint?

723
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,490
I don’t think that’s necessary.

724
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,214
But I already told them

725
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,872
you’d be saying goodbye.

726
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,927
It’s really okay.

727
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,658
Come on, you’re already in your uniform.

728
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,098
Go say a quick goodbye to them.

729
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,414
See your friends.

730
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,712
Say goodbye to Miss Jan at least.

731
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,930
They’re over at the gym.

732
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,160
Come on, Saint.

733
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,414
Just go say goodbye.

734
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,443
...Alright.

735
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,189
How did you end up here?

736
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,636
I came with my dad

737
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:52,778
to sign the resignation letter.

738
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,534
Where is everyone?

739
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,643
What are you talking about?

740
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,996
Well…

741
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:05,790
Mr.Sung told me to say bye to everyone.

742
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:11,745
Where is everyone?

743
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,592
It's just me.

744
00:46:13,614 --> 00:46:14,887
There’s no one else here.

745
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:19,963
Then why did you come here?

746
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,858
Chadjen told me to come here.

747
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:32,850
Sigh.

748
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,061
Guess I’ve been tricked.

749
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,076
What do you mean?

750
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,500
I mean both of us got tricked.

751
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,894
Do you really think Mr.Sung’s plan will work?

752
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,156
We’ve come this far, Miss Jan.

753
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:46,181
We’ve got to see it through.

754
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,360
Tricked? What are you talking about?

755
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:50,690
I can’t keep up.

756
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,065
Sigh.

757
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,345
It means he tricked me into coming here

758
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:54,749
to make up with you.

759
00:46:57,003 --> 00:46:58,196
Sigh.

760
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,396
Are you really here to make up with me?

761
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,745
Don’t be ridiculous.

762
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,505
I don’t do that…

763
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,447
Hey.

764
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,469
Chadjen.

765
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:20,829
Open the door.

766
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,327
Open the door.

767
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,487
Chadjen, open the door.

768
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,080
Hey.

769
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,676
Sigh.

770
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,785
Alright, let’s do it.

771
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,785
Hey Saint, wanna have a competition?

772
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,472
What kind of competition?

773
00:48:06,501 --> 00:48:07,600
Rock-paper-scissors.

774
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,247
What?

775
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:09,643
For what?

776
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,872
Come on, just play.

777
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:12,792
I’ll tell you why after we get a result.

778
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:13,483
Come on.

779
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:14,203
What?

780
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,847
Rock-paper-scissors.

781
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:19,258
Let’s go again.

782
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,545
Scissors.

783
00:48:20,574 --> 00:48:21,425
Hey.

784
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,076
Scissors.

785
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,658
Hey, why did you copy me?

786
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:26,378
How was I supposed to know

787
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,469
we’d choose the same thing?

788
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,654
Ugh, fine.

789
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:31,796
I’ll pick rock, and you go with paper.

790
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:32,421
Ready?"

791
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,985
Huh? What’s the point of this then?

792
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,980
Come on, just do as I say.

793
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,356
Rock, paper, scissors.

794
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,610
Hey, why didn’t you pick paper?

795
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,421
Why would I?

796
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,330
I didn’t want to win against you.

797
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,300
So I have an excuse to make up with you.

798
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,894
Come on. Rock, paper…

799
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,403
Wait…

800
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,396
are you trying to get me back to school?

801
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:18,036
Ahem.

802
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,410
Then just say it.

803
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,025
I’m not here to ask.

804
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,020
I order you.

805
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,429
Alright, tell me then.

806
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:41,840
Sigh.

807
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,883
I hate that you used me

808
00:49:45,905 --> 00:49:46,989
as an excuse to quit school.

809
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,356
Hey, you’re not an excuse.

810
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,730
If I’m not, then what is it?

811
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,178
Do you really think

812
00:49:51,207 --> 00:49:52,974
quitting will solve everything?

813
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:55,690
No, that’s not it.

814
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,141
You say you’re giving up what’s important,

815
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,152
and that means you’re giving up on me.

816
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,000
But you know what?

817
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,669
You gave up on me a long time ago.

818
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:11,309
Three years ago, when you broke my leg.

819
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,447
So, you don’t get to leave me behind again.

820
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,556
Well… if I come back,

821
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,941
will you stay in school, too?

822
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,112
Yeah, I’ll stay.

823
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,116
Alright.

824
00:50:46,305 --> 00:50:49,512
If you’re here, then I’ll come back.

825
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,260
Sigh.

826
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
The plan worked after all.

827
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,043
Yay.

828
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,701
Even if it was a strange way of making up.

829
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,974
Who said we made up?

830
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,443
Chadjen,

831
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,080
now you’re brave enough to trick me?

832
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:11,476
Uh, it’s not like that. I didn’t trick you.

833
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,280
Get over here.

834
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:13,818
Wait.

835
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:14,792
Shin, calm down.

836
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,301
Cable.

837
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,520
Chadjen.

838
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,341
Chadjen, come here.

839
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:19,280
Saint, please.

840
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:20,138
Shin, calm down.

841
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:24,712
It is Mr. Sung and Miss Jan's plan, not mine.

842
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,672
Don’t even try to explain.

843
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:27,370
You had the nerve to trick me.

844
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,770
I didn't trick you.

845
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:29,410
Saint, please.

846
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:29,934
Get over here.

847
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:30,923
Calm down, Chin.

848
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:31,629
Calm down.

849
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,669
Don't tease him.

850
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,527
Chadjen.

851
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:34,887
Ouch.

852
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:35,905
Ouch.

853
00:51:36,174 --> 00:51:37,403
Messing with me, huh?

854
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:40,654
Shin, please.

855
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,396
Cable, tell him, please.

856
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:44,814
Where do you think you’re going?

857
00:51:44,836 --> 00:51:45,570
Ouch.

858
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:47,025
Are you hiding behind a girl, Chadjen?

859
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,658
Come here.

860
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:50,421
Shin.

861
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,516
Shin’s always like this when he’s mad.

862
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:58,298
Shin, calm down.

863
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,596
Hey, help me out here.

864
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,247
Cable, tell him, please.

865
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,840
Thank you so much

866
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,658
for trusting me and Miss Jan.

867
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,567
Oh, I should be the one thanking both of you

868
00:52:12,603 --> 00:52:14,123
for taking such good care of my son.

869
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,509
Please don’t worry, sir.

870
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,541
I’ll make sure to look after Saint

871
00:52:17,563 --> 00:52:18,567
as best as I can.

872
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:20,909
Thank you very much.

873
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,800
Alright then.

874
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:23,425
Take care.

875
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:23,854
Goodbye.

876
00:52:23,883 --> 00:52:25,076
Goodbye.

877
00:52:25,105 --> 00:52:25,723
Goodbye.

878
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:38,407
This situation has really changed

879
00:52:38,436 --> 00:52:39,701
the way I see you.

880
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,236
I didn’t expect you to care this much

881
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:44,501
about the kids.

882
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,501
You even went to see Saint

883
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:48,138
at the gas station, too.

884
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:51,869
Oh really?

885
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,970
But I still see you the same way.

886
00:52:57,614 --> 00:52:59,610
Same way? How so?

887
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:02,247
You’re too idealistic.

888
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,672
Are you messing with me?

889
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,265
I’m not sure either.

890
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:19,585
Smartass.

891
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,905
Bye bye.

892
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,974
Shin, can you buy me snacks?

893
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,269
No way.

894
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,963
Why so?

895
00:53:45,643 --> 00:53:47,640
Someone will treat you today.

896
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,701
Saint.

897
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,807
I’ll buy you snacks today.

898
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:01,381
Great. I’ll eat till I burst.

899
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,890
Oh, that’s too much, girl.

900
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,465
We need to celebrate that

901
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,567
you successfully made up with Saint.

902
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:10,560
I didn’t do that.

903
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,214
You’re in denial. Boohoo.

904
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,403
You cannot eat anymore.

905
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,320
Let’s eat.

906
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,941
I want to treat you.

907
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,476
What do you want, Chingching?

908
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,625
I want tamago sushi.

909
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,756
Is that considered as a snack, huh?

910
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:26,120
Boohoo.

911
00:54:26,174 --> 00:54:27,505
You’ll be punished.

912
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,298
Should we go now?

913
00:54:30,327 --> 00:54:31,054
Let’s go.

914
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,036
Wait.

915
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,280
What’s wrong?

916
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:40,050
I want to be clear about our relationship.

917
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,905
What do you mean?

918
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,363
You and I are not friends, still.

919
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,716
Not friends? Then what is us?

920
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,192
Just classmates.

921
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,320
Um, alright.

922
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,618
No matter what you want me to be,

923
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,650
I will be that.

924
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,065
Come on.

925
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,410
Let’s have some sushi.

926
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,945
Yay.

927
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,756
After sushi, what should we have next?

928
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:28,363
Ice cream.

929
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:30,298
Oh, you want ice cream again?

930
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,709
Your teeth are going to rot away.

931
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:32,560
Boohoo.

932
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:33,803
Well, show me your teeth.

933
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,734
Oh, there’s nothing wrong.

934
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,072
Don’t act like that. Just don’t

935
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:37,418
Her teeth are just perfect.

936
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,687
Oh, this color suits you well, Peeta.

937
00:55:49,723 --> 00:55:51,869
Why did you color my locker?

938
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,469
How did you let this kind of incident

939
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,196
happened again?

940
00:55:54,232 --> 00:55:55,890
Where did you get the exam leak?

941
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:57,520
Who stole the exam paper?

942
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,738
That means your exam is leaked.

943
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,418
It must be someone from Class 2

944
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,367
who stole my exam paper.

945
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,189
She said no so it’s a no.

946
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,767
Wanna fight me?

947
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:08,152
Shin.

948
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,007
You’re Udon Pithak?

949
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:11,156
Yeah.

950
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,050
If you want to challenge me, just do so.

951
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,767
Guys, get them.
