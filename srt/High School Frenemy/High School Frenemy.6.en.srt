The real Tsunami is a Thep Burapha.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
Why Shin’s having a problem with Dragon Fang?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,480
Shin was accused…

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,000
that he was the reason

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,000
for the death of Jom, Jeng’s brother.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,560
I want to help you deal with Jeng.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,960
I’m not asking for your help.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,560
It’s too big for you to handle by yourself.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,520
I’m going to talk to you

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,559
about my students.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,640
From now on, stay away from my students.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,080
The never-ending feud

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,296
between Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak,

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,680
it started because of you.

18
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,267
I knew it.

19
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:58,314
You had to be here.

20
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:02,754
Can’t you just leave me alone?

21
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:05,794
Nah, I'll stay just like this

22
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:07,794
until you agree to be my friend.

23
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:09,354
You are just…

24
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:11,154
Yeah, I'm crazy.

25
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:13,754
I'm crazy because I love you.

26
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,834
Have you ever thought about it?

27
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:38,554
If that day hadn’t happened,

28
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:41,634
if I hadn’t done

29
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,875
all that messed-up stuff to you

30
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,834
what would things be like between us?

31
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:55,154
Would we still be best friends like before?

32
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:03,074
Stop talking about things that can't happen.

33
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:10,554
We would probably still eat together,

34
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:13,714
ride motorcycles,

35
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:17,914
go to the game shop,

36
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,114
and play football.

37
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:26,994
I really miss those times

38
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:30,834
when you were by my side.

39
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,154
I'm really sorry.

40
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,074
I messed up.

41
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:50,314
Is there really no way for you to forgive me?

42
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:58,314
It's too late now.

43
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:06,114
I know I can't change the past,

44
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,354
and I accept that.

45
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,274
I ran away from my problems.

46
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,594
I didn't have the courage to face you

47
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,194
because I thought

48
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,114
we’d never see each other again.

49
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,394
But you know what?

50
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:26,034
The first day I found out you’d be here,

51
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,594
I was genuinely so happy.

52
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:35,610
Even if I have to follow you around

53
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,634
for the rest of my life,

54
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,354
it’s still better

55
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,994
than having to walk away from you again.

56
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:46,874
So,

57
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,274
can I start over?

58
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:56,794
Shin,

59
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:03,834
let's begin anew.

60
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:36,394
DELINQUENT.

61
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,474
Go back to being your friend?

62
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,154
Keep dreaming.

63
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:52,994
Shin.

64
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:54,514
Easy for you to say.

65
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,234
What you did to me

66
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,954
isn't something I can just forget.

67
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:09,034
My legs still remember what you did.

68
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,034
You’re Thep Burapha and I’m Udon Pithak.

69
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:20,674
There’s no way

70
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,674
you and I could ever be on good terms.

71
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:25,394
Right now,

72
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,514
you and I can only be enemies.

73
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,514
Damn it.

74
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,154
I’m not giving up.

75
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:43,554
I’ll make sure we become friends again.

76
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:44,674
Just wait and see.

77
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:26,034
Don’t forget that I also know your secret.

78
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:31,394
16 years ago,

79
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,394
you killed a man.

80
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,874
You’re no better than me.

81
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,634
Louis who died was your enemy.

82
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:49,674
You and your friends ganged up to bully him.

83
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,914
You are the cause of his death.

84
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:11,434
Let’s see.

85
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,434
That’s Louis.

86
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,594
Yeah.

87
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,034
Hey, Louis.

88
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,394
The heck are you doing?

89
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:31,554
It’s because of you, Sung.

90
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:34,794
Where’s my money?

91
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,314
I told you to bring me the money every day.

92
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,994
Louis, I really don’t have any.

93
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,153
Who are you calling so?

94
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,434
Huh, you prick?

95
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,474
Aren’t your parents rich?

96
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:46,954
You’ve got lots of money.

97
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:48,554
Don’t fool me.

98
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,034
I’m not stupid.

99
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,034
I’m sorry. I really have none.

100
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,234
Sorry?

101
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:54,874
Don’t hit me, Louis.

102
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,914
I don’t want your apology.

103
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,354
Hey. Hey. Hey.

104
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:00,794
Calm down.

105
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,793
Why does the Udon Pithak

106
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,314
mess around here?

107
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:07,634
Sung.

108
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:09,594
Don’t butt it.

109
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,394
Why can’t I butt in?

110
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:13,993
He’s my friend.

111
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:14,994
Right?

112
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,634
You're really asking for it,

113
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,634
ever since the last sports day.

114
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,034
Look.

115
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:26,474
Let’s just drop it, okay?

116
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,554
We’re all friends.

117
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:30,633
We go to the same school,

118
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:31,234
right?

119
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,754
You are Thep Burapha.

120
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,914
I am Udon Pithak.

121
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:40,234
So, you really wanna fight, right?

122
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,433
You guys have shaken down

123
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,034
a lot of kids from Thep Burapha already.

124
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,314
Let me ask you something.

125
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,234
What’s your deal

126
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:49,714
with the kids from my school?

127
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:50,514
Hey, brat.

128
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,193
What’s it to you?

129
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,074
What’s it to me?

130
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,553
Don’t butt in, you bastard.

131
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,394
Don’t.

132
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:56,234
Butt.

133
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:57,274
In.

134
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,354
Come on.

135
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:02,794
Come on.

136
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:03,674
Let’s talk.

137
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:04,714
Talk.

138
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:12,994
Who has been extorted by this bastard?

139
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:14,074
Raise your hand.

140
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:18,834
You jerk.

141
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:20,954
Come here.

142
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:25,514
You even bullied women?

143
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:26,554
Huh?

144
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,474
Whoever you’ve extorted money from,

145
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:33,274
pay them back in full.

146
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,754
Go pay them back in full, you hear me?

147
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,074
I don’t have any.

148
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:39,834
I spent them all.

149
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,234
Spent them all?

150
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,794
Fine. Let’s do it this way.

151
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,634
You'll be Thep Burapha’s errand boy

152
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,274
until you pay off your debt.

153
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:51,914
Understood?

154
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,514
THEP BURAPHA’S ERRAND BOY.
- Go away.

155
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:54,474
Go away.

156
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:55,514
Go away.

157
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:57,074
You’re ruining

158
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,090
Udon Pithak’s reputation completely.

159
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:00,634
He’s a gofer now. So pathetic.

160
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:04,154
I won’t do it.

161
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,074
What did you say?

162
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:05,954
I won’t do it.

163
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:07,554
You won’t do it?

164
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:08,594
You won’t do it?

165
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,634
Hit him.

166
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,354
Go. Go away.

167
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:13,074
Go away.

168
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,834
Damn it.

169
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,754
Go away.

170
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:17,994
You won’t do it?

171
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,474
- Are you that tough?
- Damn.

172
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:20,554
Go. Go away.

173
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:22,313
Are you that tough?

174
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:22,994
Damn.

175
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,633
Stay in your place, brat.

176
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,554
Go. Go away.

177
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:41,994
Calm down.

178
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:50,314
Hey.

179
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:35,234
Sigh.

180
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:40,754
Louis’s death is not your fault.

181
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,234
But I have a part in this.

182
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,674
If it weren't for me,

183
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,394
this wouldn't have happened.

184
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,874
It has been over for a long time now.

185
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,954
Now, you aren’t that troublemaker anymore.

186
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:02,314
You are a teacher who will protect the kids.

187
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,674
But I’m not sure

188
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:14,034
if I can be a good teacher here.

189
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,050
And what if the kids find out that

190
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:17,794
I’m the reason why

191
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,594
both campuses have been at odds till now?

192
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,794
I have no idea how they would think of it.

193
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,394
It’s not just that reason

194
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,075
that has caused the two campuses to fight.

195
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,634
Teens often let their emotions

196
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,474
outweigh the reason.

197
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,834
The rivalry between the two campuses

198
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:39,434
has been going on for a long time.

199
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:40,754
But when Louis died,

200
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,314
everything just got worse.

201
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:44,194
Sung.

202
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,594
You agreed to teach at Siamwit

203
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,153
because you want to make amends

204
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,154
for the past

205
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,834
and bring the two campuses together,

206
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:55,874
right?

207
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,274
Sigh.

208
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,074
Yes.

209
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:05,074
Listen to me, Sung.

210
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,594
You need to move past the past.

211
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,433
What matters

212
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,634
is not the past that haunts you,

213
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:14,994
but the responsibility you have

214
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,634
to protect your students in the present.

215
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,274
If you can separate these two issues,

216
00:14:20,034 --> 00:14:21,554
I believe everything will get better.

217
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:26,394
Okay.

218
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,433
You guys.

219
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:40,874
You guys.

220
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:41,594
You guys.

221
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,154
Have you heard of this?

222
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,554
Why? What happened this time?

223
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:46,954
I heard that

224
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:49,074
Shin was behind someone’s death.

225
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:52,633
Huh? Shin made someone die?

226
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:54,354
Yes. It happened last year.

227
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,154
I heard he was the kid from Udon Pithak.

228
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,273
A little brother of Dragon Fang’s boss.

229
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,274
Guys.

230
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:00,634
If we stay close to him,

231
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:01,730
we're going to be in trouble too.

232
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,274
Shin is absolutely a serious threat.

233
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,034
That’s not true.

234
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,434
Shin has never caused anyone to die.

235
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,113
That’s not the truth.

236
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,674
Then what happened?

237
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:17,674
Jom got into an accident.

238
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,034
Shin didn’t do anything.

239
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:22,034
But didn’t Shin fight with Jom

240
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:24,034
and take over Udon Pithak?

241
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,594
He didn’t take over the school.

242
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,754
He’s just respected by all his friends.

243
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,394
Respected or scared of?

244
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:34,674
Shin is not that kind of person.

245
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:36,674
You don’t have to worry.

246
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:38,474
Why do you protect him, Saint?

247
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:39,873
He hurt you.

248
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,513
You don’t have to just give in to him.

249
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,434
Right.

250
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,594
Did Shin threaten you or what?

251
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:45,794
It’s not like that.

252
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,714
Never mind.

253
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,954
We’ll find ways to help you out.

254
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:56,674
Up to you then.

255
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,114
He must be threatened by Shin.

256
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,354
Someone like him wouldn’t stand a chance

257
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:03,314
against anyone.

258
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:05,034
Shin sits next to him, too.

259
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:42,714
Miss Jan.

260
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:43,874
What’s that rumor

261
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,914
about the kid in Class Two named Shin?

262
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,314
What’s the rumor?

263
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:50,994
It's about the kid named Shin

264
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:53,994
who hangs out with the mafia gang.

265
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,233
Right now,

266
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,314
there are nothing but rumors about this.

267
00:16:57,354 --> 00:16:59,834
And the kids are all terrified.

268
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:00,914
No wonder.

269
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,674
He was causing trouble everywhere

270
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:03,730
when he was at Udon Pithak.

271
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,634
That’s not true, Vice Principal.

272
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:07,434
Shin is a good kid.

273
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,794
People might just make it up.

274
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,954
Of course, you must protect your student.

275
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,034
Class 2 is full of delinquents.

276
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,074
That’s right.

277
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:22,154
The kids in Class 2 anymore.

278
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,754
I’ll be frank with you. It’s scary.

279
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:26,954
Who would put themselves at risk?

280
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,074
Do you have any evidence

281
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,354
that Shin is a mafia?

282
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:32,554
If you don’t have any,

283
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,274
then don’t judge him.

284
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:35,914
Please excuse me.

285
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:48,833
Hey, when will he get down here?

286
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,394
I f*cking need a toilet.

287
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,954
Damn, you prick.

288
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,074
We haven’t fought

289
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,514
and you wanted to pee already.

290
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,354
You brat.

291
00:17:58,674 --> 00:18:01,554
Should we just go to see him?

292
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,274
So we fight and get it done with.

293
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,834
Then I can just go to the toilet.

294
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:07,594
Which building

295
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,314
will that brat Shin come out of?

296
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:14,594
You guys keep quiet.

297
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:17,194
He might hear you.

298
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:19,714
Hey.

299
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:20,754
What?

300
00:18:20,914 --> 00:18:21,634
What the heck are you doing?

301
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,554
Come with me.

302
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:23,594
Hey.

303
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:25,754
Let go of me.

304
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:27,674
What the heck are you doing?

305
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,514
Let’s leave from the back.

306
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:30,674
I’m not going.

307
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:33,914
Believe me.

308
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,154
Or else you will fight again.

309
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,634
So what?

310
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:50,634
I’m not afraid of them anyway.

311
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,514
But you’ll be late to pick up Chingching.

312
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:56,194
Let’s go.

313
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:57,714
Come with me.

314
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:58,754
No need.

315
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,554
I can go by myself.

316
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,234
Here. I’ll help you.

317
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:36,114
I didn’t ask for it.

318
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:41,714
Then you can step on my shoulders.

319
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:44,954
Sigh.

320
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,394
Go ahead.

321
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:04,634
Stay out of my business.

322
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:06,474
Just go wherever you want.

323
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,154
I’m not going.

324
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,034
You’re so damn persistent.

325
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,674
So f*cking annoying.

326
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,234
Shin.

327
00:21:20,874 --> 00:21:21,874
What else?

328
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,114
From now on, if you have any issues,

329
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:27,234
you need to tell me, alright?

330
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,794
Why do I have to tell you?

331
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:32,794
I'm worried about you.

332
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:05,874
For paying my back late.

333
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:07,874
Next time, I'll go even harder on you for sure.

334
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:10,994
Look,

335
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:15,594
this is how they collect debts.

336
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:17,714
And if they refuse to pay,

337
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,714
then they’ll have to repay it in another way.

338
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:27,674
Jeng.

339
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:28,674
Jeng.

340
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:30,354
Something’s happened, bro.

341
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,954
The cops are swarming around our building.

342
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,194
They’re everywhere.

343
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:35,994
The f*ck they’re doing here?

344
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,754
The cops have raided our warehouse too.

345
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:40,674
Damn it.

346
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,114
I’m sure it’s that jerk Sung.

347
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,434
Sung?

348
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:53,754
Is it Mr. Sung?

349
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:55,194
I don’t think so.

350
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:57,474
What should we do, bro?

351
00:22:57,514 --> 00:22:58,713
Should we just take them on?

352
00:22:58,714 --> 00:22:59,994
You stupid ass.

353
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,050
They’re surrounding us completely.

354
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:02,114
How could we get out?

355
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:16,194
Ken, I have something for you to do.

356
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:19,474
What’s that, bro?

357
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:22,274
It’s about that jerk Shin.

358
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,474
Are you sure

359
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,634
that Jeng’s gang won’t hurt you?

360
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:32,913
You gave the police a lead that led them

361
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,634
to raid the Dragon Fang's warehouse.

362
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:37,994
It's okay.

363
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:39,954
Right now,

364
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,954
they're being watched by the police.

365
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,554
They’ll probably hide out for a while.

366
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,394
But if they really come

367
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,914
to pick a fight with me,

368
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:52,914
I’m not scared.

369
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:55,914
You haven’t changed one bit, Sung.

370
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:01,634
At least for now,

371
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,634
our students will be safe.

372
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:05,314
They won't be disturbed

373
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,434
by the Dragon Fang.

374
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:12,314
There’s still one student

375
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:13,514
I’m worried about.

376
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:16,794
Is that Shin?

377
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:21,474
This kid is like a ticking bomb.

378
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,394
He can get into trouble at any time.

379
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:39,514
Shin.

380
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:41,393
You forgot your textbook.

381
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:42,274
I don’t want it.

382
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,513
I don’t want to study.

383
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:44,514
Just throw it away.

384
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,114
You need it today.

385
00:24:53,154 --> 00:24:54,354
It’s Miss Wimol’s class.

386
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:56,834
That’s right, Shin.

387
00:24:56,874 --> 00:24:58,954
Or else Miss Wimol will scold you.

388
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,593
Umm. Don’t skip class.

389
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:03,154
I told you I don’t want to study.

390
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,314
Cable.

391
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:06,354
Hey.

392
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:11,833
Hey, did you hurt your friend?

393
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,314
Why are you like this?

394
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:15,074
I’m fine, teacher.

395
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,634
How can you be fine?

396
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:19,194
Are you a student or a thug?

397
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,994
You only know how to use violence.

398
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:23,073
This is what they call a delinquent,

399
00:25:23,074 --> 00:25:24,074
you know?

400
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:26,274
Whatever you want to call it.

401
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:29,034
Do you know whose kid Cable is?

402
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,353
He’s the principal’s son.

403
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:31,114
How can you…

404
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,154
Hey.

405
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:33,570
I hadn't even finished speaking,

406
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:34,753
and you dared to walk away.

407
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:36,394
So disrespectful.

408
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:40,874
Shin.

409
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:42,594
Shin.

410
00:25:43,154 --> 00:25:44,154
Shin.

411
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:45,914
Are you okay?

412
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,114
If someone like me is a delinquent,

413
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:52,074
then what does that make

414
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,474
a piece of trash like you?

415
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:55,674
Huh?

416
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:57,754
Can you stop putting on an act already?

417
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,794
The real piece of trash is you,

418
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,194
not me.

419
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,834
Where are you going?

420
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,394
It’s my business.

421
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:13,834
But we have an extra class today.

422
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:15,634
I’m not going.

423
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:18,714
Don’t go.

424
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,714
Sigh.

425
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,474
I beg you.

426
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,474
Just stop pretending

427
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:24,834
to be a good person already.

428
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:27,674
I'm annoyed.

429
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:31,634
You're not really annoyed with me.

430
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,674
I know.

431
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,354
If you were really annoyed with me,

432
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:39,474
you would make me let go of you already.

433
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:49,514
Did you know that every time you insult me,

434
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:53,074
I never take it to heart?

435
00:26:54,754 --> 00:26:56,754
Because every time I look into your eyes,

436
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:58,954
they’re not the eyes

437
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,234
of someone who hates me.

438
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:03,914
You might be angry with me,

439
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,914
which is so understandable.

440
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,154
But I don’t believe that you hate me.

441
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:24,433
Shin.

442
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,554
Shin.

443
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:27,234
Oh.

444
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:31,914
Uhh.

445
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:35,634
I’ll leave you guys first then.

446
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:37,074
Chadjen.

447
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:39,754
Where are you going?

448
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,114
Well.

449
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:48,273
Seems like you and Saint are…

450
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:49,634
It’s not like that.

451
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:54,594
Don’t get close to me.

452
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:01,034
Are you coming with me, Chadjen?

453
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,594
Saint.

454
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:24,114
Keep trying.

455
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:26,234
Chadjen.

456
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,274
Are you coming?

457
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,274
Yes.

458
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:47,674
Which one?

459
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:48,714
My usual.

460
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:50,354
The same place?

461
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,074
Bye.

462
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:07,514
What’s wrong, Peeta?

463
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,194
About Shin.

464
00:29:11,514 --> 00:29:13,514
Many people started talking about it.

465
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:16,634
Is that so? What about it?

466
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,954
Many begin to be afraid of him

467
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:21,730
because he constantly gets into fights

468
00:29:21,754 --> 00:29:22,754
with others.

469
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:27,674
Are you scared?

470
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:28,834
Don’t be.

471
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:30,234
I’ll protect you.

472
00:29:30,274 --> 00:29:31,474
I’m not scared of him.

473
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,073
When it comes to using force,

474
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,554
you're really good at it.

475
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:36,914
That’s right.

476
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,754
So, when it comes to using brains,

477
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,114
that’s why I have to rely on you.

478
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,114
Umm.

479
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:50,074
Actually, I’m not scared of Shin.

480
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:53,474
Then what are you worried about?

481
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:55,634
I’m afraid

482
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,634
he will cause an even bigger problem,

483
00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:59,634
and then we’ll all be in trouble.

484
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:05,474
Umm, that’s true.

485
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:08,114
He even got into fights with the mafia.

486
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,794
Especially, Saint.

487
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,914
Shin seems to hate Saint strongly.

488
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:16,394
Did you notice that?

489
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:38,874
Where is everyone?

490
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:40,394
They all skipped the class.

491
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,513
But we agreed with each other

492
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:44,154
that you’d attend an extra class.

493
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:45,354
That’s true.

494
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:48,514
But this is normal for students in this class.

495
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,434
Even Chadjen skipped it?

496
00:30:51,594 --> 00:30:54,314
Well, Chadjen just followed what Shin did.

497
00:30:57,794 --> 00:30:58,953
So, let’s cancel this.

498
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,354
I’ll do my delivery job.

499
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:02,474
Even with one person, I’ll teach.

500
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:05,634
Sigh.

501
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,634
But before we start,

502
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:18,514
I have something to ask you.

503
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:21,514
What’s the matter?

504
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:28,594
It’s about Shin.

505
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:33,154
I’m worried that Shin might be expelled.

506
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:46,114
Shin.

507
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,514
You don’t have to send me home today.

508
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:53,954
Don’t you have to pick Chingching up today?

509
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,434
My mom has a day off today

510
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:57,634
so she went to pick her up.

511
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:58,754
I’ll send you home.

512
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:01,874
Okay.

513
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:06,474
Then I’ll ask them to prepare a feast for us.

514
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:08,354
Hey, don’t mind it.

515
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:11,234
That won’t do.

516
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,234
My dad won’t let it happen

517
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,634
as you visit our home.

518
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,234
Well, do as you please.

519
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,554
Uh, Shin.

520
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:37,234
I have something I’d like to ask of you.

521
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:42,594
What’s the matter?

522
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:49,274
I want you and Saint to reconcile.

523
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,554
Stop talking about Saint, Chadjen.

524
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:00,594
Saint is a good friend of you and me.

525
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,634
Saint feels very guilty towards you.

526
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,634
And he loves you a lot.

527
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,954
I told you to stop talking about him.

528
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,234
No.

529
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,514
I’ll keep talking

530
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:15,114
until you forgive Saint.

531
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,114
Why do I have to forgive him?

532
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:20,434
Because my dad once told me that

533
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,834
the past is the past,

534
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:29,794
I think you shouldn’t hold on to it.

535
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,074
But my life fell apart because of him.

536
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:38,914
I can't forgive him.

537
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,914
No matter what, I just can't.

538
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:46,314
Don’t talk about him again.

539
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:48,114
Understand, Chadjen?

540
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,034
Sigh.

541
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,634
What do you need me for?

542
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,954
Have you dealt with Shin yet?

543
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:29,194
Sigh.

544
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,434
I haven’t, bro.

545
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,674
Remember my word, Ken.

546
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:34,634
If someone is nice to me,

547
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:35,794
I’ll be nice to him.

548
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:38,394
If someone treats me like a bastard,

549
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:39,554
I’ll treat him the same way.

550
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,114
And whoever owes me money

551
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:44,554
has to pay it back in full.

552
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:46,674
Got what I mean?

553
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:49,954
Well, I got it, bro.

554
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,554
I’ll definitely deal with him for you.

555
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:55,794
I believe you, Ken.

556
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:58,754
But you couldn’t do it now.

557
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:01,194
There should be an assurance.

558
00:35:03,674 --> 00:35:04,674
Hey.

559
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:16,034
Where are you taking my motorcycle?

560
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,713
While I'm waiting for you to deal with Shin,

561
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:22,314
I’ll keep your motorcycle.

562
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:24,594
I’ll think of it as an assurance.

563
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:27,274
But if you can’t do it,

564
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:28,554
you must pay me back

565
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:29,794
the full amount plus interest.

566
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:31,874
Then, I’ll return the motorcycle to you.

567
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:33,394
Jeng.

568
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:38,554
What’s your problem?

569
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:48,354
Damn it.

570
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:03,114
Hey.

571
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,874
That’s a girl from Udon Pithak.

572
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:06,954
Isn’t that our usual seat?

573
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:08,274
Let’s do it.

574
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:14,833
Have you had breakfast, sis?

575
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:15,354
Huh?

576
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:16,514
Hey.

577
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,554
Where are you going, sis?

578
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:18,034
Where are you going?

579
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:18,874
I’m talking to you.

580
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,874
Sis, don’t you wanna sit here first?

581
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:23,274
Bruh.

582
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,794
She wanted to sit here so badly, bitch.

583
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:30,314
Hey, Ken.

584
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:34,554
Where is your motorcycle?

585
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,234
Jeng took my motorcycle.

586
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:40,754
What?

587
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:41,914
How could he do that?

588
00:36:41,954 --> 00:36:43,394
You just got it, didn’t you?

589
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,074
But he already took it.

590
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:47,434
I'm so frustrated.

591
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:48,794
Took mom ages to trick dad

592
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:49,954
for the down payment.

593
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:53,194
If she knew that

594
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:54,395
the motorcycle was taken away,

595
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:56,354
I’d be done.

596
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:58,434
Damn it.

597
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:07,634
If I couldn’t deal with that jerk Shin,

598
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,634
I had to find the money to pay back

599
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:14,594
so I could have my motorcycle back.

600
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,570
Where am I going to find the money

601
00:37:16,594 --> 00:37:17,754
to pay him back?

602
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:19,154
Don’t worry.

603
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:22,394
The two of us will help you.

604
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:24,753
We just have to ‘sell’ them more.

605
00:37:24,754 --> 00:37:25,770
Why will that be difficult?

606
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:26,434
Right?

607
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:27,154
Yeah.

608
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,314
Never mind.

609
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:31,194
It has nothing to do with you guys.

610
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:32,234
Hey.

611
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,913
How can it be?

612
00:37:33,914 --> 00:37:35,634
You are my friend.

613
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,634
We are your friends.

614
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:39,714
Friends must help friends.

615
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:40,274
Right.

616
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:41,314
Yeah.

617
00:37:43,274 --> 00:37:44,274
Fine.

618
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:45,954
Thanks, guys.

619
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,234
But we're not helping for free, you know.

620
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:52,713
The two of us are in it for the long run.

621
00:37:52,714 --> 00:37:54,314
We want free snacks.

622
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:55,954
That’s right.

623
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:56,754
Free snacks.

624
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:57,354
Free snacks.

625
00:37:57,394 --> 00:37:58,394
Got it.

626
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,034
Let’s go.

627
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,394
Let’s go smoke.

628
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:02,754
Hey, do you have a cig?

629
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,074
I ran out of it.

630
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:08,594
I’ve heard that there’s a student

631
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,594
who got involved with the mafia

632
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:14,394
and also tends to act like a thug,

633
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,114
constantly causing trouble for others.

634
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:19,434
All the other parents and I are concerned

635
00:38:19,474 --> 00:38:22,794
that our children might be in danger.

636
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,394
We would like to know

637
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:29,074
what measures the school has in place

638
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,834
to prevent or address this issue.

639
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:37,010
The school already has a plan in place

640
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:38,354
to handle this.

641
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:40,753
We've had the police deal with

642
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:43,074
the mafia gang,

643
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:45,554
so it’s safe now,

644
00:38:45,594 --> 00:38:47,274
and there's nothing to worry about.

645
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,554
That’s right.

646
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,074
You don’t have to worry.

647
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:53,153
How can I not be worried?

648
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:55,314
Just the fact that my daughter, Peeta,

649
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,994
has to study alongside

650
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,554
the thugs from other campuses

651
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,354
has me so anxious I can’t sleep.

652
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,914
The thugs?

653
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,554
Who do you mean?

654
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:09,074
I’m talking about the kid named Shin.

655
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,234
I’ve heard that he’s the leader of the thugs

656
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:14,834
and likes to pick fights with others

657
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,354
since he was at his old school.

658
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:20,674
Even though Shin may seem a bit tough,

659
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,514
he’s not a bad kid.

660
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,714
Also, he’s not the leader of the thugs.

661
00:39:24,754 --> 00:39:26,434
Please don’t make excuses for the kid.

662
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:29,914
I already know it all.

663
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:33,353
He’s the reason the mafia gang

664
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:34,674
is getting close to the school.

665
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:37,994
This kid is putting our children in danger.

666
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:39,474
But…

667
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:40,474
Miss Jan.

668
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:42,314
Please don’t say anything right now.

669
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,674
What would you like the school

670
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,034
to do about this issue?

671
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,274
I

672
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:54,154
And all members of the parent association

673
00:39:54,674 --> 00:39:56,474
want this kid named Shin

674
00:39:56,514 --> 00:39:58,074
expelled from the school.

675
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:02,194
The parents will take action against the school

676
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,954
if we don’t expel this kid named Shin.

677
00:40:04,994 --> 00:40:06,274
I understand,

678
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:07,754
but it’s difficult

679
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:10,794
to just expel a student like that.

680
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:14,714
But if the school refuses to take any action,

681
00:40:15,394 --> 00:40:17,834
all the members of the parent association

682
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,554
unanimously agree on this.

683
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,834
We will withdraw

684
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:32,074
our financial support for the school.

685
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:37,074
Honestly, I don't want to do this.

686
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:39,993
But if sacrificing one kid

687
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:41,794
can help the entire school,

688
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,394
I believe we have to do it.

689
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:45,874
Then should we gather evidence?

690
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:49,074
Evidence that is sufficient to expel that kid.

691
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:53,234
The principal has instructed all students

692
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:54,594
to conduct a survey

693
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:56,754
about violence in the school,

694
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,114
asking if anyone has ever seen,

695
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:00,433
encountered,

696
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:01,914
or heard

697
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:04,274
about incidents related to violence,

698
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:06,674
whether it happened to themselves

699
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:08,513
or their friends.

700
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:12,474
Hey, I wonder if it’s Shin.

701
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:15,794
In this survey,

702
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,714
You don’t need to provide your name.

703
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:21,354
About Shin caused someone to die.

704
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:22,514
Sure.

705
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:23,674
He killed someone.

706
00:41:24,154 --> 00:41:25,154
Guys.

707
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,314
And if the results show that

708
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,450
the students in Class 2 have been bullied

709
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,434
by that kid named Shin,

710
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:36,474
Should we write to teachers about Shin?

711
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:42,234
Hey.

712
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,993
Write a lot.

713
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,354
Take him down.

714
00:41:46,074 --> 00:41:49,714
It’d provide enough reason to expel him.

715
00:42:08,554 --> 00:42:13,954
SHIN CAUSED SOMEONE TO DIE.

716
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:17,194
It looks like the results will be unanimous.

717
00:42:34,394 --> 00:42:35,394
Hey.

718
00:42:35,634 --> 00:42:37,394
Look who’s here.

719
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:39,394
Oho.

720
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:41,994
Do you smell something?

721
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:44,194
What smell?

722
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:46,834
The smell of someone

723
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:48,154
who’s about to be expelled.

724
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:49,834
Damn it.

725
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,553
The smell is so strong.

726
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:53,154
It's really stinky, you bastard.

727
00:42:53,994 --> 00:42:54,994
Are you okay?

728
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:57,354
The smell is getting into my throat.

729
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:01,194
Damn it.

730
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:02,514
So stingy.

731
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:04,194
The heck you’re ranting about?

732
00:43:05,594 --> 00:43:06,634
Who will be expelled?

733
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:11,314
Hey, don’t you realize that

734
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:13,914
everyone in the school is scared of you?

735
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,154
Are you a person or a ghost?

736
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:16,954
No one wants to be near you,

737
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:18,954
except for the Udorn Pithak.

738
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:21,274
That's good.

739
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:24,434
I don’t want to be near you guys anyway.

740
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:26,594
Oh, he talks big.

741
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:30,914
You sure are tough, huh?

742
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,314
Shin, don’t.

743
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,433
Saint, you jerk.

744
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:35,930
It’s you again? What the f*ck is wrong with you?

745
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:37,554
I won't let you guys do anything to him.

746
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,114
Just leave me alone already.

747
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:41,874
I already told you.

748
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,234
No matter how much you try to kick me out,

749
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:49,874
I’m not going anywhere.

750
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:53,034
Damn. So sweet.

751
00:43:55,234 --> 00:43:56,354
Back off.

752
00:43:56,754 --> 00:43:57,754
Shin.

753
00:43:58,234 --> 00:43:59,234
I'm begging you.

754
00:43:59,634 --> 00:44:01,634
What do I have to do for you to stop?

755
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:03,274
Please just tell me.

756
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:09,074
Even if you don't want me to fight them,

757
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,194
you can punch them on my behalf.

758
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:31,194
Alright.

759
00:44:33,194 --> 00:44:37,354
Whoa, the real Tsunami is stepping up.

760
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:40,114
I really want to see this.

761
00:44:43,674 --> 00:44:44,674
Is he crazy?

762
00:44:47,594 --> 00:44:48,594
Go ahead.

763
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,394
You guys can stomp on me.

764
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,794
I'm not going to fight you.

765
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:58,554
Are you crazy, Saint?

766
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:02,954
Yeah, I must be crazy already.

767
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:04,594
Stomp on me then.

768
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:12,274
Sure.

769
00:45:13,274 --> 00:45:14,394
I’ll take care of you.

770
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,834
Hey, you’re done.

771
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:21,954
Are you trying to act like a hero?

772
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:23,050
You're being nosy, you know?

773
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:24,034
Already been several times.

774
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:26,233
What the hell are you being nosy about?

775
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:27,353
Are you trying to interfere, you bastard?

776
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:28,514
What’s your problem?

777
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:31,634
Come here.

778
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:36,914
Don’t you want to help him?

779
00:45:37,754 --> 00:45:38,954
Nah.

780
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:40,434
He’s not my friend.

781
00:45:41,314 --> 00:45:43,033
Oh damn, he said he's not a friend.

782
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,154
Keep stomping on him then.

783
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:50,274
Are you hurt, you prick?

784
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,874
He said you’re not his friend.

785
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:55,314
Not his friend?

786
00:45:58,274 --> 00:45:59,594
You’re done, jerk.

787
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:00,634
F*ck.

788
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:03,994
My hands hurt like hell.

789
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:04,674
Damn.

790
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:06,034
Let’s go.

791
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:07,954
Let’s go to a class with the AC.

792
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:19,954
Good thing your boyfriend helped you out.

793
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,834
What the hell are you smiling about?

794
00:46:40,954 --> 00:46:42,954
I'm glad you didn't fight them.

795
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,914
I could protect you.

796
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:10,514
Shin.

797
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:15,674
Should we skip class?

798
00:47:17,354 --> 00:47:18,594
What’s your approach this time?

799
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:22,954
If I go back to class looking like this,

800
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:25,154
there will definitely be more problems.

801
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:26,514
And you'll be in trouble too.

802
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:44,154
The principal is going to

803
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,514
expel Shin from school.

804
00:47:45,594 --> 00:47:47,714
If you don't stop, you might get expelled.

805
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:48,514
Shin.

806
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:49,554
Damn.

807
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:51,434
If we leave it like this,

808
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:52,834
who knows what might happen next.

809
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:54,274
I ask for a chance for Shin.

810
00:47:54,314 --> 00:47:55,754
Why do you have to care

811
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:58,194
about the students so much?

812
00:47:58,234 --> 00:47:58,994
What else do you want?

813
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:00,073
Did I ask you for help?

814
00:48:00,074 --> 00:48:01,234
I won't let you go anywhere.

815
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,714
The current situation isn't very good, Saint.

816
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:05,394
And if I make everyone understand Shin,

817
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:07,114
he won't get expelled, right?
