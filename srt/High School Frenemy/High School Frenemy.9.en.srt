Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,850
Saint is not here again?

6
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:19,580
Maybe he cries in secret because of Shin.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,631
Why the heck did you hit the desk?

8
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:24,480
It's clear that his absence from class is because of you.

9
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:25,961
You need to take responsibility.

10
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:27,715
If I come back,

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,831
will you stay in school, too?

12
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:29,974
Yeah, I’ll stay.

13
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:34,007
This situation has really changed the way I see you.

14
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,478
I didn’t expect you to care this much about the kids.

15
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,964
You and I are not friends, still.

16
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:40,318
Then what is us?

17
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:41,802
Just classmates.

18
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,454
The exam is coming.

19
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,424
I want you to start studying for the exam.

20
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,710
Do you hear me, class?

21
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,008
Yes, Peeta.

22
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:01,694
Can you tell me the exam guidelines?

23
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,915
I’ll write them on the board.

24
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:07,660
You need to study hard for the exam.

25
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,414
Do you get it?

26
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,204
Yes.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
What about the others?

28
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:20,455
Saint.

29
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,975
Shin, what are you looking at outside?

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,114
They don’t hear anything except one sound.

31
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,691
What sound?

32
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,095
Class.

33
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,265
Goodbye.

34
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:36,317
Let’s go.

35
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:39,110
Okay, class dismissed.

36
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,542
Wait up.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
(Social Studies Exam)

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,410
EXAM

39
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:44,511
Hello.

40
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,408
(Hello, Saint.)

41
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:47,925
Chingching.

42
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,007
Why are you calling me?

43
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,202
(Saint, I…)

44
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:54,338
You what?

45
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:56,272
What’s wrong, Chingching? You can tell me.

46
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,170
(I…)

47
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,404
(I…)

48
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:02,605
(I’m hungry.)

49
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,132
Huh?

50
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:11,520
There’s no food in your house?

51
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,957
(There was.)

52
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,708
There was? Where is it?

53
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:21,034
(Shin burnt it while he tried to cook it.)

54
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:26,381
He still sucks at cooking.

55
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,151
How about this?

56
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,014
I’m going to pick you up, okay?

57
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:32,842
(Roger that.)

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,420
Okay. See you.

59
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Chingching.

60
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,681
Go inside.

61
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,110
I’ll order delivery food for you.

62
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:00,737
No, I don’t want to eat it.

63
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,705
Come on, be good.

64
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,674
Otherwise, I won’t buy you snacks.

65
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,958
I’ll ask Saint to buy them for me.

66
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,968
Saint? But he’s not here.

67
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:14,070
There is Saint.

68
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:15,364
Huh?

69
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,910
What are you doing here?

70
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,370
I told him to come here.

71
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,917
Why did you do that?

72
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,767
To take you and her to eat dinner.

73
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:31,662
Why?

74
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:34,957
Didn’t you burn your dinner?

75
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,917
It’s burnt to a cinder.

76
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:44,501
It was a mistake.

77
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:47,235
Shin always makes mistakes when cooking.

78
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,252
I’m hungry.

79
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:50,178
Come on.

80
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,604
I’ll take you to eat Pok Pok noodles, alright?

81
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,482
Yes.

82
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,697
No.

83
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,210
I can order noodles for you.

84
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,228
It’s just the same.

85
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:58,582
It’s not.

86
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,610
It’s more delicious if you eat at a shop when it’s freshly made.

87
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:02,924
That’s right.

88
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:06,058
I want to eat noodles at the shop of Saint’s dad.

89
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,510
You can go.

90
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:13,678
I’m not hungry.

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
You’re not hungry?

92
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,361
Dad.

93
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,518
Dad.

94
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,362
Yes.

95
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,902
I took our old customers here.

96
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,922
Who are our old customers?

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,002
Step down carefully.

98
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,311
Who are they?

99
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:40,578
Uncle Chai.

100
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,468
Chingching. Come here.

101
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:48,675
Long time no see.

102
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:50,767
You grew up so fast.

103
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:53,460
How old are you now?

104
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:54,801
I’m a big girl now.

105
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,058
A big girl?

106
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:58,401
- Hello. - Hello, Shin.

107
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,095
Are you hungry?

108
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:00,922
Yes.

109
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,110
You’re hungry? Don’t worry.

110
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:05,368
I’ll make noodles for you.

111
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,501
Saint, go make noodles for her.

112
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,221
Sure, Dad.

113
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,964
Shin, do you want to eat it too?

114
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:11,870
Yes.

115
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,121
Eat as much as you want.

116
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,230
Are you going with your usual?

117
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:17,251
Five nests of noodles

118
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:17,917
with pork balls and char siu pork.

119
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,625
Wait.

120
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:19,924
I only need two nests, dork.

121
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:21,965
I’m joking.

122
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:23,605
No spring onion, right?

123
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,520
Saint, you have such a good memory.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,601
If you remember what I like, why don’t you season the noodles for me?

125
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,776
A half spoon of sugar, two spoons of ground peanuts,

126
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,920
and a spoon of chili flakes.

127
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,701
I remember everything about you.

128
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:39,410
Move. Get away from me.

129
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:41,165
I said I wouldn’t give it to you.

130
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,830
Easy, girl.

131
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,490
Hold on.

132
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:51,412
Give me your chat contact.

133
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,470
Then I’ll let you go.

134
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,538
Move.

135
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:54,618
We aren’t friends.

136
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,821
Leave me alone.

137
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,101
Let go of me.

138
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,802
The girl said no. Don’t you get it?

139
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:02,191
That’s none of your business.

140
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Do you want to try me?

141
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:05,744
Shin, don’t start a fight.

142
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,570
Are you Shin from Udon Pithak?

143
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:12,314
Yes.

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,827
If you want to fight me,

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,320
you can always come to me.

146
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:16,907
Bring it on.

147
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,911
- Bring it on. - Shin, stop it.

148
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,605
Class 3 boys.

149
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,708
If you do anything to my friends,

150
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,842
I’ll shoot a video and show it to Miss Wimol.

151
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,497
I’ll tell her that you provoke us first.

152
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,302
Fine.

153
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
I can wait.

154
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,064
See you around.

155
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:46,824
Let’s go, guys.

156
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:54,067
Peeta, are you okay?

157
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I’m okay.

158
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,405
Thanks for helping me.

159
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,145
Did you have dinner?

160
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,110
Do you want to eat noodles with us?

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
It’s okay.

162
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,990
You just finished the extra class.

163
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:10,882
You haven’t had dinner, right?

164
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:12,818
Go eat my dad’s noodles.

165
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,088
They are delicious.

166
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,512
Come on. Let’s go.

167
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,424
Come here.

168
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,120
Come and eat my noodles.

169
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:29,707
You are my son’s friend, right?

170
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,352
Good. I’ll make special noodles for you.

171
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,200
I’ll make noodles for your family too.

172
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,410
Chingching, are you hungry?

173
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,967
- Yes. - You’re hungry.

174
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,182
Saint.

175
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Slice char siu pork.

176
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,661
Yes, Dad.

177
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,394
Wait a minute.

178
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,378
Hello, I’m Chingching.

179
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,317
Pretty sister, what’s your name?

180
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:56,218
I’m Peeta.

181
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
You are…

182
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,710
She’s my sister.

183
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,868
Come on, Chingching.

184
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,582
Help me set up the table.

185
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:04,753
Aren’t you going to take off the helmet?

186
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:05,507
No.

187
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,708
Sweetie, what noodles do you want?

188
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,420
I’ll have rice stick noodles.

189
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:13,300
I’ll have wide rice noodles.

190
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,032
Chingching, didn’t you order egg noodles?

191
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,125
No.

192
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,151
Pretty sis, come to sit here.

193
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,270
Thanks.

194
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,990
Hey.

195
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,521
Look at him. Isn’t he hot?

196
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:43,022
Yes, but he’s not my type.

197
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,911
Good. So we won’t fight over him.

198
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,504
He’s all mine.

199
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,017
You’re talking as if he’s interested in you.

200
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,395
You are so mean.

201
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:53,985
Aren’t you my friend?

202
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:55,570
I’m kidding.

203
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,521
You’re pretty and amazing.

204
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,105
Of course, he’ll be interested in you.

205
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:01,431
Now, you sound like my best friend.

206
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,912
Can you two lower your voice?

207
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:05,111
I can’t focus on my study.

208
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:07,564
Then study.

209
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,912
You’re loud. I can’t focus.

210
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,418
If you can’t focus, then go study somewhere else.

211
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:15,717
This is a library.

212
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,722
Do I need to tell you library etiquette?

213
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:21,361
Why?

214
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,234
Is a library a quiet room?

215
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:25,085
You can study whatever you want.

216
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,512
If you feel distracted,

217
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,977
you can wear your stupid earphones.

218
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:31,444
Then the problem is solved.

219
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,922
Hey, this is too much.

220
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,175
You’re acting like this.

221
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:37,368
That’s why Udon Pithak kids…

222
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
They what?

223
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,205
Who do you think you are to judge us?

224
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:41,914
Huh?

225
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,262
Girls.

226
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,447
Lower your voice.

227
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,134
What are you arguing? This is the library.

228
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:51,874
Nothing, Mr. Jo.

229
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,774
Someone just pretends to be a good girl.

230
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Let’s go, Airy.

231
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,815
Let’s paint for fun.

232
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,604
Who did this?

233
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,130
Who the hell did this?

234
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,201
It’s all pink.

235
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:59,605
Oh, the color is perfect for you, Peeta.

236
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,047
You did it, didn’t you?

237
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,084
Did you slap my friend? I’ll hit you back.

238
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,410
Leave my friend alone.

239
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,026
Don’t butt in. This is between me and her.

240
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,928
Why did you splash paint on my locker?

241
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,858
What the hell are you talking about?

242
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:18,861
You not only accuse me but also hit me.

243
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:21,017
If you didn’t do it, who did it?

244
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:22,112
How the hell would I know?

245
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:24,112
Your friend is so unlikable.

246
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:25,381
Can’t you see it?

247
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,790
It’s not surprising if someone hates her.

248
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,270
Stop it.

249
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:31,224
Stop it!

250
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,507
Stay out of my way, Eve.

251
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:33,691
Admit that you did it.

252
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:35,111
- I’m going to fight her. - Girls.

253
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,507
You two had better admit that you did it.

254
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
I didn’t do it.

255
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,690
Why did you do it?

256
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,460
Your friend is lying. Let me go.

257
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
Hey, stop it.

258
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,201
Stop it.

259
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,731
Girls.

260
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:47,294
- Do you have a problem with me, Eve? - Girls, stop it.

261
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:47,972
Stop it.

262
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,511
I said stop it.

263
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:53,905
Tell me what’s going on.

264
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,812
These brats threw paint at Peeta’s locker.

265
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,097
I told you I didn’t do it.

266
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,735
Don’t you get it, bitch?

267
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:01,752
You are the bitch here.

268
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:02,942
Eve, calm down.

269
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,200
You should talk things out.

270
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:07,182
Mr. Sung and Miss Jan are here to help.

271
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,631
Did you do it?

272
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:26,378
Even if we tell you the truth, you won’t believe us anyway.

273
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,120
Because we are from Udon Pithak.

274
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:30,177
That has nothing to do with it.

275
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,805
I just want you to tell me the truth.

276
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:36,370
The truth? It’s useless.

277
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,815
Because you and these brats already judged me.

278
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
What Airy said is right.

279
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,070
You have no evidence to prove it.

280
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,978
You can’t accuse her like this.

281
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:51,578
Peeta never had a problem with anyone except with these brats.

282
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:53,471
I told you I didn’t do it.

283
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:54,484
Hey.

284
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,617
I’ll investigate it.

285
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:02,382
If you don’t stop fighting, I’ll punish all of you.

286
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,570
Here.

287
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
What is this?

288
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,630
Textbooks.

289
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,850
Why are you giving them to me?

290
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,415
I don’t use them anyway.

291
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:42,065
You should take them to study for the upcoming exam.

292
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:46,347
Thanks.

293
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,854
Alright.

294
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,412
Aren’t you going to focus on your study?

295
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:53,257
No.

296
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,508
I’m tired. I’d rather sleep.

297
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,291
Saint, you’re our class president.

298
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:01,158
You should pay attention in class.

299
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,812
I know you’re not stupid.

300
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:07,882
I feel sleepy. I’m going to get some rest.

301
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:18,484
Peeta.

302
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:21,731
What?

303
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,720
These are my lecture notes.

304
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,310
Maybe you want to study them for the exam.

305
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:39,945
It’s okay.

306
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,710
Take them.

307
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,150
I want to help you.

308
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,211
I see you’ve been working hard in school.

309
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,874
You’re also working hard.

310
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,311
We’re always competing to be the top student.

311
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,868
But I never view you as my competitor.

312
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,111
You’re my friend.

313
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:25,297
Excuse me.

314
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,271
I heard that there was bullying in Class 2.

315
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,110
Why did you let it happen again?

316
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:56,720
We’re investigating to find out who did it.

317
00:18:57,434 --> 00:19:00,400
Are you sure that the students of Class 2 will get better grades?

318
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,970
There are new problems in the class every day.

319
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:05,524
I’m sorry.

320
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,210
If you find out who did it,

321
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:15,107
I want disciplinary teachers to take a hard line with them.

322
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,672
I want to set an example for other students.

323
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,264
Can you do it, Mr. Pokpong?

324
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,694
Yes, Principal.

325
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,901
I’ll help Miss Jan and Mr. Sung investigate it.

326
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,507
Miss Jan and Mr. Sung,

327
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:45,445
you need to focus on the overall grades of Class 2.

328
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,675
I hope that in this exam,

329
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,511
your students will get better grades like we’ve hoped.

330
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,358
I hope your class won’t cause another problem.

331
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:07,948
Yes.

332
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,418
We will take care of our students,

333
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:13,752
especially regarding their studies.

334
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,024
In this exam,

335
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,304
I believe that they will do well.

336
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,485
Good.

337
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Peeta.

338
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,315
Peeta.

339
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:45,587
Peeta.

340
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,411
The Thai language exam was easy.

341
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:49,967
Miss Jan is very kind to us.

342
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:52,825
Am I right?

343
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:54,161
Yes.

344
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
What’s wrong?

345
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,834
Nothing. I’m going to the bathroom.

346
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:06,342
Okay.

347
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:08,941
What?

348
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:10,338
Give me your hand.

349
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,484
The answers for the social studies exam.

350
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,721
Ging, where did you get it?

351
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,010
From them.

352
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:25,270
Ging, this is cheating.

353
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,574
Where did you get the exam answers?

354
00:21:57,962 --> 00:22:01,465
I’ll give you a chance to tell me the truth.

355
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:04,900
Who stole the exam paper?

356
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:10,515
If you don’t tell me,

357
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,222
I’ll give an F to all of you.

358
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,480
I don’t know who stole it.

359
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,302
It was passed on among the students.

360
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,377
I got it from them.

361
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,907
Ging, why are you blaming us?

362
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,862
That’s right. We gave it to help you.

363
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,512
Thep Burapha kid is so…

364
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:30,277
Then tell the teachers where you got it from.

365
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,210
We didn’t steal it.

366
00:22:36,894 --> 00:22:39,818
Tew, you should tell the teachers

367
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:42,168
where you got the answers.

368
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,212
I don’t want to see you and First get an F.

369
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:48,718
I...

370
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,757
I got it from a student in another class.

371
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,911
It was passed on among the students.

372
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:55,810
If you don’t believe me, you can ask them.

373
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,404
You are so damn stupid.

374
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:03,167
You got caught easily.

375
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
We should have benefitted from it too.

376
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:06,504
But now we lost the chance.

377
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:09,575
Alright.

378
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:11,292
Come to the front.

379
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,432
I said come to the front right now.

380
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Give me your hand.

381
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:57,484
Hit me.

382
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,775
Why?

383
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,905
I told you to hit me.

384
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,467
I won’t do it.

385
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:12,808
I told you to hit me.

386
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:22,067
Miss Jan.

387
00:24:30,214 --> 00:24:31,214
Next one.

388
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:33,901
Miss Jan.

389
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,671
Ging, hit me.

390
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:43,975
But…

391
00:24:56,634 --> 00:24:58,602
Tew, it’s your turn.

392
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:04,914
Hit me.

393
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,178
Why are you doing this?

394
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:20,771
It’s because I’m a terrible teacher.

395
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:26,168
I fail to stop you from becoming this.

396
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:37,010
Stealing the exam paper.

397
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:39,807
Bullying your classmate.

398
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:45,312
It’s my fault.

399
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,687
I’ll let you punish me.

400
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:52,164
Hit me.

401
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:53,980
Miss Jan.

402
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:54,811
Miss Jan.

403
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:55,864
- Miss Jan. - Hit me.

404
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:56,878
Miss Jan.

405
00:25:57,971 --> 00:25:58,701
Miss Jan.

406
00:25:58,934 --> 00:25:59,934
Miss Jan, stop it.

407
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:17,107
Everyone, watch this.

408
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,315
Watch what you have done.

409
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:25,701
When you choose the wrong path,

410
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,368
look how much it hurts your teacher.

411
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:36,714
Class president.

412
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,950
Look after the class.

413
00:26:40,635 --> 00:26:41,635
I’ll be right back.

414
00:26:41,897 --> 00:26:42,897
Yes.

415
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,914
Miss Jan, can I talk to you?

416
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:15,121
Miss Jan.

417
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:18,728
You can’t do that in front of the kids.

418
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:22,214
They don’t get it.

419
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:24,444
It’s not their fault.

420
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,837
It’s our fault as teachers.

421
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,272
Don’t blame yourself.

422
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,444
It’s not your fault.

423
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:38,637
Of course, it is.

424
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,377
It’s our fault.

425
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,111
We pressured them to get good grades.

426
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,442
They chose to do what was wrong.

427
00:27:54,224 --> 00:27:56,024
So they could deliver the result we expected.

428
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,705
Is this the right way to teach them?

429
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,965
Adults like us are ruining them.

430
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:03,011
Saint, what are you doing here?

431
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:06,864
What are you guys doing here?

432
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,318
Chadjen asked you first.

433
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,311
I’m worried about Miss Jan.

434
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:17,617
Us too.

435
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:23,014
Shin, you are worried about Miss Jan?

436
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:26,815
I’m just checking on her for Tew and First.

437
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,882
They are too afraid to face her.

438
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:31,945
That’s right.

439
00:29:32,474 --> 00:29:34,910
Shin and I want to talk to her.

440
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,507
Why didn’t you go talk to her?

441
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:41,422
Why are you watching her from here?

442
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,308
I don’t know what to say to her.

443
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:49,705
But standing here is not helping her.

444
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:53,011
Chadjen, why don’t you go talk to her?

445
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,278
What are you guys doing?

446
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:59,260
You should go first. I’ll follow you.

447
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,402
You both are useless.

448
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:05,477
Why aren’t you walking to her?

449
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,800
I also don’t know what to say to her.

450
00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:13,428
How about this?

451
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,071
If we don’t know what to say to her,

452
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:21,210
we can just sit with her.

453
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,302
Sit with her without saying anything.

454
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,035
To show that we’re here for her?

455
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,115
Yes.

456
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:32,077
We’re kids.

457
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:34,544
We don’t need to try to comfort her.

458
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
That’s a good idea.

459
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,550
It’s pretty easy.

460
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,615
What’s going on?

461
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:30,628
If you have nothing to say to me,

462
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,810
why are you here?

463
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,621
Saint, answer her.

464
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,304
You’re our class president.

465
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:48,644
What is it?

466
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:54,867
I…

467
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,871
Miss Jan, does it hurt?

468
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,750
Huh?

469
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,068
What hurts?

470
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:06,277
Your hand.

471
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:08,867
Oh, my hand.

472
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,448
My hand is not hurt.

473
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:17,131
But my heart is.

474
00:32:19,868 --> 00:32:21,707
I fail to be a good teacher.

475
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:32,581
Thank you.

476
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,444
For sitting with me.

477
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:50,052
If the students had the answers for the social studies exam,

478
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:53,005
it means your exam paper was leaked.

479
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,470
It must have been stolen by a student in Class 2.

480
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,700
I’m positive that it was not stolen by a student from another class.

481
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:06,875
But Miss Jan and I asked our students.

482
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:10,782
They all said that they got the answers from students in other classes.

483
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,930
It’s unlikely that they stole it.

484
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,070
I don’t care.

485
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:17,805
If you don’t have evidence to prove

486
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,915
that it was stolen by a student in another class,

487
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:23,204
Class 2 should fail the exam.

488
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:24,825
It’s not fair to other students

489
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,007
who weren’t part of the cheating.

490
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,370
How about this?

491
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,405
Can you give Miss Jan and me more time

492
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:36,794
to investigate it?

493
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,215
That’s a good idea, Miss Wimol.

494
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:43,820
Give them some time to investigate it.

495
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,514
This will be fair to the students.

496
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Fine.

497
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:53,915
If you fail to unveil the truth,

498
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:56,907
I need to inform the principal

499
00:33:57,265 --> 00:33:59,707
that Class 2 will fail the exam.

500
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,017
Isn’t she a student of Class 3

501
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:40,617
supervised by Miss Wimol?

502
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,251
That’s right.

503
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
I know her.

504
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:01,610
I think her name is Prang.

505
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:10,375
You are Prang, aren’t you?

506
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,010
Yes.

507
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,007
Didn’t you know that

508
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,687
there was CCTV in the staff room?

509
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:23,510
It was not smart to do this.

510
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:26,714
I was wrong.

511
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:31,068
Did you do it alone?

512
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,311
Yes, I did it alone.

513
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,945
No one helped me.

514
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,145
Are you sure?

515
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:45,622
Yes.

516
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,868
Did someone force you to do it?

517
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,158
You can tell us.

518
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,520
No one forced me.

519
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,575
I did it alone.

520
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:01,415
It was wrong. I’m sorry.

521
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,572
You’re hiding something, aren’t you?

522
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:10,120
Did someone threaten you?

523
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
No.

524
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:17,385
I did it alone.

525
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,992
It was my idea.

526
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:24,770
I was wrong. I’m sorry.

527
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:35,924
Prang.

528
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:45,107
You know that you can always tell us anything?

529
00:36:58,152 --> 00:37:00,020
Thep Burapha kids in Class 3?

530
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:04,568
Yes, they forced me to steal the exam paper.

531
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,575
I didn’t know what to do.

532
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:11,972
If I refused to do it,

533
00:37:12,712 --> 00:37:14,034
they would bully me.

534
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:16,535
It’s okay.

535
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:23,305
Do you know the girl named Peeta?

536
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,627
Yes, she’s our class vice president.

537
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:29,792
Why?

538
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,417
They told me to bully her.

539
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:34,991
I had no choice.

540
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:37,447
Wait.

541
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,115
Peeta’s locker,

542
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:41,851
it was you?

543
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,910
They said if I didn’t do it,

544
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:54,827
They would release the photos they secretly took when I was in the changing room.

545
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,107
They threatened to send the photos to everyone in school.

546
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,410
I didn’t know what to do.

547
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I was scared.

548
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:07,371
Please help me.

549
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:11,921
It’ll be alright.

550
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,602
Damn it.

551
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:24,907
Who is in the photos?

552
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,342
Prang.

553
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,610
That’s them.

554
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:32,962
These bastards.

555
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,672
Stop bragging.

556
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,718
What kind of bastard are they to blackmail a girl?

557
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:45,582
What should I do?

558
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:48,421
Did you tell the teacher about it?

559
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,177
I told Miss Wimol.

560
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:56,535
But when they found out that I told her,

561
00:38:57,997 --> 00:38:59,671
they bullied me even more.

562
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,870
Did you tell the teacher about it?

563
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,117
I’m sorry.

564
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:06,467
I was wrong.

565
00:39:11,132 --> 00:39:12,770
Don’t forget that I have your photos.

566
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:16,608
I have both videos and photos.

567
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:21,115
Please delete them. I’m begging you.

568
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:28,124
Keep in mind if you tell the teacher about it,

569
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,308
I’ll send your pretty photos to everyone.

570
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,402
So they know how hot your body is.

571
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:45,984
That’s the way.

572
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:49,978
Let’s go.

573
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:51,868
Come on.

574
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:54,710
Bye, sweetie.

575
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:03,910
I’m too afraid to do anything.

576
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:07,302
I’m worried that the bullying will get worse.

577
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:13,412
Thing like this needs practice.

578
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:19,407
I have an idea.

579
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:21,504
Don’t worry.

580
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:26,515
Yes, we’ll find a way to help you.

581
00:40:27,437 --> 00:40:28,437
Okay?

582
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,184
These assh*les are so disgusting.

583
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,444
We should beat them up.

584
00:40:44,172 --> 00:40:45,398
This is terrible.

585
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:48,251
We should tell the teacher about it.

586
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,688
Chajen, it’s useless to tell the teacher.

587
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,324
They will get more furious if they find out.

588
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:55,814
Then they’ll bully Prang even more.

589
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:57,694
You’re right.

590
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:00,680
We should kick their ass to teach them a lesson.

591
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:04,014
If we do that,

592
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,908
we will get into trouble.

593
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:09,970
Are you going to let them keep bullying us?

594
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:12,028
Why do we need to put up with it?

595
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,688
Tew, First, go get our friends.

596
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,512
Yes, that’s the spirit.

597
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,670
Shin, I think we should…

598
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,865
We have to do this.

599
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:26,945
I need to protect our Udo Pithak fellow.

600
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:29,178
Let’s go.

601
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,770
Come on, Chadjen.

602
00:41:35,197 --> 00:41:36,197
Guys.

603
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,017
Why are you smiling?

604
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,131
We’re too old for this.

605
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,635
Pipe.

606
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:52,935
What?

607
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:02,795
Delete my friend’s videos.

608
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:04,881
What are you talking about?

609
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,148
Prang’s videos.

610
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,386
Will you delete them or do we need to beat you up first?

611
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,614
You bully a girl? You’re a real assh*le.

612
00:42:13,972 --> 00:42:15,692
How does that have anything to do with you?

613
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:18,817
Prang is a Udon Pithak student.

614
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,171
It means you have a problem with us.

615
00:42:24,894 --> 00:42:26,785
What’s going on here?

616
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,234
You always cause trouble if I take my eyes off you.

617
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,612
What is Class 2 doing here?

618
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,028
Delete them.

619
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,205
It’s not your business.

620
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:37,101
Don’t butt in.

621
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:40,287
Then hit me.

622
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:42,177
So it’ll become my business.

623
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:45,435
Are you sure?

624
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:48,271
Fine.

625
00:42:48,294 --> 00:42:48,902
Stop it.

626
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:49,611
Stop it.

627
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:50,715
I said stop it.

628
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:51,551
Stop it now.

629
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:52,688
Stop it.

630
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:56,107
I have to report the cheating to the principal soon.

631
00:42:56,988 --> 00:42:58,940
Don’t you have any leads on it?

632
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:02,424
Not yet.

633
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,508
Can you give us more time to investigate it?

634
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:12,060
I have a hunch that someone forced her to do it.

635
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:16,437
Sir, we have a problem.

636
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:17,634
What’s wrong?

637
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,268
Students of Class 2 are having a fight with students of Class 3.

638
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,974
Where are they?

639
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:34,171
They were in the room a few minutes ago.

640
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:35,757
I mean it.

641
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:37,511
This is not good.

642
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,817
We have a big problem.

643
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:41,855
Are they…

644
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,490
Yes.

645
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,931
I think they are going to start a brawl.

646
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,125
Are you sure, Class 3?

647
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:01,548
Do you want to start a war with us?

648
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,022
Bring it on. I’m not afraid of you.

649
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:16,847
Go kick their ass.

650
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,910
Thank you for remembering our promise.

651
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,458
I was too quick to judge you.

652
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:33,934
I just want to be nice to you.

653
00:44:34,915 --> 00:44:36,860
How can you sell my bike?

654
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,065
You owed me money.

655
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,420
I have the right to sell it.

656
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,244
I want to get back at Jeng.

657
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:42,405
I have an offer for you.

658
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:44,515
If you accept it, we’ll leave Shin alone.

659
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:45,914
What do you want me to do?

660
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:48,692
Who’s that?

661
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:50,798
Shin.

662
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:51,312
Saint.

663
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,325
Bastard.

664
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:54,184
If we can’t run away, let’s fight together.
