1
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,825
I’d like you to change the representatives to Cable and Peeta.

2
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,748
What you did isn’t fair.

3
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:24,653
It’s not wrong to have a favorite student.

4
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,815
But when it’s this obvious,

5
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:27,970
it just looks ugly.

6
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,425
I heard that Jeng is planning to ambush and beat the crap out of Saint and Shin.

7
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:33,825
Saint is gonna end up dead at this rate.

8
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,061
Jeng, I think that’s enough.

9
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:41,452
THE MISSING FRIENDS

10
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,956
Ouch.

11
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,910
Stay still.

12
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:08,249
Ouch! Shin, can you be gentle?

13
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,511
Didn’t you say getting beaten wasn’t that hurt?

14
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:13,548
I’m just dressing your wound.

15
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,582
It’s different.

16
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:17,443
I could endure the pain then

17
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,172
because I was thinking about you.

18
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,338
You’re freaking cheesy.

19
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,759
So cringy.

20
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,772
Come here.

21
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:36,652
Ouch!

22
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:37,736
That hurts.

23
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:39,274
Sorry.

24
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:42,163
I know you did it on purpose.

25
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,209
Saint.

26
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:01,461
From now on, can you stay away from Jeng?

27
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,499
I don’t want to see you get hurt again.

28
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,628
You’re worried about me as if you were my boyfriend.

29
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,652
I’m serious.

30
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:24,055
If something went wrong today, you could have died.

31
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:27,224
But I’m okay.

32
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,283
I’m not going to die easily.

33
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,418
Don’t worry.

34
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,009
I’m strong and tough.

35
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,301
I know you’re strong.

36
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,070
But please stay away from troubles.

37
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,044
I’ll do that too.

38
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:47,268
I want us to be friends for a long time.

39
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:52,311
Can you promise me?

40
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:03,927
Yes.

41
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,366
I promise.

42
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:16,432
Shin.

43
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,424
I’m worried about Ken.

44
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,942
I don’t know what would happen to him.

45
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:23,464
Why?

46
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,032
Why are you worried about him?

47
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:28,012
He was trying to help me.

48
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:31,687
He told Jeng to stop beating me.

49
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,964
But he’s now a member of Dragon Fang.

50
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:36,747
It’s not easy to help him.

51
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,465
Wait.

52
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:56,831
Where are you going?

53
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,480
How dare you?

54
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,268
How dare you, little bastard?

55
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,683
How f*cking dare you?

56
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,124
Come here.

57
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,545
What?

58
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:08,462
He wants some more.

59
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:09,672
I’ll arrange it for you.

60
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:20,314
Get up, Ken.

61
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,074
How dare you disobey my order?

62
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:28,317
Who do you think you are?

63
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,422
How dare you tell me to stop beating him?

64
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Huh?

65
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,150
Did you feel bad for him?

66
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:43,439
Mark my words.

67
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,867
Your job is to follow my orders.

68
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,839
Bastard.

69
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:51,864
What?

70
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,129
What?

71
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,375
Did you get beaten?

72
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,243
Jackass, are you deaf?

73
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,465
I’m asking who beat you.

74
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,218
Nothing, Dad.

75
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:36,742
I practiced boxing.

76
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,084
Boxing practice?

77
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,049
Bull shit.

78
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,444
Do you think I’m stupid?

79
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:48,797
All you do is cause trouble.

80
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:53,462
Did you sell the bike your mom bought you?

81
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:55,699
I will never do that.

82
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:57,213
Then where the hell is it?

83
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,289
Huh?

84
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:05,750
Do you know that your mom lied to me to get the money to buy you the bike?

85
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,547
She hasn’t paid me back.

86
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,748
You are both trashy.

87
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,446
I’ll find the money to pay you back.

88
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:23,141
Where the hell will you get the money from?

89
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:24,856
Ken, can you really pay me back?

90
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:27,193
From your mom’s new husband?

91
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,110
Do you know I’m broke?

92
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,044
It’s useless to send you to school.

93
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:33,584
My hard work goes in vain.

94
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:36,584
I’m working hard to earn money to afford an idiot like you to go to school.

95
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:39,668
Dad.

96
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,310
I’m hurt. Please stop.

97
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,607
I send you to school but you skip class.

98
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,576
All you do is cause trouble for me.

99
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:47,346
You’re just like your mom.

100
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,649
You’re just like your mom.

101
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:50,173
Boxing practice?!

102
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:51,356
Boxing practice?!

103
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,327
Boxing practice?!

104
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:08,477
I’m sorry.

105
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:10,345
Boxing practice?!

106
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:11,916
Bull shit!

107
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,950
What f*cking boxing practice?!

108
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,772
This is the homework from the previous class.

109
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,991
Saint.

110
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,034
What happened to your face?

111
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,673
I had a bike accident.

112
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,292
I swerved my bike to avoid hitting a dog.

113
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:18,716
I fell and rolled for several feet.

114
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,339
I don’t believe you.

115
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,046
You had a fight, didn’t you?

116
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,262
It was nothing, Miss Jan.

117
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:27,868
Saint was stupid.

118
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,303
He swerved his bike to dodge a dog.

119
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,567
So he lost control of his bike.

120
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,148
Are you sure?

121
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:33,504
Yes.

122
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:34,809
Excuse me.

123
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,551
Wait.

124
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,244
Are you okay?

125
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,610
I think being a teacher isn’t the right fit for me.

126
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,876
Don’t look so discouraged.

127
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:17,972
You’ll scare the students.

128
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:27,954
I feel like I’m a terrible teacher.

129
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:31,104
I can’t help my students.

130
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,764
It seems like they don’t want my help.

131
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,249
I can’t do anything right.

132
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:47,150
I’ve never felt this useless before.

133
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:52,880
I understand how you feel.

134
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,747
Being a teacher is not easy.

135
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:02,621
It’s not weird if we feel discouraged,

136
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:04,784
disappointed,

137
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,311
or out of place sometimes.

138
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,403
But you know what?

139
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,148
Throughout my career as a teacher,

140
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,799
I’ve never seen any teachers

141
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,493
care about their students more than you do.

142
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:32,456
I know you still feel bad.

143
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,772
But I want to tell you this.

144
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:43,847
In my eyes, you’re perfect for being a teacher.

145
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,452
Let’s do our best to take care of our students.

146
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:58,895
Yes.

147
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,591
Mr. Sung.

148
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:08,948
I want to talk to you about Ken.

149
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:15,610
About him missing school for several days?

150
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,736
Yes.

151
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,207
I think he must have some problems.

152
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,864
Why don’t we visit him at his house?

153
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,947
We’ve never met his parents.

154
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,492
Let’s take this chance to visit him.

155
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:36,948
Yes.

156
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,696
I’ll get ready for my next class.

157
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,493
Give it to me. I’ll write it myself.

158
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:00,006
Your handwriting is terrible.

159
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,193
It’s cute. Trust me.

160
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,210
It’s ugly.

161
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,579
Give it to me.

162
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:06,594
No.

163
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:08,462
- No, it’s cute. - I’ll write it.

164
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,192
Class.

165
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,440
Hello.

166
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,920
Hello, class.

167
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:25,354
Miss Jan, I have a question.

168
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,129
Yes.

169
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,120
Cable never missed school.

170
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,650
Even when he was sick, he didn’t take a leave.

171
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,867
Do you know why he has been missing school?

172
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:42,911
Everyone, I have something to tell you.

173
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:46,247
Your friend, Cable,

174
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:48,942
has been missing

175
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,705
since the other night.

176
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:57,123
His family and the teachers are looking for him.

177
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,615
If you see him or he contacts you,

178
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:04,646
please inform me right away

179
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:13,052
Did he disappear because he was upset

180
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:17,156
that you replaced Eve with me on the team?

181
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,053
No, it’s not about that.

182
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:23,661
If it was true,

183
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,409
would you give your spot to Eve?

184
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,473
Alright, class.

185
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,172
Let’s start our class.

186
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,507
If I were you,

187
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,716
I would have given up my spot a long time ago.

188
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,990
I wouldn’t have the audacity to be on the team.

189
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,132
What about you?

190
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,350
Ken has joined Jeng’s gang.

191
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:02,474
This is not good.

192
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,391
It’s too dangerous.

193
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,449
I’m worried that he’ll go too far.

194
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,273
What do you want us to do?

195
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:12,942
We want to help him leave the gang.

196
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,378
We think you two can help us.

197
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,502
To be honest,

198
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,776
I want Saint to stay away from Jeng.

199
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,108
I understand.

200
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,551
If it wasn’t Saint,

201
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,550
who else could knock Jeng down?

202
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,350
There are other ways

203
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:48,513
to help Ken leave the gang without using force.

204
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,252
How, Shin?

205
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Ken.

206
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,990
Ken.

207
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:09,607
Ken, are you home?

208
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:14,154
Ken, open the door.

209
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,556
Ken, come out and talk to us.

210
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,111
Ken.

211
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:19,606
Ken.

212
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:22,000
Ken, do you hear me?

213
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:22,816
Ken.

214
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:24,096
Ken.

215
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,107
Ken.

216
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,484
Ken, open the door.

217
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:27,486
Ken.

218
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,553
Ken, come out.

219
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:31,953
What the hell are you doing here?

220
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,369
Ken, we need to talk.

221
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:45,821
You should leave. I’m going out.

222
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:50,047
Why are you avoiding us?

223
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:55,190
Your wounds, Jeng did it, right?

224
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,252
It’s none of your business.

225
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:05,072
He beat you up but you still want to go back to him?

226
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:07,250
Jeng never cared about you.

227
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,673
It’s none of your business.

228
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:11,536
Ken.

229
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,123
You don’t need to stay with an asshole like Jeng.

230
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:15,984
I know you’re not a bad person.

231
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:17,948
You helped me.

232
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,748
I didn’t help you.

233
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,218
If you didn’t help me,

234
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,575
why did you tell Jeng to stop?

235
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:32,637
Ken,

236
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,844
I think you should stop.

237
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:36,599
Stay away from Jeng.

238
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,156
We can be just the three of us.

239
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:41,735
About your debt,

240
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:43,924
we’ll help you get money to pay him back.

241
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,711
Nate, shut up.

242
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,492
You all should leave.

243
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:50,754
I’ll stay with Jeng.

244
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,677
Why do you need to be this stubborn?

245
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,507
You know what kind of bastard Jeng’s gang is.

246
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,650
Do you want to become a bastard like them?

247
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,252
So what?

248
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:05,113
I can never be a good person.

249
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,659
Then I’ll be a bad guy.

250
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:07,717
Who has a problem with it.?

251
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,930
I do.

252
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:13,162
I know you want to run away from your family.

253
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,113
But if you choose to be with him,

254
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:18,222
he beats you just like your dad does.

255
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:19,804
Asshole.

256
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,865
Ken,

257
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,147
why did you hit him?

258
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:24,613
He’s worried about you.

259
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,009
Take your worry back.

260
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:27,996
Asshole.

261
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:29,019
Stop it.

262
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,674
I won’t let it slide this time.

263
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:31,883
Asshole.

264
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:33,592
- I’ve stopped you many times. - Let me go.

265
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,575
Asshole.

266
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:36,191
Bastard.

267
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:37,273
Bring it on.

268
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:39,655
- Stop it. - Jackass.

269
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:40,970
Stop it.

270
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,252
- That’s enough, asshole. - Stop it.

271
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,988
Asshole.

272
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:44,999
I said stop it.

273
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:45,600
Stop it.

274
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:46,698
- I said stop it. - Asshole.

275
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,809
Let me go.

276
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:54,444
Get the hell away from me.

277
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:55,979
Stop it.

278
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That’s enough. Stop it.

279
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,219
Stop it.

280
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,255
- Ken. - Stop it.

281
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:07,308
Stop fighting.

282
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,206
Stop it.

283
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:09,329
I said stop it.

284
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,246
Stop it.

285
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:36,450
Call an ambulance.

286
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:37,105
Wake up.

287
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,104
Call an ambulance.

288
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:38,882
Hurry up.

289
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:39,933
Call an ambulance.

290
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:40,865
Now.

291
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:41,459
Ken.

292
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:42,391
Hurry up.

293
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,970
Wake up, Can you hear me?

294
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:44,927
Ken.

295
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:45,744
Ken, do you hear me?

296
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,282
Ken.

297
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,542
Wake up.

298
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:48,757
- Ken, easy. - Wake up.

299
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,541
Ken, do you hear me?

300
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,036
Ken is safe.

301
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:47,847
It’s not your fault.

302
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,559
It was an accident.

303
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:35,316
How is Ken doing?

304
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,362
He’s okay.

305
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,166
His condition is not serious.

306
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,856
The doctor discharged him after stitching his wound.

307
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:44,752
He got four stitches.

308
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,493
Not a big deal.

309
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:47,953
It’s not serious.

310
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,493
Do you think he will come back to school?

311
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:53,455
It’s hard to tell.

312
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:55,760
Ken is very stubborn.

313
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:00,959
Can I ask you something?

314
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,345
How did Ken owe money to Jeng?

315
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,233
Can you tell us?

316
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,662
Why did you call us to see you?

317
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,009
It’s about the Thai language quiz contest team.

318
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:36,911
I’ve talked to other teachers.

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
We’ll send you two to represent our school.

320
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,850
Is it because Cable disappeared?

321
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,750
That’s why I was chosen to replace him.

322
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,061
Someone might feel happy to be on the team.

323
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,745
But I’m not.

324
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
Eve.

325
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:12,628
Eve.

326
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:18,652
Eve, wait.

327
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:20,804
Eve.

328
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:27,788
I don’t want to talk to you.

329
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,757
Can you hear me out?

330
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:30,917
I don’t want to.

331
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:33,702
About the school’s representative,

332
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,852
I’m really sorry.

333
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,162
My mom forced the school to replace you with me.

334
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:39,582
So what?

335
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,616
I didn’t mean to steal your spot.

336
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,391
I didn’t want things to turn out this way.

337
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,148
Why don’t you drop out of the team?

338
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:49,960
Then I’ll believe that you didn’t want my spot.

339
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:52,384
I can’t do that.

340
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:53,526
Why not?

341
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:55,962
My mom will never let me do it.

342
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,021
This contest is important to me.

343
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,167
Is it more important than me?

344
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:07,381
Eve, I know you’re mad at me but…

345
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,825
Peeta, you don’t know anything.

346
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,283
You don’t understand what’s happening.

347
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:20,199
You don’t even know why I’m mad at you.

348
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:31,655
Eve, are you okay?

349
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,567
Let’s go. I don’t want to be here.

350
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,422
Shin.

351
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,745
What are you worried about?

352
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:24,477
Nothing.

353
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,705
Lying is a sin. You’ll go to hell.

354
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:36,447
Okay.

355
00:25:37,012 --> 00:25:38,012
I’ll tell you.

356
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,736
I’m worried about Ken.

357
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:46,747
Why?

358
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,818
Is Ken picking up a fight with you and Saint again?

359
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:57,658
No, he’s not.

360
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,606
He’s getting himself into trouble.

361
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,148
What do you mean? I don’t get it.

362
00:26:14,744 --> 00:26:18,224
All this time, Ken owed Jeng money.

363
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:22,013
So Jeng forced him to attack Shin and me.

364
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,227
His family has many problems.

365
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:32,004
His dad is an alcoholic and a gambling addict.

366
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,602
He often assaults Ken.

367
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,413
His mom moved to another town to start a new family.

368
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:40,674
Ken has no choice

369
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:43,428
but to obey Jeng’s order.

370
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,122
Come to think about it.

371
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:51,407
I feel bad for him.

372
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:57,073
I get why you feel bad for him.

373
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,442
But are you going to forgive him easily?

374
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,458
Right.

375
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,322
He’s done many terrible things to us.

376
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:08,824
I get that he’s not a good guy.

377
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,065
But I think, deep down,

378
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:14,760
he’s not a bad person.

379
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:16,714
Right.

380
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:18,895
He still has a chance to transform himself.

381
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,696
I want to help him.

382
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,430
I don’t want to see him choose the wrong path.

383
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,122
I don’t want him to become a bastard like Jeng.

384
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,720
I agree with you.

385
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,350
We should help him.

386
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,256
Because he’s our classmate.

387
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:50,827
It’s our job.

388
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:56,615
Friends should help friends.

389
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,199
You’re right.

390
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:02,693
I’ll help you.

391
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:07,036
Fine.

392
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:09,849
If there’s anything we can help, just let us know.

393
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,122
There’s another thing I’m worried about.

394
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:18,993
What is it?

395
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,162
About Cable.

396
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:22,726
It’s been several days.

397
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:24,474
We don’t know where he is.

398
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,039
We can’t contact him.

399
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,967
I don’t know how he’s doing.

400
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:41,407
Next time, you can’t beat me.

401
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:42,719
You’re such a braggard.

402
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,918
Don’t ask me to compete with you again.

403
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:46,360
It was a close defeat.

404
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:48,147
We got to go.

405
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:49,117
See you.

406
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:49,950
See you.

407
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:50,993
- See you. - See you.

408
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,936
Shin, do you want me to give you a ride home?

409
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,551
It’s okay. I can go home by myself.

410
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:57,843
You should go to work.

411
00:28:58,446 --> 00:28:59,058
Is that what you want?

412
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,616
Yes.

413
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,233
Okay.

414
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:00,956
See you.

415
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,050
See you.

416
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:03,363
Saint.

417
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:09,760
Shin and Saint, do you want to go to my house?

418
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,807
I can go but Saint is busy.

419
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:18,559
Yeah. Sorry, Chadjen.

420
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,631
I have to work as a food delivery man.

421
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,056
How about this?

422
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,320
I’ll hire you.

423
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:32,610
I’ll hire you to give me a ride home.

424
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,462
What?

425
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:42,624
Here.

426
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:46,560
Chadjen, it’s too much.

427
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:48,107
It’s okay.

428
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:53,924
Shin and Saint.

429
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,548
Please come to my house.

430
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,730
Chadjen.

431
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:05,113
Why do you want us to go there?

432
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:14,935
I…

433
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:19,710
I just want you two to hang out at my house.

434
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:23,412
If you don’t tell us the real reason,

435
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:24,982
I won’t go.

436
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:32,342
If you can’t tell us, you just nod.

437
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:33,582
Okay?

438
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,661
Is it about our classmate?

439
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,213
Did he ask you not to tell anyone

440
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:45,938
that he’s at your house?

441
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,313
What are you talking about?

442
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,314
I haven’t seen the twins lately.

443
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,130
Did they abandon you?

444
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,079
When your friends are not around,

445
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:58,455
you must feel lonely.

446
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:05,262
I understand how you feel.

447
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:09,650
I’m okay if you’re going to leave me.

448
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,207
But you need to pay your debt first.

449
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,566
But…

450
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:29,348
you said if I could make Shin cry,

451
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:33,350
You would forgive my debt.

452
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,572
But you failed.

453
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,061
You also disobeyed my order.

454
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:42,756
I was the one who made him cry.

455
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:44,496
Me.

456
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:50,708
I think of you as my brother.

457
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,246
I’ll give you another chance.

458
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:58,954
I have one last job for you.

459
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,960
If you finish it, your debt will be gone.

460
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:08,141
What is it?

461
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:11,855
You’ll deliver a big lot of drugs for me.

462
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:16,597
Why?

463
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:18,487
You don’t want to do it?

464
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:23,357
It’s not that.

465
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:25,973
Good.

466
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:29,644
I’ll tell you later where to deliver it.

467
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,228
Yes.

468
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:02,252
Wow.

469
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:03,794
Chadjen’s house is awesome.

470
00:34:11,364 --> 00:34:12,563
Hello, Mr. Butler.

471
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,056
You’re home.

472
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:15,607
Yes.

473
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,896
Are my parents home yet?

474
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,957
They went out to run some errands.

475
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,957
They will come home late tonight.

476
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:26,618
Mr. Chadjen, let me carry your bag for you.

477
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:28,453
It’s okay.

478
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,950
I want to carry it myself.

479
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:45,159
Saint, what’s wrong?

480
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,357
Are your jaws locked?

481
00:34:46,904 --> 00:34:48,461
Who are you, Chadjen?

482
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:54,261
I am me.

483
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,319
I mean why did you choose to attend school at Siamwit?

484
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:00,247
Why didn’t you go to a better and nicer school?

485
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:03,308
Our school is fine.

486
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:05,570
My dad said

487
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,664
he wanted me to learn to stand up for myself.

488
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:11,452
So he sent me to Siamwit.

489
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,563
He wanted me to grow up.

490
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,221
You’ve grown up so much that you can take care of Cable.

491
00:35:18,939 --> 00:35:21,609
You let him stay at your house without telling us.

492
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:24,562
Cable…

493
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:26,564
No.

494
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,893
That friend asked me not to tell anyone.

495
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,004
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

496
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:33,907
I feel very bad for him.

497
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:39,194
Okay.

498
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:42,046
Let’s go meet that friend.

499
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:46,948
Follow me.

500
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:55,356
Shin.

501
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:56,553
Saint.

502
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,277
You’ve disappeared for many days.

503
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,597
So you came to hang out at Chadjen’s house.

504
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,622
When are you going to go back to school?

505
00:36:04,942 --> 00:36:06,140
When you didn’t come to school,

506
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,708
I had no one to copy the homework.

507
00:36:14,953 --> 00:36:15,953
I…

508
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:18,216
I don’t want to go back yet.

509
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:25,519
You made the right decision to stay at Chadjen’s house.

510
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,363
Knowing that you are safe, that’s good enough for me.

511
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:31,948
But…

512
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:33,456
I…

513
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,858
We won’t tell the teachers that you’re here.

514
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:41,215
Cable.

515
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:48,658
I’m sorry for taking Shin and Saint here.

516
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:51,578
I want you to meet our friends.

517
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:55,807
It may help you feel better.

518
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:57,628
And…

519
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:01,584
What I’m going to say?

520
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,522
I didn’t bring them to pressure you to go home.

521
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:13,044
You can stay here as long as you want.

522
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:16,108
You can go home when you want to.

523
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:22,049
Thank you so much, Chadjen.

524
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:24,802
You’re so nice to me.

525
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,381
It’s okay.

526
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,612
Friends should help friends.

527
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,159
I’m happy to do it.

528
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:42,203
Cable.

529
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:46,110
If you have any problems, you can tell us.

530
00:37:57,222 --> 00:38:01,422
(I’m sorry. The number you’ve dialed cannot be reached at the moment.)

531
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,954
Cable, honey.

532
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:11,959
(The number you’ve dialed cannot be reached at the moment.)

533
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:19,422
Where are you, honey?

534
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,467
Principal.

535
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Thank you.

536
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,548
I can’t find Cable.

537
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:16,693
I don’t know where he is.

538
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,277
I don’t know how he’s doing.

539
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,745
I believe that he’s doing fine.

540
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:30,716
He’s a smart kid.

541
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:34,751
I’m sure he’s safe.

542
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,667
I didn’t mean it to turn out this way.

543
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:49,427
I just wanted him to have a bright future.

544
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:12,673
Principal.

545
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,791
I know your intention was good.

546
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,268
But as adults,

547
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:29,656
we should let kids choose their own path.

548
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,381
Sometimes,

549
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:40,350
our good intentions can unintentionally harm them.

550
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,351
What if he chooses the wrong path?

551
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,548
What if the path he chooses is not going well?

552
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,822
As parents,

553
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:08,705
all you can do is to be there for him

554
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:12,061
and watch him from behind.

555
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:27,447
At one point, I believe he will come back.

556
00:42:06,495 --> 00:42:07,495
Cable.

557
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,818
Are you really not going to sleep on the bed?

558
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,950
There’s plenty of space.

559
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:20,550
It’s okay, Chadjen.

560
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:22,212
Thanks.

561
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:32,150
Don’t you miss your mom?

562
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:47,070
I get it. You had a fight with her.

563
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:50,621
After running away from home,

564
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:53,507
have you ever missed her?

565
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:59,089
If I were you, I would miss her since the first day.

566
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:08,345
If your mom controlled every aspect of life,

567
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,858
you might feel differently.

568
00:43:17,671 --> 00:43:23,204
My parents are controlling and strict with me.

569
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:28,413
I don’t like that either.

570
00:43:30,323 --> 00:43:34,547
That’s why I need to prove myself to them.

571
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:38,828
Prove yourself?

572
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,133
About what?

573
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:52,316
I need to prove that my choice is right.

574
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:01,012
I think you should try to prove it to your mom.

575
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:12,553
I know you feel bad for running away from home.

576
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:19,304
I think the principal is also sad.

577
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:27,975
You both feel bad.

578
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:32,258
I don’t see who is happy about this.

579
00:44:47,388 --> 00:44:47,951
Saint.

580
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:50,707
When you go into the alley where my house is, you can pull over.

581
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:52,788
Why?

582
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,440
I can give you a ride to your house.

583
00:44:54,464 --> 00:44:55,464
No.

584
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:56,781
Just pull over where I told you.

585
00:45:16,732 --> 00:45:17,732
Shin.

586
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,384
Are we dating or being friends?

587
00:45:21,341 --> 00:45:22,796
Why do we need to sneak around?

588
00:45:24,176 --> 00:45:26,047
Didn’t we agree?

589
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:28,295
I told you it would take time

590
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,510
for my mom to accept you.

591
00:45:33,194 --> 00:45:35,550
That’s why I understand how Cable feels.

592
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:39,148
I know how it feels to be overly controlled.

593
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,110
I know my mom means well.

594
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:44,609
But sometimes, I feel suffocated.

595
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,487
I think Cable feels the same way.

596
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,542
But running away from home doesn’t solve the problem.

597
00:45:55,512 --> 00:45:57,188
It makes things worse. Don’t you think?

598
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,505
What?

599
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,122
Why did you hit me?

600
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,563
When it’s someone else’s problem, you act like you know it all.

601
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:05,947
But when it was your problem, you also ran away, didn’t you?

602
00:46:11,074 --> 00:46:13,483
Yes. I pretend to know it all.

603
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,507
When it’s about you, I’m acting like an idiot.

604
00:46:18,044 --> 00:46:19,847
I still can’t find a way

605
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:22,267
to make your mom forgive me.

606
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:28,698
It’s okay.

607
00:46:29,624 --> 00:46:32,033
One day, we will find a way for her to accept us.

608
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:36,449
But until that day comes,

609
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,553
we need to hide our friendship.

610
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,756
If she sees you, you will go all out.

611
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,247
What will she do?

612
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:51,342
This.

613
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,308
Come here, the puppy face.

614
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:54,975
I’m leaving.

615
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,470
Cable is not coming with us.

616
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:25,858
It’s alright.

617
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,348
We did our best.

618
00:47:30,686 --> 00:47:31,686
Let’s go to school.

619
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:33,311
Let’s ride the bike together.

620
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:36,963
Before we go to school,

621
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:40,111
can we go eat Saint’s dad's noodles?

622
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:42,572
Your family prepared breakfast for you.

623
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:43,905
Why didn’t you eat it?

624
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:46,655
I want to eat Pok Pok noodles.

625
00:47:47,919 --> 00:47:48,919
Sure.

626
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,320
I’ll ask my dad to cook for us.

627
00:47:51,098 --> 00:47:52,098
Do you want a helmet?

628
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
Yes.

629
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:07,055
Hello.

630
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,490
Principal, what are you doing here?

631
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:13,255
Cable called me.

632
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:15,512
He said he’s at Chadjen’s house.

633
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,551
Where is Cable?

634
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,393
I’m sorry for running away.

635
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:58,455
It’s okay, honey.

636
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:00,591
I’m happy that you called me.

637
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:04,096
I’m sorry.

638
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,870
Mom.

639
00:49:39,253 --> 00:49:40,253
I’m hungry.

640
00:49:43,305 --> 00:49:44,305
Sure.

641
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:46,058
I’ll buy you something to eat.

642
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:48,562
I took a day off today.

643
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,093
So I can spend time with you. Isn’t it good?

644
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:52,862
You don’t need to go to school.

645
00:49:55,615 --> 00:49:56,615
It’s okay, Mom.

646
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:58,242
I want to go to school.

647
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:03,890
What do you want to eat?

648
00:50:11,247 --> 00:50:13,148
I want to eat Pok Pok noodles with my friends.

649
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:32,856
Sure.

650
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,865
Then we all go together.

651
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:50,367
Let’s go.

652
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,390
Yes.

653
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:52,847
Leave your bike here.

654
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,227
Don’t be confused. Let’s go.

655
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,529
Here is your dry noodle, Principal.

656
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,409
Thank you.

657
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:29,856
Be careful. The soup is hot.

658
00:51:41,522 --> 00:51:43,750
Why don’t you add chili flakes and sugar?

659
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,160
I already did.

660
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,243
I finished the first bowl.

661
00:51:48,822 --> 00:51:49,822
Are you kidding me?

662
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:51,959
I’m confused.

663
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:56,056
When I see them enjoy their meal,

664
00:51:57,421 --> 00:51:59,507
it really makes me happy.

665
00:52:04,264 --> 00:52:05,264
May I?

666
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:11,317
It’s hard to believe

667
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:21,042
that parents like us are happy just by watching our kids eat well, smile, and laugh, right?

668
00:52:31,766 --> 00:52:33,046
Opps, Saint.

669
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:34,649
Can you get me new chopsticks?

670
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:35,767
This is not right.

671
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:37,677
You did it to annoy me, didn’t you?

672
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:39,145
Sorry.

673
00:52:49,089 --> 00:52:50,089
That’s right.

674
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,170
That should have been enough.

675
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:02,138
Enjoy your meal.

676
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,619
Guys, if you want more meat or anything, just tell me.

677
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:11,661
Here are char siu pork and meatballs.

678
00:53:11,948 --> 00:53:12,948
Yes.

679
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:15,416
I’ll give you more for free.

680
00:53:15,948 --> 00:53:16,948
Thank you.

681
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:18,004
It’s enough for me.

682
00:53:18,204 --> 00:53:19,261
Take it.

683
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,030
Tell me if you want anything else.

684
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:48,905
Can you help me eat it?

685
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:51,963
I’m full.

686
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:54,659
You don’t eat this often, do you?

687
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:56,967
Eat more.

688
00:53:57,246 --> 00:53:58,646
Why does your bowl still look full?

689
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:00,655
Cable, my dad will be sad.

690
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:02,658
Eat a lot.

691
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:04,944
Chadjen finished his bowl.

692
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,230
Great.

693
00:54:23,322 --> 00:54:24,709
You missed school for several days.

694
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:26,163
We were worried about you.

695
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:28,951
I’m sorry for causing trouble.

696
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,833
It’s okay.

697
00:54:30,956 --> 00:54:32,864
It’s good to see you back and safe.

698
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:38,262
Chadjen, when did you become close to Cable?

699
00:54:39,326 --> 00:54:40,326
That’s right.

700
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:42,296
You let him stay at your house for several days.

701
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,019
I’m close to all of you.

702
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:51,261
Why don’t you cometo hang out at my house this weekend?

703
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:53,945
Can we go?

704
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,376
Of course.

705
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,298
You all are invited.

706
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:10,218
I won’t go.

707
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:11,282
Me too.

708
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:14,382
Why?

709
00:55:15,163 --> 00:55:17,653
Tew and First, you like to hang out at my house, don’t you?

710
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:19,764
Yes.

711
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:22,044
But not anymore.

712
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:25,351
We’ve been close friends for a long time.

713
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:27,751
But you’ve never asked us to sleep over at your house.

714
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:29,416
But Cable did it before us.

715
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:37,788
You’re so petty.

716
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:39,145
You’re pettier than a girl.

717
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:40,661
We’re not being petty.

718
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:41,899
We are just…

719
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:43,467
sensitive.

720
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:44,781
Right.

721
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:46,139
Sensitive?

722
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:47,449
I’ll hit you

723
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,230
to see if you’re as sensitive as you said.

724
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:53,773
Sensitive? I’ll teach you a lesson.

725
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,790
You too?

726
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:56,403
You’re not a kid anymore.

727
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:57,696
Why are you mad at Chadjen for this?

728
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,058
Okay, I’ll stop.

729
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,849
We are not mad anymore.

730
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,071
Chadjen, we’re sorry.

731
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:04,071
We are kidding.

732
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:05,287
Try harder.

733
00:56:05,402 --> 00:56:07,756
Chadjen is still not smiling.

734
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:14,618
We will go to Chadjen’s house.

735
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,210
What can we play at your house?

736
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:18,985
What do you want to play, Eve?

737
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,009
I have everything.

738
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:22,145
Cable, what did you play at his house?

739
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:26,064
There’s an iguana in his house.

740
00:56:27,578 --> 00:56:29,256
Yes, we have an iguana.

741
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,204
Is it fun to play with an iguana?

742
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:35,018
Yes. You can feed it.

743
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:37,847
See, Miss Jan?

744
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:41,563
Sometimes, a problem can be resolved. We don’t need to do anything.

745
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:46,453
It may take some time but things will be better.

746
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:50,505
Yes, Mr. Sung.

747
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:00,646
Can I film a content?

748
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,083
Sure.

749
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:04,360
You can film your content.

750
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:05,764
But I’m going to swim.

751
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,655
Chadjen’s house have a swimming pool?

752
00:57:07,797 --> 00:57:09,362
Yes.

753
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,077
How big is it?

754
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:12,609
It’s not that big.

755
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:15,428
It’s a regular size like everyone has.

756
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:16,594
Not everyone has it.

757
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:18,837
I don’t have it.

758
00:57:21,006 --> 00:57:22,548
Eve, why don’t you have a pool?

759
00:57:24,052 --> 00:57:25,927
No one here has a pool at home.

760
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:26,944
Are you bullying us?

761
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,430
What are you doing here?

762
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:15,259
How is your wound?

763
00:58:16,976 --> 00:58:17,976
I’m fine.

764
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:19,468
It was an accident.

765
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:21,674
It was my fault.

766
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:26,452
I’m sorry for hurting you.

767
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:29,058
I said I’m okay.

768
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:31,501
Ken.

769
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:34,524
Please come back to school.

770
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
No.

771
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:41,212
I won’t go to school anymore.

772
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:43,347
I get it. You don’t want to go to school.

773
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:47,353
But at least, you should finish high school.

774
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:50,618
It’s important to your future.

775
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:54,431
I don’t get money from going to school.

776
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:57,710
The most important thing for me right now is to make money.

777
00:58:58,207 --> 00:59:00,913
You can go to school and work at the same time.

778
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:03,216
You don’t need to quit school.

779
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,187
Even if I explained to you, you wouldn’t understand.

780
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,413
You go teach your students.

781
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:10,362
I’m not your student anymore.

782
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,954
My dad is not serious about it.

783
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:16,698
Why would you care?

784
00:59:32,332 --> 00:59:33,332
You should leave.

785
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:35,369
Don’t come here again.

786
00:59:36,192 --> 00:59:37,013
Leave me alone.

787
00:59:37,102 --> 00:59:37,714
Do you hear me?

788
00:59:38,101 --> 00:59:41,442
Ken, if you have a problem, you can tell me.

789
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:42,581
I don’t have any problem.

790
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:43,933
Don’t you listen to what I said?

791
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,527
Leave.

792
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:46,997
Don’t come here again.

793
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,166
Come here, bastard.

794
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:22,474
What are you doing?

795
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:25,984
You’re sly.

796
01:00:27,514 --> 01:00:29,544
How much did you sell?

797
01:00:29,908 --> 01:00:32,359
What did you say to her?

798
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,409
Did you tell her about Jeng, punk?

799
01:00:35,978 --> 01:00:36,978
Why would I tell her?

800
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:40,948
About the money, I’ll talk to Jeng.

801
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,350
You can leave.

802
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:44,810
If you secretly take the money.

803
01:00:46,492 --> 01:00:47,492
I got it.

804
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:50,912
Why the hell did you need to come here?

805
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:01,775
Why are you resigning, Miss Jan?

806
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:07,587
I don’t think I’m suitable

807
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,683
to be a homeroom teacher of Class 2.

808
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:21,551
Miss Jan, I chose you because you are talented.

809
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,013
You are a good teacher

810
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:27,622
and perfect for Class 2.

811
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:34,813
I think I picked the right person.

812
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:39,559
I’m sorry, Principal.

813
01:01:44,382 --> 01:01:50,354
I want you to reconsider and think it through.

814
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:56,105
I made up my mind.

815
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,852
I believe Mr. Sung can take good care of Class 2.

816
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:07,916
What?

817
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:09,304
Shin.

818
01:02:09,677 --> 01:02:11,157
What do you want to eat after school?

819
01:02:11,756 --> 01:02:12,756
I don’t know.

820
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,019
Chadjen, what do you want to eat?

821
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:16,840
Everyone.

822
01:02:17,135 --> 01:02:18,412
I have hot news.

823
01:02:18,523 --> 01:02:19,883
Miss Jan is resigning from school.

824
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:22,175
What?

825
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:23,144
Are you sure, Ging?

826
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,341
Didn’t you mishear it?

827
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:26,250
No, Mr. Class President.

828
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,790
She already submitted her resignation letter to the principal.

829
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,455
Why did she do that?

830
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:36,622
She’s an amazing teacher.

831
01:02:37,222 --> 01:02:40,147
Amazing? Chadjen, she played favorites.

832
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:41,284
She’s unfair.

833
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,421
She helps only her favorite student.

834
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:50,455
Airy, stop talking about it.

835
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:51,670
It was over.

836
01:02:54,764 --> 01:02:56,465
Who will teach this class?

837
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,212
Anyone is better than her.

838
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:01,142
Maybe this class will be canceled.

839
01:03:02,456 --> 01:03:03,456
That will be great.

840
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:05,312
Go back to your seat.

841
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:11,916
From now on,

842
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:14,753
I’ll take over Miss Jan’s Thai language class.

843
01:03:15,862 --> 01:03:17,350
She suddenly resigned from school.

844
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:22,603
She’s acting just like her students.

845
01:03:23,461 --> 01:03:24,760
Always causing trouble.

846
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,511
You need to pay attention in class

847
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,572
and get good grades

848
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:31,421
Take out your book.

849
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:37,209
What did Miss Jan cover in the last class?

850
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:38,859
Can anyone tell me?

851
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,661
If you can’t answer, I’ll reteach the whole book.

852
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,450
Ken.

853
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:57,312
Why didn’t you answer my call?

854
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,302
I don’t want to talk to you.

855
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:02,520
You’re so annoying.

856
01:04:02,622 --> 01:04:03,979
We’re worried about you.

857
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,855
Don’t come to see me again.

858
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:09,751
You are no longer my friends.

859
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:11,246
What the hell are you talking about?

860
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:13,972
Are you deaf?

861
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,022
I said you are no longer my friends.

862
01:04:20,095 --> 01:04:21,095
Ken, you bastard.

863
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:22,853
Don’t you remember?

864
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,270
What did we promise each other?

865
01:04:25,997 --> 01:04:26,997
I don’t remember.

866
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:29,474
We promised to be friends forever, asshole!

867
01:04:32,462 --> 01:04:35,313
You told us if we hated something,

868
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:37,042
you would hate it too.

869
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:40,618
If we loved something, you would love it as well.

870
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:44,316
Where?

871
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:46,164
Where is the promise you gave us?

872
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:49,007
Damn it.

873
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,690
It means nothing to you, right? Bastard.

874
01:04:53,493 --> 01:04:54,493
Yes.

875
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:00,249
Ken.

876
01:05:00,587 --> 01:05:01,344
Leave me alone.

877
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:02,455
Shin.

878
01:05:04,162 --> 01:05:06,064
Stay away from me, you two bastards.

879
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:10,733
If you don’t want to die,

880
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:13,007
stay away from me.

881
01:05:19,936 --> 01:05:21,856
You’re doing this to protect us, aren’t you?

882
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:27,162
You are not alone.

883
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,757
You have us.

884
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,606
We all want to help you, Ken.

885
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:04,028
Ken.

886
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:38,492
What the hell is wrong with you?

887
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:39,631
Why are you looking so nervous?

888
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:41,735
You’re acting like you never slept over at my house.

889
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,003
How will we party tonight?

890
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:48,019
Stop it.

891
01:06:49,284 --> 01:06:49,861
Shin.

892
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,650
How did you get these two here?

893
01:06:51,673 --> 01:06:53,256
I want Miss Jan to come back.

894
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,753
I want her to help Ken.

895
01:06:55,847 --> 01:06:57,207
You need to sell this drug for me.

896
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:58,569
I don’t care who you sell it to.

897
01:06:58,593 --> 01:06:59,833
But you need to sell all of it.

898
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:01,256
Peeta, what are you eating?

899
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,590
Nothing.

900
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:05,141
Ken.

901
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:06,502
No one can help me.

902
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:08,199
I have to end this problem by myself.
