5
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:20,210
Oh, this color suits you well, Peeta.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,211
Why did you color my locker?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,684
How did you let this kind of incident happened again?

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,515
Where did you get the exam leak?

9
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:27,952
Who stole the exam paper?

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,878
Thep Burapha kids in Class 3?

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,831
They forced me to steal the exam paper.

12
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,404
We should beat them up.

13
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,590
How does that have anything to do with you?

14
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:37,694
Then hit me. So it’ll become my business.

15
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,171
Are you sure?

16
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:52,906
Are you sure…

17
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,306
that you want to challenge us?

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,010
Go ahead.

19
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:58,355
I’m not afraid of you guys.

20
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:03,202
Guys, get them.

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,010
Shin.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,940
Saint.

23
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,038
Don’t butt in.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,751
No, I cannot do that.

25
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:14,734
Let go of me.

26
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,791
I won’t.

27
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,229
What’s wrong with you?

28
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,625
I got it that you want to protect your friend.

29
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:23,115
But I’m begging you.

30
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:25,908
I cannot lose you again.

31
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:35,272
Saint, let go of my friend.

32
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:36,942
Don’t hurt him.

33
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,254
Why do you defend him?

34
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,503
We don’t know what to do if you’re like this.

35
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:47,016
Don’t fight with those Class 3 people.

36
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:49,681
And why are you butting in this?

37
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:51,712
Yeah. It’s the matter between Udon Pithak.

38
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:52,602
Don’t butt in.

39
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:53,911
But I’m your class president.

40
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,202
Most importantly,

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,004
I don’t want Shin to fight again.

42
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:01,669
I don’t want him to be expelled.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,355
Shin, please. Believe me.

44
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,245
I’m begging you.

45
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,106
(Sigh.)

46
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,115
Hey, Class 2 pricks.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,440
What exactly do you all want to do?

48
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,225
If you’re scared, just say so.

49
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,539
Shut up, you prick.

50
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,111
So, this is the boss of Udon Pithak?

51
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,441
Such a chicken.

52
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,484
Buk-kaaawk. Buk-kaaawk.

53
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,386
He’s chicken.

54
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,454
Buk-kaaawk. Buk-kaaawk.

55
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:33,305
Shin, don’t.

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,423
Hey, I told you not to butt in.

57
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,637
Don’t fight, guys.

58
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,715
I don’t want you to get in trouble because of me.

59
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,097
Right, I think so.

60
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,869
If you fight, teachers will punish you.

61
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:47,247
I’m so annoyed by these chickens.

62
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,620
They just don’t stop squawking.

63
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:53,520
Shin, are you really going to let them insult us like this?

64
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,702
They hurt our friend.

65
00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:59,481
But I’m also your friend.

66
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,077
Can you do this for me?

67
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:11,570
What’s wrong with them?

68
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,354
Forget it. Get them.

69
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:16,693
Stop.

70
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:19,810
Damn. It’s Pokpong.

71
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,241
Hey.

72
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:25,343
I only want to talk to Pakorn.

73
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,728
Who’d be stupid enough to stay?

74
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,023
Ouch.

75
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:31,739
Ouch, damn it.

76
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:33,047
Ouch, let me go.

77
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:33,925
Let me go.

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
- Come here. - Let me go.

79
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:40,028
Let me go.

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Let go.

81
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,450
FOR HIS SAKE.

82
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,965
I’ve heard that you’ve bullied Pornpimol since the semester started.

83
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:03,868
Did you do that?

84
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,764
Anyone can make accusations like this, right?

85
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,962
Do you have any evidence?

86
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:12,641
Pakorn,

87
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,408
how can you talk to your teachers like this?

88
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:16,617
Huh?

89
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:17,882
Because I’m innocent.

90
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,970
So, I’m asking for your fairness.

91
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:21,235
Right, Prang?

92
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:24,229
Accusations like this need to be backed up with evidence.

93
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,037
Pakorn,

94
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:29,671
no matter what, you still insist that you're not wrong, right?

95
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,115
Yes. I am not guilty.

96
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,570
You guys have something to tell us, right?

97
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:57,794
Yes.

98
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,801
We have evidence that Pipe bullied Prang.

99
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,921
What proof?

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,299
Don't speak nonsense, okay?

101
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:06,047
Whether we're lying or not, you decide for yourself.

102
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,117
Bell, show the clip to teachers.

103
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,379
(Did you tell the teacher?)

104
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:24,213
(I’m sorry. I was wrong.)

105
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:26,256
Damn it.

106
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,946
(Please delete the photos. I’m begging you.)

107
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,602
(I have both the photos and clips.)

108
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,367
With this clear evidence,

109
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,475
are you still denying that you didn't do it?

110
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,312
I’ll report this to your parents.

111
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,108
Based on your past behavior,

112
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,273
you will have to be suspended from school.

113
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,071
Hey, teacher.

114
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,977
If you still don't acknowledge the wrongdoing,

115
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,910
the punishment will be severe, up to dismissal.

116
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:49,934
The heck.

117
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,740
Go outside with me.

118
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:53,365
Come here.

119
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Go.

120
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,029
Come here.

121
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:08,616
I'm sorry for not taking care of you well enough.

122
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:23,934
They’ll be here soon.

123
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,669
Why did you call us here?

124
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,008
We have something to clear up with you.

125
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,472
Peeta,

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,800
regarding the incident where someone splashed paint on your locker,

127
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:58,514
actually,

128
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,308
Airy and Tangmay weren't the ones who did it.

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,503
I am the one who did it.

130
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,004
Why did you do it?

131
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,499
We don't even know each other.

132
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,588
I’m sorry. At that time, I had no choice.

133
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,068
Pipe forced me to do it.

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,724
I’m sorry.

135
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,722
She was blackmailed by that bastard Pipe.

136
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:24,271
Prang has no grudge against you at all.

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,976
She’s also a victim like you.

138
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,863
If what you’re saying is true,

139
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,152
I can understand the reasoning behind it

140
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,776
and I feel sorry that you had to go through that.

141
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,317
But have you thought about the fact that what you did caused trouble for me

142
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,029
and that it was wrong?

143
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,488
I was wrong.

144
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:49,949
I’m truly sorry.

145
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,797
Then how will you take responsibility for my book that got ruined?

146
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,016
Hey, Prang already apologized.

147
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,518
She didn’t mean it.

148
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,737
If she didn’t mean it,

149
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,085
then she shouldn’t have done it in the first place.

150
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:00,620
Hey,

151
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,414
don't you have any sympathy for her?

152
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,844
Having sympathy is one thing,

153
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,594
but I also have the right to be angry, right?

154
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,848
I'm the one who's been wronged.

155
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,602
Aren't you being too selfish?

156
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:09,482
So what?

157
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,004
I have the right to be selfish, don't I?

158
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,211
Act more reasonably, will you?

159
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:13,134
I'm already doing that.

160
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,097
What the hell is wrong with you?

161
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,920
Peeta, calm down.

162
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:17,994
(Sigh.)

163
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
What do you want?

164
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:39,488
Uh…

165
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,909
Back then when I blamed you two,

166
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I was wrong.

167
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,550
I’m sorry.

168
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,911
Where are you going?

169
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:19,672
Huh?

170
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:20,995
Let me go.

171
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:21,814
Let me go.

172
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,525
Do you think you can get away from me?

173
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,826
You guys again?

174
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,200
I know you're gonna do it.

175
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,320
Fine. I’ll kick both your asses.

176
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:38,533
Hey.

177
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:39,595
Hey. Stop.

178
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,545
Enough.

179
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:49,951
That’s enough.

180
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,342
You cannot fight them though you try.

181
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,558
Hey, do you look down on me?

182
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,937
Yes, I do.

183
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:58,971
I’m not mistaken.

184
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,522
Someone like you can’t bully anyone

185
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,013
except women.

186
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,965
The hell did you just say?

187
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,130
Why are you f*cking smiling?

188
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,505
Miss Jan,

189
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,506
you’ve filmed his whole face, right?

190
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,709
Yes. It’s clear…

191
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:23,777
that Pakorn harms the teacher.

192
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,903
Hey, you blackmailed me.

193
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:27,949
Give me your phone.

194
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,471
If you dare, then do it.

195
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,968
I know you don’t dare to hurt me.

196
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,595
Because I’m still a juvenile.

197
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:47,355
Yes, I cannot do anything to you.

198
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:50,208
But the police can.

199
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:56,877
What do you want to do?

200
00:11:57,377 --> 00:11:59,608
Go home or go to the detention center?

201
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,019
Actually, with just one phone call,

202
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,170
you’d already be facing multiple charges

203
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,808
because with your face clearly visible,

204
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:09,703
it’s hard to deny.

205
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,386
If you don’t want to be expelled,

206
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,317
don’t bully Prang again.

207
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,173
If I had known,

208
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:17,355
I wouldn’t have been kind like this again.

209
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:20,459
Say if you get it.

210
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:23,845
Yes.

211
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,084
I won’t bully her anymore.

212
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:37,752
Let’s go.

213
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:48,690
Thank you.

214
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,511
Thanks to both of you, too.

215
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,777
Don't worry, Prang.

216
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,450
From now on, no one can hurt you anymore.

217
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,819
You have friends who are always there to support you.

218
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,306
Um. Thank you so much.

219
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:30,087
Ugh.

220
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,037
Thanks.

221
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,650
What for?

222
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:39,677
Thanks for sending me home.

223
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,081
I can send you home every day.

224
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:43,893
No need.

225
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:46,112
I have legs. I can go home by myself.

226
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,069
But it’s essential to me.

227
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,884
The hell are you talking about?

228
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:53,413
Make me wanna puke.

229
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,306
Yeah, me too.

230
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,229
Anyway, I’m glad that you believed me today.

231
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,026
I didn’t believe you.

232
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,711
I just believed in myself.

233
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:16,365
Sure.

234
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:17,989
I’ll leave now then.

235
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:19,597
Saint.

236
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:40,314
See you.

237
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:41,149
See you.

238
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:42,438
Ride carefully.

239
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,465
Go inside then.

240
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,333
See you.

241
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,746
Did I really not pass the audition for this?

242
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:25,725
So, do you have any other jobs for me?

243
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,069
An advertisement, modeling,

244
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,080
being an extra—anything at all,

245
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,180
I can do it all.

246
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:35,574
My family really needs the money.

247
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,666
So if you have any work,

248
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,311
please feel free to call me anytime.

249
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,214
Thank you very much.

250
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,811
There goes my meal money.

251
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:40,877
What’s wrong with you?

252
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:42,619
A sandwich.

253
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:44,105
Don’t tell me you don’t know it.

254
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
I know what it is.

255
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,651
What I mean is, why did you give it to me?

256
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,802
I bought some for myself and just wanted to share.

257
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,266
Eve,

258
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,328
did you secretly put something in there?

259
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:07,179
I just want to be nice to you.

260
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:10,605
I judged you too quickly before.

261
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:13,795
At least you know it.

262
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,019
If you need any help, just let me know.

263
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,108
If I can, I’ll do it.

264
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:23,974
Nothing for you to help.

265
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:25,416
I can take care of myself.

266
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,155
Sure, Little Ms. Capable.

267
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:29,983
Nobody is better than you.

268
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,177
Are you being sarcastic with me?

269
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:34,691
Nah, I just let you have it today.

270
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:45,011
Those Class 3 picked a fight with us?

271
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,491
Why did you tell me?

272
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,111
Did they also splash paint on Peeta’s locker?

273
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:52,722
Yes, that Pipe guy forced her to do it.

274
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,065
That brat Pipe again?

275
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,379
But he’s suspended now.

276
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,441
Guess he won’t pick a fight with us anymore.

277
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
No need to do anything.

278
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:00,767
No way.

279
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,758
Class 2 is in charge of this school.

280
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,466
If we let him off,

281
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,983
he’d think we were such a coward.

282
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:08,611
Forget it. It’ll be just a hassle.

283
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,259
But it’s our pride.

284
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:14,069
But if you do that, we all will be punished.

285
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,362
F*ck off.

286
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Go.

287
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,933
What's with these guys? Do they only have muscles and brawn in their heads?

288
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,448
Every little thing, they just fight.

289
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,377
Right. I agree with you on this.

290
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:34,293
Something big has happened, everyone.

291
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,407
What happened, Miss Wimol?

292
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:38,568
Class 2 goes to fight with Class 3 again.

293
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,611
Huh?

294
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,503
Class 2 again?

295
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,309
Yes, sir. The room was all ruined.

296
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,050
No matter how much I tried to stop them but nobody listened to me.

297
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,342
What happened?

298
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,441
Who did this?

299
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,428
Who did this?

300
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,866
It’s my fault.

301
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,370
It all started because of me.

302
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:23,674
That’s not true. It’s Class 2’s fault.

303
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,909
They came to splash paint and cause trouble

304
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:28,001
until the room was ruined like this.

305
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,376
Which Class 2 students?

306
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,017
Many of them.

307
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:33,808
From what I can remember,

308
00:19:34,324 --> 00:19:36,170
they were Ken and the twins.

309
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,917
Oh, the principal’s son was here, too.

310
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:40,222
What?

311
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:41,675
He was here to stop them.

312
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:43,023
But he failed.

313
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,853
And where are they now?

314
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,911
Miss Jan. Mr. Sung.

315
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,765
Bring your students to me.

316
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:58,416
Bring everyone.

317
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,432
But it’s not fair to those who didn’t do anything.

318
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:16,857
That’s right. It has nothing to do with us.

319
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,605
Yes. I stayed quietly by myself.

320
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,020
I was even taking a nap in the class.

321
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:23,870
If you don’t believe me, you can ask our class president.

322
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:24,965
He was there with me.

323
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,819
I only filmed what happened?

324
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,731
Is it wrong?

325
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,007
We were there to stop them,

326
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,395
why do we have to be punished?

327
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:32,564
Because your class caused problems many times already.

328
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:38,377
I’ve told you I’d use your class as a model class.

329
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:41,265
But you all never give any cooperation.

330
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,558
I don't care who caused the trouble,

331
00:20:45,773 --> 00:20:46,782
but from now on,

332
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,869
you will have to take responsibility and work together on what's happened. All of you.

333
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:58,671
Principal,

334
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:02,167
I can’t even take care of myself.

335
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,509
How could you expect me to take care of others?

336
00:21:07,617 --> 00:21:09,619
You should learn to take responsibility.

337
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,019
It is a basic principle of living together.

338
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,013
Principal, but doing it this way

339
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:20,011
is unfair to the other students.

340
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,770
We can't use fairness with the students in class two, Miss Jan.

341
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:27,302
Many teachers have already quit because of these students,

342
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,574
and I'm fed up with it.

343
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:33,176
Since using a gentle approach didn't work,

344
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,371
we have to use a stricter one now.

345
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,970
Listen to me.

346
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:48,370
You all will be locked up in this room till the class is over.

347
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:53,204
And if anyone disobeys or goes against my orders,

348
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:54,328
even one person,

349
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,423
I will punish all of you in this room again.

350
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,168
No exceptions, including my own son.

351
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:46,284
This is definitely not good.

352
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,426
The kids probably won’t accept it.

353
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,785
Damn, I didn’t even do it.

354
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,681
Why am I punished together with them?

355
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:02,731
Let’s sit.

356
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:06,948
What a burden.

357
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Uh…

358
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,875
Are we really skipping class?

359
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,930
Of course, Chadjen.

360
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:39,702
We’ll be punished if we stay here.

361
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,425
Yes.

362
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,610
Ken and the others skipped class earlier.

363
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,669
Yeah, they made everyone else suffer because of it.

364
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,872
And they dared to escape first.

365
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,063
So, you’re here to stop us from leaving?

366
00:23:56,388 --> 00:23:58,614
Nah, we’ll skip, too.

367
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:01,922
Hey, Cable and Peeta

368
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:03,582
are you sure?

369
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,505
Of course.

370
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,017
Why would I stay behind if I’d be punished anyway?

371
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:08,838
It’s okay to skip class sometimes

372
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,770
so I can just wait for my tutoring school without rushing.

373
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:14,924
Yes, me too.

374
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,830
You’re even still diligent though you try to skip class.

375
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,011
Better this way.

376
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:22,117
I’ll have my audition after this, too.

377
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:29,201
Then, the whole Class 2 skips class.

378
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,510
We cannot help it.

379
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,265
The principal is being unfair.

380
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:34,789
Who would want to study?

381
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:38,525
I cannot endure it though I’m her child.

382
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,269
She never understands anything.

383
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:48,801
She only judges others.

384
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,382
She only forces others to do what she wants,

385
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,730
starting with forcing me to transfer here

386
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,630
and expected me to build the school's reputation.

387
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:20,457
Take it easy, Cable.

388
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:22,915
You still have us.

389
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:43,051
Let’s go.

390
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,029
1, 2, 3.

391
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,136
Again.

392
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,254
That’s enough, you will hurt your arms.

393
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,102
Bro, my arms are so strong.

394
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,912
You call being sick this often ‘strong’?

395
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
You talk too much.

396
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:20,715
You haven’t told me why you picked me up early today.

397
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,314
And that’s not good?

398
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,952
If I pick you up late, you complain.

399
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,127
If I pick you up early, you complain.

400
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,557
I didn’t complain, I just asked.

401
00:26:29,426 --> 00:26:32,528
We came early because we'll take you to eat snacks.

402
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,828
Really? I want to eat ice cream.

403
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,571
Oh, you might get cavities.

404
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,802
You nag me again.

405
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:40,718
Then don’t eat, I’ll eat with Saint.

406
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:42,521
Oh.

407
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,522
Saint, carry me.

408
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,090
No problem.

409
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,921
Saint, you’re spoiling my sister too much.

410
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:53,391
She might end up with bad habits.

411
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:55,817
Ching Ching is just so cute.

412
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,708
How could I not spoil her?

413
00:26:58,223 --> 00:26:59,223
That’s right.

414
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:02,622
The more you all stay together, the more you pick up bad habits from each other.

415
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:05,118
Wanna do it, too?

416
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,128
Shin,

417
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:13,485
I want Saint to stay over at our place again.

418
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:15,881
No.

419
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:18,108
Why?

420
00:27:18,614 --> 00:27:20,382
I stayed over at your place often back then.

421
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,625
That was back then, but this is now.

422
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:23,720
It's not the same.

423
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:27,013
You always have excuses.

424
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,890
Talking about it makes me think of the old days, too.

425
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,069
Hello.

426
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:09,165
- Hello. - Hello.

427
00:28:10,352 --> 00:28:11,422
Is that your new bike?

428
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,958
Yeah, I just bought it.

429
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:19,811
Well, where is my bike?

430
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:22,777
I already sold your shitty bike.

431
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:23,802
Hey,

432
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:25,525
how could you sell my bike?

433
00:28:27,364 --> 00:28:28,570
You owe me the money,

434
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:30,802
of course, I have the right to sell it.

435
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:45,774
Hey,

436
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,074
it’s okay, man.

437
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,645
The hell it's gonna be okay.

438
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:51,939
What will you do now?

439
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,035
Damn it.

440
00:28:55,477 --> 00:28:57,214
I really want to take revenge on Jeng.

441
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:58,774
Are you crazy, Ken?

442
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:00,426
We all will be in trouble.

443
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:16,122
Let’s go to see Saint.

444
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,770
Why the heck should we see him?

445
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,118
I got an idea.

446
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,554
Saint.

447
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:39,013
Come here.

448
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
What do you want?

449
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:47,477
I have an offer for you.

450
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,825
Never mind. Thanks.

451
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,297
Hey.

452
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,050
Listen to me first.

453
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,899
I’m sure you're gonna be interested in it.

454
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,325
Did the whole class skip?

455
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,202
Even Cable–-the principal’s son, skipped, too?

456
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,774
Peeta, too.

457
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:19,605
I think they weren’t happy with the way the principal punished them.

458
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:23,463
If the principal knows, she will throw a tantrum for sure.

459
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,314
Then what should we do?

460
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,714
I think we shouldn’t report this to the principal.

461
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:32,872
That’s true.

462
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:33,985
I agree with you.

463
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:36,382
Or else the kids will…

464
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,317
cannot accept it even more.

465
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,604
I am still concerned about one more thing.

466
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:45,970
I’m afraid they might cause troubles now that they skipped class.

467
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:02,277
Hey, it’s Boss’s new bike.

468
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,897
Wash it carefully, don’t let it get scratched.

469
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:04,995
Oh, Roger that.

470
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,111
Where’s the key?

471
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:09,782
Here.

472
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:21,425
Hello.

473
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,127
(Shin, it’s Knot.)

474
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:25,760
Huh? What’s happened?

475
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:27,148
(Hurry and stop Saint.)

476
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:28,896
(Or else he’ll be in trouble.)

477
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,411
Huh? What are you talking about?

478
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,687
(Ken asked Saint to steal Jeng’s bike...)

479
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,755
(in exchange for him not bothering you anymore.)

480
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:39,860
(And Saint was crazy enough to agree.)

481
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,971
Saint. Damn.

482
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:06,540
Hey, go check it.

483
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:07,715
What’s that sound?

484
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,912
(Whistling.)

485
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:30,780
(Whistling.)

486
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:34,958
Ugh.

487
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:37,675
Forgive me, bro.

488
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:40,577
This is dangerous.

489
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:48,672
There’s nothing…

490
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,780
He secretly takes a nap again.

491
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,602
If Jeng sees this, I’ll be scolded again.

492
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,305
Damn.

493
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,570
- Ugh. - Ouch.

494
00:32:57,314 --> 00:32:58,314
Sorry, bro.

495
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,379
Hey, who’s that?

496
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:11,565
Damn it.

497
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,333
You brat.

498
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:23,983
Hey. Where is he going?

499
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,093
Ouch.

500
00:33:26,382 --> 00:33:27,234
- Shin. - Saint.

501
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:27,994
Why are you here?

502
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,125
I’m taking you home.

503
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:30,527
Damn, let’s escape first.

504
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:31,096
What?

505
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,111
Damn it.

506
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,752
Shin, come this way.

507
00:33:33,773 --> 00:33:34,773
Damn it.

508
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,797
Hey.

509
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:40,748
The hell are you shooting for?

510
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:43,280
Someone sneaked in to steal your bike.

511
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:44,465
What? You jerk.

512
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,020
You're begging for death now.

513
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,730
Go block them from that side.

514
00:33:57,894 --> 00:33:59,514
Damn. What should we do?

515
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:12,071
If we cannot escape, then let’s fight them together.

516
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:14,795
Um.

517
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,250
Come out, you bastard.

518
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:28,962
I know you are here.

519
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:35,214
How dare you try to steal my bike?

520
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,844
Ugh.

521
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:58,342
Ouch.

522
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,219
Damn it.

523
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:04,786
You bastard.

524
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:06,835
Don’t come closer.

525
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,048
Stop there.

526
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:12,665
Damn it.

527
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:13,385
Are you okay?

528
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:14,552
Yeah.

529
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,284
Don’t come closer or I’ll shoot you.

530
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:38,364
Ouch.

531
00:35:38,524 --> 00:35:40,308
Shin, what about this gun?

532
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:41,517
Just throw it away.

533
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:42,918
Why will you keep it?

534
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:43,948
Let’s go.

535
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:47,520
Shin, are you okay?

536
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:48,555
Yeah.

537
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,512
Damn, we almost died.

538
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,515
Yeah, I thought we might not survive.

539
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:09,576
Don’t do it again next time.

540
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:11,422
What would you do if I weren’t there?

541
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:12,568
Guess I’d fight with my all.

542
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,374
I’m afraid you might die for real, brat.

543
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,357
Shin.

544
00:36:23,357 --> 00:36:24,635
Is your leg okay?

545
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,471
I’m fine.

546
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:30,903
What about you?

547
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,148
Did you get hurt anywhere?

548
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:34,894
I’m okay.

549
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,331
Nice then, mate.

550
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:39,312
(Sigh.)

551
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:42,195
Shin…

552
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:47,011
Did you just call me “mate”?

553
00:36:50,158 --> 00:36:51,158
Classmate.

554
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:53,776
I haven’t finished the sentence.

555
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:05,253
Okay.

556
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:06,749
Classmate.

557
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,970
Just a classmate then.

558
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:22,520
Hey, move over.

559
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:23,979
You’re too close.

560
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:29,108
Hey, sit properly.

561
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:30,715
The space is very small here.

562
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,017
Sure. Got it, classmate.

563
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:11,977
How is your leg?

564
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,308
I've been through worse pain than this.

565
00:38:15,718 --> 00:38:16,718
I'll be fine soon.

566
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:22,668
I thought you were fully recovered.

567
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,364
Don’t think too much about this.

568
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,570
I’m fine, really.

569
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:29,619
It's just a bruise.

570
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:31,588
I'll get better soon.

571
00:38:41,063 --> 00:38:42,063
Shin,

572
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:47,416
thanks a lot for helping me out today.

573
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,814
Cause you’re just a wimp.

574
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Um.

575
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:55,850
I always have to help you.

576
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:58,487
I know.

577
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,130
Shin.

578
00:39:08,364 --> 00:39:14,077
Thanks a lot for not forgetting our promise.

579
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:22,478
I’ve told you, right?

580
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:22,962
I’m sorry, sir.

581
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,147
Don’t get cocky in my territory.

582
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:24,862
I’m sorry, sir.

583
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:26,198
Get what I said?

584
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:27,348
You jerk.

585
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:28,231
Hey, Saint.

586
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:28,771
You bastard.

587
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:29,456
- Stop. - Hey.

588
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:30,765
- Enough. - Shin, get off my way.

589
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:32,127
Hey, stop.

590
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:33,392
I told you to get off.

591
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:34,536
Enough, Saint.

592
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:35,561
You bastard.

593
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:36,720
Stop there, you jerk.

594
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,177
Damn.

595
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:40,023
The hell is wrong with you?

596
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,102
Get a grip, man.

597
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,623
You wanted them dead or what?

598
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,642
You might end up in a detention center.

599
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:48,666
F*ck it.

600
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:50,351
Who said I’m scared?

601
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:52,822
I don’t want you to be in jail.

602
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:56,745
You’re always like this.

603
00:39:57,325 --> 00:39:59,365
That’s why these bastards thought I wasn’t serious.

604
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,579
Tone it down a bit, take it easy.

605
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,368
Damn.

606
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,950
I seriously feel like quitting being friends with you.

607
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Then just stop being friends with me already.

608
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,890
No.

609
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,560
I don't break up with you because

610
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,268
I know you don't have friends either.

611
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,127
We're the only ones we've got.

612
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:33,419
If we stop being friends...

613
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,940
I'd probably die from loneliness.

614
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:40,785
You jerk.

615
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:42,908
You hit me?

616
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:50,588
Saint.

617
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:58,062
Remember this.

618
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,512
When you're in danger,

619
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,106
I'll be the one to help you.

620
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:08,816
I won't let you end up in jail.

621
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:11,977
I won't let you fight alone.

622
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,317
I'll keep doing this until the day I die.

623
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:20,259
I promise you.

624
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,017
Because you are my best friend.

625
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,786
What’s wrong with you?

626
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,640
Why suddenly act all emotional?

627
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:34,917
Huh?

628
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:36,914
If you’re emotional then cry for me.

629
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,114
Where’s your tear?

630
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:39,512
Hurry up. I’m waiting to see it.

631
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:41,034
You brat, that’s enough.

632
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,200
Well, what about you?

633
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,411
Don't you have anything to promise me?

634
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,229
I want something touching.

635
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:49,376
Oh.

636
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Sure.

637
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:55,675
Umm…

638
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,485
Then,

639
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,010
I promise you that

640
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:03,127
you and I

641
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:05,740
will be friends forever.

642
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:10,422
Come on, jerk. I can say that much too.

643
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:13,011
Hey,

644
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:14,625
I'm speaking from the heart here.

645
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:15,826
Not touching enough?

646
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,718
The hell it’s touching. You’re useless.

647
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:19,397
What?

648
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:23,154
But I’m serious.

649
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:28,700
You and I must be friends for life.

650
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,628
I haven’t forgotten it either.

651
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:38,854
For me,

652
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,678
you’ll always be my friend.

653
00:42:52,048 --> 00:42:53,671
You don’t need to say anything.

654
00:42:55,894 --> 00:42:57,014
I only want you to know that

655
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,241
I’m f*cking happy

656
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:05,162
that we started talking again.

657
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:09,050
You just talked too much now.

658
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:15,971
I’m also glad that you thought of me.

659
00:43:17,088 --> 00:43:18,088
Yeah.

660
00:43:20,802 --> 00:43:21,377
Shin…

661
00:43:21,737 --> 00:43:23,143
If you say even one more word,

662
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,574
I’ll stop talking to you.

663
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:33,699
Thanks for sending me home.

664
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:35,394
Um.

665
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:37,659
See you tomorrow.

666
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,324
- Yeah. - Shin.

667
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:47,536
Mom.

668
00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:52,694
I have told you, right?

669
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,505
Don’t bother Shin anymore.

670
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:57,971
Get inside, Shin.

671
00:43:58,394 --> 00:43:59,717
I deserve it.

672
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:02,211
This isn’t even enough.

673
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:05,813
You cannot be friends with Shin.

674
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:09,514
Yes, I know.

675
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:11,712
If you know it, then don’t bother him anymore.

676
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:15,145
Or else I’ll have him resign from school.

677
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:16,718
I’m not leaving.

678
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,022
I told you to go inside, Shin.

679
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,208
Mom.

680
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:21,238
That’s enough.

681
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,717
- Saint wasn’t… - Stop talking.

682
00:44:26,348 --> 00:44:27,642
He is the one who hurt you

683
00:44:27,943 --> 00:44:29,321
and made you cry.

684
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:32,025
Are you still going to keep someone like this as a friend?

685
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:37,840
Don't go soft on someone with this kind of nature, Shin.

686
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:42,512
Mom, calm down.

687
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,051
What do you mean I'm hot-tempered?

688
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:45,805
I've been very patient, Shin.

689
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:50,143
How many times do I have to watch you like this?

690
00:44:50,164 --> 00:44:51,925
You don't listen to me.

691
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:53,417
And do you listen to me?

692
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:55,965
He didn’t mean to be so.

693
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:58,300
How long do you want me to keep seeing you like this?

694
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:02,112
- I’m fine, mom. - Shin.

695
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,174
I got what aunty said.

696
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:09,431
I…

697
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:11,515
Really shouldn’t be your friend.

698
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:16,174
I ruined your dream.

699
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:23,016
And I was selfish enough to ask for your forgiveness.

700
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:27,511
I’m such a jerk.

701
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:35,914
You’re always like this.

702
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:40,782
When you came to apologize,

703
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:44,186
you wanted me to be your friend again.

704
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:48,502
You were stubborn and did everything to get things your way.

705
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:55,317
Before, you told me that you wouldn't walk away from me anymore,

706
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:59,314
but as soon as my mom scolded you,

707
00:46:01,078 --> 00:46:02,715
you gave up so easily.

708
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:07,187
You're going to leave me again, just like that, you jerk.

709
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:11,108
You’re always like this.

710
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:17,694
In the end,

711
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,423
you still choose to run away.

712
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:24,391
Shin.

713
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:25,592
Get lost.

714
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:27,728
- I didn’t run away. - I told you to get lost.

715
00:46:35,902 --> 00:46:36,937
You and I,

716
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:40,112
We’re done here.

717
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,390
Let’s go, mom.

718
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,090
Be careful.

719
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:56,573
Shin misunderstood me.

720
00:47:56,911 --> 00:47:57,915
If so,

721
00:47:58,112 --> 00:47:59,672
then make him understand you correctly.

722
00:47:59,857 --> 00:48:01,909
This on-and-off relationship

723
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:03,063
What a bothersome.

724
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:04,508
Is really not good.

725
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:06,508
Those around you’ll be tired.

726
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:07,712
It’s my bad.

727
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:09,672
How long will you keep avoiding me?

728
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:10,752
You and I,

729
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,788
we’re no longer friends, aren’t we?

730
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:14,481
Stupid jerk.

731
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,290
Such a stupid jerk, really.

732
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:18,659
Didn’t you say you’ll never leave us?

733
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:21,728
I don’t want to see my best friends keep messing up like this over and over.

734
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,411
What’s wrong with my way of living?

735
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:25,145
It’s my life, don’t butt in.

736
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:26,834
You bastard.

737
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:27,201
Hey.

738
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:28,434
You jerk.
