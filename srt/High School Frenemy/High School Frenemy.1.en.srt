1
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,499
Is this all?

2
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:24,465
Thank you.

3
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:27,684
Grilled pork. Crispy pork belly.

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,188
Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,183
Can you give me a ride?

6
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,556
- Huh? - Can you give me a ride?

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,340
I’m a food delivery man, not a ride-sharing.

8
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:43,823
Here.

9
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,103
Please help me.

10
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,281
Please. Start your bike.

11
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:47,996
Come on.

12
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:48,882
Where do you want to go?

13
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,284
Anywhere but here. Come on.

14
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:51,979
Hurry up. Stop asking.

15
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,549
Fine. I’ll do it.

16
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,700
Start your bike. Hurry up.

17
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,088
Hey. He’s right there.

18
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:01,293
- Aod, stay right there. - Sh*t. Go, go, go.

19
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,451
Stop.

20
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:04,591
Stop.

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,376
Stop.

22
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,476
Hey.

23
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:08,980
Aod, I said stop.

24
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,573
Aod, j*ckass.

25
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,988
Come back.

26
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,986
Go that way.

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,759
Aod.

28
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,982
Damn. It’s a dead end.

29
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:43,241
What should we do? I think we’re screwed.

30
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,585
You think you can run away from us, Aod.

31
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:47,290
Come here.

32
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,196
Come here, jack*ss.

33
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:49,294
Come here, d*ckhead.

34
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Come here.

35
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,979
Hold tight.

36
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,525
Where are you going?

37
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,490
Follow them.

38
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,509
Sh*t.

39
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:35,684
ENEMIES

40
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:55,996
Hey.

41
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,488
I thought you said it was a 3x3 game.

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Sorry.

43
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,438
Thep Burapha kids are loyal friends.

44
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:26,136
Loyal friends? No, you are just cowardly pack dogs.

45
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,785
Woof.

46
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:27,893
Woof woof.

47
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:28,804
Woof woof.

48
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:29,349
Woof woof.

49
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,044
What the heck?

50
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:31,808
- What the hell are you barking for? - Woof woof.

51
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:33,774
Woof woof.

52
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,989
Do you think Udon Pithak kids are not loyal friends?

53
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:48,881
You brought your friends.

54
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,595
You are also cowardly pack dogs.

55
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,075
It’s because I know your nature.

56
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:07,392
What are you waiting for?

57
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:08,186
Go teach them a lesson.

58
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:08,875
Bring it on.

59
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:09,894
Hey.

60
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:22,834
Come here.

61
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:25,897
You, pr*ck

62
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,988
Don’t hurt me.

63
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,967
Stop it.

64
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,445
Catch them.

65
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:38,076
Hey!

66
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:39,315
What the heck?!

67
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:40,303
Stop it.

68
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,651
I said stop.

69
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,949
Hey, the cops are here.

70
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,017
Catch him.

71
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,447
Shin.

72
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,265
Shin.

73
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:50,356
Get up.

74
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:52,903
Shin.

75
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:54,297
Let me go.

76
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,279
Let me go.

77
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,634
Stop.

78
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,106
Stop it.

79
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,394
Why can’t you stop fighting?

80
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,851
I said stop it.

81
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:13,401
Fighting again?

82
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,431
Why do you keep fighting?

83
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,330
You know though you study at different campuses,

84
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,782
you all are Siamwit students.

85
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:25,856
Why do you have to fight?

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,681
Can I ask you for real? Aren’t you tired of it?

87
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:32,186
If we were tired of it, we wouldn’t have done it.

88
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,142
You’re still in the mood for joking?

89
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:39,097
Do you want to sleep behind bars?

90
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:39,933
Huh?

91
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:42,989
Those morons provoked us first.

92
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:46,185
Yes, those morons provoked us.

93
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:47,974
Who did you call ‘morons’?

94
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:52,151
Look how stupid they are, Sergeant.

95
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,388
D*ckhead, let me kick your ass.

96
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,749
These rascals, can’t you stop fighting for one minute?

97
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,754
You are brawling every year.

98
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:02,188
Everyone is sick of you.

99
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,183
Aod, get off.

100
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,422
Thank you so much.

101
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:23,497
Who are you?

102
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:25,607
I’m just a food delivery man.

103
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,556
One noodle, please.

104
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,016
Mister.

105
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:46,915
Mister.

106
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,989
Do you want to buy noodles?

107
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:55,565
Wait a sec.

108
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,380
Good evening, Teacher.

109
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,487
I’m fine. Thank you. And you?

110
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:13,097
I’m fine. Thank you.

111
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:19,382
Teacher, you want eat noodles?

112
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:22,761
I can speak Thai.

113
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,490
Despite my looks, I teach the Thai language.

114
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:29,647
I want dried noodles with cha siu pork.

115
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,094
Yes.

116
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,142
Is he opening the shop?

117
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:39,342
Yes.

118
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,491
My dad is just resting his eyes.

119
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,395
You are hard-working.

120
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:54,254
You help your dad at the noodle shop.

121
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:56,084
You also work as a food delivery man.

122
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,084
I’m helping him earn money

123
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:59,876
to pay for my tuition fee at Siamwit School.

124
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,986
I’m teaching at the school.

125
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,388
This is my first semester here.

126
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,545
Are you old enough to work as a delivery man?

127
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,182
I’m 19.

128
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,185
I took a break from school for two years.

129
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,914
40 baht.

130
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,946
Do you want chopsticks?

131
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:23,752
Yes.

132
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,851
- Here.
- Thank you.

133
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,279
What’s your name?

134
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:36,838
Saint.

135
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,122
Saint.

136
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:39,949
I’m Jan.

137
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,245
Nice to meet you.

138
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,785
Why are you tapping it?

139
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,004
Dad, you were sleeping when there was a customer.

140
00:10:11,023 --> 00:10:12,491
Are you helping me make money?

141
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,174
- I already sold several bowls. - Did you drink last night?

142
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:18,719
No, I didn’t.

143
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,076
You look hungover. You surely drank last night.

144
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,388
Naruebet, your parent is here.

145
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:38,742
Shin.

146
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:40,912
I told you not to cause any trouble.

147
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:43,112
Why didn’t you listen to me?

148
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,250
I don’t want to move you to a new school again.

149
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:52,269
If you have records, no school wants to take you.

150
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,485
It’s not a big deal, Mom.

151
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:55,982
Shin.

152
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:02,768
I told you.

153
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,114
I don’t want to go to school.

154
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,478
I can walk by myself.

155
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,389
We are home, Dad.

156
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,645
I know where my home is.

157
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,780
Saint, you don’t know your duty.

158
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:40,194
You need to work harder at school.

159
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:42,979
Do you hear me?

160
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,688
Work hard…wait.

161
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,253
Wait. Time out.

162
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,482
Dad, stop drinking. You’re drunk.

163
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,999
You need to work hard at school.

164
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,882
Why?

165
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,887
When your mom looks down from above,

166
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:02,232
she won’t be worried.

167
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,648
She won’t be worried about you

168
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:12,293
if you have an education.

169
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,195
So you can survive in the society.

170
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,385
Do you get what I say?

171
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,082
Huh, Saint?

172
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:19,927
I get it.

173
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:20,939
Lie down.

174
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,927
Chai.

175
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,629
Chai.

176
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,814
Where’s your dad?

177
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,774
He’s not here.

178
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:58,890
He’s not here? But his bike is here.

179
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:07,213
Can you give us more time?

180
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,611
My dad and I don’t have any money right now.

181
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,706
Kid, my rule is simple.

182
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:16,078
If my debtor can’t pay me, I’ll hurt them.

183
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:17,274
Move.

184
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,795
If you want to do that, I’ll take it for him.

185
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:21,934
You, jack*ss.

186
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,933
He wants to have trouble.

187
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:26,362
Let’s give it to him.

188
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:27,782
Sure.

189
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:45,647
Our Siamwit School is struggling.

190
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,179
We have been in deficit for several years.

191
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,682
Our school has been known for its bad reputation.

192
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:58,177
Our students have been involved in brawls and violence for several years.

193
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:02,417
The executives and I discussed the matter with the school’s owner.

194
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,854
We reached a conclusion.

195
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,850
Udon Pithank campus.

196
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,884
Thep Burapha campus.

197
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,192
They will be merged.

198
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,632
Principal, if the students from the two campuses have to study together,

199
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,882
I’m afraid that the problem will worsen.

200
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,112
Go.

201
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,789
You know that the feud between them has been ongoing for years.

202
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,008
If you put them together,

203
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:32,293
they will fight constantly.

204
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:42,139
This is the reason why I invited you all today.

205
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:47,014
I want you to work together to solve this problem.

206
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,145
How could we solve the problem?

207
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,991
We can’t even stop each campus from making trouble.

208
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,290
If you merge them,

209
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,539
I can’t see a solution to the problem.

210
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:17,853
It’s your job to teach and discipline our students.

211
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,780
I want to ask for your cooperation.

212
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,371
Please work together to improve our school’s image.

213
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:35,396
Siamwit will no longer be known as a school of thugs.

214
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:51,135
Though this is your first year here,
you have a big challenge waiting.

215
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,265
Are you sure you can handle it, Miss Jan?

216
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:55,097
Yes.

217
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,435
You know that I’m very patient.

218
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:02,065
Siamwit is a tough challenge.

219
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,897
As long as I get to teach students,

220
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:08,379
any school is fine with me.

221
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:13,116
I know that you went through a lot while teaching at a rural school.

222
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,356
I get it.

223
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,278
But this school is different.

224
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,485
This school is full of troubled kids.

225
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,035
They don’t listen to anyone except themselves and their friends.

226
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,739
Any schools have problems.

227
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:29,130
That’s what my dad taught me.

228
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,519
I remember.

229
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,082
He taught me that too.

230
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,342
I just want to give you a warning.

231
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,333
Mr. Jo.

232
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,425
Why are the students from Thep Burapha

233
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,425
and Udon Pithak campuses enemies?

234
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:51,534
From what I heard, it started 16 years ago.

235
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:54,687
Back then, the two campuses didn’t have any problems.

236
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,463
They even had a friendly sports day.

237
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,804
SIAMWIT’S FRIENDLY SPORTS DAY:
THEP BURAPHA VS. UDON PITHAK

238
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,346
On the sports day,

239
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,044
THEP BURAPHA’S SLAVE

240
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,783
a student from Udon Pithak died.

241
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:13,137
What the hell are you looking at?

242
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:18,385
The student was bullied by Thep Burapha students.

243
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,989
You’re ruining our reputation.

244
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:23,854
Go away, jack*ss.

245
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,431
Get lost, idiot.

246
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,711
Get lost.

247
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,345
Assh*le

248
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,274
Pr*ck.

249
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:44,299
He decided to kill himself by jumping off a building.

250
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:52,986
He was a troubled kid who was constantly involved in brawls.

251
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,186
After that, the two campuses have been fighting.

252
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:01,579
It’s as if they’re conditioned to be enemies.

253
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:04,576
I don’t get it.

254
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,524
Why do they keep fighting

255
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,594
over the problem that happened 16 years ago?

256
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:11,854
I guess it’s about their pride.

257
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:16,180
They have been competing against each other,

258
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:19,438
in terms of academic performance and brawls.

259
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:22,824
As time passed, their rivalry became a normal thing.

260
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,982
They have been told by their seniors

261
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:28,548
that they need to compete and defeat each other.

262
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,644
They end up hating each other.

263
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,514
You don’t know how to smoke. Why do you try it?

264
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,539
Saint, what are you doing here?

265
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
I’m working.

266
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:13,676
What about you, Peeta?

267
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,342
Why are you smoking here?

268
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:19,848
You can’t tell anyone about this, especially Eve.

269
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,125
Do you get it?

270
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:22,737
If you do, I won’t leave you alone.

271
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,674
Tomorrow is the first day of school.

272
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:28,773
See you.

273
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,155
Did you hear what I said?

274
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,224
Lighter.

275
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:22,244
S ACADEMIC CENTER

276
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:26,364
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

277
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:19,502
Dad.

278
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,911
Dad.

279
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,284
I made boiled rice for you.

280
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,148
Why aren’t you leaving for school?

281
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:31,856
You will be late.

282
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,856
Go, go, go. Go to school.

283
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,509
Don’t forget to eat it.

284
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,583
Eat it while it’s still warm.

285
00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:41,645
I won’t take the motorcycle.

286
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,168
You can use it to buy the ingredients.

287
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,084
I’ll use it for work in the evening.

288
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,259
Fine.

289
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:48,194
Don’t forget to eat it.

290
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:08,780
Saint, get up. My legs hurt.

291
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,304
It’s only the first day of school but you already annoy me.

292
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,514
Thank you.

293
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:41,044
Sorry, Eve.

294
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:42,876
He gave up his seat for me.

295
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,988
If you want to sit, you can sit on my lap.

296
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:47,977
No.

297
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,114
I’ll think that I give up the seat for a kid.

298
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,155
Your tongue is still sharp, Beautiful.

299
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,792
Do you want to join Ken’s gang?

300
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:58,482
No.

301
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,988
I’m sick of the evil twins like you.

302
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:05,964
She’s something.

303
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:15,992
Saint.

304
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,639
Are you really sleeping while standing?

305
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:19,284
How can you let him get his way?

306
00:23:19,302 --> 00:23:20,389
You are a man.

307
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:30,079
Homeroom teacher?

308
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:31,857
Yes.

309
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,882
I’ll appoint you as the homeroom teacher of Class 2

310
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,394
to replace the resigned teacher.

311
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,343
Isn’t it too hard for a new teacher like her?

312
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:45,905
Principal, you know what kind of kids are in Class 2.

313
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,223
That’s right.

314
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:50,848
No teachers have been able to control them.

315
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:54,582
I think it’d be better to assign another teacher for the job.

316
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:59,739
Currently, we are short of faculty staff.

317
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:04,476
It’s my plan to assign Miss Jan to supervise this class.

318
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:10,337
I believe that she can help improve these kids.

319
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:15,980
Wait. Is Class 2 that problematic?

320
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:17,974
Yes.

321
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,854
They’re the most difficult and
problematic kids in our school.

322
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,330
Last year, two teachers resigned because of them.

323
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,094
Miss Ploy is the third one.

324
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:34,082
What did the kids do for the teachers to resign?

325
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:43,982
The language has five levels.

326
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:46,751
- The first one is the formal level. - What level?

327
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,744
- What level? - Here it is.

328
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:51,383
- Class, pay attention. - Here is the formal level.

329
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:53,032
Everyone, stop it.

330
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:55,254
Push it.

331
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,201
Point the camera to the teacher, not us.

332
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,589
Guys, smile to the camera.

333
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:04,225
We got it.

334
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,685
Her phone.

335
00:25:25,937 --> 00:25:27,087
Give it to Cable.

336
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:29,614
What do we do next?

337
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:34,589
I feel so sleepy.

338
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,109
Me too.

339
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:40,681
- Keep walking. - Just keep walking, jack*ss.

340
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:43,244
Their butt looks funny when they walk.

341
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:44,482
They are so annoying.

342
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:57,546
Hey, you.

343
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,391
Come here.

344
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,059
What’s up?

345
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:09,503
Are you a Udon Pithak student?

346
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,961
Wow, you use an expensive bag.

347
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:19,882
Is your family rich?

348
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:21,262
Give us some money.

349
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,684
Are you extorting money from me?

350
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,482
Didn’t you hear what I said?

351
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:27,854
I’m asking you to give us money.

352
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,278
If we were extorting you, we wouldn’t be doing this.

353
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,392
Do you want to try us?

354
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:32,008
No.

355
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,465
No? Where are you going?

356
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:34,911
No.

357
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:36,682
What are you doing?

358
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,388
What are you doing?

359
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:43,774
Please stop it.

360
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,795
We just asked for a little money from you.

361
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,434
- Why are you so stingy? - Give it to me, dumb*ss.

362
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:51,447
No.

363
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,988
Your family is rich, isn’t it?

364
00:26:52,989 --> 00:26:54,442
It’s just a few bucks.

365
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,094
Where did you hide your money?

366
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,819
Why? You don’t want to give it to us?

367
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,762
Let me see.

368
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,533
Where did you hide it?

369
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:05,885
Here it is.

370
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:07,325
Give it to me.

371
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:08,383
Don’t do this.

372
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:10,814
That’s Chadjen’s wallet.

373
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,783
That’s Chadjen’s wallet. Dumb*ss.

374
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,690
- Give it back. - Shut up.

375
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,301
I’m going to tell a teacher about this.

376
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:21,376
You’re going to tell a teacher. It’s so scary.

377
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Give it back.

378
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,189
That’s my money.

379
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:29,558
Ken.

380
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:32,804
Let him go.

381
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:38,752
Why do you have to butt in?

382
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:44,242
Take my money.

383
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,374
Where is my cigarette?

384
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:06,245
Come on. Let’s go to school.

385
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,779
See you.

386
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,431
He has a babysitter.

387
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,383
This is so annoying.

388
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,225
Start shooting.

389
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
Class.

390
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:55,842
Who is the class president?

391
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:03,703
I was the class president last year.

392
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:07,146
This year, we haven’t picked a new class president.

393
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:13,688
Can you tell your friends to go back to their seats?

394
00:29:15,945 --> 00:29:17,385
They won’t listen to me.

395
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:25,951
Everyone.

396
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:27,952
Please go back to your seat.

397
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:30,951
Hey.

398
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,096
Do you hear what I say?

399
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:51,379
Hello, everyone.

400
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,460
My name is Jan.

401
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,986
I’m your new homeroom teacher.

402
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:02,026
Please go back to your seat.

403
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,505
Hey.

404
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,767
Guys.

405
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,945
Guys.

406
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,232
Don’t be late next time.

407
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,050
Stop playing with the ball.

408
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,145
Girls, stop dancing and go back to your seat.

409
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:31,985
Don’t put your feet on the desk.

410
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,555
Stop playing with your phone.

411
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:35,697
Don’t put your feet on the desk.

412
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,585
So annoying.

413
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:44,284
What did you say?

414
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,943
Hey, I told you to stop playing with your phone.

415
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:51,543
Give it to me.

416
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,694
Stop playing with your phone.

417
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:56,909
Give it to me.

418
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:58,084
Let it go.

419
00:30:58,198 --> 00:30:59,318
You are the one who has to let it go.

420
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:00,342
Let it go.

421
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,001
Let it go.

422
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,050
You need to let it go.

423
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:08,703
Let it go.

424
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:11,229
Sit down.

425
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:12,662
Sit down now.

426
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:13,674
- Let it go. - Sit down.

427
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:14,979
Let it go.

428
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,282
Sit down and let it go.

429
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,770
Let it go.

430
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:19,297
Let it go.

431
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:19,943
Let it go.

432
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:20,959
Sit down.

433
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,380
Give it to me.

434
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:23,148
Go back to your seat.

435
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,177
- Do you hear what I said? - Let it go.

436
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,105
Let it go.

437
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:26,911
Let it go.

438
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:27,998
Kasidit.

439
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
What are you doing?

440
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:36,078
Let the phone go.

441
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:45,081
Next time.

442
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,745
Listen when I talk to you.

443
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,282
Don’t play with your phone.

444
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:54,791
Don’t put your feet on the desk again.

445
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:01,445
Go back to your seat.

446
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,342
You two, go back.

447
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,933
The three at the back, put your feet down.

448
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:18,780
Put your feet down.

449
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,389
Principal, are you sure Miss Jan can handle Class 2?

450
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:32,143
You chose a half-westerner teacher to teach Thai.

451
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:33,736
No students will listen to her.

452
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:37,496
You should choose a teacher from Udon Pithak campus to supervise Class 2.

453
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:39,442
I think it’ll be a better choice.

454
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:42,679
I worked at Udon Pithak campus before.

455
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:46,364
There are a few teachers there who have the potential to control the class.

456
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:51,491
At first, I didn’t believe Miss Jan would be a good teacher.

457
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:54,973
But after I saw that she helped her students

458
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:58,792
win a national Thai language contest.

459
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,998
I believe that she has something special.

460
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:07,290
Is she that talented?

461
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:09,663
Yes.

462
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:13,850
That’s why I’m confident that a talented teacher like Jan

463
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,337
can help Class 2 improve their grades.

464
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:20,780
But I think it won’t be that easy.

465
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:25,380
Don’t forget that troubled kids from Udon Pithak

466
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,385
are transferred to join Class 2.

467
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,786
I think it will be a difficult task for her.

468
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:37,391
She needs to prove her abilities as a teacher to us.

469
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:44,682
This is Miss Jan.

470
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:47,091
She’s your new homeroom teacher.

471
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:51,617
Alright.

472
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:52,848
I think you probably heard

473
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:58,444
students from Udon Pithak campus will join your class this year.

474
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,383
I don’t want it.

475
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:01,589
I don’t want it.

476
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:02,916
- Go away. - Calm down.

477
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:04,580
Calm down. Calm down.

478
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,287
This is my order.

479
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:12,284
Students of Class 2 must not start a fight.

480
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,954
You need to find a way to live together.

481
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:18,294
Because you are now classmates.

482
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:24,342
There will no longer be our or their campuses.

483
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,690
Do you get it?

484
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:30,124
Please call the new students in.

485
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Come in.

486
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:57,444
If I know or see that you guys are fighting with each other.

487
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,167
I repeat.

488
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,291
Don’t ever start a fight.

489
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,856
Otherwise, you all will be punished.

490
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:05,991
Do you get it?

491
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:08,884
Do you get it?

492
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Yes.

493
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:16,645
Please proceed, Miss Jan.

494
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,579
Everyone, please take the empty seats.

495
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,287
Let’s do a roll call.

496
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:11,934
Peechaya.

497
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,188
Here.

498
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:15,902
Kunakorn.

499
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:17,505
Here.

500
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:19,229
Naruebet.

501
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,136
Naruebet, are you here?

502
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:27,291
Naruebet Ittiwat.

503
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:40,838
Shin.

504
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:42,468
Shin

505
00:36:42,927 --> 00:36:43,927
Shin, man.

506
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:45,334
Hey.

507
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:50,905
What?

508
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:52,356
Hurry up.

509
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:03,914
What?

510
00:37:04,454 --> 00:37:05,454
What are you doing here?

511
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,842
I came to pick up you, my best friend.

512
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:11,438
Whenever you call me that,

513
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:13,148
it means you want something.

514
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,282
You read my mind.

515
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:16,989
Let’s skip school today.

516
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:18,340
No.

517
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:21,531
Every time you asked me to skip school, we always got into trouble.

518
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:22,548
What?

519
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:24,442
I’m just asking you to go to an internet café with me.

520
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:25,657
You’d better spill everything.

521
00:37:26,145 --> 00:37:28,586
You’re going to the internet café to pick up a fight.

522
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:29,958
Am I right?

523
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:32,804
This is why you are my best friend, Shin.

524
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:34,748
This is boring.

525
00:37:36,436 --> 00:37:37,574
Hey.

526
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,278
Shin, aren’t you going with me?

527
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:43,343
No, I have soccer practice this evening.

528
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:46,407
Shin, come with me.

529
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:48,779
Aren’t you worried about me?

530
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:57,482
Don’t t give me puppy dog eyes.

531
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:58,887
I won’t fall for it.

532
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,245
Fine, I’m not going.

533
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,075
Get on the bike.

534
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:05,688
What?

535
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,839
I’ll carry it for you.

536
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,982
You’re always doing this.

537
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:17,140
If I get on your bike, you won’t take me to the Internet café, right?

538
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,576
Saint, you’re always doing this.

539
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:25,576
Please come with me.

540
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,636
Fine.

541
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,636
Just this once.

542
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:29,851
Come on. Get on the bike.

543
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:30,814
I’ll get on the bike.

544
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,192
You should start the engine first.

545
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:34,385
I really hate you.

546
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,579
I don’t believe it.

547
00:38:35,672 --> 00:38:36,672
You really love me.

548
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,297
If one day I disappear from your life,

549
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,044
you don’t need to ask why.

550
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,419
Why?

551
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:46,090
It’s because I hate your puppy face.

552
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:47,897
Fine.

553
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:50,583
I’ll print my photos and put them on the whole street.

554
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:54,382
- So you will see my face everywhere. - Let’s go. You’re wasting our time.

555
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,490
Aren’t you going to do something else other than fighting?

556
00:38:57,831 --> 00:38:58,879
All you do is play soccer.

557
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,248
Just zip up.

558
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:04,551
Saint, what are you revving the engine for?

559
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,579
You are disturbing the neighbors.

560
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,946
Your question is stupid.

561
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:09,447
I’m doing it to let everyone know that Tsunami gang is here.

562
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:12,090
You give me a headache, Saint.

563
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:15,704
Shin.

564
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,980
Is Naruebet here?

565
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,979
He’s not here.

566
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,850
Where is your friend?

567
00:39:24,558 --> 00:39:25,558
I don’t know.

568
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,442
He often misses school.

569
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,942
Please tell him to come to school.

570
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,754
Chingching.

571
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,041
Get up to eat breakfast.

572
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:55,789
I bought porridge with minced pork and two boiled eggs,

573
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,394
like you have told me.

574
00:39:57,894 --> 00:39:59,534
I told them to leave out the green onion.

575
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:06,263
Let me see.

576
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:09,647
Are you still coughing?

577
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,044
Let’s eat porridge.

578
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,980
Shin, aren’t you going to school today?

579
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:31,484
No, I want to be with you.

580
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:36,897
But Mom said we will be stupid if we skip school.

581
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:39,133
Are you afraid that I will be stupid?

582
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,312
Yes.

583
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:44,096
Fine, I’ll go to school.

584
00:40:44,924 --> 00:40:46,924
But I’ll wait until Mom comes home before I leave.

585
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,182
When Mom comes home, I’ll fall asleep already.

586
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:56,479
Anyway, let’s eat to boost your energy first.

587
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,681
You need to eat a lot.

588
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:00,389
So you will have the energy to go to school with me.

589
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,794
Let’s take turns to eat.

590
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:07,644
Sure.

591
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,854
If I take a big bite, you need to do the same.

592
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:13,275
Okay?

593
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:14,851
Alright.

594
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,890
I’ll take the first bite and then it’s your turn.

595
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:20,506
Look.

596
00:41:24,623 --> 00:41:25,623
Now, it’s your turn.

597
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:32,488
Good girl. You did well.

598
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:34,484
I’m hungry.

599
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,519
Yes.

600
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:36,970
What kind of food does the cafeteria have?

601
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,685
Why is the cafeteria so small?

602
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:40,814
Look what they are eating.

603
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:43,848
None of them looks yummy.

604
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:45,574
Let’s go somewhere else.

605
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,275
Can I ask you something?

606
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,130
What do you want?

607
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:51,543
I won’t answer you.

608
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:52,893
Go away from us.

609
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,839
Where is Shin?

610
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:58,694
Why didn’t he come to school?

611
00:41:59,986 --> 00:42:01,143
Do you know him?

612
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,085
Did you have a fight with him before?

613
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,071
Why are you barking at our Thep Burapha friend?

614
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:10,145
You’re Udon Pithak dogs.

615
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:13,010
I’m barking at you, morons.

616
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,714
This is your first day at our school.

617
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:20,188
But you don’t seem to hold back your sharp tongue.

618
00:42:20,919 --> 00:42:22,891
Do you want to get your teeth knocked out?

619
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,647
Your teeth will fall out first.

620
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:27,878
Where is your boss?

621
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,087
Did he run away because he was scared?

622
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:32,989
Watch your mouth, jack*ss.

623
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:35,188
Tsunami gang is so lame.

624
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:37,084
It’s just the first day of school

625
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:39,145
but your boss already ran away with fear.

626
00:42:39,656 --> 00:42:41,817
He ran to sleep with your mom, jack*ss.

627
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:42,854
You, pr*ck.

628
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:44,743
First.

629
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:45,967
You, assh*le.

630
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:47,708
Why did you butt in?

631
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:49,382
Bring it on.

632
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,554
- Come on. - Come here.

633
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,268
Where are you going?

634
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:02,505
Hey, catch him.

635
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:06,262
You, assh*le.

636
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:09,048
Students, stop it.

637
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,011
Students, stop it.

638
00:43:11,847 --> 00:43:12,847
Students.

639
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:13,780
Stop.

640
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:14,848
Stop it.

641
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:16,211
Stop it. I said stop it.

642
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,259
I said stop it.

643
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:19,874
Get away from me.

644
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,074
Why did you butt in?

645
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,253
Can you stop now?

646
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,794
Saint, do you want another punch?

647
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,210
Are you happy now?

648
00:43:58,516 --> 00:43:59,516
Damn you, Saint.

649
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:30,688
I knew it was going to happen.

650
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:34,238
It’s not been a day but you already had a fight.

651
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:38,582
I’ll give you 10 demerit points.

652
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:42,391
Do you know if you get 100 demerit points, you will be expelled?

653
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:45,466
Mr. Pokpong.

654
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:49,441
I think we shouldn’t give them demerit points.

655
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:52,179
Today is the first day of school.

656
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,494
They still can’t get along.

657
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:57,444
It’s normal for them to have clashes.

658
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:00,468
Let’s give them a second chance.

659
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:04,319
Did you hear it?

660
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,681
I’ll do what your homeroom teacher asked.

661
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:10,488
I won’t give you demerit points this time.

662
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,220
If you have another fight, I won’t be kind like this time.

663
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:14,879
Go back to your class.

664
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:32,586
Miss Jan, I know you mean well.

665
00:45:33,124 --> 00:45:35,534
But these kids are different from your former students.

666
00:45:37,574 --> 00:45:39,281
I sincerely warn you.

667
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:43,782
If you are too kind to them, you will get hurt.

668
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,145
I get it.

669
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:50,914
Excuse me.

670
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,940
Let me go.

671
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:02,943
You’re such a smart mouth?!

672
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:05,611
Right back at you!

673
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:06,684
Stop it.

674
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:09,694
Girls, please stop fighting.

675
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:10,653
Hey.

676
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,091
You are blocking my view.

677
00:46:12,424 --> 00:46:13,946
Go for it.

678
00:46:14,865 --> 00:46:15,391
Bring it on.

679
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:16,865
Do it.

680
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:21,192
Breaking news from Class 2.

681
00:46:21,214 --> 00:46:24,205
There is a big battle between girls from Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak campuses.

682
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:26,375
This is their first fight after being transferred to the class.

683
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:28,958
Let’s see who will win in this battle.

684
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:31,386
Come here.

685
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,336
Stay away from my friend.

686
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:34,186
Let my hair go.

687
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:35,356
No.

688
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,122
What the f*ck are you looking at?

689
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:44,782
Shut the f*ck up.

690
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:46,282
Shut the f*ck up.

691
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:47,995
What the f*ck are you looking at?

692
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:53,628
I won’t let go. What are you going to do?

693
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:55,202
Let go of me.

694
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,891
Students.

695
00:46:58,505 --> 00:46:59,505
Students, stop it.

696
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:00,562
Stop it.

697
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:01,540
Stop it.

698
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:03,343
I said stop it.

699
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:04,789
Stop it.

700
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:07,851
Sh*t.

701
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:11,282
She hits the teacher on her first day of school.

702
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:29,825
It’s not my fault.

703
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,054
I was fighting with her but you came in between us.

704
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:33,537
Don’t blame it on me.

705
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:38,785
It’s okay.

706
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:40,394
I’m okay.

707
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,528
Are you sure?

708
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,770
I’m okay.

709
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,591
Everyone, go back to your seat.

710
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:50,845
So we can begin our class.

711
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:09,986
Are you a Thai language teacher?

712
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,850
Yes.

713
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:16,674
She looks like a Westerner but teaches Thai?

714
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,499
You can’t even speak Thai properly.

715
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,290
Can’t our school find a teacher for the class?

716
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:23,914
Then who will teach English?

717
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:24,816
That’s right.

718
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:25,856
Who?

719
00:48:38,588 --> 00:48:39,588
Alright.

720
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,942
Everyone, turn to page 14.

721
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:52,988
Today, we will study literature works from the mid-Ayutthaya period.

722
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:58,699
Does anyone know what literature is?

723
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,234
This jack*ss is a Udon Pithak student.

724
00:49:27,063 --> 00:49:29,140
Are you in Tsunami gang?

725
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Why?

726
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:33,434
Do you have any problem with me?

727
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:36,845
If you want to walk past this way,

728
00:49:37,194 --> 00:49:40,586
you need to pay a toll fee.

729
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,042
Did you own the tollway?

730
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:53,389
How dare you, assh*le?

731
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:56,322
Hey.

732
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,380
Hey, assh*le.

733
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:12,036
Assh*le.

734
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:24,983
You are nothing.

735
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:28,349
I don’t even break a sweat.

736
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,291
Hey.

737
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:36,579
What did you do to my friends?

738
00:50:39,192 --> 00:50:40,389
Sh*t.

739
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:45,460
If you want to know, then follow me, jack*ss.

740
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:47,456
Assh*le, how dare you?

741
00:50:50,709 --> 00:50:51,939
How dare you hit my friends?

742
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:58,988
Can I borrow it?

743
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:02,431
Guys.

744
00:51:02,912 --> 00:51:04,047
Where the hell did he go?

745
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:05,419
Guys, this way.

746
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:10,914
Thanks.

747
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:18,316
Shin.

748
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,548
Long time no see.

749
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:38,445
How have you been?

750
00:51:39,956 --> 00:51:40,979
What do you want from me?

751
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:47,588
I’m happy to see you again.

752
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:08,756
Why are you smiling?

753
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,857
You didn’t hit me.

754
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:16,574
Because you still think I’m your friend, right?

755
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:23,853
I don’t have a friend like you.

756
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,931
Don’t ever call my name again.

757
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:40,836
What did you get?

758
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:41,924
No.12.

759
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:42,982
No.12.

760
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,476
Chadjen, pull it.

761
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,579
Give it a try.

762
00:52:48,236 --> 00:52:49,236
Come on, Chadjen.

763
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,099
Pull it.

764
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:52,115
Give it a try.

765
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,577
It’s not that hard, Chadjen. Try it.

766
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:57,325
Shin.

767
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,850
Shin is here.

768
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:00,641
Shin.

769
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,468
I didn’t think you would come to school today.

770
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:06,296
My sister feels much better.

771
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:10,542
Chadjen sent me dozens of messages telling me to come to school.

772
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:12,445
Chadjen, you did that?

773
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:18,585
I’m sorry that I sent you too many messages.

774
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:19,851
It’s okay, Chadjen.

775
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:21,635
Staying at home is quite boring.

776
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,524
I was attacked by Thep Burapha students on my first day of school.

777
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:29,325
But they were lousy.

778
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:31,925
It’s good that you came to school.

779
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:34,348
Our Tsunami gang can now rule this place.

780
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:35,534
Yes.

781
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:37,222
What are you doing?

782
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:39,971
Chadjen refuses to pull the block.

783
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,271
Chadjen, pull it.

784
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,137
Chadjen, come on.

785
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:46,636
If you don’t do it, I’ll tell Shin.

786
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:47,533
Pull it.

787
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:48,776
Can’t I pull another one?

788
00:53:48,784 --> 00:53:49,813
No.

789
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:55,189
Damn it.

790
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,340
Why do I have to be in the same class as him?

791
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:00,045
Do you know him?

792
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:03,047
He asked us about you yesterday.

793
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,842
Shin, I want to talk to you.

794
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,248
I have nothing to say to you.

795
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:17,396
But I…

796
00:54:18,278 --> 00:54:19,839
My friend said he didn’t want to talk to you.

797
00:54:19,863 --> 00:54:20,976
Are you deaf?

798
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:22,253
Do you want to get hit?

799
00:54:24,284 --> 00:54:25,284
Stay away from him.

800
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,740
Why?

801
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,078
Shin, are you afraid of him?

802
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,770
No, I’m not.

803
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,696
But you should be.

804
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:42,792
Be afraid of Saint?

805
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:45,196
He doesn’t do anything but sleep in class.

806
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:47,700
Shin, you know him?

807
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,647
A person with this kind of nature?

808
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,148
I don’t count as one.

809
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:58,514
This kind of nature…

810
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:01,491
What do you mean?

811
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,594
I sincerely warn you.

812
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,594
His true nature…

813
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,983
is liking to hurt others.

814
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:17,848
He hurts everyone.

815
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:21,349
Even his friends are not the exception.

816
00:55:47,705 --> 00:55:50,051
Mr. Sung will be a homeroom teacher of Class 2,

817
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,430
- Go back to your seat. - together with Miss Jan as a special case.

818
00:55:52,454 --> 00:55:54,072
How could you let them go?

819
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:55,294
They didn’t want to study.

820
00:55:55,356 --> 00:55:56,635
I cannot force them.

821
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,075
Have you heard of Shin’s story when he was in Udon Phithak?

822
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,780
The Tsunami cannot dominate here

823
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:01,937
because I’ll get them.

824
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:05,241
Tsunami, you and I need to settle who's on top.

825
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:06,585
You haven’t had lunch.

826
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:07,594
Want some bread?

827
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,767
Saint is willing to be a gofer for the Udon Pithak?

828
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,605
He might be afraid of the Tsunami.

829
00:56:11,854 --> 00:56:13,847
You cannot bow down to the Udok Phithak.

830
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:17,543
The only one you need to is us.

831
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:19,983
Can’t you just stop bothering me?

832
00:56:22,281 --> 00:56:23,339
I’ve told you.

833
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:26,210
Don’t call my name anymore.
