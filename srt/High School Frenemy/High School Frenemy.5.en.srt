4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,520
Do you want me

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,599
to send you and your sister home?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,440
So you don’t have to walk.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,599
Fine. But follow us from a distance.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,520
Don’t let me see your face or speak up.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,679
I want you to make Shin shed tears.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
If you can do it, I will forgive the debt.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,000
Damn. Who the heck are you?

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,080
Tsunami.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,320
Beat him up.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,960
Bastard.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,880
Saint.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,440
Shin.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,960
You, bastard.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
Your punch is quite heavy.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,800
Let’s do a real fight, Tsunami.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,359
I’ll show a kid like you

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,320
what a real fight looks like.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,760
Jeng, cops are here.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,119
Come on.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,640
We got to go.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,120
Come on. Let’s go.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,160
Stop.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,120
Shin.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Shin.

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Shin.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,920
Shin.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Shin, are you okay?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,160
It hurts but it won’t kill me.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,519
I’ll take you to the hospital.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
No.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,919
Shin, Saint just…

36
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,240
Enough, Chadjen.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
I don’t want to hear it.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Shin.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
Shin, lean on me.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,120
Come on, Shin.

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
Shin.

42
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you sure you don’t need to see a doctor?

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
What happened between you two?

44
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,080
Why are you no longer friends?

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,440
Saint, what did you do to upset Shin?

46
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
Stop asking about it, Chadjen.

47
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,999
I bought this for you.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,720
Eat it to curb your hunger.

49
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
While waiting for Mr. Sung to talk to the police.

50
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,280
Thank you.

51
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,320
Saint. Shin.

52
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Eat it.

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
To curb your hunger.

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,960
While waiting.

55
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
- Can I have more? - Can I have more?

56
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Eat a lot.

57
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,400
Here.

58
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Shin.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
What happened, Shin?

60
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,640
How did you get involved with those men?

61
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
They are dangerous.

62
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
You don’t need to tell me.

63
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,240
But I want you to talk to the police.

64
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
If something happens in the future,

65
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,640
at least, the police can help you.

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,640
No one can help me.

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,520
You should stay out of it.

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Trust me.

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
I know you don’t want to listen to me.

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
But I won’t give up on you.

71
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,720
I’m always here to listen to your problems.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,480
I don’t want you or any students in Class 2

73
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
being taken to the police station again.

74
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,640
You can go home now.

75
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Those thugs arrested by police

76
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,040
have confessed everything.

77
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,320
But they all refused to talk about Dragon Fang.

78
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
I’m not surprised.

79
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
Shin.

80
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,040
How did you know those mafias?

81
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,720
What is the problem between you and them?

82
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,800
I don’t know them.

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,720
I neither want to know them.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,320
You don’t know them?

85
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Then how did you have a fight with them?

86
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,840
They are very dangerous, Shin.

87
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,280
Shin.

88
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,440
Mom.

89
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,520
I told you to stay away from my son.

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Mom, don’t hurt Saint.

91
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
Saint’s mom, please calm down.

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Saint actually saved Shin from the thugs.

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,200
You two are their homeroom teachers, right?

94
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
- Yes. - Yes.

95
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
Mark my words.

96
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,200
From now on,

97
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,160
Don’t let Saint come near my son.

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,119
I don’t think I can do that.

99
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,040
If you can’t,

100
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,521
then you should quit being a teacher.

101
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Mom.

102
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,640
I won’t associate with him again.

103
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
Because I loathe him.

104
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I will loathe him until the day I die.

105
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Let’s take Chingching home, Mom.

106
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,400
Chadjen, you should go home.

107
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,640
Damn it.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,040
We almost got busted.

109
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
Today was full of surprises.

110
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Saint is Tsunami.

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
He must be pretty badass.

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
He put up a good fight with Jeng’s gang.

113
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,320
To be honest, he’s not half as good as I am.

114
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
But I don’t get it.

115
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,320
Why is he a doormat for Shin?

116
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Saint must have done Shin wrong.

117
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
Go find out.

118
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,360
Jeng, what are you doing here?

119
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,120
You haven’t paid off your debt.

120
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,920
We already beat Shin for you.

121
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,920
That’s right.

122
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
And his sister…

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
Shut up, twins.

124
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,080
Ken.

125
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,040
I told you if you wanted me to forgive the debt.

126
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,040
You needed to make Shin shed tears.

127
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,600
What else do you want me to do?

128
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
I don’t want anyone to die.

129
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,520
I don’t want to go to jail.

130
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
I’m not forcing you to kill anyone.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
I just want you to make his life hell.

132
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Dragon Fang gang?

133
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,240
This is a big problem.

134
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
What should we do?

135
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,920
Shin won’t tell us how he knows these men.

136
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,400
I told you.

137
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,839
There are things

138
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,560
that our students don’t want to know.

139
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,480
The more you try to push them to talk,

140
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,159
The more they won’t trust us

141
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,320
and build higher walls.

142
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Do you want us to do nothing?

143
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,800
Didn’t you say these men were dangerous?

144
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
Stop arguing.

145
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,440
There’s not much we can do right now.

146
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,599
Because the fight happened outside the school.

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,360
Mr. Jo is right.

148
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,599
All we can do is monitor our students

149
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,520
so that they won’t cause any trouble.

150
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,719
About their safety outside the school,

151
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,879
I’ll ask the police to keep an eye on the gang

152
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,320
so they can’t hurt our students.

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,800
I get it.

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,599
If we all agree,

155
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
let’s get ready for our classes.

156
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Hey.

157
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,199
Tsunami is here.

158
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,680
Let’s give him a round of applause.

159
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,520
The real Tsunami is a Thep Burapha.

160
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,079
From now on,

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,520
we should call him Big Bro Saint.

162
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
He’s two years older than us.

163
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,600
We should call him Big Bro, right?

164
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,920
He’s freaking cool.

165
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,320
Saint, are you really Tsunami?

166
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
But you never stood up against anyone.

167
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,800
You let Ken push you around.

168
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,280
Say something. Why do you keep quiet?

169
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
Saint.

170
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
Can I ask you something?

171
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Who came up with your nickname ‘Tsunami’?

172
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,120
Why did you let Shin pretend to be you?

173
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,200
What was your relationship with him?

174
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
That’s none of your business.

175
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,720
We just want to tell our classmates

176
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,840
the truth about who you are.

177
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,520
You are fake.

178
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,920
You are an identity theft.

179
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
You are a loser.

180
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,616
Do you want to see a real deal?

181
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,520
Show me. Where is it?

182
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,520
Please don’t start a fight.

183
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,879
But I’m never afraid of Jeng like you are.

184
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,920
Assh*le.

185
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,480
If you think your Tsunami is a real deal,

186
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
you can tell him to duel with me.

187
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
So we will know who the real deal is.

188
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
Saint.

189
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,480
What’s up, Chadjen?

190
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,520
I have a favor to ask you.

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
What is it?

192
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,920
I want you…

193
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,640
to protect Shin from Jeng’s gang.

194
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,400
I’m afraid that he will be in danger.

195
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,880
What happened between Jeng and Shin?

196
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Chadjen, can you tell me

197
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,680
why Shin’s having a problem with Dragon Fang?

198
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,760
Last year, Shin was accused…

199
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,400
that he was the reason

200
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,240
for the death of Jom, Jeng’s brother.

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,080
Jom?

202
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
But…

203
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,960
Shin did that to help me.

204
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,120
I’m the reason why Jeng resents Shin.

205
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,159
I told you to bring a lot of money.

206
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
Why did you bring so little?

207
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
I’m sorry.

208
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,200
What the heck?!

209
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,720
Back then.

210
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,359
Jom was the leader of the gang

211
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,280
dominating Udon Pithak.

212
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,320
Everyone was afraid of his gang.

213
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,440
You are so annoying, dumb*ss.

214
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Who the hell are you?

215
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,360
I’m Chadjen’s friend.

216
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
From now on, stay away from my friend.

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
Then you need to defeat me.

218
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,040
If that’s what you want.

219
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,440
Because Shin saved me from Jom.

220
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,640
He was constantly fighting with Jom.

221
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,199
What do you mean when you said

222
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
you wouldn’t give me money anymore?

223
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,920
From now on,

224
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,320
Jom’s gang no longer dominates this school.

225
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,879
What the hell?

226
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,159
I told you to leave my friend alone.

227
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,760
If you are bullied by him,

228
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,840
you can come to me.

229
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,000
I’ll protect all of you.

230
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,960
Because you all are my friends.

231
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,720
Although Shin was fighting alone,

232
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,520
he was not afraid.

233
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,800
What is your gang called?

234
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Do I need a name for it?

235
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,040
- You! - Watch out!

236
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,680
Shin.

237
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,960
Shin.

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,640
It’s cool to have a name for it.

239
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,240
I want to join your gang.

240
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Me too.

241
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,160
Bastard, you hurt my friend.

242
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,520
Bastard.

243
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Shin.

244
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
Shin, Shin.

245
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
Tsunami.

246
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,240
Let’s call it ‘Tsunami’.

247
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Tsunami, Tsunami, Tsunami.

248
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,440
Since that day,

249
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,999
Shin became the new boss of Udon Pithak

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,440
instead of Jom

251
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,920
No one was bullied by Jom’s gang again.

252
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,800
Tsunami, Tsunami, Tsunami.

253
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,640
But…

254
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,840
Something unexpected happened.

255
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,320
After Jom was defeated by Shin,

256
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,000
Jeng was furious at Jom.

257
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
He’s the same age as you.

258
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,520
He’s a student like you.

259
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,160
But you can’t even defeat him.

260
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,320
You’ll never be able to dominate anyone.

261
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
I sent you to dominate Udon Pithak.

262
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,040
I didn’t send you to be defeated.

263
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,039
I don’t care what you need to do.

264
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,840
But you have to defeat him.

265
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
If you fail,

266
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,239
our business on the campus will be doomed.

267
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,440
I don’t want to fight with Shin anymore.

268
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
Why? Are you afraid of him?

269
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,239
You are the brother of Dragon Fang’s leader.

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,400
Damn it.

271
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,400
All you do is talk about your gang.

272
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,000
I’m sick of it.

273
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,320
I just want us to go back to our old lives.

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,040
The lives that we had to travel around?

275
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,640
The lives that we didn’t have a place to sleep?

276
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,640
Listen to me, Jom.

277
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,440
That kind of life is not working for us.

278
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,000
But at least, I had a brother.

279
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,120
Jeng wanted Jom to dominate Udon Pithak.

280
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,960
If he failed to do so,

281
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Jom would never be able

282
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,000
to take over Dragon Fang.

283
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
That night,

284
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Jom was killed in a road accident.

285
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,560
That’s why Jeng is resenting Shin.

286
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,040
He blames Shin for Jom’s death.

287
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,880
Shin is never afraid of him.

288
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,280
That’s why I’m very worried about him.

289
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,280
All this time,

290
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,480
has Jeng ever done anything to Shin?

291
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,640
No.

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,520
He just recently ended a war with his rival gang.

293
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,920
Why did you know so much about this?

294
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,800
I’m watching Shin’s back.

295
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,840
I want to protect my friend.

296
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
But…

297
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,520
I will no longer be able to watch out for him.

298
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Why?

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
I…

300
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
I’m moving away with my family.

301
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,960
Move away?

302
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
To where?

303
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,920
We’re moving to England.

304
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,240
I want you to protect Shin.

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,120
Can you promise me you will do that?

306
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,800
I’m not sure if he will let me help him.

307
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,440
He hates me.

308
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,080
I don’t know…

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,239
why you two became enemies.

310
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
But I know…

311
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,920
Shin will never hate you.

312
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
How did you know?

313
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,120
Yeah, how did you know, Chadjen?

314
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Shin.

315
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,840
I hate him.

316
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,240
I loathe him.

317
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,600
I will never be his friend again.

318
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Fine.

319
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,320
You can hate me if you want.

320
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,920
But I’ll always love you.

321
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
Though I’m the person you hate the most,

322
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,440
I will never stop being your friend, Shin.

323
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,399
You’re so cool, Saint.

324
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Well said.

325
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,040
What are you happy about, Chadjen?

326
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,520
I’m happy that you have one more friend

327
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,960
who loves you.

328
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,720
Chadjen, thank you

329
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,400
for helping me make up with him.

330
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,560
Make up?

331
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Watch your mouth.

332
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,440
Shin, you are quite sulky.

333
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,320
Sulky?

334
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,000
I’m not sulking.

335
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,840
I hate you.

336
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,800
You should be careful if you keep hating me.

337
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
Careful about what?

338
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,720
My dad said when we hate something so badly,

339
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,720
you usually end up with it.

340
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Oh.

341
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,680
Shin, you should keep hating Saint.

342
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,360
You should hate him a lot.

343
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
Shut up, Saint.

344
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,240
Otherwise, I’ll punch you in the face.

345
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
The three of you.

346
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,736
Miss Jan and Mr. Sung told you

347
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,960
to meet them at the staffroom.

348
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,719
Me too?

349
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,520
Yes. We’ve been looking for you.

350
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,959
Hurry and go to see them.

351
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,760
Are you waiting for me to beg you to do it?

352
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Eve, you’re going too far.

353
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,576
We’ve been looking for them everywhere.

354
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
Why did they need to come up here?

355
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,320
What?

356
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Why do we need to take extra lessons?

357
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,320
Why are we the only ones who need to do it?

358
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,879
What about the other classmates?

359
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Your grades are concerning.

360
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,320
You need extra lessons.

361
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,200
I won’t do it.

362
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:25,320
No.

363
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,520
You need to take extra lessons.

364
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,080
I have a home duty.

365
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
I need to pick up my sister.

366
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,120
I talked to your mom.

367
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,640
She agreed to let you take the extra lessons.

368
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,240
All of you here.

369
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,199
Your parents agreed

370
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,120
to let you take the extra lessons.

371
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,120
So none of you can resist the order.

372
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,640
Do you get it?

373
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
Do you get it?

374
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Yes.

375
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
If you get it, you can leave.

376
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Do you think this plan will work?

377
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,200
At least, we can keep an eye on them.

378
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
Yes.

379
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,799
This is the best way to keep them away

380
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
from Dragon Fang gang.

381
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,320
You want me to teach them?

382
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
How?

383
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,800
They never pay attention in class.

384
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,520
That’s normal for students of Class 2.

385
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,720
I’m sure you can handle them.

386
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,360
After I finish my meeting with the principal,

387
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
I’ll come to help you.

388
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,920
If you want to take a lesson,

389
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,400
you should check…

390
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,559
Shin.

391
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,560
If the teacher is knowledgeable.

392
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,159
I don’t want to talk to you.

393
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
I’m not going to talk to you.

394
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,640
Then why did you call me?

395
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,640
You look drowsy.

396
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,040
Do you want candy?

397
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,680
No.

398
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,319
What of the following choices

399
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,720
relates to the poem?

400
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,000
I said I don’t want it. Don’t you hear me?

401
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,320
Class, pay attention.

402
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,320
I think this is not working.

403
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,200
Let’s stop here.

404
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,600
Are you letting us go home?

405
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,039
No.

406
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
The class is not over.

407
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,320
What?

408
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,040
Everyone, get up and follow me.

409
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,120
I’ll let you play basketball.

410
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,839
You don’t need to teach us.

411
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,440
We know how to play.

412
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,480
Do you want to go back to the classroom?

413
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,840
Saint, Ken, Knot, Nate,

414
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
you’re on the same team.

415
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,960
Shin, Chadjen, First, Tew,

416
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
you’re on the other team.

417
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,720
Isn’t this Thep Burapha vs. Udon Pithak?

418
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Good. It looks fun.

419
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,520
The team with the highest scores

420
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,480
doesn’t need to go back and clean the classroom.

421
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,400
I have one rule.

422
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,240
Don’t cheat.

423
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
You will compete fairly.

424
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,040
Do you get it?

425
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,920
If you get it, let’s start the game.

426
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,920
Very good, bro.

427
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,800
What are you doing?

428
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,520
Go, go.

429
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,880
You’re acting like you’re good at it, pr*ck.

430
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
Block him.

431
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,200
Chadjen.

432
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,120
Show us what you got.

433
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,519
Is this all you got?

434
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,600
Knot.

435
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
What are you doing, Miss Jan?

436
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,160
Why aren’t you teaching them?

437
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,240
I was teaching them.

438
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,639
But they looked drowsy.

439
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
So I took them here to exercise.

440
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,000
They will feel more energetic.

441
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,120
Let’s think of it as a friendly match.

442
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,720
Is it a friendly or rivalry match?

443
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,120
Block him, Ken.

444
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,040
First.

445
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,600
Are you okay?

446
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,120
Does your leg still hurt?

447
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,600
It has never recovered.

448
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,120
It keeps reminding me of what you did to me.

449
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,640
Gotcha, Shin.

450
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,520
Shin.

451
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,639
That’s five points.

452
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,000
Shin, are you okay?

453
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,600
Are you okay?

454
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,119
I’m okay.

455
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,000
Don’t need to be too aggressive, Ken.

456
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,720
Damn you, Ken.

457
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
Do it. Hit me.

458
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,560
Boys.

459
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,800
Stop it.

460
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,600
Stop fighting.

461
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,679
Why are you hating each other so much?

462
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,960
Why do you keep fighting and provoking

463
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,840
each other every day?

464
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,840
Aren’t you tired of it?

465
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
No.

466
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,120
That’s it for today.

467
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,000
You all can go home.

468
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,200
If I see you fighting, I’ll punish all of you.

469
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,840
Go.

470
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
Let’s go.

471
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,240
Stop following me.

472
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,680
Are you alright?

473
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,200
Do you want me to give you a ride?

474
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
No.

475
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,520
I can walk home.

476
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,919
The more you walk,

477
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,600
the more your leg will hurt.

478
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
Let me give you a ride.

479
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,320
What are you doing this for?

480
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,320
I’m worried about you.

481
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you think this can make up

482
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,720
for what you did to me?

483
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,880
I know it can’t.

484
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,040
But I still want to make up for you.

485
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,120
Do you know I’m getting more upset

486
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,040
when you’re doing this?

487
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,800
What do you want me to do?

488
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,600
Tell me.

489
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,439
I’m willing to do anything

490
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,720
if we can go back and be friends again.

491
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,720
Saint.

492
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:44,040
You still can’t see how selfish you are.

493
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,840
You keep asking me to be your friend again.

494
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,400
You never see what you’re doing,

495
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,759
It reminds me of the sh*tty things

496
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,320
you did to me.

497
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Every time I see your face,

498
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,560
I…

499
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,920
It’s too late for you to be nice to me.

500
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,040
You and I, we were over a long time ago.

501
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,039
You and I can never go back to be friends again.

502
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,240
Because of what you did to me,

503
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
no one could forgive it

504
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,640
if their friend did that to them.

505
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,600
You need to go to sleep.

506
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,400
Otherwise, you will wake up late tomorrow.

507
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,920
Shin, you should go to sleep too.

508
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay.

509
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,520
I’ll meet you in your dream.

510
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,440
No, I don’t want to see you.

511
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,840
I want to meet Saint in my dream.

512
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,800
I’m sorry.

513
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
Have you ever seen Saint in your dream?

514
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,120
Yes.

515
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,320
I miss him.

516
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,320
Have you ever seen him in your dream?

517
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
Let’s go to sleep.

518
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,760
I just want to tell you

519
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,640
that I bought cleats for you.

520
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,560
I keep my promise.

521
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,400
Go, Shin. Show them what you got.

522
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,880
Mond.

523
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,400
No.8, pass the ball to Shin.

524
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,440
Shin, run.

525
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,480
Shin, Shin, shoot.

526
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,039
You almost got it.

527
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,520
You can do it.

528
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
Pass it to me.

529
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,879
Go, Shin, go.

530
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,600
Dodge and shoot.

531
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,120
Damn, Shin.

532
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,479
Your goal is amazing.

533
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,520
My friend scored the goal.

534
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,239
My friend scored the goal.

535
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
You look like Ronaldo.

536
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,320
Go and make a hat trick.

537
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,599
My dad put five noodles in the pot for us.

538
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,160
He also gave us the pork bones.

539
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,480
Damn. It looks yummy.

540
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,640
Here.

541
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,600
It’s so damn hot.

542
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,840
How did you eat it?

543
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,600
It’s because you suck.

544
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,560
Shin.

545
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,120
Let’s compete to eat spicy noodles.

546
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Let’s add all the chili powder in the jar.

547
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,360
If I win, you need to buy me

548
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,640
boxing gloves and a mouth guard.

549
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,240
If you win, I…

550
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,400
I’ll buy you new soccer cleats. Okay?

551
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,000
How will you get the money?

552
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,720
I can save up money for it.

553
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Damn, when will you be able to afford it?

554
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,559
Come on.

555
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,200
I promise if you win, I’ll buy you new cleats.

556
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,439
You promise?

557
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,840
Of course, my best friend.

558
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,719
Shall we start?

559
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,920
Bring it on.

560
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,320
Come on.

561
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,080
Saint, you are dead.

562
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,400
Mix it.

563
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,719
Three.

564
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Two.

565
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,679
Damn it, Shin.

566
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,919
You are cheating.

567
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,000
Yes.

568
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,040
I won’t go easy on you.

569
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,960
Go away.

570
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,920
Shin, it’s hot.

571
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,160
You, bastard.

572
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,640
I want to hit you.

573
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,640
I’m getting new cleats.

574
00:44:52,641 --> 00:44:55,160
Saint, give it back.

575
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,240
I’m sorry.

576
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,520
Can we be friends again?

577
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,440
Shin.

578
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,760
Put your bag in the classroom.

579
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, Miss.

580
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,920
Be good, alright?

581
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Do you hear me?

582
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,360
Do you hear me?

583
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,120
Do you hear me?

584
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:57,159
I’m always a good girl. I’ve never been bad.

585
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,200
Bleh!

586
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,800
Bleh!

587
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,239
I’ll come to pick you up after school.

588
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,880
Pay attention in class.

589
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,960
Bye.

590
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,160
Bye. Bleh!

591
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,319
Bleh!

592
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,000
Bye.

593
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,880
Bye.

594
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,160
Bleh!

595
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Hello.

596
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Do you think I don’t see you?

597
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,320
I want to talk to you.

598
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,800
But I don’t.

599
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,640
About yesterday,

600
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,280
I’m sorry.

601
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,800
I was only thinking about myself.

602
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,319
It’s good that you knew it.

603
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,040
So leave me alone.

604
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,680
I’m sorry.

605
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,520
But I don’t think I can do that.

606
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,120
I’d rather be a selfish person.

607
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,440
Don’t you get what I’m telling you?

608
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,040
Shin.

609
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,119
I want to help you deal with Jeng.

610
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,040
I’m not asking for your help.

611
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,320
It’s too big for you to handle it by yourself.

612
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,360
I can’t let anything happen to you.

613
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,120
How dare you say that?

614
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
I’m really worried about you.

615
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,720
Keep it to yourself.

616
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,120
I’ve been living without you for a while.

617
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,000
I can handle my own problems.

618
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,520
I don’t need your help.

619
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
I won’t give up.

620
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,640
Stop pestering me.

621
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,920
I’ll continue to pester you.

622
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,520
I’ll continue to worry about you.

623
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,080
Do you get it?

624
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,440
No.

625
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,640
You don’t get it? Fine.

626
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,639
I’ll keep asking for your forgiveness.

627
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,760
Okay?

628
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,240
No.

629
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,480
Shin, wait up.

630
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,640
Stop following me, jack*ss.

631
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,839
I’ll keep following you

632
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,560
until you stop being mad at me.

633
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,919
I’m not mad at you.

634
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,840
I hate you.

635
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,719
Yes, I know that.

636
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,360
You can hate me. I don’t mind.

637
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Shin.

638
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,559
How was the soccer match last night?

639
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,160
I was screwed.

640
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,520
What about you?

641
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,200
I shouldn’t have bet on that team.

642
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,920
What are you doing here?

643
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,400
I came to see Jeng.

644
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,520
This lot is fine.

645
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,039
This lot is fine.

646
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,200
Who?

647
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,719
Jeng, I can go check for you.

648
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,720
No.

649
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,160
I wonder what an idiot

650
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,080
dares to come to my base.

651
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,080
It’s you, Sung.

652
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,560
Long time no see, buddy.

653
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,120
How long has it been?

654
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,640
Over 10 years?

655
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,640
Since you were expelled from school.

656
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,440
It hurts to hear it.

657
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,400
If I didn’t get expelled,

658
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,240
You and I would have had a big war.

659
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,000
I wouldn’t have a war with you.

660
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,080
I’m a peaceful man.

661
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,480
You know it, don’t you?

662
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,400
What kind of a peaceful man

663
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,120
would step into my den?

664
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,639
I’m going to talk to you

665
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,120
about my students at Siamwit.

666
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,120
Students?

667
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,640
You’re a teacher?

668
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Huh? A guy like you?

669
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,040
Which student?

670
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,160
I hit a lot of them.

671
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
I can’t remember them all.

672
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,200
His name is Shin.

673
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,840
He was recently transferred from Udon Pithak.

674
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,920
Are you his teacher?

675
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,840
Yes.

676
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,120
From now on, stay away from my students.

677
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,240
What if I don’t do that?

678
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,720
I’ll bring you down.

679
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,200
You? Bring me down?

680
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,320
Look around, jack*ss.

681
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,320
I have many ways to bring you down

682
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,640
without using force.

683
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
Come on, my dear friend.

684
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,640
Don’t forget that I also know your secret.

685
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
16 years ago,

686
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,560
you killed a man.

687
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,520
The never-ending feud

688
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,200
between Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak,

689
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,920
it started because of you.

690
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,640
Sung, are you sure Jeng won’t hurt you?

691
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,000
It must be Sung.

692
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,319
If he wants to fight me, I’m not afraid.

693
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,359
I heard that

694
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,280
Shin was behind someone’s death.

695
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,600
If we’re with him, we might get into trouble.

696
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,400
If we don’t expel Shin,

697
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,199
the parents will take action against the school.

698
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,519
This kid is like a ticking bomb.

699
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,400
He can get into trouble at any time.
