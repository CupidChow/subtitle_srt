Characters, actions, locations, occupations, and events in this series

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,710
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,280
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,710
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,370
Hey, how could you sell my bike?

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,600
You owe me the money,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,936
of course, I have the right to sell it.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,700
I really want to take revenge on Jeng.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,860
I have an offer for you.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,930
In exchange, we will stop bothering Shin.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,410
Since using a gentle approach didn't work,

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,349
we have to use a stricter one now.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,790
This is definitely not good.

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,200
The kids probably won’t accept it.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,200
Are we really skipping class?

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,640
The principal is being unfair.

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,020
Who would want to study?

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,490
He is the one who hurt you.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,340
Are you still going to keep

20
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,640
someone like this as a friend?

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,640
I really shouldn’t be your friend.

22
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,650
Saint.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,460
Come here.

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,500
Eat your dinner.

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I made dinner for you.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,500
Sit down.

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,790
Hey.

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,570
Why do you look so down?

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,400
Did someone scold you?

30
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,810
Shin?

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,340
I thought you two had reconciled.

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,760
How did you know that it was Shin?

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,180
There’s only one person

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,680
who can make you look so down.

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,750
Am I right?

36
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,540
What did you do?

37
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,410
Shin misunderstands me.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,910
If he misunderstands you,

39
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,680
you only have to correct it.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,770
Friends always find a way to reconcile

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,340
when they are mad at each other.

42
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,870
They always forgive each other.

43
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Really?

44
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,090
Do you really believe that?

45
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,810
Yes.

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,340
That’s why I’m saying so.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,090
Tomorrow,

48
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,230
you just need to explain to Shin.

49
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,090
You are stiff-lipped.

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,560
You are presumptuous.

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,400
In the end, the problems are left unsolved.

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,260
PUNISHMENT

53
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,090
Saint.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Chadjen, don’t call him.

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,360
You are mad at him again?

56
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,380
I’m not mad at him.

57
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,680
I hate him.

58
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,960
Saint.

59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,370
Did you do something to upset Shin?

60
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Yes.

61
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,450
It was my fault.

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,210
Your love-hate relationship

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,020
is not good for anyone

64
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,890
It’s tiring for people around you.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
What?

66
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,440
I heard that all students in Class 2

67
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,180
skipped class yesterday.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
Is it true?

69
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,010
Why didn’t you tell me?

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,820
Principal, the kids…

71
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,100
Did Cable also skip class?

72
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,190
Yes.

73
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,920
All of them skipped class.

74
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,080
What happened?

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,230
Cable has never acted like this.

76
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,860
Principal, can I be honest with you?

77
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,530
Yes.

78
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,810
I think you were the reason.

79
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,000
What do you mean?

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:41,300
I think they were upset about your punishment.

81
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,700
So they skipped class to express their objection.

82
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,700
These brats.

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,030
How dare they go against her order like this?

84
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,050
I guess my punishment wasn’t harsh enough.

85
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,960
That’s why they dared to do that.

86
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,570
That’s right.

87
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,980
You need to give them a harsher punishment.

88
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,450
So they will learn their lesson.

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,130
Please don’t give them another punishment.

90
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,240
I think it’ll make them more rebellious.

91
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,100
If we go soft on them and

92
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,100
don’t give them a harsh punishment,

93
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,870
the good kids will be influenced

94
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,630
by the troubled kids.

95
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,960
Principal, I know you’re worried about Cable.

96
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,830
If you give them another punishment,

97
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,490
The kids Of Class 2, including Cable,

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
will shut us out even more.

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,420
Mr.Pokpong, do you have a better idea?

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Yes.

101
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,990
I think it’s better to let their homeroom teachers

102
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,500
make a call on the punishment.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,440
They know these kids better than us.

104
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,420
Since we are their homeroom teachers,

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,910
Please give us a chance to solve the problem.

106
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,830
Sure.

107
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,590
Are you sure that they will learn the lesson?

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
I don’t want to see things get worse

109
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,750
or other kids get affected by it.

110
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,190
If you fail, I’ll handle it myself.

111
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,110
- Yes.
- Yes, Principal.

112
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,690
All of you skipped class yesterday.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,210
The principal decided not to punish you for it.

114
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,720
But Mr. Sung and I have a punishment for you.

115
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,330
How will you punish us?

116
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,250
Don’t tell me that you will force us

117
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,930
to attend an extra class as a punishment.

118
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,670
If you’re going to do that,

119
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,330
I’d rather do community work.

120
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,610
Huh?

121
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,760
No, that’s too tiring.

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,250
I guess you will be tired.

123
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,040
Are you…

124
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,150
Yes, all of you will work together

125
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,400
to clean the school this evening.

126
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,560
You can’t skip class like this again.

127
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,070
I won’t be kind to you like this time.

128
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,330
Do you get it?

129
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,080
Do you get it?

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,080
Yes.

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,620
Get ready for your next class.

132
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Knot.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Please come to see me at lunch break.

134
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Knot.

135
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,830
Why did you ask me to see you?

136
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,970
I noticed that Ken and Nate are absent today.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,300
Do you know where they are?

138
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,800
I don’t know.

139
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,880
Knot, I know you care about your friends.

140
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
If you really care about them,

141
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,450
I want you to tell them to come to school.

142
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,810
If they continue to miss school,

143
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,260
they may not be able to graduate.

144
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,000
I’m worried about them.

145
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,040
I’m glad to see

146
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
that your grades are getting better.

147
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,050
Keep up the good work.

148
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,460
It’s just a fluke.

149
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,390
I just guessed the answers in the exam.

150
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,390
Don’t get in my way.

151
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,100
What are you doing?

152
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,530
Even if I hate you,

153
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,870
you must not avoid me.

154
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,040
These two are fighting again?

155
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes, Miss Jan.

156
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,570
I don’t know how to help them.

157
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,920
Mr. Sung and Miss Jan,

158
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,570
can you help me on this?

159
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,840
Mr. Sung, do you have any good ideas?

160
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,650
What do men do when they want to reconcile?

161
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,820
I think I have the right plan for them.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,860
What plan?

163
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,510
Come on.

164
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Open it.

165
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,870
You two will clean this room.

166
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,060
Make sure that it’s clean and has no dust left.

167
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,240
It’s so dusty, Mr. Sung.

168
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,960
There’s no way we can clean it in one day.

169
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,570
That’s why you will work together.

170
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,750
Wait.

171
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,010
What?

172
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,450
Before you start to clean the room,

173
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,710
You need to put the desks, chairs,

174
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,330
and other stuff somewhere else.

175
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,670
Where you do want us to put them?

176
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,940
I have no idea.

177
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,520
Put them on the rooftop.

178
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Huh?

179
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,420
Are you kidding us?

180
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,290
No.

181
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
If you don’t finish it,

182
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,760
you can’t go home.

183
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,580
If you’re ready, start working.

184
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Don’t waste more time.

185
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,410
You can’t go home unless you finish it.

186
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,570
How long are you going to keep avoiding me?

187
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,010
We aren’t friends anymore, are we?

188
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,890
Idiot.

189
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,890
You’re such an idiot.

190
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Are you tired?

191
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,720
Of course.

192
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,800
Can’t you see?

193
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,090
Do you know why I assign this task to you two?

194
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,050
If you want to know why,

195
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,480
you should get back to work.

196
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,530
Are you really not going to tell us

197
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,850
what we did wrong?

198
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,150
Come on. You’ll figure it out.

199
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,900
Come on.

200
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,060
After finishing cleaning, you still have to study?

201
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,780
I want to get a full score on the exam.

202
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,220
You can get a full score even when you don’t study.

203
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,250
But for me, no matter how hard I study,

204
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,390
I’ll never get a full score.

205
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,210
Hard work never betrays.

206
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,580
But it betrays me.

207
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,490
Peeta, do you think

208
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,490
we will go to the same college?

209
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,550
If you work hard and get high scores,

210
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,500
you may get into the same college as me.

211
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Can you just get lower scores?

212
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,990
So I will have a chance

213
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,850
to get into the same college as you.

214
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,290
Are you kidding me?

215
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,510
I really want to go to

216
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,510
the same college as you, Peeta.

217
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Me too.

218
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,680
Eve, I have to go to a cram school.

219
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,560
I got to go. Bye.

220
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,400
You want to go to the same college as Peeta.

221
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,740
Is it because you have a crush on her?

222
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,660
I like her as a friend.

223
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,720
Nothing more.

224
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,570
Are you sure?

225
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Yes.

226
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,230
I don’t have that kind of feeling for my best friend.

227
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,440
It’s not wrong

228
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,550
to have a crush on your best friend, right?

229
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,620
No, it’s not.

230
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
But I just don’t have a crush on her.

231
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,060
So…

232
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,950
What is your ideal type?

233
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,600
Can you tell me?

234
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,790
I don’t have an ideal type.

235
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,530
But I had a crush on someone

236
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,690
when I was young.

237
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,470
Who was it?

238
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,700
Is that person in this school?

239
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,710
Yes.

240
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,770
Who was it?

241
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,770
Do I know her?

242
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,900
You know her very well.

243
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,170
Huh? I know her?

244
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,440
Who was it?

245
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,500
Don’t tell me that it was Tangmay.

246
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,920
Are you crazy?

247
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,160
I never met Tangmay when we were young.

248
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,640
You met her when you were young?

249
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,670
Who was it?

250
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,490
You met her when you were young.

251
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,180
If it was not Tangmay,

252
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,870
was it me?

253
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,090
Yes.

254
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Huh?

255
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,700
Me?

256
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,700
You didn’t know me.

257
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,460
But I knew you.

258
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,950
Huh?

259
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,770
How?

260
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,810
I saw you on television.

261
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,000
At first, I didn’t know that you were her.

262
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,000
I looked up on the internet.

263
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,960
I realized that the kid actress I liked

264
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
when I was young was you.

265
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,950
I was surprised.

266
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,530
You watched my work?

267
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,270
Yes.

268
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,090
You were very cute when you were young.

269
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I never thought you would grow up to be like this.

270
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,240
Hey.

271
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,430
Are you saying I’m not as cute

272
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,330
as I was when I was young.

273
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,320
Yes, you are too pretty.

274
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I liked you when you looked cute.

275
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,760
I watched your drama when I was young.

276
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,570
I loved it when you played an orphan.

277
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,290
You looked so pitiful.

278
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,520
But when you got older,

279
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,610
you only played pretty girl characters.

280
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,790
Your acting is good.

281
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,200
I think you should choose a role

282
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,760
that lets you show your acting skills.

283
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,210
Maybe you failed those auditions

284
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,770
because you chose to cast for the wrong role.

285
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,920
Good job.

286
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,090
Mr.Sung, I can’t do it anymore.

287
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
What?

288
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,190
The job is not that hard for strong guys like you.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let’s go clean the storage room.

290
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I don’t get it.

291
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,346
Mr. Sung gave unreasonable punishment

292
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,370
to those two.

293
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,920
So they can talk things out?

294
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,856
Why does it have to be that complicated?

295
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
I don’t get it when he told them

296
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,280
to carry the desks to the rooftop.

297
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,350
Mr. Sung told me it would help them

298
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,100
start questioning things.

299
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,330
Can I ask you something?

300
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,400
After we clean the room, do we need

302
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,110
to put these desks and chairs back?

303
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Yes.

304
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,490
Why are you doing this to us?

305
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,570
If you can’t figure it out,

306
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,570
why don’t you brainstorm?

307
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,250
Two heads are better than one.

308
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,380
Is this how men usually solve their problems?

309
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,940
Mr.Sung probably thinks

310
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,250
if they are tired from moving the desks,

311
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,220
they may forget about their feud.

312
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,890
Going through a hardship together

313
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,670
may help them to open up to each other.

314
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,080
But if he wanted to tire them out,

315
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,700
he could order them to run laps.

316
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,952
That may be too easy for them.

317
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,054
For some relationships,

318
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,440
they need to go through hardship

319
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,327
to see the value of what they have.

320
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:35,120
I never thought

321
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,970
you would have this side in you, Mr. Pokpong.

322
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,501
Can I note it down?

323
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,730
Shin.

324
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,076
You and Saint are best friends, aren’t you?

325
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,985
It’s not good to be on bad terms.

326
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,440
I can tell that you two are very close.

327
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,074
You are so close that you can die for each other.

328
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:18,021
I don’t have a close friend

329
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:19,432
who always walks out on me.

330
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,890
Saint always walks out on me

331
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,705
when we go through a big problem.

332
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:33,340
He did that when my leg was broken.

333
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,792
He was the one who broke it.

334
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,181
But he chose to avoid me.

335
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,850
He left me alone.

336
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,370
So you weren’t mad at him

337
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
because he broke your leg?

338
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,618
I was never mad at him about that.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,338
I was mad

340
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,280
that he walked out on me.

341
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,174
I was his friend.

342
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,585
Hey, guys.

343
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,040
Are you going to school tomorrow?

344
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,309
Why will I go?

345
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:08,260
You have to submit your homework.

346
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:10,276
I already finished the homework for you.

347
00:24:10,654 --> 00:24:12,429
You just need to go to school.

348
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,163
No, I don’t want to go.

349
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,690
But Miss Jan said

350
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,312
if you continue to miss school,

351
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,803
you will not be able to graduate.

352
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,116
You may not advance to Grade 12.

353
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,290
Knot, why are you taking school seriously?

354
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:30,138
Right. You have been acting strange lately.

355
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:32,130
Why did you start to work hard at school?

356
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,560
What the hell is going on with you?

357
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:37,956
I’m just worried about my future.

358
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,850
I’m also worried about you two.

359
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,327
What would you do if you fail to graduate?

360
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:46,472
Nothing.

361
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,476
I don’t give a damn care if I’ll graduate or not.

362
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:52,269
Aren’t you thinking about your future?

363
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,661
Knot, you’ve changed a lot.

364
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,810
What the hell happened to you?

365
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,010
Didn’t you say you would never leave us?

366
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,327
I’m not leaving you.

367
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,694
I’m saying this because I’m worried about you.

368
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,312
I don’t want to see my best friends

369
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,589
keep living a shady life.

370
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,941
What did you say?

371
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,010
Ken, don’t you see

372
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,352
what kind of life Jeng is living?

373
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,352
Do you want to end up like him?

374
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,636
I won’t do it.

375
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,574
I won’t do it.

376
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,090
What we are doing is already too much.

377
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:52,872
I want to have a good life and be by your side.

378
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,760
It’s not too late to get out.

379
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,938
Don’t live that kind of life.

380
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,480
What’s wrong with my life?

381
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,087
Ken.

382
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,029
It’s not too late to start a new life.

383
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,981
Jeng doesn’t care that much about you.

384
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:17,869
You know it, don’t you?

385
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,025
This is my life.

386
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,829
It’s none of your f*cking business.

387
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,916
Jackass.

388
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:24,910
Ken, calm down.

389
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:27,830
How dare you lecture me, punk?

390
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,180
What the hell is wrong with you?

391
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,516
Why do you keep picking a fight with us?

392
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:39,040
I said this because I love you.

393
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,723
The three of us, we never fought.

394
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,940
We never f*cking left anyone behind.

395
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,540
I promised that I would never leave you.

396
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,778
I’m trying to keep that f*cking promise.

397
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,960
I warned you.

398
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:08,570
Because I don’t want to lose you.

399
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,192
If you refuse to listen to me,

400
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,810
From now on,

401
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,389
You and I,

402
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,370
we are no longer friends.

403
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,134
Damn it.

404
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,956
How long are you going to keep silent?

405
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,596
I’m running out of ideas to help you reconcile.

406
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,705
So everything that you did

407
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,560
is to help us reconcile?

408
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,490
Yes.

409
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,665
Don’t you think your method is a bit strange?

410
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,247
Yes, it is.

411
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,410
I know that you two have a unique relationship.

412
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,498
So I need to use a unique way to deal with you.

413
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,941
If you continue to act like this,

414
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,560
I’ll keep you here.

415
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,952
Wait.

416
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,574
Is he locking the door?

417
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,058
Yes.

418
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:15,607
Shit. Really?

419
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:21,309
Damn it.

420
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,934
Is he crazy?

421
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,894
It’s already dark.

422
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:31,090
Call your friend to open the door.

423
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,832
I left my phone in my bag.

424
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:41,149
I don’t have my phone with me.

425
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,523
Mr. Sung.

426
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:45,556
Hey.

427
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,923
Hey.

428
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,247
Open the door.

429
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,767
Why are you locking us out here?

430
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:50,705
Mr. Sung.

431
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,298
Did he lose his mind?

432
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,420
What the hell is wrong with Mr.Sung?

433
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,352
You don’t carry your phone

434
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,316
but you have cigarettes?

435
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,589
It’s none of your business.

436
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,745
Do you why

437
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:34,327
I voluntarily stopped being your friend?

438
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,570
Because you are a coward.

439
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,374
You ran away from problems.

440
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,232
No, I didn’t.

441
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,269
Bullshit.

442
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,309
I did that

443
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,967
because I didn’t want you to leave this school.

444
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,654
I did that.

445
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,452
Because I didn’t want you to have a problem

446
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,792
with your mom because of me.

447
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:56,596
I’m sorry, Shin.

448
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,989
It was my fault that day.

449
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,330
I followed the stupid rule of Tsunami gang.

450
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,476
I didn’t mean to break your leg.

451
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,178
Can you stop blabbing?

452
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,101
I know…

453
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,280
that it was an accident.

454
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,029
I wasn’t mad that you broke my leg.

455
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,629
I was mad that you left me, jackass.

456
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,792
You left me, Saint.

457
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,705
Now, you chose to leave me again.

458
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,563
Stop saying that you did it for me.

459
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:39,672
Stop apologizing to me, assh*le.

460
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,687
Your apology means nothing.

461
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,563
Because you never understand anything.

462
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
You’re right.

463
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,058
I’m a jerk and a coward like you said.

464
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,490
I’m a horrible person.

465
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,545
So you shouldn’t have a friend like me.

466
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,203
It’s good that you hate me.

467
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,749
I don’t want to ruin your life again.

468
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:48,189
I want to see you play soccer again.

469
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,694
Even if it means

470
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,203
that I can no longer be by your side.

471
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,560
I’ll do it.

472
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:05,869
Because that is your happiness.

473
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,930
If you are not by my side,

474
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,018
how could I be happy, jackass?

475
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:16,236
Huh?

476
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,861
Yes, you can.

477
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,701
You have your mom,

478
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,472
Chingching,

479
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,236
and Chadjen.

480
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,790
Saint.

481
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,341
Are you really going to leave me?

482
00:34:25,127 --> 00:34:26,501
Saint.

483
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Saint.

484
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,029
Saint.

485
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,410
Wake up.

486
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:41,934
Saint.

487
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:42,956
Saint.

488
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,996
Mr. Sung.

489
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,210
Mr. Sung.

490
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,494
Saint, wake up.

491
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:51,520
Hey.

492
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:52,749
Saint.

493
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,086
Wake up.

494
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,098
Saint.

495
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Saint.

496
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,138
Saint.

497
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,760
Hey.

498
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,592
Saint, wake up.

499
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:03,236
Saint!

500
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,414
Anyone, help us.

501
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,607
Mr. Sung.

502
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,614
Mr. Sung.

503
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,272
Saint.

504
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:15,672
Saint.

505
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:16,240
Saint.

506
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:17,578
Damn it, Saint.

507
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:18,843
Saint.

508
00:35:18,872 --> 00:35:20,290
Wake up.

509
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,680
Saint.

510
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,120
Saint.

511
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,120
Why are you yelling?

512
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,545
Are you okay?

513
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:29,861
Did you get hurt?

514
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,414
Do you have any strange symptoms?

515
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,021
Are you dizzy?

516
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,309
Do you feel disoriented?

517
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,523
Did you forget that I’m made of steel?

518
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:42,683
This can’t do anything to me.

519
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,930
Are you really okay?

520
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,709
Now, I start to feel the pain.

521
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,203
Where?

522
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,861
I don’t want to say it. It’ll look like a sitcom.

523
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:57,585
Tell me where you are hurt.

524
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,580
My arm hurts because you’re sitting on it.

525
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,603
We are about to have a sweet moment

526
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:06,600
but you turn it into a sitcom.

527
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,225
What sitcom? I’m worried about you.

528
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,338
Damn. It does really hurt.

529
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,418
Didn’t you say you are made of steel?

530
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,734
Are we good?

531
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
I guess.

532
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,910
Come on.

533
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,752
Shin, easy. It hurts.

534
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,618
Don’t be a baby.

535
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,770
I never thought…

536
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,723
that it would be this easy…

537
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,243
for us to reconcile.

538
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,610
I thought we would stop being friends.

539
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,545
It’s because you are an idiot.

540
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,174
Idiot.

541
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,530
Shin.

542
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,025
What?

543
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,029
I’m sorry.

544
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,843
You said it again.

545
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,316
You are so annoying.

546
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,221
I’m sorry

547
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
that I only saw things from my perspective

548
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,850
and forgot about your feelings.

549
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,109
I forgot…

550
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,589
when my friends had a hard time,

551
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,578
The best thing I could do,

552
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,010
It was to be there for you.

553
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,574
Do you remember

554
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,229
when my mom broke up with Chingching’s dad?

555
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,349
You came to sleep over at my place

556
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,498
almost every day.

557
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,450
Yes.

558
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,636
Saint.

559
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,010
Can I ask you something?

560
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,600
Why are you sleeping over at my house?

561
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:35,600
How is your mom?

562
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,290
The same.

563
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,814
She’s a bit sad.

564
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,556
She just went through a divorce.

565
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,585
Do you expect her to be cheerful?

566
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,425
What about Chingching?

567
00:38:56,283 --> 00:38:57,396
Is she sad?

568
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,483
A little.

569
00:39:01,578 --> 00:39:03,570
She wasn’t close to her dad.

570
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,196
She mostly spends time with me and you.

571
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,403
It’s going to be okay.

572
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,898
Things will get better.

573
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You always say that.

574
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,792
Trust me.

575
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,658
Good night.

576
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,672
I’m going to sleep.

577
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:47,720
I told you to go back to sleep at your house.

578
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,069
Why are you sleeping at my house?

579
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:52,698
I like this house.

580
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Why?

581
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,087
Because my friend lives here.

582
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,967
You’re talking nonsense.

583
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,021
You don’t want to be home alone, right?

584
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:19,396
You are lonely, aren’t you?

585
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Damn it.

586
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,240
Do you know when you came to my house,

587
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:52,894
you brighten up my home?

588
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,745
The atmosphere should have been dull

589
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,014
because my mom just got a divorce.

590
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
When you were with us,

591
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,596
it made me, my mom, and Chingching happy.

592
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:13,192
When you broke my leg and disappeared,

593
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,494
it really hurt me.

594
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,898
I was never mad at you over this small thing.

595
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,825
We had many good memories together.

596
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,010
We have so many good memories that

597
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,010
I could have forgiven you for breaking my leg.

598
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,745
But you disappeared and left me.

599
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,530
I couldn’t forgive you that.

600
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,654
You kept blaming yourself

601
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:05,403
for ruining my dream and future.

602
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,800
As friends, it’s okay for us to be apart.

603
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,087
But you shouldn’t have left your friend.

604
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,010
When it’s other people’s problem,

605
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,643
I’m good at solving it.

606
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,930
But when it comes to my own problem,

607
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,472
I’m acting like an idiot.

608
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,163
I always do stupid things.

609
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,098
From now on, if it’s about me,

610
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:00,600
You need to ask me first.

611
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,290
Don’t think or make a decision by yourself.

612
00:43:04,312 --> 00:43:05,840
You’re an idiot.

613
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:07,025
Do you get it?

614
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,247
Yes, I promise.

615
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Fine.

616
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,458
I’ll try not to be mad at you

617
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:18,101
when you’re acting like an idiot.

618
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,138
Okay?

619
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:21,072
Okay.

620
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:33,090
Shin, did you just call me an idiot?

621
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,832
Damn, you’re really an idiot.

622
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,120
You, puppy face.

623
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:38,814
Idiot.

624
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,436
Why are you smiling?

625
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,141
You miss my puppy face, don’t you?

626
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,140
Stop talking nonsense.

627
00:43:47,163 --> 00:43:49,140
I know you miss me.

628
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:52,065
Just drop your act.

629
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:53,970
Why are you smiling?

630
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,301
Let me kick your ass.

631
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:56,472
Shit.

632
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,549
You want to try me?

633
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,567
Bring it on.

634
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,770
Saint.

635
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,807
Saint, let me down.

636
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:06,974
Stop it.

637
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:07,810
I won’t.

638
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,887
Saint.

639
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,181
Let me go.

640
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,501
Saint.

641
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:13,810
- Shin, my bestie.
- Let me go.

642
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:14,825
Shin, my bestie.

643
00:44:17,832 --> 00:44:18,832
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

644
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:05,738
Thank you.

645
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,505
Sure.

646
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Idiot.

647
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,138
I so damn miss you.

648
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,498
Me, too.

649
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,647
Why are you patting my head?

650
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,640
I can’t believe

651
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,840
that your strange plan actually works.

652
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,992
I can’t believe it either.

653
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,098
I thought you are an expert on this.

654
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,570
Not at all.

655
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,080
I’m barely mad at my friend.

656
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:50,530
You must have a lot of friends.

657
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,396
Because you are kind

658
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:55,163
and barely mad at your friends.

659
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,436
No, Chadjen.

660
00:45:57,498 --> 00:45:59,160
I barely have any friends.

661
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,698
I’m not surprised.

662
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,418
So you use a random plan to help them

663
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:08,923
but it turns out to work well.

664
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,010
Don’t call it random.

665
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,381
Let’s call it an improvisation.

666
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,240
I believe that they will find a way to reconcile.

667
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:25,520
I just speed up the process.

668
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:29,796
How did you know that?

669
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,420
This is the power of friendship.

670
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,625
Friendship always wins over hatred.

671
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,836
Even though there are things

672
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:40,421
we don’t like about our friends,

673
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,843
The power of friendship will help us

674
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,465
overlook their weak points.

675
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,105
Having friends is really good.

676
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,690
I will miss friends like Saint and Shin.

677
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,509
When will you leave?

678
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,156
Soon.

679
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,840
My time here is running out.

680
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,672
Saint.

681
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,167
Huh?

682
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,512
I have something to tell you.

683
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,990
Yes.

684
00:47:38,341 --> 00:47:39,341
What is it?

685
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,261
You know what?

686
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,516
Besides soccer,

687
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,094
you are the only one that I care about.

688
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:03,694
For me,

689
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,407
you are the only one I care about.

690
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,050
Saint.

691
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:32,443
I’m so lucky to have you as my friend.

692
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:44,440
Why are you telling me now?

693
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,647
I’m driving.

694
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:48,349
We could have ended up having an accident.

695
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,620
What are you looking at?

696
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,650
During the time you disappeared from my life,

697
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:04,916
what were you doing?

698
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,916
It’s okay if you have your favorite student.

699
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:12,436
But if it’s too obvious like this, it’s not okay.

700
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,807
Did Cable contact you?

701
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:15,992
What happened?

702
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,436
Jeng is waiting to beat you and Saint.

703
00:50:18,472 --> 00:50:19,309
Do you know where Saint is?

704
00:50:19,338 --> 00:50:20,814
Shit, Saint fooled me.

705
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:21,745
Wait, Shin.

706
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:22,774
Go.

707
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,647
Let my friend go.

708
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Assh*le.

709
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:28,570
Saint.
