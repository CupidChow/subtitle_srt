They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,190
This on-and-off relationship

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,270
What a bothersome.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,740
Is really not good.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,300
What do men do when they want to reconcile?

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,670
Why are you doing this to us?

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,790
If you can’t figure it out,

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,930
why don’t you brainstorm?

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,350
Are we good?

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I guess.

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,370
I never thought that it would be this easy

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,780
for us to reconcile.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
Shin, my bestie.

17
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:41,160
JUST ONE HUG.

18
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,590
See you then.

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,050
Saint.

20
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,790
I want to ask you something.

21
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,420
What’s that?

22
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,220
While you were outta my life,

23
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,540
what’ve you been up to?

24
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,450
Sigh.

25
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,570
I dropped out of school

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,290
‘cause I couldn’t face you.

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,580
After that, I just sat around at home,

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,580
doing nothing.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Same thing over and over.

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,030
But after a while,

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,550
I started feeling like...

32
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,220
my life without you

33
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,160
didn’t have any purpose.

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,600
I’m serious.

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,010
I kept thinking about you every damn day.

36
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,850
And in the end, I couldn’t take it anymore.

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,210
I decided to come find you at your place.

38
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,600
After everything you did to Shin,

39
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,140
you’ve still got the nerve to meet him?

40
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,970
I’m sorry, aunty.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,550
Keep your apology to yourself.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,610
What kind of friend ruins their friend’s future?

43
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:48,190
You knew soccer meant everything to him,

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
and you still did it.

45
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,750
You killed my son while he was still alive.

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,890
I’ll never let you hurt him again.

47
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Aunty...

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,480
I’m really sorry.

49
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,680
But please, can I see Shin?

50
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,260
Just for a moment, that’s all I’m asking.

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,240
If you truly feel guilty,

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,350
then don’t let Shin see you again.

53
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,530
Stay out of my son’s life for good.

54
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,310
After that,

55
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,280
I did what your mom told me to do.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,140
But deep down, I kept hoping

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
I’d run into you somewhere.

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,250
That’s why I kept stopping by places

59
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,500
you liked to go,

60
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,780
but I never saw you.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,370
I was doing fine with it all…

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,670
until I ran into you at school this semester.

63
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,720
Sigh. I get it.

64
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,720
I must be irresistible, huh?

65
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,076
What the hell kind of joke is that?

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,720
Ugh, you’re making my skin crawl.

67
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,720
I can’t with you right now—I’m outta here.

68
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,670
Hey, Saint. I have to tell you something.

69
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
What now?

70
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,200
For now,

71
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,636
you and I have to keep being friends

72
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,540
on the down-low, alright?

73
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,480
Don’t let my mom find out.

74
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,520
Got it. What about Chingching, though?

75
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,970
You can tell my little sis.

76
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,080
She’d probably be happy about it.

77
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,790
As for my mom, I’ll talk to her slowly.

78
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,120
Let me handle it.

79
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,030
Um. Thanks, man.

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,170
Yeah, buy me lunch to make it up to me.

81
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,170
Sure. Now get inside already.

82
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah, drive safe, okay? See ya.

83
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
I’ll wave you off.

84
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,520
See you.

85
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,600
See you.

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,330
Go on.

87
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,600
Get inside already.

88
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,600
A Thai language quiz competition?

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,330
That’s right.

90
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,920
I’d like you to select two students

91
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,400
from Class 2 with strong Thai language skills

92
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,820
to represent the school

93
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,180
in the district-level competition.

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,590
Understood, sir.

95
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,740
Oh, and the principal also emphasized that

96
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,210
this year, we must bring back some prizes,

97
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,840
as part of the plan to make Class 2

98
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,210
the model classroom.

99
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,710
I understand.

100
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,220
I’m counting on you.

101
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,570
Anything happened? You can tell me.

102
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,210
Can you bring Ken and Nate back?

103
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,800
I’ve tried to convince them

104
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,140
but they don’t listen to me at all.

105
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,350
Thanks for telling me this, Knot.

106
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,920
I’ll find ways to bring them back.

107
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,590
Don’t worry.

108
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,370
If you can bring them back,

109
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,780
I promise you

110
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,750
I’ll make them study hard.

111
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,910
Okay. We’ll work together then.

112
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,910
Thank you, sir.

113
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
Alright.

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,630
Sigh.

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Looks like today’s going to be full of stuff.

116
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,850
Mr. Sung, I need your help.

117
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,310
Sit here first.

118
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,490
What do you want?

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,160
I’d like to ask you about

120
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,350
submitting my portfolio for university.

121
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,870
I’m not sure if my portfolio is good enough.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
From what I can see,

123
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,020
your grades are great,

124
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,690
and...

125
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,930
your extracurriculars look good too.

126
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,570
I think you could add

127
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,380
some academic competitions to it as well,

128
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,890
since universities like to see

129
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,840
students with academic achievements

130
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,870
in their portfolios.

131
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,590
If there are any academic competitions

132
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,210
open for registration,

133
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,980
could you let me know, please?

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,770
I’d really like to participate.

135
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,400
Sure. What subjects are you interested in?

136
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,710
Any subject is fine,

137
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,130
as long as I can compete.

138
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,490
Peeta,

139
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,390
I don’t think you need to put

140
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,040
that much pressure on yourself.

141
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,170
There’s still time,

142
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,200
and your grades are already good.

143
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
But the program that

144
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,600
my mom wants me to get into

145
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,720
requires really high scores,

146
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,850
and the achievements have to stand out too.

147
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,740
I’m not sure

148
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,340
if it’s going to be harder in the future,

149
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,860
and if I don’t try now,

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,180
my mom says I might not get in.

151
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,590
Hmm, okay.

152
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,860
How about this?

153
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,560
If you’re worried,

154
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,540
I can help you boost your English score.

155
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,936
I’ll give you some practice tests

156
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
and summaries I’ve created,

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,020
so you’ll get a better understanding

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
of the subject.

159
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,160
Thank you, Mr. Sung.

160
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,260
Shin, stay still, can’t you?

161
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,320
I’m working on a masterpiece.

162
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,760
Class.

163
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,950
Hello.

164
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,410
Hello, everyone.

165
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,620
Before we start today,

166
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,060
I have something to tell you.

167
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
Now, we’re looking for 2 representatives

168
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,120
to compete in a Thai quiz competition

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,220
at a district level.

170
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,470
I am to select the most suitable ones.

171
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,780
The first representative is Cable.

172
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,400
The second one is Eve.

173
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,070
What?

174
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,970
Me? Why me, sir?

175
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,730
Eve, you’re really talented.

176
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,220
You’ve topped the scores this semester.

177
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,980
But it should’ve been Peeta, Miss Jan.

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,220
I’ve thought it through.

179
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,140
For Thai Language, you’re the best fit.

180
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,080
As for Peeta, don’t worry.

181
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,120
There are still many other competitions

182
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,120
the school will send students to.

183
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,080
I’ll let you know later.

184
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,416
Who would’ve thought someone like me

185
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,476
would get picked as a representative?

186
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,020
It’s totally unbelievable, right?

187
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,860
Hmm, congrats.

188
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,306
So, I guess we need to study

189
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,140
to get ready for the competition, huh?

190
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,780
Just study. You got chosen to compete.

191
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,840
I’ll just go have fun and make it legendary.

192
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,560
Hey, can you be a bit more serious?

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,896
If you’re not going to take it seriously,

194
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,126
why bother being the representative?

195
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,230
Let someone who’s actually dedicated

196
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,150
have the spot.

197
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,320
It’s a waste.

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,580
Peeta, what’s going on?

199
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,950
Are you mad at me?

200
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,730
No.

201
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,370
Then why are you talking like this?

202
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,030
I just feel like if you act like this,

203
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,790
you shouldn’t be the representative.

204
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,580
And if it’s not me, who should it be?

205
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,030
You?

206
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,820
Because I scored better than you, right?

207
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,890
You just can’t accept it.

208
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,610
No, that’s not it.

209
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
Then what is it?

210
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,480
You wouldn’t get it even if I told you.

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,950
Shouldn’t you be happy for me,

212
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,400
not jealous?

213
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,980
We’re friends, you know.

214
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,620
Why would I be jealous of you, Eve?

215
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,450
What’s there to be jealous of?

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,230
Peeta, what’s wrong with you?

217
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,380
Don’t think too much.

218
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,450
She must be sad that she wasn't chosen.

219
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,580
I get where she’s coming from.

220
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,100
Even though I know

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,480
she shouldn’t have done this to you.

222
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,320
Hey, didn’t you say

223
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,570
you didn’t like bread anymore?

224
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,480
You seem to enjoy it a lot.

225
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,800
Who told you that?

226
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,830
What?

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,700
Back then, I brought you bread…

228
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,260
Want some bread?

229
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,800
I don’t like it.

230
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,410
I mean I don’t like you.

231
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,410
So, now you like me again, right?

232
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,370
Oh, Saint, you brat.

233
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,640
I’m gonna hate you now, you jerk.

234
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,780
Dumb ass.

235
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,310
Hey, Saint. Give me some water.

236
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,240
You jerk.

237
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,486
Damn, the bread's stuck in my throat.

238
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,790
Drink slowly.

239
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,450
Drink slowly.

240
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,570
You’ll choke.

241
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,600
Hey, Shin.

242
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,090
Hm?

243
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,770
Should we take a picture or something?

244
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Why take a picture?

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,780
Just as a memento,

246
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,130
you know, since we’re making up.

247
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,390
Don’t see the point.

248
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,720
Come on, it’s important to me.

249
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,040
I… I want to show it off to Chingching.

250
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,960
Come on, just one picture.

251
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,320
You’re such a kid.

252
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,470
Hurry up, man.

253
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,360
Make it look good.

254
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,020
Are you really that happy?

255
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,160
Well, of course, I’m happy.

256
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,320
This is our first couple photo in years.

257
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,010
If you're this happy,

258
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,780
why don’t you print it and frame it?

259
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,380
Damn, that's a good idea.

260
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,440
I’ll go to the photo shop tonight.

261
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,640
I’m being sarcastic,

262
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,970
you dumbass.

263
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,480
I’m going to keep this picture safe.

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,750
Send it to me too.

265
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,526
Don’t forget to show it off to Chingching.

266
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,120
Wait, didn’t you say

267
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,496
you were going to show it off yourself?

268
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,080
Well... you’ll go home first,

269
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,780
so you’ll run into Chingching first,

270
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,780
so you’ll show it off first.

271
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,650
Lemme see.

272
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,920
Your face looks weird.

273
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,800
You weren’t like this before.

274
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,280
Ouch.

275
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,180
You’re falling for me.

276
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,320
Pfft, no. Your face is swollen, you jerk.

277
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,200
Probably from too much sodium.

278
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,760
Damn, Saint.

279
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,130
Look at your stupid face too.

280
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
With that dumb dog face.

281
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,746
Seriously, making that stupid face.

282
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,936
I’ll shove bread in your face.

283
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,780
Shin, you brat.

284
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,780
Go eat the damn bread.

285
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,570
It’s cutting my mouth.

286
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,950
Damn it. I’m not joking.

287
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,940
Hey, can I have like

288
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,420
two or three more pictures?

289
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,770
Whoa, why do you need so many?

290
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,230
Damn, this is like a national photo, man.

291
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
I gotta stock up

292
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,860
in case my phone breaks.

293
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,670
What’s the matter, Cable?

294
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,570
I heard Miss Jan chose you as a representative

295
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,230
for the Thai quiz competition.

296
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,280
I’m expecting you to help bring a prize home

297
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,970
for our school.

298
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,020
But I’m not confident at all, mom.

299
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,770
Hmm, no need to worry about that.

300
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,260
From today until the competition,

301
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,940
I’ll arrange tutoring sessions in Thai for you.

302
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,000
Mom, can I not compete?

303
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,740
I’m scared I won’t score well.

304
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,370
Cable, it’s just a district-level competition.

305
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,420
It’s not that hard, sweetheart.

306
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
But…

307
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Sigh.

308
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,930
Cable, you have to compete.

309
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,040
This isn’t just about you.

310
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,740
It’s about me and our school too.

311
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,440
You understand that, right?

312
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,650
Hmm?

313
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,700
Tew and First, are you ready?

314
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,530
3, 2, 1. Start.

315
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,200
Oh, First, hurry up.

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
First, Tew is leading now.

317
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,690
Oh, First.

318
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,690
Hurry up.

319
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,380
First, hurry up.

320
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,380
Oh, Tew is about to finish.

321
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,800
First, oh…

322
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,560
Oh, Tew won again.

323
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,670
I lost to you again.

324
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,970
Next time, can you compete with Tew?

325
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,770
Yeah, next time,

326
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,386
you should join the competition with us.

327
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,730
Beat Tew first,

328
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,930
then you can challenge me.

329
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,890
Yeah, exactly.

330
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,930
Damn, you’re so cocky.

331
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,050
Hey, what are you doing here, Saint?

332
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,190
I’m here to see my friend.

333
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,130
Who’s your friend?

334
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,590
It’s him.

335
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,230
Right, Shin?

336
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,770
Yeah.

337
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,800
Does this mean Saint will hang out with us

338
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,540
more often now?

339
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,540
Hey, who gave you permission for that?

340
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,810
Shin, are you really okay with this?

341
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,960
From now on, Saint’s my friend.

342
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,530
You’re gonna see him with me often,

343
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,930
so cut him some slack, alright?

344
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,430
Fine, fine.

345
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,940
I’ll let it slide ‘cause Shin said so

346
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,050
Alright, but if you mess with my friend,

347
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,990
we’ll beat the crap out of you

348
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Got it.

349
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
Alright then.

350
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,680
Wanna prove yourself?

351
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Let’s go, step up

352
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,540
Thanks, man.

353
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,400
Thanks for what?

354
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,650
For letting me stay, obviously.

355
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,760
It’s your right.

356
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,860
Oh, right... the right of a best friend, huh?

357
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Huh? Best friend?

358
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,540
Take this, you smug dog face.

359
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,380
Ow, damn, that stings. My face is burning.

360
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,770
I’m flicking you back.

361
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,670
Don’t you dare, Saint.

362
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,990
Don’t—hey, stop it.

363
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,400
Chadjen, look at this.

364
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,820
Shin’s bullying me.

365
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,930
What? You siding with him, Chadjen?

366
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,570
You want some too?

367
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
I’m not taking Saint’s side, but...

368
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,500
Hey.

369
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,960
Come here, you.

370
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,440
Hey.

371
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,600
Chadjen, are you protecting him?

372
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
Don’t you dare.

373
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,670
Come on, don’t mess around like this.

374
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,356
- You want in on this too?
- You might end up mad at each other again.

375
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,520
I don’t want it.

376
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,950
Sit down, all of you.

377
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,930
Here.

378
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,090
What?

379
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,160
A lollipop. Don’t tell me you don’t know it.

380
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,510
You’re messing with me.

381
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,510
You copy my words.

382
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
Here.

383
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,670
Not gonna eat it?

384
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,370
Not in the mood. Not gonna eat now.

385
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Here.

386
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,180
Believe me,

387
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,180
having some sugar makes you feel better.

388
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,270
Are you okay?

389
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,550
Honestly, I’m so not okay with this.

390
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,060
Peeta and I have been friends for years.

391
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,400
We’re super close.

392
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,330
Whenever Peeta gets something good,

393
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,740
I’m always happy for her.

394
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,840
But now that it’s my turn,

395
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,360
she’s not even happy for me,

396
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,810
like, not even a little.

397
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,780
She even said

398
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,250
I don’t deserve it.

399
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,150
It’s so hurtful.

400
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,660
I get that,

401
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,610
but I really believe that in the end,

402
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,680
you and Peeta will find a way to talk again.

403
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,190
Friends fight—it’s normal.

404
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,620
I hope so.

405
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,980
Thanks for sitting with me, though.

406
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,260
Wait... so I’m your friend now?

407
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,350
Uh, what else am I supposed to call you?

408
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
“Thanks for sitting with me, stranger”

409
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,200
Like this?

410
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,200
Are you joking?

411
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,350
Or you’re only being nice to me because...

412
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,240
Oh my, I’m nice to you

413
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,990
because I think of you as a friend.

414
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,000
Thanks, new friend.

415
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,090
Anytime.

416
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,390
Okay, okay, okay.

417
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,570
Let’s do it again.

418
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,370
First to finish wins.

419
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,740
Look at mine!

420
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,660
It’s smaller than yours.

421
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:53,821
But I eat these all the time.

422
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,860
What are you doing here?

423
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Thought you said you were done with us.

424
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,550
I’m here to talk to you guys one last time.

425
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,110
Are you seriously not going back to school?

426
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,570
I’ve told you before. I’m not going.

427
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,360
And you, Nate? What about you?

428
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,680
I’m sticking with my boss, obviously.

429
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,260
School can wait, bro.

430
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,186
Nate’s not gonna ditch his friends

431
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,400
like you did, Knot.

432
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,050
I’m saying this

433
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,890
because I care about you guys, man.

434
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
Living like this won’t get you anywhere.

435
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,000
Whatever, think what you want.

436
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,800
This is my place now.

437
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,040
I’m staying here.

438
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,180
It works for me.

439
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,450
If you’re gonna stick around here with me,

440
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,130
Ken, you better make yourself useful.

441
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,130
What do you want me to do?

442
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,190
It’s about your friend, Shin.

443
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,690
I told you to make him cry.

444
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,890
Done that yet?

445
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,970
You guys handle your part,

446
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,280
and I’ll take care of mine.

447
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,510
I’m gonna ruin him to death.

448
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,510
You better get it done.

449
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,250
So, what’s the plan, Ken?

450
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,840
Drop it with Shin, man.

451
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,970
Don’t get involved.

452
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,170
This’s never your fight in the first place.

453
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Jeng’s just using you for his game.

454
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,990
You already lost your bike over this.

455
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,810
Enough’s enough.

456
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,810
If I don’t do what Jeng says,

457
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,460
you know what’ll happen to me.

458
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,620
You can still walk away, Ken.

459
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,960
You too, Nate.

460
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,380
Just stop, man.

461
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,780
I’ll be frank with you, Principal.

462
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,750
I’m very upset that Peeta wasn’t chosen

463
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,500
as the school’s representative

464
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,180
for the Thai quiz competition.

465
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,170
Ms. Pornphan, I need to clarify that

466
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,660
the school carefully selects representatives

467
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,200
based on their suitability and ability

468
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,730
in each subject.

469
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
For Thai subject,

470
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,930
there are students with higher scores

471
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
than Peeta.

472
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,020
And how, exactly, are you so sure

473
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,170
that my daughter isn’t suitable?

474
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,080
Peeta once had the highest Thai scores

475
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,970
in her class.

476
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,970
As a parent yourself, Principal,

477
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,290
you should understand

478
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,020
how crucial academic achievements are

479
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,960
for university admissions.

480
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,010
I also know your son has been chosen

481
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,800
as a school representative.

482
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,020
Therefore, both your son and my daughter

483
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,770
are the most suitable representatives.

484
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,970
I’m confident they will bring home

485
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,970
prizes for the school.

486
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,250
Not just me, but the other members

487
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,770
of the Parent Association would be thrilled

488
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,590
if my daughter were chosen

489
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,260
as a representative.

490
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,300
It could also mean an increase

491
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,780
in donations for the school.

492
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,770
Alright, Ms. Pornphan.

493
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
I’ll see what I can do.

494
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,010
Miss Jan.

495
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,170
Yes, Principal.

496
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,660
Have you submitted the names

497
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,620
of the representatives for

498
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,160
the Thai quiz competition yet?

499
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,490
Not yet. Why?

500
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,890
I’d like you to change the representatives

501
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,710
to Cable and Peeta.

502
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,290
Why the sudden change?

503
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,040
After careful consideration,

504
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,700
I believe Peeta is more suitable

505
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,800
to represent our school.

506
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,690
Besides, I’ve already discussed this

507
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,370
with Peeta’s mother.

508
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,530
But, Principal, if we go by the scores,

509
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,270
Eve deserves the spot more.

510
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,410
Changing this suddenly will disappoint her.

511
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,950
And Peeta too,

512
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,786
especially if Peeta finds out that her mother...

513
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,100
Miss Jan, instead of focusing on

514
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,200
just a few students,

515
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,360
you should think about our school.

516
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,660
Peeta’s mother has significant influence

517
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,200
in the Parent Association,

518
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,570
which holds considerable sway

519
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,010
over our school.

520
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,790
Sometimes,

521
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,806
we have to make certain compromises

522
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,080
for the greater good.

523
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,670
Please handle this matter promptly.

524
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,970
Regarding the Thai quiz competition,

525
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,900
the school needs to change

526
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
the representatives.

527
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,200
From Cable and Eve

528
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,290
to Cable and Peeta.

529
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,780
Why is the representative changing?

530
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,310
I’m sorry, Eve.

531
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,730
Is it because I’m not more suitable

532
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,260
to represent the school than Peeta?

533
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,260
No, that’s not it, Eve.

534
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,890
Then why?

535
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,070
Did I do something wrong?

536
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,400
Or did someone tell you to change

537
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,600
the representative?

538
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,820
No one told me to do this.

539
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,110
It was my decision.

540
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,570
I decided to change it myself.

541
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,110
I know I’m not as good as Peeta

542
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,390
when it comes to academics.

543
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,480
But Miss Jan,

544
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,840
do you know how happy I was

545
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,410
when you chose me?

546
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,980
It was the first time

547
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,550
I felt like I did something well.

548
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,640
I’ve thought you were a good teacher,

549
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,400
a fair teacher,

550
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,400
but I was wrong.

551
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,780
In the end, you gave the opportunity

552
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,480
to the smarter student anyway.

553
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,910
Will you really change the representative

554
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,540
from Eve to Peeta?

555
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,820
What you did isn’t fair.

556
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,520
Tangmay, Airy,

557
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,320
I know you’re upset

558
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,320
about what happened with Eve.

559
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,130
It’s not wrong to have a favorite student.

560
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,260
But when it’s this obvious,

561
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,170
it just looks ugly.

562
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,990
Exactly.

563
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,510
What you did isn’t very teacher-like.

564
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,940
You can’t speak to me like that.

565
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,190
Why not? It’s the truth.

566
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,790
I get it—Peeta’s family is rich,

567
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,800
and her mom’s the head

568
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,320
of the Parent Association.

569
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,320
Everyone has to tiptoe around her.

570
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,990
But I never thought

571
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,220
you would be one of them.

572
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,330
We’re really disappointed in you.

573
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,600
I’m sorry I let you down.

574
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Sigh.

575
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,070
What are you thinking about?

576
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,440
About Miss Jan and Eve.

577
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,700
I’m kind of concerned about this.

578
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,810
But why did Miss Jan suddenly change from

579
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,240
Eve to Peeta?

580
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,460
She didn’t tell us the reasons either.

581
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,590
No surprise Eve felt upset.

582
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,810
Guess she has the reasons

583
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,410
she cannot share with us.

584
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Sigh.

585
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,570
But if it goes like this,

586
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Miss Jan is going to get a lot of heat.

587
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Yeah,

588
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,770
but maybe she’s protecting something.

589
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,770
That’s why she’s willing to take the blame

590
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,790
all by herself.

591
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,520
Sigh.

592
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,870
If it were you,

593
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,180
would you just take the blame for nothing?

594
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,180
Well, if it were to protect you...

595
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Tch.

596
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,570
I’d do it without hesitation.

597
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,860
Ugh, Saint, you’re being so cheesy again.

598
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,400
What? I’m serious.

599
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
You’re everything to me now.

600
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,700
Ew, gross. I’m gonna puke.

601
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,700
You’re too damn sappy.

602
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,560
So what if I’m sappy?

603
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
You like it, don’t you?

604
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,880
Hell no, you idiot. Gives me goosebumps.

605
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,810
Aww, blushing already?

606
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,040
Don’t touch me, Saint, you jerk.

607
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,390
Listen to me, Shin.

608
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,450
From now on,

609
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,970
no matter what happens,

610
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,170
I’ll protect you,

611
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,250
my best buddy.

612
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,360
Ugh, save it. I can take care of myself.

613
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,260
You should worry about

614
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,499
keeping yourself alive first.

615
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Oh, come on. You’re all talk.

616
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,810
Back then,

617
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,170
who was always protecting you?

618
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,620
Ugh.

619
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,540
Every time you were about to

620
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,736
- get your butt kicked, who stepped in?
- Yeah, and now?

621
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,370
Who saved you?

622
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,580
You’re dumb.

623
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,270
I’m the one looking after you now.

624
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,270
Wow, you ungrateful bastard.

625
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,180
Ugh, you idiot.

626
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,256
So all those times in the past

627
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,980
meant nothing to you, huh?

628
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,176
Let me hit you once, come here.

629
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,480
Oww, you’re blushing. Look at that red face.

630
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,380
Hey, Chingching, Brother Shin is blushing.

631
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,120
Stop it.

632
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,930
Don’t do that dumb dog face.

633
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,380
Stop it right now.

634
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,790
So what if I’ve got a dog face?

635
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Tch.

636
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,260
At least dogs are loyal, you know.

637
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,630
Ugh, seriously? Let me hit you once.

638
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,200
I can’t believe

639
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,480
I’m stuck with someone like you.

640
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,690
Are you gonna punch a dog?

641
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,740
No, I’m punching you, idiot.

642
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,640
I’m telling Chingching about this.

643
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,710
Don’t you mess with my sister, damn it.

644
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,110
Chingching, Brother Shin is blushing.

645
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
So, you’re asking to withdraw?

646
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,050
Yes.

647
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,200
Please let Peeta and Eve represent the school

648
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,330
instead of me.

649
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,030
If this is about Peeta and Eve,

650
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,540
you don’t need to give up your spot.

651
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,220
I’ll handle it.

652
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,260
It’s not about them.

653
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,380
I just don’t want to compete.

654
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,560
Have you spoken to the principal about this?

655
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,160
I’m the one who will compete.

656
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,190
Whether I do or not should be my decision,

657
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,820
not my mom’s.

658
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,440
Please take my name off the list, Miss Jan.

659
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,610
Thank you.

660
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,240
Mom, you told the teacher

661
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,920
to replace Eve with me, didn’t you?

662
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,760
Well, being the school representative

663
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,600
increases your chances

664
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,916
of getting into a good university, sweetie.

665
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,780
But you used this method?

666
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,430
Didn’t you think about how I’d feel?

667
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,080
Of course I did.

668
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,660
That’s why I stepped in to help.

669
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,660
So why are you getting mad at me?

670
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,650
Because it’s not right.

671
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,810
How am I supposed to face Eve after this?

672
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,630
She’s just one friend. What’s the big deal?

673
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,280
And why didn’t you focus on studying harder

674
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,440
in the first place?

675
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,080
If you had,

676
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,566
I wouldn’t have had to step in like this,

677
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,400
would I?

678
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,540
If you’d gotten the highest score,

679
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,450
you’d have been chosen right away,

680
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,810
and I wouldn’t need to do this for you.

681
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,950
Peeta,

682
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,120
if you give up over something this small,

683
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,710
how will you handle other things later on?

684
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,300
If you don’t endure and push yourself,

685
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,130
forget about getting into a top university

686
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,930
like everyone else.

687
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,500
I’ve told you before.

688
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,700
You can’t just sit back

689
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,420
and wait for opportunities.

690
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,010
You have to grab them.

691
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,256
I don’t want to hear about this anymore.

692
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,680
Focus on your studies. That’s all.

693
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,330
Withdraw?

694
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,340
What are you thinking, Cable?

695
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,470
I just don’t want to compete, mom.

696
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,760
I already told you.

697
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,200
But I’m not allowing it.

698
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You can’t just do that, Cable.

699
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,600
Why do you have to force me?

700
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,700
I’ve already told you,

701
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,330
this is really important,

702
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,140
and the school needs you.

703
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,720
But I’m not the only student in the school.

704
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,050
There are plenty of others

705
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,460
who can take my place.

706
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,000
But I only have you, Cable.

707
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,460
Tomorrow morning,

708
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,746
go tell Miss Jan you’ve changed your mind

709
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,970
and that you’ll compete.

710
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,000
Don’t make me repeat myself.

711
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,000
Why are you giving me this?

712
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,981
It's a thank you for the exercises

713
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:31,192
and the summary you gave me.

714
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:33,190
It really helped me understand a lot more.

715
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,189
And I’m here to ask for the summary too.

716
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,167
No need to thank me.

717
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:42,487
I'm just happy to see that you understand.

718
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,240
As for the summary,

719
00:47:44,276 --> 00:47:45,470
I'll send the file to you,

720
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:47,156
and you can share it with your friends.

721
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:48,530
Thank you, Mr. Sung.

722
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,400
It's almost time for class.

723
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:51,752
Go on, get ready.

724
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:52,789
Yes, Mr. Sung.

725
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,352
Miss Jan, did Cable contact you?

726
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,120
Not at all. What happened?

727
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,363
Cable has been missing since last night.

728
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,174
I’ve tried calling, but I can’t get through.

729
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,712
Do you know if Cable has any places

730
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:46,552
he likes to go

731
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:47,432
or any close friends

732
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,025
or relatives he might be with?

733
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,590
I’ve tried calling everyone,

734
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,440
but no one knows where he is.

735
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,974
Has Cable talked to you, Miss Jan?

736
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,552
He came to talk to me about

737
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,720
wanting to withdraw from the competition.

738
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:12,916
But other than that,

739
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:14,952
he hasn’t consulted me about anything else.

740
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,607
I’m so sorry,

741
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,170
I didn’t notice

742
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,123
if there’s something wrong with my student.

743
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,949
I’m his homeroom teacher

744
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,040
but I didn’t pay enough attention.

745
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,927
Don’t blame yourself.

746
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,512
The most important thing right now

747
00:49:41,534 --> 00:49:43,316
is finding Cable.

748
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,087
Nate, are you coming back to school?

749
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:25,670
Not that.

750
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,934
Then why are you here?

751
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,756
What’s wrong?

752
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,523
I heard that Jeng is planning to ambush

753
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:40,152
and beat the crap out of Saint and Shin.

754
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,370
I’m really worried about it,

755
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:43,585
so I’m telling you first.

756
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,607
When’s that?

757
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,938
This evening, in front of the school.

758
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,985
Hello, Shin.

759
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:55,367
What will you do this evening?

760
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,625
Wanna have barbecues together?

761
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,680
Will you treat me?

762
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:00,261
Sure, I promised you I’d do it.

763
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,600
Fine, you better bring a lot of money.

764
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:05,469
I’m going all out on a big meal.

765
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,460
You’re really going all out, huh?

766
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,789
Yeah, I’m just kidding.

767
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:10,898
You don’t have to treat me.

768
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,709
Nah, it’s fine. I told you I’d treat you.

769
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,367
I’ll go pick up the food first,

770
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,869
then we’ll meet up at the restaurant later.

771
00:51:17,905 --> 00:51:19,956
Yeah, yeah. Just give me a call later then.

772
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,898
Okay. See you.

773
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Jeng…

774
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,323
The hell they’re doing here?

775
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,676
Hello, Shin. Are you still in school?

776
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,450
Still here. About to go home now.

777
00:51:58,487 --> 00:51:59,141
Why?

778
00:51:59,178 --> 00:52:01,490
Hey, then don’t go yet.

779
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,025
Check my desk for me.

780
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,301
Seems like I forgot my wallet.

781
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:11,738
Huff, as always. you're always forgetful.

782
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,200
It's a pain for me.

783
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:14,865
Come on, if not for that,

784
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,647
I wouldn't have the money to treat you.

785
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:18,640
Yeah, yeah, I'll go check it out.

786
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:23,570
That's it. Sigh.

787
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,149
You came right to me, huh?

788
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,963
You’ve got some guts, I like it.

789
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,076
What about your friend?

790
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,392
Don't mess with my friend.

791
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,680
Talk to me if you’ve got something to say.

792
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,620
Of course, I’ve got something to say.

793
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:09,156
Where is it?

794
00:53:09,178 --> 00:53:10,178
Shin.

795
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,530
What’s up?

796
00:53:11,716 --> 00:53:13,636
Jeng’s gonna ambush you and Saint,

797
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:14,836
have you seen him?

798
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,785
What the…

799
00:53:16,814 --> 00:53:18,261
Saint, you jerk, you tricked me.

800
00:53:18,283 --> 00:53:19,549
Hey, Shin. Wait up.

801
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:22,563
Shit.

802
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:25,261
Let’s go.

803
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,690
Let’s go.

804
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:33,390
Saint.

805
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:40,750
You bastard, stop!

806
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:42,421
Let go of my friend.

807
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,210
Damn it.

808
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,258
You jerk.

809
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
You can take a beating pretty well, huh?

810
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,810
I already told you,

811
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
if you’ve got something, come talk to me.

812
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,894
Talk to my feet, your prick?

813
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,418
I really wanna see

814
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,254
how long you can take it for your friend.

815
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,810
Grab him.

816
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,185
Is this all the strength you’ve got?

817
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,592
Not much.

818
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,214
I really like these loud-mouth kids.

819
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,585
Let’s see if you can back it up.

820
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,980
You and that Shin really pissed me off.

821
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,540
Don’t think I’ll let you go so easily.

822
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,567
You’re gonna die at my feet.

823
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:26,032
Go ahead.

824
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,898
If you can do it,

825
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,076
then do it.

826
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,810
But you’ve gotta let my friend go.

827
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:35,709
Hmm, you really care about each other, huh?

828
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,581
Ken, handle him.

829
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,723
Didn’t you hear me, bastard?

830
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,214
I told you to deal with him.

831
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:06,472
Jeng, I think that’s enough.

832
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,600
Saint is gonna end up dead at this rate.

833
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,620
You’re gonna disobey me? Huh?

834
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,178
If you don’t do it,

835
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,378
I’ll make you my target next.

836
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,567
Hey, Jeng, you ran out of steam or what?

837
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,658
Gotta get the kid to help now, huh?

838
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,207
Big mouth, huh?

839
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,785
Give me his phone.

840
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:36,618
Hey, assh*le.

841
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,007
Don’t mess with me.

842
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,181
Call Shin

843
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,545
and tell him to come clean up

844
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:47,567
his friend’s body.

845
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,523
Ken, don’t.

846
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,156
Don’t listen to him.

847
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:54,905
Ken.

848
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,050
Ken.

849
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,530
Ken.

850
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,980
Ken.

851
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,963
Jerk.

852
00:57:06,305 --> 00:57:07,345
Jerk.

853
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:08,952
Jerk.

854
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,614
You bastard.

855
00:57:09,636 --> 00:57:10,021
You bastard.

856
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:10,472
You bastard.

857
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:11,501
You bastard.

858
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,510
You little shit.

859
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,450
Saint.

860
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Saint.

861
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,770
Saint.

862
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:04,910
Saint.

863
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,407
Saint, Saint.

864
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,870
Saint.

865
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,309
Saint, hang in there.

866
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,978
Shin, I…

867
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,030
Jeng, you brat.

868
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,992
Shin, don’t.

869
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,229
But he hurt you.

870
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,400
I’m fine.

871
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:35,912
The hell you’re fine.

872
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:37,469
You’re beaten up this badly.

873
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,901
Listen to me.

874
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,272
I’m really fine.

875
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,138
Don’t go there.

876
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:48,130
I only want you by my side now.

877
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,910
Damn it.

878
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,370
Why? Why did you do this, Saint?

879
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,912
Why would you take a beating for me?

880
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,792
I told you, right?

881
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,163
I’ll protect you.

882
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:14,200
I’m not gonna let anyone hurt you again.

883
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,294
You're crazy.

884
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:19,290
You’re really crazy, you know that?

885
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:25,170
You went through all this pain just for me?

886
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:34,472
For me, all I need is for you to be okay.

887
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,385
That’s enough.

888
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,807
Shit, man.

889
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,370
That bastard Jeng really made me cry.

890
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:05,396
I’m sorry,

891
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
this is all my fault.

892
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,660
Shin...

893
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,698
You’re getting hurt like this because of me.

894
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,790
It’s all on me.

895
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,527
I’m sorry, Saint.

896
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:44,820
Come on, hug me, will you?

897
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,829
Don’t cry, it’s alright.

898
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,000
I’m sorry.

899
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:41,650
I’m really glad I could protect you.

900
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:02,647
Saint, I’m begging you.

901
01:02:05,134 --> 01:02:06,850
Don’t be stupid again, alright?

902
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,116
What the hell are you smiling for?

903
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,870
You almost died, you know?

904
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,785
Shit, but I made it through, didn’t I?

905
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:45,781
You’re such an idiot.

906
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,780
Damn, I really am an idiot.

907
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,952
From now on, stay away from Jeng, okay?

908
01:03:29,207 --> 01:03:30,130
I don’t want to see you getting hurt

909
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:30,763
like this again.

910
01:03:30,785 --> 01:03:31,767
You’re acting like

911
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:33,418
you’re my boyfriend or something.

912
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:35,614
Right now, Cable, our friend,

913
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:37,927
has been missing since the night before.

914
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,730
I can’t find Cable anywhere.

915
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,490
I don’t know where he is.

916
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,538
I have no idea if he’s okay,

917
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,576
or if something’s happened to him.

918
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,272
Right now, Ken’s still with Jeng’s gang.

919
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:47,127
We want to get him out.

920
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,996
I think you two can help him.

921
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,538
You’re gonna go back after all that?

922
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,970
You don’t have to stay with

923
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,610
assh*les like Jeng.

924
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,796
You know well how fucked up

925
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:55,294
Jeng and his gang are, don’t you?

926
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:56,323
Damn, you jerk.

927
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,000
Isn’t that enough already?

928
01:03:58,029 --> 01:03:59,338
Come at me, you bastard.

929
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,065
I don’t think I’m suited to be

930
01:04:02,087 --> 01:04:04,334
the homeroom teacher of Class 2 anymore.

931
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,603
Miss Jan, are you really going to resign?

932
01:04:09,898 --> 01:04:11,890
Are we dating, or are we just friends?

933
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,992
Why do we always have to hide like this?

934
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:14,450
One day,

935
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:16,618
you and I will make my mom accept us,

936
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,290
but until that day comes,

937
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,563
we’ll have to stay friends in secret like this.
