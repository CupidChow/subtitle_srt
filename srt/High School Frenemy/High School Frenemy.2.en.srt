1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:01,650
Homeroom teacher?

2
00:00:01,885 --> 00:00:04,259
I’ll appoint you as the homeroom teacher of Class 2

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,671
to replace the resigned teacher.

4
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:06,638
I think you probably heard

5
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:11,117
students from Udon Pithak campus will join your class this year.

6
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,309
Shin, I want to talk to you.

7
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,970
My friend said he didn’t want to talk to you.

8
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:17,305
Are you deaf?

9
00:00:17,662 --> 00:00:18,434
Stay away from him.

10
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:20,405
Shin, are you afraid of him?

11
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:21,708
No, I’m not.

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,737
But you should be.

13
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:32,814
Okay.

14
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,008
For the Error Identification exam,

15
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:36,835
in lots of real exams,

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,917
you may have only 1 minute per question.

17
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,133
Or even less.

18
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,822
However, I have some techniques to help you do your exam quicker

19
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:50,429
and have a chance to score better.

20
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:51,709
Ready?

21
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,170
First, find easy questions.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,216
What is to find easy questions?

23
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:00,269
It is to find the questions that you can answer the most.

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,500
In the first phase of exam taking,

25
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,801
don’t waste your time on the hard questions

26
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,105
because you’ll lose your opportunity to finish other questions.

27
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:11,816
I’ve never thought that

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,290
the one who always skipped classes back then

29
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:16,807
would become a famous tutor

30
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:19,608
who helps many students get into universities.

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,005
That was a long time ago, teacher.

32
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:28,503
Don’t you think of becoming a teacher in a real school?

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,708
Being a tutor is already nice.

34
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,604
What if…

35
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,607
I wanted you to teach with me at Siamwit?

36
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,871
Why do you want me to teach there?

37
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:51,977
You graduated from there.

38
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:55,014
You are an alumnus of this school.

39
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:59,977
You might understand the personality of Siamwit’s students best, right?

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,462
Most importantly this year,

41
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:14,100
the principal will merge the Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak campuses together.

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,408
Merge them?

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,970
CLASS 2

44
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:36,968
This is Mr. Sung.

45
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,705
The guest teacher we hired specially for this academic year.

46
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,810
Nice to meet you. I’m Sung.

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,165
I’m Jan.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,708
What subject do you teach, Miss Jan?

49
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,562
I teach Thai.

50
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:55,011
Mr. Sung will be a homeroom teacher of Class 2,

51
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,767
together with Miss Jan as a special case.

52
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:00,605
This year,

53
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,505
I aim to make Class 2 a model classroom for the new curriculum.

54
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,709
The curriculum that will change the mischievous children

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,973
with poor academic performance

56
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,106
to the behaved ones with better performance.

57
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,317
The two of you need to work together.

58
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:18,757
You must do it.

59
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:21,915
Okay.

60
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:25,825
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,262
Shin, you know him?

62
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:43,011
A person with this kind of nature?

63
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:44,508
I don’t count as one.

64
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:47,712
This kind of nature…

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,706
What do you mean?

66
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,629
I sincerely warn you.

67
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,869
His true nature…

68
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,300
is liking to hurt others.

69
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:06,109
He hurts everyone.

70
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,515
Even his friends are not the exception.

71
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:19,502
Saint?

72
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,160
It’s me whom you better be afraid of.

73
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,407
What bad day is it?

74
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,777
Why do all jerks gather here?

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,614
I haven’t done talking to you yet.

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,914
Shin, don’t.

77
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,173
Shin, don’t.

78
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:40,973
Stop.

79
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:44,309
Just wait.

80
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,219
Go.

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,862
Bored of this subject to death.

82
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,120
Where are you going?

83
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,565
Go back to your seat.

84
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,271
Go back to your seat.

85
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,238
Who the fuck are you?

86
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,750
Who gives you the right to order me?

87
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,874
If you don’t mind the assault charges, then just punch me.

88
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:11,817
Assaulting and causing both physical and mental harm to others

89
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,475
is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding 2 years,

90
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:16,200
a fine not exceeding 40,000 baht,

91
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,567
or both.

92
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:31,272
If you think your parents can pay the fine,

93
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,767
then do it.

94
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:36,700
Working for 2-3 months to pay a child’s fine.

95
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:38,960
But I’m not sure if they’d pay for that though.

96
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:43,011
Go back to your seat.

97
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:57,512
I told you to sit down.

98
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:09,508
Okay.

99
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:11,508
Hello, everyone.

100
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,508
My name is Sirawit

101
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:16,411
or you can call me Mr. Sung in short.

102
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,560
I teach English.

103
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,410
Also, from now on,

104
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,506
I’ll be another homeroom teacher of yours.

105
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,122
What the fuck?

106
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,111
Why the heck are they here?

107
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,170
And as you can see,

108
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:31,768
I’m not kind like Miss Jan.

109
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:35,508
I don’t let things slide easily as well.

110
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:37,308
So,

111
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:39,982
if you want to fight with me,

112
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,025
I want to give you a heads-up that

113
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:47,168
you might not get to graduate here.

114
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,059
Ken...

115
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:11,325
Ken.

116
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:12,053
Ken.

117
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,035
Have you heard of Shin’s story when he was in Udon Pithak?

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,908
Which one?

119
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,475
The one about Shin overthrowing the Northern Dragon Gang

120
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,717
that used to dominate the Udon Pithak campus.

121
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,653
That formidable gang.

122
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,400
The one whose leader was good at boxing.

123
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,548
He later named his gang “Tsunami”

124
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:32,068
because he defeated a bunch of Northern Dragon members at the time.

125
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,222
I thought you meant something else.

126
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,274
That stupid dragon gang was pathetic.

127
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,650
So, the Tsunami can take control of the campus.

128
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,198
But mark my word.

129
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:43,709
The Tsunami cannot dominate here

130
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,656
because I’ll get them.

131
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:48,333
If they’re Tsunami,

132
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,597
what should we call ourselves?

133
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,506
I think I’ll be Hurricane.

134
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,668
Then I’ll be Tornado.

135
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,725
And you, Ken. You’re Typhoon.

136
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,674
Aren’t you afraid of them?

137
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:01,862
What's so scary about them?

138
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:04,957
I’ve punched his face so many times.

139
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,908
Now that they’re in my zone,

140
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,515
I’ll make them realize that

141
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,579
this is Thep Burapha.

142
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:16,405
Not Udon Pithak.

143
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,561
Don’t read this kind of textbook.

144
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,607
From now on,

145
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:13,365
I want you all to forget everything you’ve learned in your English classes.

146
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:16,940
And listen to what I teach you only.

147
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,770
What will you teach us then?

148
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:23,908
I’ll teach you things that will help you get better scores

149
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,317
and get into universities.

150
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:31,106
You want to get into good universities, right?

151
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,669
What should you do to make that happen?

152
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:37,570
You need a high score on your exams, right?

153
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,620
These theories are not practical.

154
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,607
You need to do the practice exercises.

155
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:46,370
In my class,

156
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:50,820
I’ll teach you about what will be in the exam.

157
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:54,371
You just bring yourself here in my class.

158
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:55,974
Listen attentively.

159
00:10:56,401 --> 00:11:00,111
I can confirm that you will get better scores.

160
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:08,440
Hey.

161
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,429
Sit properly.

162
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,408
Is my class that sleepy?

163
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:20,167
No, it’s not.

164
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:22,614
Then why did you sleep?

165
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:24,973
I don’t want to study at university.

166
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,075
So, I don’t know why I have to study hard.

167
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,626
Isn’t graduating enough?

168
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,303
Well, then.

169
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,869
For those who want to sleep

170
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,312
since they don’t want to get into university or have better scores,

171
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,205
I give you this chance to stand up

172
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:59,900
and walk out of the room now.

173
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:01,928
I’ll not check the attendance

174
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,481
and deduct the score.

175
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,502
And from now on,

176
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,983
you don’t need to attend my class.

177
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,475
Go ahead.

178
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:23,610
Let’s go.

179
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
Nobita is kind.

180
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,710
Why isn’t Doraemon here with you?

181
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,881
Does anyone else want to leave the room?

182
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,968
No more?

183
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:07,810
Then, let’s begin.

184
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:12,216
Turn to the exercise of Unit 1.

185
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:13,703
Let’s do some quiz.

186
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,068
This’s nice. I’m too lazy to study, too.

187
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,302
I have no idea what the hell he was saying.

188
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:21,804
Yeah. I’m hungry.

189
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,069
Let’s find something to eat.

190
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:24,659
What will we have today?

191
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:25,411
Shin.

192
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,703
Shin. Please wait for me.

193
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,770
Why do you follow me, Chadjen?

194
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:35,214
Well…

195
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,419
Friends don’t leave each other behind.

196
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,814
Chadjen is too cute.

197
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:44,562
Do you care about us?

198
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,352
I care about Shin.

199
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,118
Shin, you see this?

200
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,044
Chadjen only cares about you.

201
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,327
Never cared about us.

202
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,677
Thanks, Chadjen.

203
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,807
Let’s find some snacks. Go.

204
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:05,915
Shin.

205
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:13,318
I want to talk to you.

206
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,005
I know with what I’ve done to you,

207
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:24,642
there is no way…

208
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,068
I’ve told you.

209
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,648
Don’t call my name anymore.

210
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,127
Shin, can’t you listen to me first?

211
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:46,868
Wanna be hit again?

212
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:51,909
You can do it as many times as you want.

213
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,268
But can you listen to me first?

214
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,663
I don’t want to talk to you.

215
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:12,322
I beg you.

216
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,517
Can you give me a chance?

217
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:31,262
Don’t bother me again.

218
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:42,946
Chadjen.

219
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,066
Chadjen, come here quickly.

220
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,619
…yes.

221
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,554
Where are your friends?

222
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:14,511
I’m not sure.

223
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,511
In the last period,

224
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,912
Mr.Sung allowed them to leave the class.

225
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:20,669
Leaving the class?

226
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:22,711
How could they leave the class?

227
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,976
Mr.Sung said if anyone doesn’t want to study then he doesn’t have to.

228
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,475
For all we know,

229
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,100
they might already run back home by now.

230
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:38,616
Mr. Sung.

231
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:41,109
Yes.

232
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,979
About you letting the student leave the class,

233
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:45,234
what happened?

234
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,367
The kids decided to not study

235
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:49,979
so I don’t force them.

236
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,555
I only care about those who pay attention.

237
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:53,705
Is it appropriate?

238
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,648
The responsibility of us, teachers, is to teach students.

239
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,811
They didn’t want to study.

240
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,976
I cannot force them.

241
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,207
The more you force them, the worse it will get.

242
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:10,475
Anyway, they should be in the class

243
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,026
and you must find ways to make them study.

244
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:18,115
Your and my ways of handling the kids...

245
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,238
are different.

246
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,038
But what you did is wrong.

247
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,665
Even worse, you told them to forget what other teachers have taught.

248
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,666
How can you say that to students?

249
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:31,911
Miss Jan.

250
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,703
You teach Thai. I teach English.

251
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,423
We teach different subjects.

252
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,505
Our teaching methods are also different.

253
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,471
Let’s not interfere with each other.

254
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,558
Please excuse me.

255
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:57,374
I’ve heard that the Tsunami overthrew the Northern Dragon.

256
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:59,117
They are badass as hell.

257
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:00,514
Now that they are here,

258
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,973
will they win over Ken’s gang?

259
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,428
Could be. The Udon Pithak is always bold.

260
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,170
There. They’re here.

261
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,770
My dad won’t allow me to go.

262
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,611
Again? Your dad is at it again.

263
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:21,976
Shin, I’ll buy food for you.

264
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,499
Never mind. I’ll do it myself.

265
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,761
Hey, your friend wants to treat you, don’t stop him.

266
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,028
That’s right.

267
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:31,520
You just wait there with your handsome face.

268
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,511
We’ll buy food for you.

269
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,161
Let’s go, Chadjen.

270
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:34,928
Okay.

271
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:35,982
I’ll pay, too.

272
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,322
What do you want to eat?

273
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:39,768
I want to eat Krapow Moo Sap.

274
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:40,560
Okay.

275
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:42,000
Tew, you treat Chadjen.

276
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,140
And you pay for yourself?

277
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,308
Pay for me, too.

278
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,404
Just eat it.

279
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:17,680
It’s your favorite.

280
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,404
I already peeled the garlic for you.

281
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,971
(Here. Your garlic.)

282
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,051
(I peeled them all.)

283
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,170
You don’t have to peel them for me.

284
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:42,468
Your hands will be smelly.

285
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,269
I do it for you every time.

286
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:45,780
Why?

287
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,465
What if my hands are smelly?

288
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,672
You smell them.

289
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,820
Saint, you bastard.

290
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,629
Both the smell of garlic and sourness.

291
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,109
I cannot distinguish them.

292
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,168
It doesn’t smell bad.

293
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,703
You’re overreacting so badly.

294
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:00,914
Smells so bad.

295
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:02,317
This is really a life-extending medicine.

296
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:04,505
How many did I peel for you? Like 5 or 6.

297
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,308
See how much I love you?

298
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:17,608
You don’t eat this?

299
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,210
I know you like it.

300
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,546
Eat it.

301
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:27,718
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,979
Fine. Just devour them.

303
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,106
Will just eat them all.

304
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:32,213
Devour.

305
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:33,985
Devour.

306
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,565
Big bite.

307
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:36,614
Here is another one.

308
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:39,201
Shit.  Sorry, man.

309
00:20:39,383 --> 00:20:41,201
- Just have it. - Was it intentional?

310
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,608
No. I know you like it.

311
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:46,845
Eat it.

312
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,037
This brat. Let me hit you once.

313
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,121
You made my house dirty, Saint.

314
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,122
You’re so overreacting, Shin.

315
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:11,226
You, Tsunami.

316
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:15,408
You and I need to settle who's on top.

317
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:17,897
Wanna do it now?

318
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,518
If you’re ready,

319
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,604
see you after school.

320
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,151
Let’s go.

321
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:48,165
If you’re really confident,

322
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:50,148
you wouldn’t have to wait until after school.

323
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,521
You bastard.

324
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,562
Shin.

325
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:56,127
Shin, don’t.

326
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:57,388
Don’t fight, guys.

327
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,327
Shin. Don’t.

328
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:00,712
Hey.

329
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:03,321
Stop it now.

330
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:06,057
It’s you.

331
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,765
Tell me when you’re ready.

332
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,765
I told you to stop.

333
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,149
I give you time to prepare yourself.

334
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:13,875
Go.

335
00:22:29,709 --> 00:22:30,525
Do you understand?

336
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,760
He’s on my side. Come, I’ll help you.

337
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,022
Kind of get it.

338
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:35,482
Have you read the book?

339
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:39,211
You help me, too.

340
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:39,976
Have you read it?

341
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,414
Don’t. Let me play, too.

342
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:44,934
But it will be in the exam.

343
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,260
Your fingers are on fire.

344
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:47,511
I’m dope.

345
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:51,502
Hey, it’s on point.

346
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,614
It’s not.

347
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,262
Where? Do you know which part it is?

348
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,204
I’m not thirsty.

349
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:04,336
What do you want to eat then?

350
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,205
You haven’t had lunch.

351
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,976
Want some bread?

352
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:11,671
I don’t like it.

353
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,721
Is that so? Now, you no longer like bread?

354
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:19,767
Then, do you want candy?

355
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:20,854
I’ll open it for you.

356
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,807
Here.

357
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:26,925
Am I your friend?

358
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,268
Are you really not hungry?

359
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,720
Can you just stay out of it?

360
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,469
Eat a little.

361
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,607
If you want to eat anything just tell me,

362
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,802
I’ll get it for you.

363
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:56,490
You want to be my gofer so badly, right?

364
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,124
If you want me to become one,

365
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:00,854
I’ll do it.

366
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:03,302
Ging.

367
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:06,410
Saint is willing to be a gofer for the Udon Pithak?

368
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,214
He might be afraid of the Tsunami.

369
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:10,477
If I were him, I would do the same.

370
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:11,517
They are really scary.

371
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,016
Scary?

372
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,468
Is that so?

373
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:16,114
Yeah.

374
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,269
Those people don't seem to be looking for trouble at all.

375
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:24,204
Are people from Thep Burapha cowards like this?

376
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,211
Don’t seem to be great like their name.

377
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,167
When they meet the Tsunami,

378
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,321
all of them back down.

379
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:31,912
Utterly useless.

380
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:45,324
Come here, you bastard.

381
00:24:46,822 --> 00:24:47,557
What’s wrong with you?

382
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:48,254
Come here.

383
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,170
Ken, what are you doing?

384
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,180
What’s wrong with you?

385
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:55,038
Where are you going?

386
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:55,884
Let’s go.

387
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,884
Go easy with your friend, dude.

388
00:24:58,505 --> 00:24:59,912
They started to fight with each other already.

389
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,414
Come here.

390
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:03,814
Quick.

391
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:06,176
What’s up with you?

392
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,668
You and I have something to clear up.

393
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:10,715
Ken.

394
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:11,976
What are you doing?

395
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:14,069
Eve, you stop.

396
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:16,069
Come here.

397
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:16,875
Go.

398
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:17,841
Go.

399
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:19,512
Hey.

400
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,508
Wait.

401
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:21,962
Ken.

402
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,438
What’s wrong with you?

403
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,148
Why are you getting so worked up?

404
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:25,863
Knot.

405
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:27,912
Ken.

406
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:28,600
Knot.

407
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:29,271
Nate.

408
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:31,475
The door is locked.

409
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,810
Damn. I don’t think it’s not going to end well

410
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:35,328
Let’s go call the teacher.

411
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,115
You come here.

412
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:43,802
Are you stalling?

413
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,515
Quick.

414
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,162
Why the fuck do you walk this slow?

415
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,514
Who allows you to be a gofer for Shin?

416
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:56,912
Such a shame to Thep Burapha, you brat.

417
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,608
You are Thep Burapha.

418
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:07,512
You cannot bow down to the Udok Phithak.

419
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,413
The only one you need to...

420
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:17,810
is us.

421
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:19,607
Understand?

422
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,520
Miss Jan. Mr. Sung.

423
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:30,503
Something has happened.

424
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,644
What happened?

425
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:33,641
Ken’s gang dragged Saint to the rooftop.

426
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,414
I think they would fight.

427
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:38,402
You all go wait in the class.

428
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:39,554
We’ll take care of it.

429
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:51,870
You can handle it, brat?

430
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:55,607
Let’s stop here.

431
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,321
We better not fight each other.

432
00:26:59,082 --> 00:26:59,814
You angry?

433
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:01,982
Then punch me.

434
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:04,438
Fight me.

435
00:27:05,543 --> 00:27:06,168
Go ahead.

436
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:06,882
Yeah.

437
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,511
Show us what you’ve got.

438
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,037
I’m curious to see

439
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:16,808
just how good you really are.

440
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:24,688
Come on, Saint.

441
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:26,280
Fight me, bastard.

442
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,219
Saint, you bastard.

443
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,727
You jerk.

444
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,311
Why is he that fast?

445
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:47,357
Let’s go.

446
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:01,269
Hey. Don’t run away.

447
00:28:04,752 --> 00:28:05,653
Where are you going?

448
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,562
It’s not over between you and me.

449
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,028
Where are you going?

450
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:11,401
Let’s continue, brat.

451
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:12,877
Do you only know to run away?

452
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:15,207
Hey, Saint.

453
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,303
Saint.

454
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:25,407
Saint.

455
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,180
Damn. I thought he was Spider-Man.

456
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,114
Saint.

457
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:50,706
How could he do that?

458
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:19,610
Do you know that what you’ve done is wrong?

459
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,149
What if you missed and fell?

460
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:23,977
And you, Saint.

461
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,914
Jumping down like that is dangerous.

462
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,026
Anyway,

463
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,571
what did you do on the rooftop?

464
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:33,635
Hum?

465
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:35,648
What’s your problem?

466
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:37,429
Can you tell me?

467
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,571
If you don’t want to tell us, then you don’t have to.

468
00:29:43,896 --> 00:29:45,207
This time, I’ll let you off.

469
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:48,503
But if this kind of incident happens again,

470
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,016
I’ll not be generous.

471
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:54,371
I’ll also report your parents.

472
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:57,205
Got it?

473
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,360
I ask if you got it.

474
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:09,358
Got it.

475
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:11,711
You can leave.

476
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,419
How did you let them go?

477
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:29,214
We still don’t know what’s going on between them.

478
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:32,269
Boys are just like this.

479
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,063
When they fight, there's often no reason behind it.

480
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,512
They might just not get along or dislike each other,

481
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,013
and that's reason enough to fight.

482
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,362
Especially, students here at Siamwit.

483
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:16,872
Why did you follow me?

484
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:23,278
Come on, I'll hold your bag for you.

485
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,072
No need.

486
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:29,023
It’s okay. I’m your gofer.

487
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:31,459
Can you stop being extra?

488
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:33,414
This is nothing.

489
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,429
I can do more than this for you.

490
00:31:47,425 --> 00:31:48,416
What the fuck is wrong with you?

491
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,605
What the fuck are you trying to do?

492
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,170
Trying to be a good guy?

493
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,152
No. I just want to do it for you.

494
00:31:59,167 --> 00:31:59,914
No need.

495
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:01,712
I don’t need any of these.

496
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:05,300
Let’s go. I’ll see you off myself.

497
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,164
Can you just stop bothering me already?

498
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:18,700
No. I cannot do that.

499
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:22,939
You are… so damn annoying.

500
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,980
Yeah, I know.

501
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,077
So, just bear with me.

502
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,930
If you don’t stop, I'll knock you out.

503
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,131
Go ahead.

504
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,454
Do whatever you want to me,

505
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,428
whatever makes you happy.

506
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,520
What the hell is wrong with you?

507
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:43,909
Don’t you understand what I'm saying?

508
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,161
- Hey. - I’ve told you.

509
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:46,162
What are you doing?

510
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:46,785
Huh?

511
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:48,623
If it makes you happy, then do it.

512
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:49,601
Let him go.

513
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,320
I’m good with it.

514
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:53,019
I told you to let him go.

515
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,361
I don’t care how big you are elsewhere,

516
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,330
but here, it's Thep Burapha.

517
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,314
Saint, aren’t you embarrassed being his gofer?

518
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:15,917
You all stay out of it.

519
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:17,715
Why are you letting him walk all over you?

520
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:21,974
These 2 girls protect you greatly.

521
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,312
Are they your chicks?

522
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,197
No. They’re my friends.

523
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:30,826
Friends?

524
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,709
Do people like you really have friends?

525
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,216
Haven't you already betrayed everyone?

526
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:39,368
Shin.

527
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:43,008
Saint and I are friends so I must protect him.

528
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:44,091
Got it?

529
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:48,709
Be careful, or you’ll regret it.

530
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,555
What’s wrong with him?

531
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,506
Saint, what happened between you guys?

532
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,802
You don’t need to know.

533
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:11,817
Is that so? Fine.

534
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:13,976
Okay.

535
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,220
Come on, Eve. Let’s go.

536
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,000
First, when will you pay me?

537
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:27,971
What for?

538
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:30,814
Girls, you heard about that, right?

539
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:33,816
Saint was dragged to the rooftop and beaten by Ken's gang.

540
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,447
He jumped off the building to escape,

541
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:38,020
climbing down from the rooftop just like in the movies.

542
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,537
After looking closely,

543
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,509
Saint is actually pretty cool.

544
00:34:41,642 --> 00:34:43,920
Right? But it’s a pity he doesn’t fight back.

545
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:45,502
Since we've been studying together,

546
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:46,912
I haven't seen him beat anyone;

547
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:48,059
I've only seen him get beaten.

548
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:52,109
And what’s worse is that he’s willing to be a gofer for the Udon Pithak.

549
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:54,100
That ruins all his coolness.

550
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:56,850
This is something I, the Thep Burapha, can't accept.

551
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:57,379
Yes.

552
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:57,948
Yes.

553
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:58,813
What do you think?

554
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,007
Do you know what it is called?

555
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,902
I just act skilly but when I’m serious, I win them all.

556
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:10,447
What do you want?

557
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,977
Miss Jan told me to collect the fine from those who came late,

558
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:17,970
50 baht each.

559
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:19,718
Why do I have to pay?

560
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,672
Yeah. My money, my rights.

561
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:24,739
I won’t pay for it.

562
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,637
But Miss Jan…

563
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:29,422
We won’t pay for it.

564
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:32,137
Any problems?

565
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:48,616
Well, I’ll pay for everyone.

566
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:49,757
Don’t pay for it, Chadjen.

567
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:52,515
It’s okay. I want to pay for you guys.

568
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:58,610
I want to pay for Shin, Tew, First.

569
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:01,499
I want to pay for Airy and Tangmay, too.

570
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,025
The total is… 250 baht.

571
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:09,672
Here you are, Cable.

572
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:12,971
Okay.

573
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,022
We paid so get lost quickly.

574
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,579
Hey, Mr. Class President.

575
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:26,208
What the hell is going on now?

576
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:30,850
Pay for the 3 of us, too.

577
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,108
Isn’t your family rich?

578
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:34,654
Your mom is the principal.

579
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,314
You should be able to pay for us, right?

580
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,274
The h*ck are you waiting for? Hurry up.

581
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,268
Hurry up.

582
00:36:58,463 --> 00:36:59,874
Well, you’re such a nice guy.

583
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:03,414
Scumbags.

584
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,703
Chadjen, I’ll pay you back.

585
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,448
Me, too.

586
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:16,275
Never mind. I want to pay for you guys.

587
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:18,674
Nah. I’ll pay you back twice.

588
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,663
The fine from those being late today.

589
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:36,720
Thanks, Cable.

590
00:37:58,397 --> 00:37:59,173
Miss Jan.

591
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:01,562
Yes.

592
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,057
This year,

593
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:06,660
I don’t want to be a class president anymore.

594
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:14,866
Why so, Cable?

595
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,066
Why don’t you want to be one anymore?

596
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,368
Being a class president gives you a special score.

597
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:25,708
Well, I…

598
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:30,168
Should we select a new class president?

599
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,819
Right. We don’t want Cable to be a class president.

600
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,223
We pity him.

601
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,234
Pity?

602
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,583
Why is that?

603
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:42,980
As you know,

604
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,071
students in Class 2 are mischievous.

605
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:48,466
Cable almost has no time to study

606
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,819
because he needs to take care of everyone.

607
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,675
Is that true, Cable?

608
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,002
Yes, teacher.

609
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,201
Won't the principal have any objections?

610
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,447
It's related to my study,

611
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,671
so my mom might not have any objections.

612
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:13,817
Due to this year, Cable, our class president,

613
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,121
is not taking the position,

614
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,106
is there anyone who volunteers to be a class president?

615
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:30,029
I volunteer to be a vice president.

616
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:32,598
Wow. “I volunteer to be a vice president.”

617
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:34,106
Grandstanding.

618
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:35,497
She volunteers.

619
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,810
Do you not want to be a class president?

620
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:40,874
I'm comfortable with just this position.

621
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,600
“I'm comfortable with just this.”

622
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,770
Didn’t you say you don’t want to be a class president?

623
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,505
You didn’t want to take care of the class matter.

624
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:50,573
I want a special score.

625
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,007
Besides, the responsibilities of the VP aren’t as heavy as the class president's.

626
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,013
Smart move.

627
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,411
Of course.

628
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,565
If no one volunteers to be the class leader,

629
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:03,816
I will use the nomination method instead.

630
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:06,158
Anyone who wants to nominate someone,

631
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,068
go ahead and speak up.

632
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,263
I have someone to nominate.

633
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,475
Who will you nominate?

634
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:34,143
Saint.

635
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,514
I nominate Saint.

636
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:03,813
Then, I’ll nominate Saint, too.

637
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:05,128
Me, too.

638
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:06,914
That’s nice.

639
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,213
Having an incompetent class president

640
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,377
will just add more burdens to the VP.

641
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:12,670
Let’s do it.

642
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:18,527
Fine.

643
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,807
Better than having the Udon Pithak as our president.

644
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,770
Since the vote was unanimous,

645
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:38,835
Saint, you are the class president until the end of the school year.

646
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,795
Well, then.

647
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:00,703
That’s all for our homeroom.

648
00:42:06,238 --> 00:42:07,665
We, Siamwit School,

649
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:09,656
are currently developing the curriculum.

650
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:15,318
It will help address the issues of students with academic and behavioral problems.

651
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:17,714
Hey.

652
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:19,268
Go ahead.

653
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,370
Is that you? Where are you?

654
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:31,980
We will start by bringing students from both campuses together in one classroom.

655
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:36,087
He’s not here.

656
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:38,225
Oops, here he is.

657
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,256
He’s here.

658
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:42,863
What are you doing, Chadjen?

659
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,222
Hey. Hey. Why are you rushing?

660
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:46,451
-Why are you rushing? - Where are you going?

661
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:47,674
- Sit down first. - Chadjen.

662
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:52,717
Then we will mix students who perform well academically with those who do not.

663
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,866
What's going on?

664
00:42:57,613 --> 00:43:00,500
Since you’re rich enough to pay the fine for your friends,

665
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,451
from now on, you better pay for us too.

666
00:43:05,346 --> 00:43:06,666
I won’t pay.

667
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,954
Why do I have to pay?

668
00:43:11,077 --> 00:43:12,217
You won’t?

669
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:14,118
I told you to pay,

670
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,672
so you must pay.

671
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,048
You must pay.

672
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,521
- Got it, brat? - Don’t hurt me.

673
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:19,321
Where’s your money?

674
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:20,965
I’m hurt.

675
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:22,506
Where do you keep it?

676
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:28,410
To create a good environment and also raise the average scores.

677
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,071
The heck are you doing?

678
00:43:31,302 --> 00:43:32,090
What’s that?

679
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:33,059
You want to fight?

680
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:33,936
Come on, you bastard.

681
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:34,918
Hey.

682
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,718
Are you okay?

683
00:43:37,777 --> 00:43:39,908
We will make them friends.

684
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:41,120
Shin, be careful.

685
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:43,125
Shin, be careful.

686
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:46,349
Shin.

687
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,638
You're really good, aren't you?

688
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:00,441
And not be at odds with each other

689
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,093
like other classes over the past 10 years.

690
00:44:04,103 --> 00:44:04,915
Shin, be careful.

691
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:08,047
Shin.

692
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,435
Shin, be careful.

693
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:12,090
Shin.

694
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:15,080
Help Shin, please.

695
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,114
Shin, be careful.

696
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:24,385
Help Shin, please.

697
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:25,272
Stop.

698
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:26,961
Stop.

699
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,770
First.

700
00:44:28,672 --> 00:44:29,282
Everyone.

701
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:32,514
Everyone, please stop.

702
00:44:34,328 --> 00:44:34,952
Stop.

703
00:44:36,825 --> 00:44:37,597
Stop.

704
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:38,717
Everyone.

705
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:40,194
Everyone, stop.

706
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:44,891
Everyone.

707
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,979
I told you to stop.

708
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,497
Can’t we separate the classrooms of students from Thep Burapha and Udon Pithak?

709
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:39,971
If we continue studying together,

710
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,451
there will be people who get bullied

711
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:42,420
and people who get hurt.

712
00:45:42,715 --> 00:45:44,420
If Miss Jan punishes Ken’s group,

713
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:45,816
they will be resentful.

714
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,324
What are you talking about?

715
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,985
Shin’s and Ken’s group are scheduled to fight.

716
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:52,016
There’s no way I can stop you, right?

717
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:53,565
What do I have to do to make you stop?

718
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:56,380
Stop acting like you know me well.

719
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,315
You and I are not friends.

720
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:01,688
Hey.

721
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:02,311
Hey.
