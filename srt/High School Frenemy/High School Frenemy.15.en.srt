Thanks so much

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,054
for asking me to stay over tonight.

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,483
I told you it’s Chingching who wanted it,

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,643
Shin, you can even invite these two?

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,367
We want Miss Jan to teach again.

10
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:27,287
We also want her to help with Ken’s issue.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,585
Sell these drugs for me.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,930
Sell them to whoever.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,005
But you have to sell them all out

14
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,992
Hey, Ken. Are you selling drugs?

15
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:36,203
Why do you two keep bothering me?

16
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:37,232
Don’t you hate me?

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,781
I have something important to tell you.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,356
I have to go abroad now.

19
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,672
Hey, Ken.

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,712
Ken, wake up.

21
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,210
Ken, let’s go to school.

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,149
Ken, wake up.

23
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:30,669
Ken, wake up.

24
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,967
We will be late for school.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,030
Ken.

26
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,950
Why did you need to sleep over here?

27
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,130
I told you not to.

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,630
No.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,338
I’m going to drag you to school today no matter what.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,825
Wake up, Ken.

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Come on.

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,047
Get up, Ken.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,090
Come on. Get up.

34
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:14,480
You’re such a sleepyhead.

35
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,429
You’re so heavy.

36
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,100
-Fine, I’m up. - Come on. Go take a shower.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Ken.

38
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,010
Ken.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Hello.

40
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,287
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,090
We came to pick Ken up to go to school.

42
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:43,090
School?

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,145
He told me he quit school.

44
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,483
What are you doing here?

45
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,630
We came to take you back to school.

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,105
Can you stop being so dramatic?

47
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:00,072
Why the hell do you want him to go back to school?

48
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,218
A guy like him will never make it far in life.

49
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:05,803
You’re wasting your time.

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,036
I don’t think it’s a waste of time.

51
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,425
It takes time for us to become friends.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,858
Friends are supposed to help friends.

53
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,450
Why do you think it’s a waste of time?

54
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,312
You are the one who is wasting his time.

55
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:39,418
Are you done talking?

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,887
Leave.

57
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,349
Why are you not leaving?

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can we go now?

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,592
Can I leave my bike at your house?

60
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:09,894
Why?

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,465
We all cannot ride on it.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,770
I’ll leave it here.

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,574
I’ll come to take it after school.

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
After school?

65
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,610
You are coming here again?

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Yes.

67
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:23,767
Then how will I go to school with you?

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,596
You all came to my house.

69
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:40,040
It’s not only to take me to school, right?

70
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,980
No.

71
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,640
We came to be your bodyguards, Master Ken.

72
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,650
You’re the boss of Class 2.

73
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,283
Why are you crying?

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,490
Is that a tear?

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,450
Your eyes are red.

76
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:03,487
I don’t know.

77
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I’m not crying.

78
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,570
Can we go now?

79
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,058
We will be late for school.

80
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Wait up, big bro.

81
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:09,970
You look cute when you feel shy.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,578
Why are you in such a hurry?

83
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,170
You also have a cute side.

84
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:40,610
IN THE END, WE ARE FRIENDS.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
I’m happy to see you all present in class.

86
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:50,363
Even though some of you are late.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,018
From now on, I want you to focus in class.

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,127
Enjoy school.

89
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,647
Live your life in school to the fullest.

90
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,352
Especially you.

91
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Ken.

92
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,709
Welcome back.

93
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,632
I hope, from now on,

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,898
you will focus on study.

95
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes, Mr. Sung.

96
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,800
Will you focus on studying or fighting with others?

97
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:37,287
Ging, watch your tongue.

98
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,712
Ken is now a good boy.

99
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,530
He won’t get into any more fights, right?

100
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,890
Miss Jan told me

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,418
that she thought she failed as a teacher.

102
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,069
She thought she didn’t do her job well.

103
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:03,709
I think she needs some time.

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,265
She’s abandoning her duty.

105
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,410
I think you should approve her resignation now.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,818
We shouldn’t be giving her time.

107
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,520
Slow down, Vice Principal.

108
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,705
We should give her some time.

109
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
She is still a Siamwit teacher.

110
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,509
I want to ask the principal to give her more time.

111
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Yes.

112
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,807
I believe that she will come back.

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,298
Don’t worry.

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,836
I plan to give her time.

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,229
To be honest,

116
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,127
I don’t want to lose her.

117
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,614
Thank you.

118
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:54,260
How is Class 2 doing?

119
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,676
We got Ken back to school.

120
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,618
He was absent for several days.

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,243
I still stand by my words.

122
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,767
I want Class 2 to be a model class.

123
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,763
While Miss Jan is absent,

124
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,876
you will need to work harder, Mr. Sung.

125
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,552
Yes.

126
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,061
I’m sure Class 2 is making progress.

127
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,796
I believe the feud from the past

128
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,385
will end this year.

129
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,774
From my experience,

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,785
these kids will never change.

131
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,050
I don’t believe that you can change them in such a short time.

132
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,643
Actually, Miss Jan and I

133
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,898
are not changing the kids.

134
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,872
They now started to understand.

135
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,083
Understand what?

136
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,174
That in the end, they are friends.

137
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,909
When they understand that,

138
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,974
fighting and bullying will stop.

139
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:26,509
Why are you in such a hurry?

140
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,312
It’s because I’m hungry.

141
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,047
Why are you so slow?

142
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:30,392
Can you walk faster?

143
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,036
I’m starving.

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,858
Eat this. It’s healthy.

145
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,920
It’s all carb.

146
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:41,738
No, there is plenty of meat.

147
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,796
This one is tasty It’s my favorite.

148
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,287
Why does the chicken look like that?

149
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:50,996
I only took a small bite.

150
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,570
You didn’t only take a small bite, Tangmay.

151
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,625
If you were going to leave your mark

152
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,036
on every piece, don’t share it with us.

153
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,207
They are in the same bowl.

154
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:00,916
It means that they all have your saliva on.

155
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,167
Where is my pineapple?

156
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:03,189
Here.

157
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,480
Can we sit with you?

158
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,541
Why are you sitting in my friend’s seat?

159
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,792
Let me sit with you.

160
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,421
Chadjen.

161
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:35,829
Thank you.

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,716
Why are you sharing your food with us?

163
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,030
It’s normal for friends to share food.

164
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,880
Ken, what did you call Shin?

165
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
Friends.

166
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,610
Can you say it again?

167
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,618
I said he’s my friend.

168
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,647
Ken, do you really accept Shin and Saint as your friends?

169
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,545
Yes, they are my friends.

170
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,298
You all are my friends.

171
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,807
Everyone in Class 2 is my friend.

172
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:13,829
You get that?

173
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:23,363
Ken.

174
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,214
Can you give me another one to give to Cable?

175
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,945
Sure, Chadjen.

176
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Here, Cable.

177
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,654
I’m also in Class 2. Can I get three pieces?

178
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:33,676
Come and take them.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

180
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,469
Did you take more than three pieces?

181
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,341
Why are you standing?

182
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,363
Have a seat.

183
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,810
It’s Vietnamese sausage.

184
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,665
It looks more like fish feed.

185
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,636
Hey, what’s going on?

186
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,950
First.

187
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,767
Now, Ken and his gang are our friends.

188
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,294
Hey.

189
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,890
Come and sit with us.

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,534
What?

191
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:07,701
Calm down and have a seat.

192
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,400
Come on. Have a seat.

193
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:11,520
Come and sit here.

194
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,465
Sit down.

195
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,425
Sit down.

196
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,145
Sit down.

197
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:15,258
Good.

198
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,887
Calm down.

199
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:17,890
Can I sit with you?

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,240
Are you thirsty? Want some water?

201
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:19,825
It’s okay.

202
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:20,494
Drink it.

203
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:20,960
No.

204
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:21,716
You drink it.

205
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:22,225
Come on.

206
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,247
I’m fine.

207
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,778
Give him some sweets.

208
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,218
It will help him feel better.

209
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,534
Give him a sugary one.

210
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:30,556
This one is delicious.

211
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,410
You can have it. I bought my meal.

212
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,040
Sweets will make you feel better.

213
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:36,076
Take a bite.

214
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,040
You eat it first.

215
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,585
Come on.

216
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:40,021
You go first.

217
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,829
Come on.

218
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:41,658
Did you put something in it?

219
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:42,916
Come on. I’ll feed you.

220
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:46,509
It’s delicious.

221
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,941
Have a bite.

222
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:49,796
Can you eat it with me?

223
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:54,694
Me again?

224
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,843
I won’t eat it. I want to eat pineapple.

225
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,232
Taste it, Ken.

226
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,385
No.

227
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,607
I brought this for you.

228
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:12,796
Thanks.

229
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:21,010
Are you Ken’s teacher?

230
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,301
I’m his former teacher.

231
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
What are you doing here?

232
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,952
Did he cause a problem again?

233
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,538
No, he didn’t.

234
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:39,600
What do you want?

235
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,836
As a teacher who has taught him,

236
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,043
though it wasn’t long,

237
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,581
I can see what his problem is.

238
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,643
I know my son is a troubled kid.

239
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,760
But a boy with his nature can’t be taught with kind words alone.

240
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,392
Sometimes, you need to use harsh methods.

241
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,025
Can I be honest with you?

242
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,458
Ken has this problem.

243
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,581
Partially, it’s because

244
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,447
you use harsh methods on him.

245
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,734
What we can do to help him solve his problem is...

246
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,883
we need to give him love.

247
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,585
All you need to do is listen to him

248
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,276
and pay attention to him.

249
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,756
Don’t judge him.

250
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,570
Don’t use violence with him.

251
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,672
You also need to cut down on your drinking.

252
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,298
I know you are mad that I’m saying this to you.

253
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,290
It’s actually not my business.

254
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,490
If you really care about his future,

255
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,196
I hope you will think about what I said.

256
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,447
Chadjen is resigning?

257
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,990
Yes.

258
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,327
This week is his last week at school.

259
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,130
Why is it so sudden?

260
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,854
He was supposed to move abroad a while ago.

261
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,563
His whole family has moved abroad.

262
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,207
He asked to stay here for another week.

263
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,101
I don’t know why he insisted on staying here longer.

264
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,801
He might want to stay with his friends as long as he can.

265
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,327
We need to get Miss Jan back.

266
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,185
If they miss the chance to say goodbye,

267
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,690
they will really regret it.

268
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,640
Both Miss Jan and Chadjen.

269
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,200
The kids of Class 2 are not the only ones who have changed.

270
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,636
You have changed too, Sung.

271
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,490
I guess so.

272
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,654
What are you doing here alone, Chadjen?

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,621
I…

274
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,170
I want to leave a message here.

275
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:08,763
What did you write?

276
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,327
You can’t see it, Saint.

277
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,174
You too, Shin.

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,225
We will really miss you, Chadjen.

279
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,207
Me too.

280
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,941
I’m glad that I attended this school.

281
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,221
I have many friends here.

282
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,814
I did right to ask my parents

283
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,334
to let me stay here a bit longer.

284
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,710
Shin.

285
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,440
Before I leave,

286
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,581
I want you…

287
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,945
to quit smoking.

288
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:37,978
Shin, you should do that for him.

289
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,392
You are leaving but you still want to stop me.

290
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,963
It’s bad for your health.

291
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,749
Saint.

292
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,123
Don’t let him smoke again.

293
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,967
If he smokes, you can tell me.

294
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,254
Sure, I’ll stop him.

295
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,003
You think you can stop me?

296
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Why?

297
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,476
Do you think I can’t?

298
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,934
Ouch. Saint, you started it.

299
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,592
Chadjen, get out of the way.

300
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,636
Stop it, Shin.

301
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,349
-Do you want to try me? - Shin, stop it.

302
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:25,461
Chadjen, get out.

303
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,643
Shin, ouch.

304
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,232
Chadjen, did you just hit me?

305
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,709
Saint, run away.

306
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,989
Here.

307
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,232
Where are you going?

308
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,905
No, Chadjen. Come back.

309
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,854
Chadjen, come back.

310
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:45,323
Chadjen, come back.

311
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,847
Saint.

312
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,934
Chadjen, don’t cover for him.

313
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:58,974
Saint, come here.

314
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You will fall.

315
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,087
Don’t do this.

316
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,141
Chadjen, help me.

317
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,530
Shin, stop it.

318
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,560
Shin.

319
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:14,561
(I’m glad that I have all of you as my friends.)

320
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,050
Why did you call me here, Cable?

321
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,676
Peeta, you don’t look well.

322
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,654
Did you get any sleep?

323
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,665
I’m fine.

324
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,829
Just say what you want.

325
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:38,901
Wait a sec.

326
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:43,832
Who are you looking for?

327
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,727
What am I waiting for?

328
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,510
Wait a sec.

329
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,574
Cable, what are you doing?

330
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,665
I called you three here

331
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
because I want to talk to you about Miss Jan.

332
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,763
About what?

333
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,258
About the school’s representatives,

334
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,370
Miss Jan didn’t want to remove Eve

335
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,541
from the team.

336
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,269
She didn’t agree to do it

337
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,538
but my mom pressured her.

338
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:40,967
You are back on the team

339
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:42,960
because I wanted to step down.

340
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,741
Miss Jan didn’t do anything wrong.

341
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:50,280
I don’t want you to misunderstand and hate her.

342
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,989
Yes, she didn’t do anything wrong.

343
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:55,360
It’s all my fault.

344
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,752
My mom is behind everything.

345
00:22:57,796 --> 00:23:00,029
I don’t want to join this stupid contest.

346
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:01,112
But what can I do?

347
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,698
My mom wants me to join it.

348
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,472
I can do nothing about it.

349
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,029
Anything I did made it worse.

350
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,447
If you want to be mad or hate someone,

351
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,730
it should be me.

352
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,392
I’ll take it.

353
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,207
Peeta, calm down. Eve didn’t…

354
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:15,381
If you have nothing else to say, I’ll leave.

355
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,647
Wait, Peeta.

356
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:19,940
Don’t worry about Miss Jan.

357
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,814
I’m not mad at her, okay?

358
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,803
But you are mad at me, aren’t you?

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,938
You two are having problems?

360
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,334
Here is your water.

361
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:13,930
Thank you.

362
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,330
Thank you.

363
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,750
I’ll get to the point.

364
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,429
I think you know why

365
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:31,127
Mr. Pongpong and I came to see you today.

366
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,530
Yes.

367
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,127
But my answer is still the same.

368
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,581
I think I’m not suitable to return to teaching.

369
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,720
Why do you think you’re not suitable?

370
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,854
I couldn’t help my students.

371
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,905
I failed as a teacher.

372
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,570
You didn’t fail.

373
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:07,420
Kids of Class 2 are much improving.

374
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:15,141
It’s because of Mr. Sung.

375
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,054
Aren’t you going to say goodbye to them?

376
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,989
Chadjen is resigning to study abroad.

377
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,603
This week is his last week at our school.

378
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,490
Can I say something?

379
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,763
Miss Jan, it’s not wrong to fail sometimes.

380
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,825
I did fail as a mother.

381
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,941
But we can learn from our failures

382
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,940
and get up to start again.

383
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:11,381
There will be many more failures in our lives.

384
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,669
The important thing is that

385
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,660
you shouldn’t give up on yourself.

386
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,210
Miss Jan, do you love Class 2?

387
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:35,389
Yes.

388
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,040
Then you should go back to them.

389
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,003
Excuse me.

390
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,032
Yes.

391
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,112
What’s up, Mr. Sung?

392
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,560
Hello, Miss Jan.

393
00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:04,101
Can you come out to the front of your home?

394
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,076
Now?

395
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,330
Yes. Someone wants to see you.

396
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,980
Guys, what are you doing here?

397
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:44,820
We are here to ask you to go back to school.

398
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,785
We failed the last time.

399
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,727
So we got more of our friends to come this time.

400
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,389
If we fail again this time,

401
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,240
I’ll take the whole school here tomorrow.

402
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:02,690
You’re so dramatic.

403
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,287
My dad called me.

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,149
He said you visited him at our house today.

405
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,581
He said…

406
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,483
if it weren’t because of you,

407
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,110
I would have never become a better person.

408
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
So…

409
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,494
please come back to be my teacher.

410
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,854
Airy, Tangmay, it’s your turn.

411
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,658
You go first.

412
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,156
You go first.

413
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,436
You go first.

414
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,861
-I said you go first. - Shh!

415
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,629
I’m sorry, Miss Jan.

416
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,603
You don’t need to apologize to me.

417
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,763
You didn’t do anything wrong.

418
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,585
We did wrong.

419
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,570
I said many terrible things to you.

420
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,749
I’m sorry for misunderstanding you.

421
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,770
Yes. I’m sorry that my friends were idiots.

422
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,945
Especially Tangmay and Airy.

423
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,258
Miss Jan, before I leave,

424
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,403
I have a favor to ask you.

425
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,570
I want you…

426
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,625
to go back to be a homeroom teacher of Class 2.

427
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,647
See, Miss Jan?

428
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,516
Everyone is waiting for you to go back and be their homeroom teacher.

429
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,087
Do you really want me to go back to school?

430
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,370
Yes.

431
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Okay.

432
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
Yes!

433
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,429
I’m sorry.

434
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,221
Me too.

435
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,898
Thank you, Miss Jan.

436
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,843
Let’s go.

437
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:55,650
Go to her.

438
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,752
Go, go.

439
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,436
Don’t step on my foot.

440
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,900
We need to pull out this stunt

441
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:08,378
for her to come back.

442
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,541
What are you talking about?

443
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,698
Alright.

444
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:15,760
Don’t pull me.

445
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:16,894
Don’t push me.

446
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,705
I’m going in.

447
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,501
I’ll call to wake you up tomorrow.

448
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,058
Are you sure?

449
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:03,872
I’m usually the one who calls to wake you up.

450
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,567
Isn’t it the same?

451
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
I’m going in.

452
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Shin.

453
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,167
Why do you keep calling me?

454
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,080
Can’t you say everything out before I leave?

455
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,956
Do you think one day…

456
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,403
you will go back to play soccer?

457
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:28,312
I don’t know.

458
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Maybe.

459
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,240
If that day comes,

460
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,083
can I be the first person you play soccer with?

461
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:47,305
Yes.

462
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,090
If I go back to play soccer,

463
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,607
you will be the first one I tell.

464
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,872
What are you doing?

465
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,207
Pinky swear.

466
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:10,807
What pinky swear?

467
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,443
We are not kids anymore.

468
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:15,745
Give me your finger.

469
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:16,774
Hey.

470
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,516
I’ll wait for that day.

471
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,472
I got it.

472
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,465
Shin.

473
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,010
What else?

474
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,363
I have a gift for you.

475
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,603
What gift?

476
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,543
It won’t be a surprise if I tell you.

477
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:43,178
What?

478
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:44,538
You’ll know when you see it.

479
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,429
Just wait and see.

480
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,458
I got to go.

481
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,829
Good night, my bestie.

482
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:08,261
See you again tomorrow, kiss kiss.

483
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,578
Kiss my ass.

484
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,538
Good morning, Miss Jan.

485
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,338
Good morning, everyone.

486
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,312
I’ll take it.

487
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
Thank you.

488
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,263
You’ve been away for several days.

489
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:33,250
Your work is piling up on your desk.

490
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,010
While you were away,

491
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
we were very busy.

492
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,476
I’m sorry for causing trouble to all of you.

493
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,920
It’s good that you are back.

494
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,094
I can’t handle Class 2.

495
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,450
Thank you for covering my class, Vice Principal.

496
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,352
It’s okay. It’s my job.

497
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,469
Miss Jan.

498
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,992
Since you’re back, don’t forget to help the kids prepare for the Thai language quiz contest.

499
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,549
Yes, Principal.

500
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:11,760
I’m confident that Eve and Peeta will do well.

501
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,930
Peeta, did you get any sleep?

502
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
The contest is coming soon.

503
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,232
I still can’t memorize everything.

504
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,487
So I need to study harder.

505
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,196
Do you need to win the first place?

506
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,105
My mom wants me to win first place.

507
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,458
You can definitely win first place.

508
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:54,290
Because you all have that expectation of me.

509
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,905
That’s why I need to study harder.

510
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,040
If I don’t win it,

511
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,080
everyone will be disappointed.

512
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,541
Don’t stress about it.

513
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,540
Look at Eve. She doesn’t stress about it.

514
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,378
All she does is hang out with Airy, Shin, and his friends.

515
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,778
Eve. Airy.

516
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,530
Come here.

517
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,967
Where are you going?

518
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,392
Peeta, where are you going?

519
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,596
Are you two having a problem?

520
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,400
You don’t need to know everything, Ging.

521
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,487
I can’t do it anymore.

522
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,981
Mom, I can’t do it anymore.

523
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,727
Can I drop out of the contest?

524
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,192
But I…

525
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
Peeta.

526
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,450
Why are you studying here?

527
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,243
I just want to change the environment.

528
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,083
Did you get any sleep?

529
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:05,687
I’m okay.

530
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,694
I should go.

531
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,716
It’s okay.

532
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,850
You should stay.

533
00:39:13,883 --> 00:39:15,592
Shin and I will be quiet.

534
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,541
It’s okay.

535
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,054
Peeta.

536
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,229
Peeta.

537
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,345
Peeta.

538
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:56,181
Peeta.

539
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:56,887
Peeta, are you okay?

540
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:57,410
Peeta.

541
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:57,985
Peeta.

542
00:39:58,014 --> 00:39:58,596
Peeta.

543
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,985
Shin, what should we do?

544
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:00,923
Peeta.

545
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:01,607
Peeta.

546
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:03,403
Saint, help me turn her onto her side.

547
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Peeta.

548
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,218
How do you know what to do?

549
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,254
My sister often gets sick.

550
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,796
So I study about it.

551
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,912
Stop asking questions. Go get Miss Jan.

552
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,941
Yes.

553
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Peeta.

554
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:33,665
Jeng’s drug.

555
00:40:58,661 --> 00:40:59,661
Peeta.

556
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,945
Your friends found you

557
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,287
having a seizure and unconscious.

558
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,090
You are now safe.

559
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:20,872
Miss Jan.

560
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,036
Will it be okay if I…

561
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,480
drop out of the contest?

562
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,440
Of course.

563
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,581
Will everyone be disappointed in me?

564
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:53,934
Peeta, you don’t need to try to please everyone.

565
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,934
I want you to do only what you want.

566
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,047
But…

567
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,778
My mom is worried that I won’t get into college.

568
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,058
There will be other opportunities.

569
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:14,930
There are other ways

570
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,460
to increase your chance of getting into college.

571
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,585
You are smart.

572
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,530
I’m sure you will find a way.

573
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,970
One more thing, you are not alone.

574
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,650
You have me and your friends.

575
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,952
They will be there and support you.

576
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,236
I don’t have friends anymore.

577
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,523
That’s not true.

578
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,385
There’s a friend who is very worried about you.

579
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,625
Do you want to see her?

580
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,232
Eve.

581
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,552
Are you okay?

582
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:53,330
I’m very worried about you.

583
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,430
I’m sorry, Eve.

584
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,870
I was terrible.

585
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,403
I’m sorry.

586
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,338
I’m sorry for saying terrible things to you.

587
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,345
I never wanted to stop being your friend.

588
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,803
Can we go back to being friends?

589
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,287
Peeta, you are my best friend.

590
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,890
I’ll never stop being your friend.

591
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,905
Eve.

592
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,069
I’m sorry.

593
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:51,076
I’m sorry.

594
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,070
Don’t cry.

595
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,749
I’m not the only one who worries about you.

596
00:45:42,763 --> 00:45:44,740
They all do.

597
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,814
I’m sorry.

598
00:45:55,272 --> 00:45:56,810
I forgive you.

599
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,229
How is Peeta?

600
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,112
She’s now safe.

601
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:16,189
Don’t worry.

602
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,109
How are Eve and Peeta?

603
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,174
I heard them crying.

604
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,378
Yes, they are having problems.

605
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:27,796
Do they reconcile?

606
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,323
Yes.

607
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,760
Even if they have another fight,

608
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,390
it will be okay.

609
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,912
What do you mean?

610
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,629
They are friends.

611
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,989
Even when they are mad or fight,

612
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,410
it’s not a big deal.

613
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,189
They will eventually forgive each other.

614
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,185
You are right.

615
00:46:57,352 --> 00:47:02,865
Miss Jan, can we go in to see Peeta?

616
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,974
Will we interrupt them?

617
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,454
Wait a bit longer, Chadjen.

618
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:15,450
Let’s give them some time alone.

619
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:20,585
Yes.

620
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,090
What’s wrong?

621
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,072
You look down.

622
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,305
I feel guilty about Peeta.

623
00:48:16,596 --> 00:48:18,590
I didn’t pay enough attention to her.

624
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,432
All this time,

625
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:24,123
I didn’t even notice that she had problems.

626
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,534
Then be good to her after this.

627
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,920
You still have the chance to do that.

628
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,730
I’ll be good to her too.

629
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,392
Because she’s your friend.

630
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:43,341
Thanks.

631
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,790
Sure.

632
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,756
Shin, I…

633
00:48:56,778 --> 00:48:58,232
Shin. Saint.

634
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,890
Let’s go say goodbye to Peeta.

635
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,018
So we can go home.

636
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Okay.

637
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,112
Is everything okay?

638
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,770
Yes.

639
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,880
Peeta is now safe.

640
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,360
But the doctor wants to monitor her for a few more days.

641
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,589
Principal.

642
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,501
Yes.

643
00:49:34,887 --> 00:49:36,880
About the quiz contest,

644
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:39,530
Peeta wants to drop out of the team.

645
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,140
I talked to her mom.

646
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,603
Did she agree to do it?

647
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,380
Yes.

648
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:54,980
Then let’s talk about this.

649
00:49:59,156 --> 00:50:01,636
If a kid like Peeta can get access to it,

650
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:04,989
I’m worried the drug may be spreading in our school.

651
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,821
What should we do?

652
00:50:43,112 --> 00:50:44,112
Give it to me.

653
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,614
Go home safely.

654
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,138
Wait, Shin.

655
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,654
You call me again.

656
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,530
What?

657
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,458
I have something to give you.

658
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:05,203
What is it?

659
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,538
Why are you eating the same thing every day, Chingching?

660
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,967
Saint, my mom is coming this way.

661
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,298
You should leave.

662
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,790
Go.

663
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
Let’s share it with Shin.

664
00:51:21,316 --> 00:51:23,170
What are you waiting for? Go.

665
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:27,790
Hurry up.

666
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:33,996
Go.

667
00:51:41,287 --> 00:51:42,287
Go.

668
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,700
This is not right.

669
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,680
Shin.

670
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,730
Shin.

671
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,032
Saint, what are you doing here?

672
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:41,905
I have something to give you.

673
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:43,010
You can give me later.

674
00:52:43,032 --> 00:52:44,800
No. I need to give it to you today.

675
00:53:05,258 --> 00:53:06,509
Damn.

676
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,029
I keep my promise.

677
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,040
I bought you cleats.

678
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Actually…

679
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:22,487
I wanted to give you a long time ago.

680
00:53:22,523 --> 00:53:24,960
But I never had the chance.

681
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,505
Saint.

682
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,247
Get out.

683
00:53:38,276 --> 00:53:40,094
I told you not to come to this house again.

684
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:42,550
Mom, don’t scold Saint.

685
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,218
Chingching, this is not your business.

686
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Mom.

687
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,150
I…

688
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,410
Saint…

689
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:56,425
Aunt.

690
00:53:58,283 --> 00:54:00,280
Please give me permission to be Shin’s friend.

691
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,610
No.

692
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,003
Get out.

693
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,229
Please give me another chance

694
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,807
to be Shin’s friend.

695
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,905
Saint, I think you should go.

696
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
No.

697
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,934
I don’t want to run away anymore.

698
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,981
Don’t you want to be my friend?

699
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,301
We are friends.

700
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,330
That’s right.

701
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,669
Then we should explain it to her.

702
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:34,901
If we keep running away,

703
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,792
you and I will never be happy.

704
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,178
No matter what,

705
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,043
I’m going to stay friends with him.

706
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,920
Shin.

707
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,047
Saint is my brother.

708
00:55:19,076 --> 00:55:22,203
I want him to be Shin’s friend.

709
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,854
Even though he broke my leg in the past.

710
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,043
He ran away and disappeared for several years,

711
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,760
In the end, he’s still my friend.

712
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:57,883
I know that he is a good person, Mom.

713
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,436
Chingching and I will be happy

714
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:10,530
if you will forgive him

715
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,723
just like I did.

716
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,621
I bought noodles for you.

717
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:08,650
And for Mom.

718
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,174
Who did you call Mom?

719
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,276
What is going on?

720
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:13,680
I think it’s about the drug.

721
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,130
Police suddenly raided here.

722
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,636
I think we have a spy.

723
00:57:17,658 --> 00:57:21,141
You need to die if you want to leave my gang.

724
00:57:21,163 --> 00:57:22,480
Shoot me.

725
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:24,130
My friends will take revenge on you.

726
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,934
Are you sure you’re going in with me?

727
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,450
Yes, I won’t leave my friend.

728
00:57:38,632 --> 00:57:40,450
We can help Ken get out.
