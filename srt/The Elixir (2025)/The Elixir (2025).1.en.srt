-Here you go, Uncle.
-Which one's mine?

00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,066
-The one on the right.
-Oh, thank you.

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,818
-This is great. Thank you, Sih.
-Please enjoy.

00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,078
-Excuse me, sir.
-Hey, Man, have something to eat first.

10
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,080
-All good, sir.
-Come on, try some food.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,877
-Ningsih.
-Excuse me, ma'am.

12
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,338
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes, go ahead.

13
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,215
Ningsih, listen.

14
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,347
I can explain.

15
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,349
Explain what?

16
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,935
If you don't want to propose, then don't.

17
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,272
Why would you make a promise?
And then ghost me for days.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,941
It's not that.

19
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,861
I was just waiting for the right moment.

20
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,279
What right moment?

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,656
For me to die?

22
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,450
Don't say that, it's not good.

23
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,413
Okay.

24
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,666
I was wrong.

25
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,501
I was mistaken.

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,711
I wasn't ready.

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,297
I was overthinking things.

28
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,175
Forgive me.

29
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,152
Yes, sir?

30
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,072
Pardon me, I was just stopping by.

31
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,825
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,627
Ningsih, I…

33
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,505
I have to get back to work.

34
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,384
Ningsih.

35
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,386
My Ningsih.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,473
What's left to wash? It's already clean.

37
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,310
Look at me! Come on, look at me.

38
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,480
I promise.

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,857
This time it's different.

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,277
You are my priority. Okay?

41
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,697
I have to go to work.
I'll come back this afternoon.

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,408
And I'll wash all the dishes. Okay?

43
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,036
I'm so sorry.

44
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,787
-I really am.
-Hey, hey, hey.

45
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,831
-But--
-Okay?

46
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,585
-You said you have to go to work--
-I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

47
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,672
Okay, I forgave you.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,715
Smile.

49
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,343
Smile.

50
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,723
Yeah, that's it.

51
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,558
Be careful.

52
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,564
This afternoon!

53
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,649
Okay!

54
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,068
Before dark!

55
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,311
-Oh, my God!
-Sri, Sri. Get up!

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,814
-Mat! Are you okay?
-Get up, Mat!

57
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,023
Help!

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,403
Hey, bastard!

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,696
Who are you?

60
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,199
Have you lost your damn mind? Hey!

61
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,827
Fucking idiot! Get out!

62
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,496
Get out!

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,039
Get out!

64
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,586
Bastard!

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,963
He's drunk.

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,965
This guy OD'd.

67
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,387

We've worked on this for three months.

Skip Food and Drug for now,
submit once the boss approves.

74
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,641
Don't forget the other one.

75
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,478
One for the boss,
the other for Mrs. Grace.

76
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,104

-Thank you.

-Jaka.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,782
-This is for the boss. Take care of it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

80
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,451
This one's for Mrs. Grace. Okay?

81
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,328

Mr. Jaka.

88
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,458
What's that?

89
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,253
The usual. It's the boss's sample,
so be careful.

00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,756
Hope this weekend goes well, Mbok.

91
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,799
Indeed.

92
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,926
I want them to feel comfortable here,

93
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,469
no matter what.

94
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,895
I always pray

95
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,606
that Mrs. Karina and Mrs. Kenes

96
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,860
can be friends again.

97
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,782
You two were childhood friends.

98
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,705
But you haven't spoken
to each other for three years.

99
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,086
I really miss

100
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,506
how it used to be, ma'am.

101
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,550
So do I.

102
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,930
Excuse me, ma'am.
There's a delivery for Sir.

103
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,224
-Just leave it there. Thanks.
-Okay.

104
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,443
Are you done, Han?

105
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,861
Not yet.

106
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,950
Oh, I know.

107
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:19,290
I bet you can't pee
'cause you haven't excused yourself.

108
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,044
Excused myself to whom?

109
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:29,467
To the trees, grass, and soil.

110
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,761
Well, to nature.

111
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,721
We have to be kind to nature,

112
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,473
so it will be kind to us.

113
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,891
Give it a try.

114
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,187
Excuse me.

115
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,106
Excuse me.

116
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,573
It's working, Mom.

117
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,325
See?

118
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,285
Thank you, nature.

119
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,037
Now Raihan can take a pee.

120
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,121
Here, sweetheart.

121
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,125
Watch your hand. I'm closing the door.

122
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,587
Okay.

123
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,008
All good? Careful, sweetheart.

124
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,721
Nes. Could you please be nice
to Karina this time?

125
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,682
What's her deal?

126
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,891
Dad's the one to sign.

127
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,185
That's the thing.

128
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,064
I wanna push him to sign this weekend.

129
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,109
If Karina's upset, your dad will be too.

130
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,236
And we're the ones affected.

131
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
The deal won't go through.

132
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,656
Got it?

133
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,077
Okay, Rud, so we can split up faster too.

134
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,249
All good, Han?

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,834
Yes, Dad.

136
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,085
Okay.

137
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,279
What is that, honey?

138
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,579
A sample.

139
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,004
Once everything's settled,

140
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,174
let's go on a little trip.

141
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,635
Another honeymoon.

142
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,432
Where else do you wanna travel, babe?

143
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,189
Didn't we take a trip last month?

144
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,566
Yeah, but this one's different.

145
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,528
You're retired now, more relaxed.

146
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,239
Who knows, we might come home with…

147
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,201
a new family member.

148
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,050
Sir.

149
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
Mr. Aris.

150
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,679
How are you?

151
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,097
I'm fine.

152
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
-Di.
-Welcome, ma'am.

153
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,478
-What time did you leave Jakarta, ma'am?
-We left while it was still dark.

154
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,313
Is it heavy? Want me to carry that?

155
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,524
-Yay!
-Be careful, sweetheart.

156
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,942
Han!

157
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,944
Raihan, come here, dear.

158
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,364
Don't get too excited.

159
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,573
We just got here.

160
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,991
Look, you're sweating.

161
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,370
How was the trip?

162
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,746
You guys hungry?

163
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,081
Nes.

164
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:49,875
Mrs. Kar!

165
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,585
Hey, sweetheart!

166
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
How did you grow up so fast?

167
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,050
Hey, I made your favorite fried chicken.

168
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,635
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

169
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,764
Come on. What did you promise me?
No fried food, you just got over a cough.

170
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,437
Excuse me, ma'am.

171
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,105
Excuse me, ma'am.

172
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,148
Yeah.

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,193
-Hi.
-Rud.

174
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,529
Kar.

175
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,905
Mom--

176
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,867
This is for Dad.

177
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,289
-Where's Dad?
-Still in the shower.

178
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,458
Okay, thank you.

179
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,967
Well, well.

180
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,427
See?

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,805
See? It's better-- Hey, hey.

182
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,057
Hey, hey. They got me. Oh, my.

183
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,642
-Oh, my. They got me.
-Boo!

184
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,560
Fu--

185
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,608
You little squirt!

186
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,026
Let me go!

187
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:01,071
-I stayed up two nights to hit that level.
-I don't care.

188
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,365
You rascal.

189
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,786
Did you come alone?

190
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,413
I'm with Mom and Dad.

191
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,123
How could I come here alone?

192
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,418
Who knows, maybe you can drive now.

193
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,796
No, no, no.

194
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,380
That's the new one.

195
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,759
-We'll try it together, okay?
-Okay.

196
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,803
Okay? Go play with another one for now.

197
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,223
Han.

198
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,725
How's your mom and Mrs. Karina?

199
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,102
-Like always, they're still fighting.
-Yeah?

200
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,813
You know how moms are.

201
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,816
Yeah, right, but that's your mom!

202
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,570
How did they fight? Were you involved?

203
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,448
-Mom told her…
-Yeah?

204
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,951
…I can't eat the fried chicken she made.

205
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,245
Even though my cough has gone.

206
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,955
Well, that's okay.

207
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,625
Just so you know,
her fried chicken isn't tasty anymore.

208
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,252
-Uncle.
-Yes.

209
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,671
What's wrong with our family?

210
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,339
What do you mean?

211
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,968
Mom and Dad are fighting,

212
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,469
Mom and Mrs. Kar as well.

213
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,595
Everyone fights.

214
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,850
Well, your mom and dad's fight
is their business.

215
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,645
Mrs. Kar and your mom's fight
is their business too.

216
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:19,108
What matters is that
we're always strong together.

217
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,235
-Right?
-Of course.

218
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,947
Up first, then…

219
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,283
We'll practice again later.

220
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,578
Honey, they're here.

221
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,121
Tell them to wait for a while.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,834
What the…

223
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,672
What the…

224
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,555
What the…

225
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,321
For over 40 years,

226
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:11,368
Wani Waras herbal medicine
has been a favorite among Indonesians.

227
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,165
Now, with global support…

228
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,708
It's still a work in progress.

229
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,753
-…Wani Waras herbal medicine goes global.
-Any thoughts? Good?

230
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,421
WANI WARAS - CENTRAL JAVA
SINCE 1983

231
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,840
Wani Waras, Nusa Farma Company.

232
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,760
Why is there no picture
of the Wani Waras factory?

233
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,386
Nes.

234
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,265
Our factory is so old and shabby.

235
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,517
It'll put off potential investors.

236
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,520
Still, Dad wouldn't like it
if he saw this.

237
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,147
You know how Dad is.

238
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,942
But he'd like the money, right?

239
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,485
I mean…

240
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,322
He still wants to sell our factory.

241
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,575
It's Dad's factory, not ours.

242
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,035
But I'm the one running it.

243
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,413
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, Bambang!

244
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,666
What's that?
It's too dangerous. Come here.

245
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,919
Don't play with it. Look at you sweating.

246
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,630
Relax, Nes. This doesn't hurt, you know.

247
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,215
Check this out, look!

248
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,716
-See?
-Hey, Bang.

249
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,013
Bang, you're being such a kid.

250
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,307
Grow up a little, will you?

251
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,937
Go to that job interview with Uncle Ical.
Stop slacking off.

252
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,356
You didn't show up to the interview again?

253
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,067
If I show up,

254
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,695
he'll dump me in the middle of nowhere.

255
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,990
Dad won't have friends left
to get you jobs, you know.

256
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,326
That's just your opinion.

257
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,537
Like you've ever worked a day
in your life?

258
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,038
No, right?

259
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,751
So let's just sit tight and wait
for the merger to finish.

260
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,379
I get the money, you get the money,

261
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,424
and when you get it,
you can walk away from…

262
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,012
-Raihan, don't copy him.
-Raihan, stop it.

263
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:54,972
Good job.

264
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,515
Dad's got shot.

265
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,853
Where are they?

266
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,069
Honey?

267
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,614
Your hair…

268
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,075
What the…

269
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,912
Your face-- How?

270
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,666
This is all thanks to this.

271
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,341
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Look, look, look.

272
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,120
So when's the signing? Huh?

273
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,455
Here.

274
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,249
I've got the contract.

275
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,460
This weekend, if possible.

276
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,799
So we get the money then?

277
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,967
Well, that depends on Dad.

278
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
Dad.

279
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,181
-Dad? Huh?
-Dad.

280
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,682
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

281
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:26,396
-You look so different. Looking fresh.
-Nah, I only took a shower. Why?

282
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,898
Did you dye your hair?

283
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,484
No. Why, do I look young?

284
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,823
Rud, I've seen your video.

285
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,158
-What do you think?
-Awful.

286
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,495
You didn't show the factory.

287
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,291
Don't you remember
that Wani Waras is very down-to-earth?

288
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,964
Full of local culture and nature.
So why all these buildings?

289
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,675
What were you thinking? Are you ashamed?

290
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,595
Worried Nusa Farma
will try to lower the price?

291
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,680
Grandpa!

292
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,140
Hey!

293
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,018
Oh, my, my little champ is getting so big!

294
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,607
I'm gonna talk to your dad, your mom,
and your uncle.

295
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,944
Go ahead and play there, okay?

296
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,864
Hey, Raihan.

297
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,786
-Kar, how come Dad looks so young?
-He wasn't looking like that this morning.

298
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,916
Dad, did you just have
some treatment or something?

299
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,085
I'll explain.

300
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,337
After thinking it over,

301
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,090
I've finally decided

302
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,968
not to sell Wani Waras.

303
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,636
-What?
-Dad?

304
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,513
So no money for us?

305
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,015
What do you need it for?

306
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,518
-Well--
-What for? So you can have more toys?

307
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,355
-Bang.
-Where are you going?

308
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,398
Fu…

309
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,482
Gonna grow up!

310
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,817
Bang!

311
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,153
Let him be.

312
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,779
Well…

313
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,991
Listen carefully.

314
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:08,123
For a long time, our company
has been considered stagnant.

315
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,249
Never progressing.

316
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,585
Always considered a small-time company.

317
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,756
So I have no choice
but to take the Nusa Farma offer.

318
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,342
Does that change anything?

319
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,552
Does it?

320
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,179
It doesn't.

321
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,513
Why?

322
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,601
Because there's nothing special
about our herbal medicine!

323
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,146
But now…

324
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,148
You have to see.

325
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,150
THE ELIXIR

326
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,612
This is the new herbal medicine.

327
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,571
SAMPLE

328
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,824
This is gonna change everything.

329
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,326
The potion of eternal youth.

330
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,706
You see, I don't have gray hair, right?

331
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,251
I don't wear glasses.

332
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,711
This morning, I still had gray hair.

333
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,172
My voice hadn't changed either.

334
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,341
Why's that?

335
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,386
All thanks to this.

336
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,014
This concoction will change the world.

337
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,811
I call this herbal medicine "The Elixir."

338
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,482
Honey.

339
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,612
But weren't you set on retiring?

340
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,781
Kar.

341
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,452
I owe you my deepest apologies.

342
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,873
But right now, this is my priority.

343
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,252
Wani Waras herbal medicine.

344
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,921
This doesn't make sense.

345
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,883
Dad, you know
Rudi and I are getting a divorce.

346
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,303
Let's not talk about that here.

347
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,512
I have a plan, Dad.

348
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,389
I want to start my own business.

349
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,684
So Raihan and I won't have to rely
on anyone else.

350
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,561
Let's talk this over calmly, okay?

351
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,981
That chance ended
when you slept with Lisa from Nusa Farma.

352
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,693
Hey, cut it out! Enough!

353
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,239
Have you two even considered
what'll happen to Raihan if you divorce?

354
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,407
Have you?

355
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,576
Kenes.

356
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,037
Have you ever actually
taken care of yourself?

357
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,665
Have you ever even tried
to make yourself look attractive?

358
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,085
Have you?

359
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,923
How am I the bad guy here?

360
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,343
-It's not like that, sweetheart.
-Honey.

361
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,971
-She's right. It's not fair if--
-Don't defend me!

362
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,062
Do you even realize?

363
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,564
Do you?

364
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,442
-Why's Bambang acting that way?
-Sweetheart.

365
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,695
Because you constantly get everyone
to go along with whatever you want.

366
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
Sweetheart.

367
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,156
Always gotta keep you happy.

368
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,742
Even if it hurts us,
even if it makes us angry.

369
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,036
Even when you married my best friend!

370
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,245
Kenes!

371
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,498
Why drag me in?

372
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,957
Of course I did!

373
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,503
My dad's been delusional
since he married you!

374
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,547
-I've tried to explain it so many times.
-Explain what?

375
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,174
I wanna know.

376
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
How much you love Dad?

377
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,595
Is that it?

378
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,642
Bullshit, Karina!
You just want Dad's inheritance, right?

379
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,018
-Nes--
-Stop!

380
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,902
We've been friends since we were kids.
I was always there for you.

381
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,946
When you lost your mom,

382
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,824
when you got pregnant,
and when you had to marry Rudi--

383
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,493
So what do you want me to say, huh?

384
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,870
You wanna hear me say "Thank you"?

385
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,706
I'm warning you.

386
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,251
Never mention my mother again!

387
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,088
Did you forget what I caught you and Dad
doing back then? You forgot?

388
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,967
You were naked with Dad
in my mother's room!

389
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,427
Enough!

390
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,763
Kenes! Rudi!

391
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,934
Don't bring Wani Waras
into your personal problems.

392
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,769
My decision is final.

393
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,980
I won't sell Wani Waras!

394
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,691
Dad.

395
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,651
Dad.

396
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,364
Dad, please. Let's talk this out.

397
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,451
What else do you want to talk about?
What else, huh?

398
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,121
You just care about money, don't you?

399
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,540
-Dad, listen to me.
-What?

400
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,293
Have you ever appreciated
the struggles I went through

401
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,212
to build Wani Waras from nothing?

402
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,881
Have you?

403
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:31,303
For decades, I worked in Wanirejo
while you lived lavishly in Jakarta!

404
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,220
Hey, Kenes.

405
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,057
Have you ever offered
to help me with anything?

406
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,642
You too!

407
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,729
Have you ever said thank you to me?

408
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,814
You never even said thank you!

409
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,399
-Honey.
-Babe.

410
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,944
They don't even know
how to be grateful to their dad.

411
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,656
Always asking, never giving!

412
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,702
Paying no respect to your parents.

413
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,620
Look at this!

414
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,663
-This is your cash machine.
-Dad.

415
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,956
Dad!

416
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,208
Dad! Dad!

417
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,292
Honey.

418
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,972
Never respect their parents.

419
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,727
Dad, what's wrong?

420
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,979
-Sweetheart…
-Dad. What's wrong?

421
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,022
-Honey.
-Dad.

422
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,150
Sweetheart…

423
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,485
Babe…

424
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,237
Dad, Dad!

425
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,113
Dad?

426
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,324
-Honey?
-Dad!

427
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,493
Dad!

428
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,499
Dad!

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,085
Dad, Dad, Dad!

430
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,753
-Dad!
-Honey!

431
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,302
-Dad, Dad, Dad!
-Honey!

432
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,679
-Dad?
-Help me!

433
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,055
-Lift his head!
-Slowly!

434
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,807
-Rud, help me!
-Honey!

435
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,642
Dad!

436
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,643
Honey.

437
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,187
-Rud!
-He's stopped breathing.

438
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,481
-Don't say that!
-Don't say that! We need help!

439
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,566
Call the hospital!

440
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,067
Hurry up! Now!

441
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,820
-Bang, help carry him to the car, quick!
-Wait.

442
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,572
-What are you doing?
-Wait!

443
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,324
-Dad! Wake up!
-Mbok Sum! Mbok Sum!

444
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,411
Mbok Sum!

445
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,037
Mbok!

446
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,914
-Oh, my God.
-Help…

447
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,166
Get Pardi and Mr. Aris.

448
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,002
Help me get him into the car now.

449
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,212
-Now!
-Yes, ma'am.

450
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,841
-The nearest ambulance is in Sleman.
-Keep looking. Find another one.

451
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,009
-Where?
-Grandpa?

452
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,344
-On the internet! Find it!
-Yes, this--

453
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,471
Find a clinic or something!

454
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,311
Clinic. There is a clinic nearby.

455
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,651
-Mommy.
-Yes, sweetheart?

456
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,112
Dad?

457
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,450
Dad! Dad?

458
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,909
What's going on, ma'am?

459
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,703
Oh, my God.

460
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,257
Sir?

461
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,009
Sir? Sir!

462
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,637
Sir! Sir! Sir!

463
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,514
Sir, pull yourself together! Sir!

464
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,058
Sir!

465
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,774
Help!

466
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,734
Dad? Dad!

467
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,486
-Dad!
-Help! Stop, sir!

468
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,820
Dad, what's wrong?

469
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,406
Dad? Dad! Dad!

470
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,659
Mr. Aris. Oh, my…

471
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,744
Dad? No, Dad! Dad!

472
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,746
Dad, please!

473
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,000
-Nes, pull him!
-Honey!

474
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,961
-Dad, stop!
-Honey, stop!

475
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,964
Nes, help me!

476
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,549
Please pull him.

477
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,009
Honey!

478
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,927
Pull!

479
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,347
Dad, stop it!

480
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,017
Nes, help me!

481
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,978
Nes! Nes!

482
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,822
Dad?

483
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:24,953
Dad?

484
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,162
Honey!

485
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,039
Dad?

486
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,374
Honey!

487
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:40,844
Dad?

488
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,405
Mr. Aris.

489
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,201
Don't tell them anything.
Just say it was an accident.

490
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,913
But you gotta bring the police here.
I'll do the explaining. Okay?

491
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,707
Mr. Aris, listen to me!

492
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,710
Yes, sir. Got it.

493
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,296
-Clean all the blood first.
-Yes, sir.

494
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,714
Go.

495
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,370
-What happened to Mr. Sadimin?
-I don't know, Mah.

496
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,540
I only heard a voice from behind.
He sounded possessed.

497
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,707
-What?
-Don't say that!

498
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,959
Bambang!

499
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,043
Hey, Bang!

500
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,254
Bang!

501
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,756
Bambang!

502
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,508
Bang!

503
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,718
Where are you--

504
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,682
Bang.

505
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,852
Open the door, please.

506
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,438
I know you're freaking out.

507
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,088
Dad never appreciated me.

508
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,925
He's always undermined me.

509
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,598
Look at this.

510
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,934
He never gave me a new car.

511
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,272
And sure,
I never fulfilled his expectations.

512
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,694
Instead, I killed him.

513
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,575
You didn't kill him.

514
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,911
I was there. I saw it.

515
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,790
This wasn't your fault.
I was there. It was an accident.

516
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,213
Dad didn't want you to go.

517
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,508
You have to protect me.
Who will look after me if you're gone?

518
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,559
What exactly happened to Dad?

519
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,686
Why did he act like that?

520
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,689
I don't know.

521
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,691
Ma'am.

522
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,862
-Pardi.
-What is it?

523
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,823
-Unconscious.
-What?

524
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,034
We need to take him to the clinic.

525
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,994
-Unconscious?
-Yes.

526
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,792
What is it? Han.

527
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,300
Pardi?

528
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,844
Oh, my God!

529
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,890
Pardi…

530
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,435
Handle him, Mbok Sum! Go on!

531
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,689
Watch out, Mbok!

532
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,193
Pardi!

533
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,945
Watch out, ma'am!

534
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,698
-Pardi! Hey!
-Mbok Sum!

535
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,783
Rud, help me!

536
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,493
-Pull yourself together!
-Mrs. Kar!

537
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,580
Pardi.

538
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,708
Ma'am!

539
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,001
Pardi, it's me!

540
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,505
Pardi! Pardi, what's going on?

541
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,696
Help! Help! Help!

542
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,947
Nes. Nes.

543
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,266
Nes, get in the car!

544
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,835
We have to take her to the hospital.

545
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,109
Rud!

546
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,237
Rudi!

547
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,616
Rud?

548
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,078
-Nes! What do we do now?
-Bang.

549
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,705
-What do we do?
-Bang, where are they?

550
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,415
-Rud?
-What?

551
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,625
Rudi.

552
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,212
Raihan!

553
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,296
Han!

554
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,467
Rud?

555
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,389
Rudi?

556
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,057
Bang.

557
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,102
Oh, fuck.

558
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,523
-Find them.
-Rud? Rudi?

559
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,734
-Kar!
-Raihan? Han?

560
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,069
Mbok Sum?

561
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,946
Rud?

562
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,243
He's not picking up.

563
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
-Nes.
-Rud?

564
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,290
-Did he answer the phone?
-No.

565
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,584
-Wait, I'm still trying.
-Keep calling.

566
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,377
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

567
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,425
Bang.

568
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,844
-That's Imah, right?
-Yes, that's Imah.

569
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,639
Bang! Bang!

570
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,894
Close it!

571
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,233
Wait for me! Come on, where are you?

572
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,152
-Did he answer the phone?
-No.

573
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,905
-Keep calling. Come on, hurry up.
-Okay, okay.

574
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,826
Let's go.

575
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,956
Where is Suji?

576
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,465
Ji? Ji!

577
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,508
Bang!

578
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,887
Come on, let's get out of here.

579
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,644
I'll try to call him again.

580
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,182
Have you lost your damn mind?

581
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,143
Hey!

582
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,145
Get out!

583
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,064
Hey!

584
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,526
Bastard!

585
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,902
He's drunk.

586
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,864
Sir?

587
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,890
Let's go there!

588
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:30,808
I'm afraid.

589
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,018
Hurry up!

590
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,022
We'll ride in this car. There, there, Son.

591
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,317
-Kar, check the door.
-Please hurry up.

592
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,986
Okay, wait a while.

593
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,655
-Is it locked?
-It's locked.

594
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:58,979
Pardi!

595
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,357
Pardi! Stop!

596
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,776
Dad!

597
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,450
Pull him!

598
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,495
Come out!

599
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,919
-Ma'am!
-Karina, come here!

600
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
Kar, Mbok Sum.

601
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,303
Come on, let's go.

602
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,138
Let's get out of here!

603
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,895
Rudi, Rudi, Rudi.

604
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,398
Rudi, where are you?

605
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,567
Get out of the house now.

606
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,986
Pardi attacked us like Dad.

607
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,738
Can she pick us up?

608
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,200
Earlier, Imah and Suji also attacked us.

609
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,702
I don't know what's going on.

610
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,371
Tell me your location,
so I can pick you up.

611
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,332
The rain's too heavy. We have to get you.

612
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,043
-Raihan is fine, isn't she?
-Where do we meet?

613
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,046
We're close to the Chief's house,
we can go there.

614
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,298
Tell her we'll meet at the Chief's house.

615
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,676
Nes, Karina said to meet up
at the Chief's house.

616
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,053
The Chief's house.

617
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,472
-Where's the Chief's house?
-What? I don't know.

618
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,141
How come you don't know?
Bambang doesn't know where it is.

619
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,643
What? He doesn't know?

620
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,770
What does he know in this world?

621
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,439
Do you know where it is?

622
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,482
Yes, I know.

623
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,651
-I'll share the location.
-Let's go there now.

624
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,444
Yes. Hurry up, I'll wait.

625
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,947
Can I talk to Raihan for a sec?
Where is he?

626
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,782
No time, let's meet there.

627
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,950
Rud?

628
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,243
Rudi? Hello?

629
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,453
How is Raihan?

630
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,497
Now what? Where do we go now?

631
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,290
-Okay, we go--
-Where to?

632
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,211
-It's my son. We have to pick him up.
-Calm down, you have to calm down now.

633
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,254
My son!

634
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,259
-Is this the Chief's house, Mbok?
-Yes.

635
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,512
Come on!

636
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,350
Excuse me. Chief? Sir?

637
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,270
This is his house, right?

638
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,437
What is it, ma'am?

639
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,902
Mr. Aris, ma'am.

640
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,282
They're just like Pardi.

641
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,450
Mr. Aris.

642
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,119
We need to find somewhere safe.

643
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,663
Come on, come inside.

644
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,966
-Karina! Karina, don't!
-Mbok Sum! Mbok Sum!

645
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,638
Watch out!

646
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,729
-Karina, don't! Stop it!
-Mbok Sum!

647
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,067
Karina!

648
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,444
Stop it! Let it go!

649
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,290
Bang, we passed the turn. Go back.

650
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,959
We should turn left. Turn left.

651
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,255
Okay, hurry up.

652
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,519
Nes, what happened to them?

653
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,691
Oh, my God.

654
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,525
Goddamn it!

655
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,901
What do I do?

656
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,912
Drink this, sweetheart. It's still warm.

657
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,583
Where are you, Rud?

658
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,544
I'm here.

659
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,462
Where are you? I can't see you.

660
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,715
In the Chief's house. Where are you?

661
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:22,052
I'm right in front of his house!
Where are you? I can't see you.

662
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,179
We're stuck, damn it!

663
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,473
There are so many people
eating people out there.

664
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,434
-Nes, Nes!
-Do you hear that?

665
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,935
-Follow the car horn!
-Nes!

666
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:37,860
Nes!

667
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,699
-Nes, stop it!
-Rud!

668
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,492
Nes, they're looking at us!

669
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,717
I can't do it. I can't.

670
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,344
-Don't leave Raihan!
-We'll find another way!

671
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,767
Bambang, be careful!

672
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,771
Watch out! Watch out!

673
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,693
-Hurry up!
-Okay. Okay.

674
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,039
Hurry up. I'll call Rudi.

675
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,062
Karina. That's-- That's Dad's car.

676
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,690
-We have to go there.
-All right.

677
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,721
I'll check the car. Take Raihan.

678
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,765
-Karina! Take Raihan.
-Okay. Come here.

679
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,559
-Go with her.
-Come here.

680
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,859
Damn! It's wrecked. Fuck!

681
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,443
The car won't start!

682
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,075
Dad…

683
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,743
-What is it, kiddo?
-Dad…

684
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,043
Damn. Run! Run, run, run!

685
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,088
Damn! What is that?

686
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,047
Bastard!

687
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,549
Fuck!

688
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
Damn it!

689
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,769
There! Go inside the house!

690
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,897
Help! Help!

691
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,814
Help!

692
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,654
Get in!

693
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,490
Rudi!

694
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,784
Come! Come here if you dare!

695
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,038
Rudi!

696
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,168
Damn it!

697
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,564
Daddy?

698
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,278
Mbok Sum…

699
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,821
She…

700
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,660
She's gone.

701
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,119
I can breathe again…

702
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,999
Fuck! He didn't answer the phone!
Where are they?

703
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,835
We left Raihan behind.

704
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,254
Okay. There must be other roads.

705
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,881
Maps, maps, come on.

706
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,175
Bang, we can't keep going.

707
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,635
There's no more road ahead.

708
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,845
-There's got to be a way!
-No!

709
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,973
You want me to turn around and face them?

710
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,307
-We gotta get Raihan!
-You nuts?

711
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,518
-No more roads!
-Check it correctly!

712
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,479
-No more roads ahead.
-Let me see!

713
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,730
Bang! No more--

714
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,941
-Watch out!
-Hey, hey! Nes! Nes!

715
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,986
Watch out for the cart! Bambang!

716
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,423
I'll be damned.

717
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,801
Oh, my God, the car…

718
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,553
I'll be damned. Fuck!

719
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,521
Sir! What happened?

720
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,315
-There's an accident.
-We're already late to the event!

721
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,994
Sir? Are you all right?

722
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,705
Ma'am. Are you okay?

723
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,790
Let me help you.

724
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,292
Slowly.

725
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,384
I'll take you to the health center, okay?

726
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,303
-No need.
-It's okay. I'll take you.

727
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,846
I'm fine. I'm fine.

728
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,106
Nes.

729
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,321
-Let's go, Mom.
-That's…

730
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,406
Nes, that's…

731
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,515
Help!

732
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,692
Help! Help!

733
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,902
Hey!

734
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,986
Hey, sir!

735
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,780
Hey, bastards, that's my truck!

736
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,407
-He'll die, Nes.
-Don't.

737
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,301
Help! Help!

738
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,095
We have to run.

739
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,304
What? Where to?

740
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,473
There's the police station! Hurry up!

741
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,008
Are you okay?

742
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,426
I'm okay.

743
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,469
Wait here.

744
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,264
I'll look for a rag.

745
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,844
Dad?

746
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,475
Have you tried calling Mommy?

747
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,794
I know I argue a lot with your mom.

748
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,881
But I still love her.

749
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,595
And I love you.

750
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,931
Don't you forget that.

751
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,810
From now on…

752
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,981
you have to be able to look after Mom.

753
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,941
Why are you saying that?

754
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,235
-Where are you going?
-I love you.

755
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,821
You have to be able to look after Mom.

756
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,031
You're a big boy now.

757
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,327
Why?

758
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,164
Why, Dad?

759
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,084
Stay right here.

760
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,627
Wait for Mrs. Kar.

761
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,963
Don't follow me.

762
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,301
What's wrong, Dad?

763
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:06,803
Dad…

764
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,430
Rud?

765
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:17,772
Raihan.

766
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,566
-Dad.
-Come here, sweetheart.

767
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,778
Dad? Daddy…

768
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,742
Daddy!

769
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,832
Rudi! Rudi!

770
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,751
-Dad!
-Please don't!

771
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,836
-Dad!
-Rudi, stop!

772
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,887
-Dad!
-Rudi!

773
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,764
Dad!

774
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,607
Rudi.

775
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,361
This way.

776
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,446
Raihan!

777
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,412
Please don't, Rudi!

778
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,207
Rudi! Stop!

779
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,526
Dad!

780
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:45,860
Dad!

781
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,154
Dad!

782
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,325
-Dad! Dad!
-Get back. Get back, sweetheart. No.

783
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,370
-Dad!
-No! Don't!

784
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,419
Dad…

785
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,712
Why did you put it here?

786
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,881
The storage is full, sir.

787
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,134
We'd destroy them tomorrow anyway.

788
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,051
Yes, sir.

789
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,219
All right then.

790
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,387
Nobody smokes.

791
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,098
-If this burns, the station blows up.
-Yes, sir.

792
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,851
And it'll take us even longer
to get promoted.

793
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:18,893
Roger that, sir.

794
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,353
Wait for me!

795
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,230
-Hey, hey, sir!
-Wait, wait.

796
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,314
Ma'am.

797
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,275
-Sir. Help--
-Please calm down.

798
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,486
-What happened?
-We had an accident. The car overturned.

799
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,487
Where?

800
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,990
Over there. The car in the rice fields.

801
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,783
Anybody hurt? Dizzy?

802
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:34,993
-I'm fine.
-Careful, sir.

803
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:38,163
Help, sir. I need to borrow a car
to get my nephew.

804
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:42,375
Calm down. Is it an accident,
or do you just want to borrow a car?

805
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,794
-Both, sir.
-How come?

806
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,338
All right then, sir, ma'am.

807
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,382
Please have a seat for now.

808
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,343
-There's no time, sir.
-Tell the whole story.

809
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,013
-Take a breath.
-Calm down. Calm down.

810
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,182
You need to check outside. There's chaos.

811
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,101
-All right, we'll take a look.
-There are so many people.

812
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,730
-Der! Go see what's happening outside.
-Yes, sir.

813
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:08,735
Sir, you can't just send one person.
Lots of people are dead outside.

814
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,111
-Many dead outside.
-How?

815
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,489
Please, sir. I need a car to get my son.

816
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,492
-So many dead!
-Sir! There are many people outside.

817
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,828
-Emergency, code 810. Please check, sir.
-What?

818
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
What happened?

819
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,083
Sir, please stay with us here.
Don't leave us.

820
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,337
Sir, ma'am, calm down.
Sir, please sit down.

821
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,256
All of you, get ready. Come on!

822
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,800
-Should I come, sir?
-No. Just me and the boys.

823
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,427
Sir.

824
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,305
Raihan, be strong, my dear.

825
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:41,267
We must stay strong together.
Stay close to me, okay?

826
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,022
Mrs. Kar!

827
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:50,985
Who are you?

828
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,866
Are you possessed too?

829
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,076
Possessed?

830
00:58:58,159 --> 00:58:59,827
No, we're not.

831
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,459
What are you doing in my house?

832
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,171
They chased us.
Then we saw this house and hid.

833
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,506
Mrs. Kar…

834
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,474
Who's that?

835
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,101
Who's that, ma'am?

836
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:25,979
Don't.

837
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,865
The car is in the rice field.

838
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,661
Oh, no!

839
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,582
-Sir!
-What's that?

840
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,669
-Sir, what's that?
-Wait. Hold on.

841
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,507
This is bad.

842
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,440
Fire the tear gas! Now!

843
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,524
Sir!

844
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,486
What the heck, sir? It's not working!

845
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,490
Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!

846
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,912
Retreat! Retreat!

847
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,997
Sir!

848
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,124
Sir!

849
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,756
Bastard!

850
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,720
Back off! Back off!

851
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,097
Back off!

852
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,516
Back off!

853
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,728
Back off!

854
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,403
Ningsih, sorry.
I can't go to your place yet.

855
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,404
Rahman.

856
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,199
Uncle, Auntie,

857
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,494
Mom, and Dad, they're all gone.

858
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,164
What? What do you mean they're gone?
Did they have an accident?

859
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,832
How did they die?

860
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,836
No, they didn't have an accident.
I was at Idham's house,

861
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,756
and suddenly, these people came.

862
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,218
-Wait, where are you right now?
-At home. Where are you?

863
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,844
-Man!
-Rahman?

864
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,137
-Man!
-Call you back.

865
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,347
-Hello?
-Danger!

866
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,765
Hello?

867
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,018
What happened, sir?

868
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,104
Close the door!

869
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,484
Hold it, sir!

870
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,027
I'm holding the door!

871
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,656
Use the cabinet!

872
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:42,782
The cabinet!

873
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,034
Bambang, move!

874
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,411
Come here.

875
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,917
Man! This one. Use this chair!

876
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,510
-Sir!
-Hold the door!

877
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,637
Come on, Bambang!

878
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,350
Don't let them get in.

879
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,519
-Hold it, sir.
-Okay.

880
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,774
Sir, what happened?

881
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,196
Don't let those people in.

882
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:25,700
Here, sir.

883
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,201
Sir.

884
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,620
Sir, sir! Sir…

885
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,247
Sir.

886
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,501
Hang in there, sir.
I'll go get some help. Hang in there!

887
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,461
Sir! Sir!

888
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,921
Please hold the rag.

889
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,174
I wanna call-- Sir-- For help.

890
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:42,717
Sir!

891
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,140
Hello. Yeah. Wanirejo Hospital?

892
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:51,642
Please send an ambulance
to Wanirejo Police Station.

893
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,644
Just come here.

894
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,070
Sir?

895
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,536
-Sir?
-Don't.

896
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,621
-Bang?
-Don't.

897
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,539
Sir?

898
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,417
Sir?

899
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,342
Shoot him.

900
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,886
There's no use talking
to him anymore. Shoot!

901
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:28,763
-Sir?
-Sir!

902
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,724
-Damn it.
-Bang!

903
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,063
Idiot!

904
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:37,980
Sir!

905
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,485
Sir!

906
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,742
Why did you shoot him? He's my commander.
You could be charged with murder.

907
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,161
If I didn't shoot him, we'd be dead!

908
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,079
Dead how?

909
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:53,996
What?

910
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,999
Bang-- Bambang…

911
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,835
-That's…
-Bang?

912
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,294
Sir?

913
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,842
Sir!

914
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,226
-Bambang!
-Calm down. I'll protect you.

915
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,310
Bambang!

916
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,193
Nes, help!

917
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,612
Nes, help me! Nes!

918
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,751
-Help me, sir!
-Okay.

919
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,214
Watch out! Your hand!

920
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,767
WANIREJO POLICE STATION

921
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,352
Sir, sir. Sir.

922
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,189
Could we call

923
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,819
another police station
to ask for help? Is it possible?

924
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,779
What's wrong with my commander?

925
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,114
And the people outside?

926
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:14,577
Sir, it's not important to find out why.

927
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,370
We have to find a solution.

928
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,748
But how do I explain
what's wrong with them?

929
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,042
Let's just be frank about it.

930
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,294
There's a riot, and many people have died.

931
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,129
-Sir, come on.
-Please.

932
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,012
Hello?

933
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,806
Sleman Police Station? Report, sir.

934
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,600
From Wanirejo Police Station.

935
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:41,437
I want to report a riot between residents.

936
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,815
Casualties including
three police officers.

937
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,984
Requesting immediate reinforcements ASAP.

938
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:14,845
Nes.

939
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,514
Nes.

940
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,433
Nes.

941
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,644
Nes?

942
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,027
There, there.

943
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,823
You have to calm down.

944
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,993
I'm sure Raihan is fine.

945
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,746
He's a strong child.

946
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,998
Smart.

947
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,584
I'm sure he can survive.

948
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,175
Well, I don't care about Rudi.

949
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,595
I hope his dick gets bitten.

950
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,474
No, no. So he can't cheat on you anymore.

951
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,476
I can't accept that.

952
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,563
He cheated on my little sister.

953
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,030
Calm down.

954
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,033
Reinforcements are coming.

955
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:21,996
Are you sure?

956
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:24,373
Sure.

957
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,376
Mr. Rahman himself said that.

958
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,134
UNKNOWN NUMBER

959
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,513
Who is that?

960
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,348
I don't know. It's an unknown number.

961
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,685
-Hello.
-Nes!

962
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,437
Kar? Karina?

963
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,606
Nes, are you okay?

964
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,899
Kar, where are you?

965
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,902
At a local resident's house,
near the Chief's.

966
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,445
What about you and Bambang?

967
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,405
Kar, where is Raihan?

968
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,990
He's with me. Just a sec.

969
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,493
Han, this is your mom.

970
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,412
-Han! Han!
-Uncle!

971
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,581
Raihan, this is Mommy, sweetie.

972
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,958
This is Mommy. You're okay, right?

973
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,211
Yes, Mom. Mrs. Kar's taking care of me.

974
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,296
When are you picking me up?

975
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,715
I can't come over just yet, sweetie.

976
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,510
But I'll be there, I promise.

977
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,220
But you're okay, right?

978
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,472
I'm fine, sweetie. I'm fine.

979
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,765
Where's your dad?

980
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,266
Daddy…

981
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,186
Nes.

982
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,230
Where's Rudi, Kar?

983
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,315
Rudi…

984
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,653
Karina, where's Rudi?

985
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,779
He turned.

986
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,116
And attacked me and Raihan.

987
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,544
Are you 100% sure
that he has turned or not?

988
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,630
Just like Dimin, Nes.

989
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,470
Kar, Kar.

990
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,182
Kenes and I are still stuck
at the police station.

991
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,767
We can't go anywhere yet.

992
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,687
Help from Sleman Police Station
is on the way.

993
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,232
When they come, we'll get to you, okay?

994
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,151
Okay, Bang. Yeah.

995
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,111
I wanna talk to Raihan again.

996
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,362
Okay, wait.

997
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,409
Yes, Mom.

998
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,289
Sweetie…

999
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:33,127
You're doing great. Really great.

1000
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:40,551
I'm sorry, I can't pick you up right now.
But I will. Wait for me, okay?

1001
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,011
Okay, Mom.

1002
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,029
Hey, hey. It's okay.

1003
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:03,991
He will be fine.

1004
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,062
-Sir! Ma'am!
-Yes?

1005
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,146
Help me!

1006
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:37,191
Help me! Hold the door.

1007
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,318
Okay. Come on.

1008
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,871
Monitor. Wanirejo One, come in.

1009
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,123
-This is Sleman 204.
-Hold it!

1010
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,917
Wanirejo.

1011
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,543
Wanirejo One, come in.

1012
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,171
-This is Wanirejo!
-Is this Wanirejo One?

1013
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,423
This is Wanirejo. Come in.

1014
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,300
We can't go in!

1015
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,219
Hey. Move away!

1016
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,012
Sleman 204, do you hear me?

1017
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,597
Situation under control, sir?

1018
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,225
Shoot, Yon! Shoot! Shoot…

1019
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,561
Hello, Sir? Monitor.

1020
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,254
-Hurry up!
-Hold it, Nes!

1021
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,255
Bang!

1022
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:43,924
Come on, sir.

1023
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:06,780
So many of them.

1024
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,615
That's our help.

1025
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,034
Supposedly.

1026
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:14,913
-How's Raihan doing?
-I don't know.

1027
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,486
Hello, Nes.

1028
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,404
It's a bust, Kar.

1029
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,031
What do you mean?

1030
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:53,577
The rescue team didn't make it.
No one survived.

1031
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,752
-So, what now?
-I have no idea.

1032
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:04,838
What's Raihan doing?

1033
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,469
He's eating. He's starving.

1034
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,637
Okay. Okay.

1035
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,098
Please take care of him.

1036
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:18,227
You guys stay inside. Don't go anywhere.

1037
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,145
Don't come out, okay?

1038
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,982
We can't go anywhere either.
We're stuck here.

1039
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,193
Do you remember

1040
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:32,658
when we were trapped at school
because of the flood?

1041
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,577
How could I forget?

1042
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:40,082
Waiting for your journalism club meeting
until late. I wasn't even part of it.

1043
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,459
And then my dad picked us up, right?

1044
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,963
Insane. I really miss your dad.

1045
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:51,343
He used to pick us up so much.
Almost every day.

1046
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,012
Even my dad never picked me up.

1047
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,182
Your father always picks us up.

1048
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,726
I'm sorry, Kar.

1049
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,147
I wasn't there when he died.

1050
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:06,650
But you were always there for me.

1051
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,112
Nes…

1052
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:13,907
I really do love Dimin.

1053
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,245
But I should've put your feelings first.

1054
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,081
I know.

1055
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,587
I also know that my father loved you.

1056
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:32,301
But do you know
what breaks my heart the most?

1057
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,098
I lost my best friend, Kar.

1058
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,727
I lost you too, Nes.

1059
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,312
Kar.

1060
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:47,232
If anything happens to me and Bambang…

1061
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,818
Don't be ridiculous, please.

1062
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,907
You have to try and take Raihan
far away from here.

1063
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:56,617
Okay?

1064
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:07,753
Yes, I promise.

1065
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,339
Okay.

1066
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,608
There's more of them now.

1067
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,154
Sir. What should we do?

1068
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,741
I have to pick up my nephew.

1069
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,373
Are they still human or not?

1070
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:48,961
Of course not.
You can't even talk to them.

1071
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,256
They just wanna kill and eat people.

1072
01:15:55,050 --> 01:16:02,057
God is the greatest…

1073
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,399
But they still wanna pray.

1074
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,905
-God is the greatest…
-No, they don't.

1075
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,033
They're just following the sound.

1076
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:24,246
God is the greatest…

1077
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:33,964
He's dead.

1078
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:36,466
Wait a minute.

1079
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,760
Poor him.

1080
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,349
Do you have a lighter?

1081
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,809
Here it is.

1082
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,498
My motorbike.

1083
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,547
We can go to my motorbike.

1084
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:25,849
POLICE

1085
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:33,857
Sir.

1086
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,487
You only called one police station.

1087
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:44,117
Are there no other police stations
or precincts to ask for help?

1088
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,745
I'm not sure if they can come quickly.

1089
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,122
I'm afraid the front door
will already be breached.

1090
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:54,711
This is the only way to pick up Raihan.
And we have to pick him up now.

1091
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:57,130
Trust me.

1092
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,513
Here's the safety.
Aim, and pull the trigger.

1093
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:12,145
Do I really have to shoot people?

1094
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:14,314
They're not human beings anymore.

1095
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,233
You can do it.

1096
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,694
-Here.
-Okay.

1097
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,614
-Can I use that?
-Yes, you can.

1098
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,121
It's working.

1099
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:41,091
Ningsih, I'll get the motorbike first,
then I'll pick you up.

1100
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:43,135
Are you sure?

1101
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,680
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

1102
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:49,015
I'm 90% sure.

1103
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,601
Well, 85%.

1104
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,186
I'm serious!

1105
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:57,315
It's fine. Don't worry. Just wait for me.

1106
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,193
Be careful.

1107
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:01,862
Thank you.

1108
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,285
Ma'am.

1109
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:11,705
My boyfriend will pick us up.

1110
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,782
There are still so many of them.
Are you sure?

1111
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:47,699
Yeah.

1112
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:51,912
-You sure wanna open it?
-Yeah.

1113
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:55,290
-Hold on. You sure wanna open it?
-Yes, I'm sure.

1114
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,584
-For real?
-Seriously.

1115
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,878
-There's so many out there.
-I'm sure.

1116
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,592
Just open the door slightly.

1117
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,895
-What should we do about this?
-Move! Move!

1118
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,230
Watch out!

1119
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,570
Hold the door!

1120
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,158
The door won't hold.

1121
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,119
-Sir! Sir!
-Is there more?

1122
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:34,704
Sir! Sir!

1123
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,961
-Try this one. Where is the lighter?
-You wanna open it again?

1124
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,553
Careful.

1125
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,617
Is it clear?

1126
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,206
-Let's go.
-Run. Run!

1127
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:31,219
-Come on, catch up.
-What? What do you mean?

1128
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,014
Sir!

1129
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:37,142
It's them. Shoot them.

1130
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,978
It's them, sir!

1131
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,234
Be careful!

1132
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:49,404
He's dead! Shoot the head!

1133
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:50,906
They're getting closer!

1134
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,450
Shoot the head!

1135
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,457
Hit!

1136
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,792
Nes. Calm down.

1137
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,921
-Bambang!
-What?

1138
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,301
They're coming closer!

1139
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,097
Now what? Where do we go?

1140
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:19,559
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

1141
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:23,563
Bambang!

1142
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,233
Hold it!

1143
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,287
-Bang!
-Shoot them, Nes!

1144
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:41,081
Careful!

1145
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,920
What are we gonna do?

1146
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,338
Push!

1147
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:49,923
-Where to?
-To the motorcycle!

1148
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,967
Nes, stay close to me!

1149
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,468
Push it!

1150
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:55,762
Calm down!

1151
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,765
Nes, stick to me!

1152
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,941
I can't breathe. I can't breathe…

1153
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,869
What are we gonna do?

1154
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,584
-Mrs. Kar.
-Raihan, stay there!

1155
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,265
Mrs. Kar!

1156
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,482
Bang!

1157
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,788
Bang? Bang?

1158
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,002
Hold it!

1159
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,507
Ma'am!

1160
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,981
Nes, why did they stop?

1161
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:17,987
Let's go over there.

1162
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,157
Follow me.

1163
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:31,960
Go, go!

1164
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:38,550
Nes! Nes! Let's go.

1165
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:51,729
Where are they going?

1166
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,819
Mrs. Kar.

1167
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:00,530
Ma'am, please don't.

1168
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,825
Mrs. Kar.

1169
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,453
Mrs. Kar. Mrs. Kar!

1170
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,554
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1171
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,640
Why are they standing still?

1172
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,435
It's the rain.

1173
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,563
I think it's because of the rain.

1174
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,236
We have to get out of here.

1175
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,741
Raihan, we leave now.

1176
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,244
We can use my motorbike, ma'am.

1177
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,164
Mrs. Kar.

1178
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,715
Ningsih, hurry up!

1179
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,643
Come on, Sih! Now!

1180
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:15,730
Okay.

1181
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:24,948
Come on, ma'am!

1182
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,288
Ningsih, hurry up!

1183
01:27:58,731 --> 01:27:59,983
-Nes!
-Bang! Bambang!

1184
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:02,944
-Bang!
-Nes!

1185
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,329
Kenes! Nes!

1186
01:28:25,758 --> 01:28:28,052
-Kenes! Nes!
-Bang!

1187
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,013
Just go to the motorcycle!

1188
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:45,987
Shoot them!

1189
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,697
I've run out of ammo!

1190
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:52,201
Back to the station!

1191
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,703
Through the fields!

1192
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:55,371
Push it!

1193
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:58,624
-Shoot them!
-I've run out of ammo!

1194
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,174
Sir.

1195
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:07,633
Sir.

1196
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,135
My sister.

1197
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:24,544
Where are we going?

1198
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:27,505
We're going to Rahman's office!
Then getting out of here!

1199
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,757
We must get out, no matter what!

1200
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,719
What is that?

1201
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,055
I don't know.

1202
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,182
Stop, stop, stop.

1203
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,273
Wait here.

1204
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,493
Turn around!

1205
01:30:58,327 --> 01:30:59,328
What's wrong?

1206
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,165
It won't start.

1207
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,416
Get off, Han.

1208
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:06,878
Can you start it?

1209
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,383
Raihan! Raihan! Raihan!

1210
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:16,846
Raihan!

1211
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:21,559
Help me, ma'am.

1212
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:27,523
Raihan!

1213
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:32,945
Ma'am!

1214
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:36,199
Ma'am!

1215
01:31:58,721 --> 01:31:59,764
Raihan…

1216
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:03,059
It won't start, ma'am!

1217
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,319
Mommy!

1218
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,155
-Mommy!
-Sweetie!

1219
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,949
Mommy!

1220
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,496
It's okay, sweetie. Mommy is here now.

1221
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:33,839
-What's wrong, Mom?
-Nothing, sweetie.

1222
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,219
Kar.

1223
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:43,599
That's…

1224
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:46,686
Come on.

1225
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:49,397
Let's get inside. Come on, Mom.

1226
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,154
Imah, don't!

1227
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,725
Hurry up, get in!

1228
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:31,063
Fuck!

1229
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,321
-Where are you?
-Rahman!

1230
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:42,074
I was going to pick you up.
Now I'm in a truck.

1231
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,911
I'm here with Mrs. Karina,
Raihan, and Mrs. Kenes.

1232
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,163
Where is Bambang?

1233
01:33:47,246 --> 01:33:50,082
-Ningsih is in the truck. With Mrs. Kenes.
-What?

1234
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,169
Nes! Is Raihan with you?

1235
01:33:53,252 --> 01:33:54,795
Yes, we're together.

1236
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,923
We'll try to go there
and pick you guys up. Okay?

1237
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,551
-Okay. My sister is still alive!
-Okay.

1238
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:05,848
-Quick. Come on!
-It's been ages since I drove stick.

1239
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:07,933
You can do it.
Just turn it on. What's hard?

1240
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,644
-Just start it.
-Not like this!

1241
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:13,689
Enough, enough!
You can drive, right? Hurry up, ma'am.

1242
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,775
-Karina, you can…
-Shut it!

1243
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:17,526
-Okay, okay.
-Okay, okay.

1244
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,904
You got this. You got this.

1245
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,740
-Slowly. Okay.
-Yeah. Okay.

1246
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,789
-Okay, okay.
-Slowly. You can do it.

1247
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,168
You got this.

1248
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,881
Kar!

1249
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,054
-Go, go, go! Hurry up!
-Move!

1250
01:34:48,307 --> 01:34:51,644
Kar, come on! Just hit them! Hit them!

1251
01:34:57,274 --> 01:35:00,027
-Hit them!
-Ma'am! Mrs. Karina!

1252
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:04,865
Move it!

1253
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,002
Why are they still going?

1254
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:19,880
That's the office!

1255
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,342
Kar, turn left. Turn left.

1256
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:24,760
Ma'am, stop! Stop!

1257
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,596
-Hit the brakes!
-I can't!

1258
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:53,289
Sweetie, are you okay? Oh, sweetie.

1259
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,421
Are you okay, Kenes? Raihan?

1260
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,426
Ningsih!

1261
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:08,429
Rahman! Please get out, ma'am.

1262
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,266
Rahman!

1263
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,896
Ningsih, are you okay?

1264
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,022
Carefully.

1265
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:20,191
Bang!

1266
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,694
Kar! Karina! Help me, please!

1267
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,279
-Sir, please help!
-What's wrong?

1268
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:27,615
-Karina, hurry up!
-Wait a minute.

1269
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,575
-Wait here.
-Kar!

1270
01:36:30,075 --> 01:36:31,577
Bang! Lift it up, Kar!

1271
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,121
We're already here. Please calm down.

1272
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,248
Calm down. Calm down. Kar!

1273
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,042
Nes, help me.

1274
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:39,585
Sir!

1275
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:41,587
It hurts! Don't pull!

1276
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:42,671
Okay, okay.

1277
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,176
Move the truck back!

1278
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:48,260
I can't.

1279
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,056
Rahman!

1280
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:06,904
Rahman!

1281
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,198
Back up!

1282
01:37:13,702 --> 01:37:15,162
Damn it!

1283
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:43,440
Kar, check the side door! Quick!

1284
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:56,453
We can go this way. We can go this way.

1285
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:58,873
-Uncle!
-Kar, come on!

1286
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:01,584
-We can go out through the side door.
-Lift it up.

1287
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:11,176
-Come on.
-We can!

1288
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,681
-Lift his legs…
-It's no use.

1289
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:17,391
I'll pull and you push.

1290
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:19,393
-Nes, stop!
-No!

1291
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:22,313
-You can do it!
-Stop, stop! Stop!

1292
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:24,481
Stop!

1293
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:28,277
All my life,
I've always run away from trouble.

1294
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,279
Well, this time I'm not going anywhere.

1295
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,157
Hey, Champ!

1296
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:37,953
Let's divide and conquer.
You take care of your mom.

1297
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,331
No.

1298
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:42,833
I'll stay here.

1299
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:53,719
Rahman!

1300
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,137
-Help me!
-Ningsih!

1301
01:38:57,681 --> 01:38:58,682
Ningsih!

1302
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,279
Back up!

1303
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,133
-Nes, enough! Nes! Enough!
-Bang, you can do it!

1304
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,051
Nes--

1305
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,648
-Rudi!
-Dad!

1306
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,197
I've run out of bullets.

1307
01:39:55,906 --> 01:39:56,740
Watch out, Nes!

1308
01:40:03,747 --> 01:40:04,623
Shoot him!

1309
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,834
Mommy!

1310
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:29,231
Rudi, stop!

1311
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,406
Karina, shoot him!

1312
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,283
Shoot him!

1313
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,246
Karina, shoot him!

1314
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:47,041
Shoot him!

1315
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:25,537
Come on. We don't have time.

1316
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,249
-Come on.
-Wait.

1317
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:30,584
Come on, Uncle!

1318
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:50,062
-Come on!
-You can do it!

1319
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:53,524
Leave, guys!

1320
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:55,859
-Come on, Uncle!
-Come on, Bang.

1321
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,787
Ningsih.

1322
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:16,547
I love you, Rahman.

1323
01:42:23,595 --> 01:42:25,139
I can't, Nes.

1324
01:42:27,349 --> 01:42:29,143
Bang, come on!

1325
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:32,229
Go! Just go!

1326
01:42:32,312 --> 01:42:34,523
-Bang, come on!
-Uncle!

1327
01:42:34,606 --> 01:42:35,607
Come on, Bang!

1328
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:40,320
-You must go now!
-No, Bang!

1329
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,742
Nes, let's go!

1330
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:51,165
Nes, we must go!

1331
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:01,049
Come here!

1332
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,260
Son of a bitch!

1333
01:43:07,556 --> 01:43:09,183
Come here!

1334
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:12,269
Hey! Come here, you bitch!

1335
01:43:16,106 --> 01:43:16,982
Bitch!

1336
01:44:07,157 --> 01:44:10,994
-Nes, we can't stay here. Come on.
-Uncle Bambang…

1337
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,204
Come on.

1338
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:20,254
This way.

1339
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:28,387
Kar, check the motorbike.

1340
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,847
-Can you drive?
-Yes, I can. Come on.

1341
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:33,558
We have to go.

1342
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,277
Please, please, please.

1343
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,529
It's working, Nes.

1344
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,949
What's wrong?

1345
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:54,329
What is it?

1346
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:56,832
What is it, Mom?

1347
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:00,377
What is it, Mom?

1348
01:45:02,504 --> 01:45:03,380
What is it?

1349
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:04,965
Mom?

1350
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,972
Sweetheart…

1351
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,310
I can't come with you and Mrs. Kar.

1352
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:19,604
-You have to come with us.
-No, it's okay.

1353
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:21,857
-If I recover…
-You have to come with us.

1354
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,650
…I will come to you.

1355
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:24,943
Okay, sweetheart?

1356
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:30,282
You have to come with us.

1357
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:36,705
Mom… Mom…

1358
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,212
You have to come with us.

1359
01:45:44,796 --> 01:45:46,214
Mom…

1360
01:45:46,882 --> 01:45:48,592
-I'm sorry, dear.
-Mom…

1361
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:53,055
Mom-- Come--

1362
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:57,726
You have to come with us.

1363
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:01,688
Nes. Nes.

1364
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:04,399
Listen to me.

1365
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:08,278
You come with us. We'll go far from here.

1366
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:11,615
I don't want to lose you again.

1367
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:13,784
Mom…

1368
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:18,789
Nes…

1369
01:46:20,248 --> 01:46:21,875
Raihan is yours now.

1370
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:26,546
You promised me you'd take care of him.

1371
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:29,007
You have to go far away from here.

1372
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,219
Okay? You promised me.

1373
01:46:39,267 --> 01:46:41,728
What are you doing? Please don't!

1374
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:43,605
-Nes! Kenes!
-Mommy!

1375
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:46,525
Mommy! Mommy!

1376
01:46:46,608 --> 01:46:48,193
Mommy!

1377
01:46:48,276 --> 01:46:49,111
Nes.

1378
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,530
Mommy!

1379
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:53,407
Mommy!

1380
01:46:55,534 --> 01:46:56,368
Mommy!

1381
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,956
Mommy!

1382
01:47:01,456 --> 01:47:03,125
-Go, Kar!
-Mommy!

1383
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,167
Go!

1384
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:06,002
Mommy!

1385
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:43,433
We left Mommy behind, Mrs. Kar.

1386
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:45,852
Forgive me, Han.

1387
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,609
THE ELIXIR

1388
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:44,578
Honey.

1389
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:47,706
Dimin hasn't responded yet.

1390
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:52,210
-Dimin?
-Yes. It's not like him.

1391
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:53,962
He's busy.

1392
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:59,134
His children.
They're having a lot of trouble.

1393
01:50:00,677 --> 01:50:02,929
But we might get in trouble too.

1394
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,557
If you don't take a shower.

1395
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:08,184
Oh, you…

1396
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:12,439
Okay, I'll shower.

1397
01:50:12,522 --> 01:50:13,523
-Come on.
-Okay.

1398
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:17,152
By the way,
have you tried the herbal medicine?

1399
01:50:17,652 --> 01:50:19,446
-Not yet.
-I see.

1400
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:22,907
HERBAL MEDICINE
SAMPLE

1401
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:26,161
-Honey!
-Yeah?

1402
01:50:26,244 --> 01:50:27,245
Honey?

1403
01:50:27,329 --> 01:50:28,538
-What?
-Look!

1404
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:30,790
Look!

1405
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:33,209
What happened to you?

1406
01:50:34,836 --> 01:50:36,296
No gray hairs!

1407
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:40,842
How did you get rid of the wrinkles?

1408
