=Fortune Writer=
(Based on the original Zhihu novel)

2
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,400
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
I fell from a cliff
and narrowly escaped death.

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,080
I've been sitting here all day thinking

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
about you since I came back.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,720
Su Yunqi, I have always felt

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,520
that meeting you is the only
good thing in my life.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
Lu Huai.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,120
Your feelings are too heavy for me.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,800
I approached you only to use you,
don't you understand?

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,440
I don't care. Just keep lying to me.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,960
Lu Huai, I don't want to be involved
anymore. Let me go.

13
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
Just consider it my fault.

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,320
Su Yunqi, I am a human.
I can feel pain too.

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,520
(Final Chapter)
(Prince Chun marries Su Luoluo.)

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,960
(Lu Huai shoots Su Yunqi to death.)

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,400
You knew instead of me, Su Luoluo saved
you when you were little.

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Our fate began because of it.

19
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
If it weren't for
all the misunderstandings,

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,680
you'd have fallen for Su Luoluo.
She's the right one for you.

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,000
There are no misunderstandings.

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,200
This hairpin...

23
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,080
It's the one I made it fall
when I first met you.

24
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,360
From that moment, you...

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,720
Right.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
So no matter who saved me
when I was little,

27
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,680
it was merely an act of kindness.

28
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,480
I know the difference.

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,200
Besides, Lady Luoluo did save me,

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,840
but I have already repaid her kindness.

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,760
When?

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,480
She gave me steamed buns,
and I granted her a favor.

33
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,880
She took my jade pendant.

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
I see.

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,440
Are there any other problems now?

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
If everyone says
I am unforgivably evil one day,

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
will you stand by me?

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
I will.

39
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,800
If one day, I need to kill someone

40
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
without reasons, what will you do?

41
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,640
No matter who you want to kill,
just let me know.

42
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,320
You needn't do it yourself. And...

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,080
If anyone tries to hurt you,
I'll kill them.

44
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,320
Su Yunqi, I have fallen for you.

45
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,840
I want to be with you.

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
Let me think about it.

47
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,120
(Can I trust him?)

48
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
(What if this is another trap
set by the Fortune Writer?)

49
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,280
(He could make others mock me
with just a few strokes.)

50
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
(Can I afford to bet on it?)

51
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,200
Miss, make a wish.

52
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,520
It takes five wen of silver,
and it really works.

53
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Is that so?

54
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,920
All requests will be granted.

55
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,880
(This world is manipulated
by the Fortune Writer.)

56
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
(To whom else can I request?)

57
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,444
(Together Forever)

58
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:55,744
(Together Forever)

59
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,180
(Together Forever)

60
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,200
(Is there truly no hope?)

61
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,180
(Together Forever)

62
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,440
No matter where you go, I'll find you.

63
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,680
If you take a step back,
I'll move forward.

64
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,000
(Lu Huai, I believe in you.)

65
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,640
(We can survive together against fate.)

66
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,632
(Together Forever)

67
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,872
It's late.

68
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,400
Yeah, it's late.

69
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
You should go back now.

70
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm afraid you'd run.

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,600
So you're gonna watch me all night here?

72
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,280
Playboy.

73
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,440
What?

74
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Playboy...

75
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,640
No, try again.

76
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
Lu Huai.

77
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
No.

78
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm really sleepy. I'm going to bed now.

79
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,960
Alright, I'll make a bet then.

80
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,560
What?

81
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,640
I have my bet on you.

82
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,040
Lady Yunqi, I'm betting on your win.

83
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
My Lady, it's time to get up.

84
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
What are you doing?

85
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,720
Serving you with washing and dressing.

86
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,120
Who asks for your service?

87
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,040
Didn't you feel
that you've always followed me before?

88
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,480
From now on, I'll follow you.

89
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,320
So, you'll give me whatever I want?

90
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,000
Of course.

91
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Then I'll ask for something tricky.
I want to see fireflies.

92
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,520
As you wish.

93
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,616
Didn't you sleep well last night?

94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
Why are you blushing?

95
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,400
The place we're going to see fireflies
is called Ethereal Valley.

96
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Legend has it

97
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,560
that the mountain god of Ethereal Valley
will bless every couple going there

98
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,560
and let them be together forever.

99
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,880
Lu Huai, I am actually a bit afraid.

100
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,560
Don't be afraid.
I will protect you for a lifetime.
