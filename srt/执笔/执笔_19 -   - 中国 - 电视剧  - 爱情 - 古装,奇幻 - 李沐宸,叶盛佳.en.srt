1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,840
Stop there!

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,200
Where are you going?

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,640
Let go!

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,960
No, the prince will blame us.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,680
Let go!

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,320
Guards! The princess is escaping!

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,200
Leave me. Go after the princess!

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,520
Miss,

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,720
could you do me a favor?

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,160
What is it?

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
Help me take care of it.

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,040
You are the last person I can see.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Only you can help me.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,680
I am about to be imprisoned.

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,480
Su Yunqi!

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,040
What are you doing?

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,440
Did you run out to see him?

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,680
What?

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,640
He looks like Yun Sheng, the wanted man
who wiped out the Guo family.

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
But he...

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,640
Yes, it is me.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,376
Take him to Imperial Prison.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Come back.

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
No.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,880
Come back.

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
No.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Let go of me, Lu Huai!

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Let go of me!

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,120
Let go of me!

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,840
Lu Huai!

32
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:37,696
=Fortune Writer=

33
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,848
=Episode 19=

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,000
Let go of me, Lu Huai!

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
What on earth do you want?

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,000
We are legally married.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
So what do I want to do?

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
Married?

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,880
That wedding doesn't mean

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,240
a thing!

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,960
You're right.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll fight you!

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,160
How so?

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,280
Isn't it just intimacy?

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,640
Don't you want me very much?

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,880
Why are you angry?

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
You're a butcher,

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
and I'm meat.

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
I just know what's best for me.

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,440
A butcher

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
and meat.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,392
Then what else? Are we fall in love?

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,160
Good.

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Then

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,000
your life

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
is in my hands.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
I know you hate me.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I cherish my life,

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
but if you want it,

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
it'll be yours.

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
To see you,

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
I've come a long way.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Why don't you turn back to look at me?

64
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,120
So what?

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
I don't care if you

66
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,600
or anyone else

67
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
is gone from the world.

68
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
I only care about myself.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah.

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Why would you care about me?

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm tired.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
Your Highness, please leave.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Come out.

74
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Lu Huai has you watch over me all day

75
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,440
and has secretly tightened security.

76
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,960
He overestimates me.

77
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,600
He fears you'll run away again.

78
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,320
He doesn't say it.

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
I'll say it for him.

80
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,480
He loves you.

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,560
(I took what should have been
Su Luoluo's.)

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,640
(The one he has fallen in love with
is Su Luoluo in the Book of Fate,)

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,720
(not me.)

84
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,520
What's on your mind?

85
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,520
Don't come closer.

86
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
You look very pale.

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Prime Minister,

88
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,440
why was the ledger

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,960
from Fuhua Mansion

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,000
destroyed before it was presented to me?

91
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,920
It is unfavorable to you, Your Highness,

92
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
so I must dispose of it
as soon as possible.

93
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,600
But Lu Huai told me

94
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
it recorded

95
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,320
the bribes you took from officials.

96
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,640
Your Highness,

97
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm loyal

98
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
to you.

99
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
Lu Huai

100
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,360
slandered me

101
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
to sow discord between us.

102
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,640
Really?

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,360
Your Highness,

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,000
His Majesty
still doesn't make a crown prince.

105
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,560
Your Highness,

106
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
you've been wanting to achieve
something to show His Majesty.

107
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,200
So,

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,680
I have been courting
support from officials.

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,200
Even

110
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,120
my beloved wife has been implicated.

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
Whenever I think of that,

112
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,120
it breaks my heart.

113
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
No need to say more.

114
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,960
Please rise.

115
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,720
I misunderstood you.

116
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,520
Thank...

117
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,880
Thank you, Your Highness,

118
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,520
for your judgment.

119
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,632
(Prince Su's Residence)

120
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,000
You've lost lots of weight,

121
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,800
and you look so bad.

122
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,720
My father even allowed you

123
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
to come to take care of me?

124
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
Strange things happened.

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
No one's paying attention to me.

126
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
What strange things?

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,560
Yesterday, the characters on tablets
in family shrine

128
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,120
suddenly all disappeared.

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,680
Besides,

130
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
things are going wrong in the mansion.

131
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
People are restless.

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,120
The butler forgot things.

133
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,880
The bowl I broke a moment ago

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
was back
on the table intact immediately.

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,160
And...

136
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Taoqi.

137
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,600
Taoqi.

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,720
What is it, My Lady?

139
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,520
What else happened?

140
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,800
What?

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,960
What is it, My Lady?

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
The Book of Fate.

143
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,800
Master Lu.

144
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
Your Highness.

145
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
How are you feeling now?

146
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,080
If you're tired, rest for a while.

147
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,920
Lu Huai,

148
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
I want to leave.

149
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,160
You're just tired

150
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,760
and need some rest.

151
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Previously, I stayed here,

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
trying all means to please you.

153
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,840
Do you think that was a great time?

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
But I hate it.

155
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
You're into me because I

156
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
celebrated your birthday

157
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,480
and took an arrow for you.

158
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,440
No one had ever done
such things for you.

159
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,480
You were moved.

160
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
That's all.

161
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,440
That is

162
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,360
what you think?

163
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,920
