(The medicine's power
must not be obstructed,)

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,400
(so she must soak for four hours)

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,560
(with her clothing loosened.)

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,520

(She appeared in Fuhua Mansion,)

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,600
(so she clearly overheard
my conversation with Jin Jiu.)

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,040
(She purposefully got close to me.)

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,120
(But what exactly is her purpose?)

20
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Why are you staring at me?

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
Su Yunqi,

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,440
what is your purpose in...

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,280
This medicine is for me, right?

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,320
I only eat

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Then forget it.

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,880
So sweet.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,280
What did you ask me?

30
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,720
I forgot.

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
Haven't I recovered from the poisoning?

32
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Why does it still hurt?

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,280
It's written in code.

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,320
We need to decipher it.

35
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
(Intimate Encounters)
Leave it to me.

36
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,760
Hurry up.

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,440
Alright.

38
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,440
Who was that ugly lady in the mirror?

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,720
It was me.

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,600
My Lady,

41
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
how can a sick person look good?

42
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,960
I don't want to live anymore

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
with a face like that.

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,760
My Lady, if you die,

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
a beautiful lady

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
like you will not be seen.

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,120
You're right.

48
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,800
Taoqi,

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
did you bring my rouge and face powder?

50
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,000
I want to restore my beauty.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Well...

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
My Lady,

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
Prime Minister gave all your rouge

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,400
and face powder Lady Luoluo.

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,200
What?

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,960
How dare he?

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,880
Did he give all of these

58
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
to Su Luoluo?

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,360
All of those?

60
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,960
My...

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,080
My Spring and Autumn series
rouge from the Stormy House?

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
The eyebrow pencil

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
from the Bamboo Pavilion?

64
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
And the Summer Special Face Powder

65
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,320
from the Dream Manor?

66
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
My Lady,

67
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
please don't be too sad.

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,080
It's okay. No worries.

69
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
I

70
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,880
want

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Su Luoluo to

72
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
get lost!

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,000
My Lady...

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Sister,

75
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,280
I've come to see you.

76
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
(She finally arrived.)

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,000
(Chapter 23)

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,240
(Su Luoluo visits Su Yunqi)

79
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,560
(and accidentally obtains the ledger.)

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,320
What's the deal?

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
To visit you, of course.

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
And I also want

83
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
to check on Master Lu.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Well,

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Master Lu is not here.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
No one will watch your show.

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
I didn't expect you,

88
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
as the Prime Minister's daughter,

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,040
to live in such a place.

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Actually, I don't like
extravagance either.

91
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
But I have to adapt to the luxury
in Prime Minister’s Residence.

92
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,440
Even the comb

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,720
is the silver twisted
jade comb from Orchid Pavilion.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,080
Look at her dirty teeth.

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,880
The silver twisted jade
comb from Orchid Pavilion

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
has long been out of fashion.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,840
Why take it as a treasure?

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,440
Take my advice.

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,680
Change your comb frequently,

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,240
otherwise, it looks oily and dirty.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Isn't it disgusting?

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Judging from her condition,

103
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,480
her health must be nearly restored.

104
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
My courtyard...

105
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,200
Is it really that shabby?

106
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,160
Yes.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
It is indeed inferior compared to hers

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,200
due to your limited salary.

109
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,160
You are

110
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,560
talking nonsense!

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,520
I am keeping clean.

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
At the very least,

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,160
my living standard is
better than yours now!

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
You really think I'd shed tears
due to your words?

115
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,960
Father is now so worried
about the ledger.

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
If I recover the ledger,

117
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
wouldn't the title

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
of the princess be within my reach?

119
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,480
Lu Huai's study room

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,200
should be this one.

121
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,080
Where would Lu Huai

122
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,520
hide the ledger?

123
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,880
Why is it the butler's ledger?

124
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:08,320
(Intimate Encounters)

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
I didn't expect

126
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,720
Lu Huai to read such things.

127
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,880
What is this?

128
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,400
Not even a picture in it.

129
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,680
What's there to read?

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,760
What are you doing here?

131
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,360
I was lost and went

132
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
into a wrong room.

133
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't read it.

134
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,560
I wouldn't read such a book.

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,640
(Really impressive.)

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
(Is the Book of Fate helping her?)

137
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,360
She could even find this.

138
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
Su Luoluo,

139
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,360
I didn't expect you
to have such a hobby.

140
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
You like such books, right?

141
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,440
Had you said so earlier,
I would ask Master Lu to send you some.

142
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Better leave them to yourself.

143
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
I am not that filthy.

144
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,120
If not so,

145
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
then why do you sneak in here?

146
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Isn't this what you like?

147
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
Who let you in?

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,200
Butler,

149
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,360
this person is

150
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,920
sneaking around.

151
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,040
I wonder what she's doing.

152
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm here to take her away.

153
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
Don't let people

154
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,160
like this in anymore.

155
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm about to send her away.

156
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,720
Go.

157
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,400
What did you say?

(Intimate Encounters)

159
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,200
Father,

160
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,400
I' m sorry.

161
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
I didn't find the ledger.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Forget it.

163
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,640
It's not your fault either.

164
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,120
You've never done this before.

165
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
Lu Huai!

166
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,000
Master Lu,

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
this is all because of you forcing me.
