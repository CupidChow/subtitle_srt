1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,280
Father, my mother was killed by bandits.

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,880
It's my fault for not discerning right
from wrong and wronging you.

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm so sorry. Father, please punish me.

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,920
There are only heartless children,

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,040
instead of heartless parents.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960
Parents don't bear a grudge
against their own children.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,480
Get up.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,960
Thank you, father.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Sister, even though
your mother has gone,

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,800
you still have Father and me.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,040
From now on,
our family will live well together.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,400
How could I forget

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,480
that I have you?

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,320
Alright, help Yunqi
back to her room to rest.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,880
Master, it seems Lady Yunqi
has changed her temper.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,480
She's just pretending.

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,760
If it weren't for the fact that only
legitimate daughter can be the princess,

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,840
I would not indulge her so.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,840
It'd be nice if Luoluo
could be qualified.

20
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:56,420

21

=Episode 4=

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,160
(Sister, even though
your mother has gone,)

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,080
(you still have Father and me.)

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,112
Just pretending.

25
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,200
She's such an eyesore.

26
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:16,612
(Mingzhi Pavilion)

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,720
Hey, what is this?

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,560
What is this?

29
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,760
(Love Knot.)

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,520
It's clearly an aphrodisiac,

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
yet it has such a nice name.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
One cup is for Su Luoluo.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
And whose drink is this?

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
(Prince Chun.)

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
I have a grudge against Su Luoluo,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,960
so I deliberately drugs her
to taint her purity.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,520
This is indeed a good idea.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
Where are they? I'll go right now.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,960
(Tianxiang Pavilion.)

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
Even I hate Su Luoluo,

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,800
I won't taint a lady's purity

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
by using such a despicable way.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
(One goes against his fate
will not end well.)

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,200
Thank you for saying something nice
for my sister in front of my father.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Actually, you are quite nice.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,840
Give me.

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,320
What?

48
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
The handkerchief for me.

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,680
What do you mean?

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,880
I've felt off lately.

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
What's wrong?

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Lately, I've been thinking about you.
I might...

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,160
Your Highness, my sister is
so beautiful that I cannot compare.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,000
Silly girl, the more you
act like this, the more I...

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
Like you.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
Why are you here?

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,520
I am willing to quit,
so you can be together.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,120
This bracelet should be given
to the princess that Prince Chun loves.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,800
Sister, don't misunderstand.
I don't deserve it.

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Is that so?

61
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,172
Oh my.

62
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:45,720
But this broken bracelet
seems to suit you quite well.

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,360
You broke the bracelet
that my mother gave you.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,320
How dare you! I have to...

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
Do you want to report me
and break off the engagement?

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,320
Your Highness,
my sister likes you, you mustn't...

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
I like him?

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,440
In the complicated palace,

69
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,040
you two are quite a match
for each other.

70
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,360
You think Her Majesty can let you marry
her if you break off the engagement?

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,120
Don't forget you're in the royal family.

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,000
You are only a pawn in the palace.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,840
You!

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Marriage is just a transaction
for your wealth and honor.

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Are you still a living person?
How pathetic!

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,920
All the people go all out to live

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
and make money.

78
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,320
Do you think everyone
is as fortunate as you?

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,520
Are love and affection important?

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,960
You need a well-born princess,
and I need wealth and honor.

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
We're just getting what we need.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,440
Your Highness, don't be too naive.

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
Do you think

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,640
you are the characters
in the love story?

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,240
Your Highness, we are the same people.

86
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,120
We will win or die.

87
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Even if you succeed in marrying me,

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,880
I can make you suffer a lot.

89
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,080
I only love one person.

90
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,600
And you dare to negotiate with me?

91
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
Because I am Su Yunqi.

92
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
I know I'm of lowly status
and don't deserve Your Highness's love.

93
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,360
I will take my leave.

94
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Luoluo.

95
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
Your Highness, don't worry.

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,160
People who really want to leave
don't say so.

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,920
Sister, why are you being so mean?

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,480
I never want to compete with you.

99
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
Su Luoluo, I dare admit what I want.
What about you?

100
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,280
Playing hard to get
is really working, right?

101
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,200
What a pity.
No matter how many tricks you use,

102
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,480
no matter how Father loves you,

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,920
you can't replace me to be a princess.

104
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
You've gone too far.

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,840
Luoluo, wait for me.

106
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,200
(What happened to me?)

107
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,400
(You've been poisoned.)

108
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,360
Poisoned?

109
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,200
I can make you suffer a lot.

110
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,920
Is it Prince Chun?

111
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,400
(You refused to drug Su Luoluo.)

112
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,240
(One goes against his fate
will not end well.)

113
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,880
(The high-perched bird
felled by an arrow.)

114
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,880
(A deserved violent death
of the femme fatale.)

115
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,000
(Lu Huai, save me.)

116
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,400
The poison she gets
is extremely dangerous.

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,280
She'd be dead if she didn't
spit out some after drowning.

118
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,320
What's the poison?

119
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,120
This poison looks strange.
I need further investigation.

120
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Can you save her?

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,160
There is a temporary relief measure.

122
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,240
Making small cuts
at her Jiuwei and Danzhong acupoints,

123
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,960
and using a silver knife to draw out
poisoned blood can temporarily save her.

124
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,544
Get started.

125
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,800
These acupoints are located on her body.

126
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,320
She doesn't seem to be married yet.

127
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,840
I am not suitable to do so.

128
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,520
You do it.

129
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,920
I'm not suitable either.

130
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,960
You need to be bold.

131
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,280
If she wakes up and makes a fuss,
just marry her.

132
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,800
Time is ticking. I have to go.

133
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,280
I'll see you out.

134
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,408
What are you doing?

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,800
To detoxify you.

136
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
How?

137
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,680
From Jiuwei and Danzhong acupoints,

138
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,816
draw out poisoned blood
with a silver knife.

139
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,960
Will you do it?

140
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,720
Do you want to survive or...

141
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,920
Do it. What are you waiting for?

142
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
Be gentle. I'm afraid of pain.

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
It's done.

144
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
Thank you, Master Lu.

145
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,520
It's getting late. You should go back.

146
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll see you off.

147
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,800
(You are amazing.
Can't believe you'd survive.)

148
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,160
(Sadly, you can't escape in the end.)

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,080
(Why was I suddenly poisoned?)

150
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,560
(Luckily, Lu Huai happened to pass by.)

151
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,240
(Could it really be Prince Chun
who poisoned me?)

152
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,840
Mother.

153
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Madam, why are you so cold?

154
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,800
Don't die.

155
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
(Cold?)

156
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Hang in there.
I'll take you to see the physician.

157
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
She's dead.

158
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,240
She froze to death in the summer.

159
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,560
What does it mean?

160
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,720
(Chapter 18, Su Luoluo Falls for Lu Huai.
Prince Chun Faces Setbacks.)

161
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,960
(In some stories, all three realms must
perish if the protagonist wants.)

162
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,936
(It doesn't matter
if anyone else lives or dies.)

163
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:19,640
So this woman died
just for Su Luoluo to fall in love?

164
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,000
This is human life!

165
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,000
Others' lives are insignificant.

166
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,280
Only she, Su Luoluo, is above all.

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
How absurd!

168
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,400
Stop crying.
Eat something to go on living.

169
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,040
(Su Luoluo Falls for Lu Huai,
but what about Lu Huai?)

170
00:15:19,556 --> 00:15:22,600
(Chapter 6, Su Luoluo Saves a Beggar.
Lu Huai Encounters His Ms. Right.)

171
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,040
After his mother died,
10-year-old Lu Huai became homeless.

172
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,120
So Su Luoluo saved Lu Huai
when they were children.

173
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,640
So cliche! If they didn't meet
when they were little,

174
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,960
then you can't make up stories?

175
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Then the next part will be

176
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,040
that Lu Huai recognizes his lifesaver,

177
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,320
and is completely devoted
to Su Luoluo, right?

178
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:06,272
