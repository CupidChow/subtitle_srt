1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Master Lu.

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,440
Master Lu?

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,440
(Wang Hu,)

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,560
(from Huainan,)

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
(lives on Anyang Street.)

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,760
(I can say
I'm here to deliver porridge.)

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,760
(Why is my first reaction hiding?)

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,640
(This is the law in novels,
there must be someone in the bathtub.)

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,040
(What law?)

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,160
(The water is so hot.)

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,320
Still won't come out?

12
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,760
Do you want to bathe together?

13
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,920
Thank you.

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,960
Master Lu,

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
the porridge I cooked for you
is on the table.

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,480
Drink it.

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,840
No.

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,080
Also,

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
it was made by my cook.

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,680
You're right.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
But...

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
Fine, Lu Huai.

23
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,080
Master.

24
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,200
Come in.

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,920
It's done.

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
Hu from West Market

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
is in charge of taking Hua
to Fuhua Mansion.

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,280
He will take our people in

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,440
at the right time.

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,920
But

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
someone has to disguise as Hua.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,320
Who should go?

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I can't do it.

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
Is there any better choice?

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,840
Hu from West Market?

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,160
Fuhua Mansion?

37
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,792
=Fortune Writer=

38
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:38,912
=Episode 9=

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,920
(We went west from West Market
and exited the West Gate,)

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,320
(arriving at Shasi Street.)

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,160
(Based on the distance,)

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
(it's Fenglin Alley.)

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,720
Once entering Fuhua Mansion,

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,120
don't hear, see, or ask.

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
Otherwise, you'll die.

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,760
Take off the blindfold.

47
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
First-rate in appearance

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,600
and figure.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
What's your skill?

50
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,400
Sword.

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Sword dance.

52
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Give her wine.

53
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,720
(It's poisonous.)

54
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,760
You won't drink?

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,120
If you dare to cause any trouble,

56
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,160
you'll die from the poison in six hours.

57
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Speak

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
and act cautiously.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,680
Third-rate

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,040
in skill.

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,520
Please get changed and come with me.

62
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,480
(Fuhua Mansion)

63
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Please.

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Please.

65
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,976
Your Highness, please.

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,640
Jin Jiu.

67
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm impressed.

68
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,240
You have a nice figure.

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,640
Why are you here?

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
No need to be surprised.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,400
This place is easier to enter
than Lu's Mansion.

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
You eavesdropped.

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,600
18 rooms.

74
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,240
What?

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,240
Fuhua Mansion has 18 rooms.

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,800
If you search one by one,

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
you'll die from the poison

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
before you find anything.

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Where is the antidote?

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't know.

81
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,480
But I know

82
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
how you can find what you want.

83
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Will that work?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
I know my father well enough.

85
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

86
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,640
-Your Highness.
- Prime Minister.

87
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,000
Please.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Please, everyone.

89
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Your Highness, Prime Minister.
A fire broke out.

90
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
What?

91
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,320
Someone released smoke. Search.

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,880
Yes.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
Have you found it?

94
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,040
Leaving together is difficult.

95
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
Give this to Master Lu.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,848
(Intimate Encounters)

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,240
The ledger?

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,440
You trust me?

99
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,200
Yes.

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,440
What about you?

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
I have my responsibility

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,600
and mission.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Take her down.

104
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Yes.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
The poison can suppress internal force.

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's go.

107
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,040
This way.

108
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,040
The antidote.

109
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,000
You go first.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,720
I...

111
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
I'm one of them.

112
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,600
(That was close.)

113
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,720
Oh.

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
It's you.

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
You drugged me last time.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,440
Stay away.

117
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
It's still unsettled.

118
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
Trying to escape?

119
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,880
Madam, I know this beauty.

120
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,680
Want to escape?

121
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Let's go.

122
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
Still trying to escape?

123
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,280
Come with me.

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
Lady Luoluo,

125
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,160
why are you here?

126
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,680
A man has been following me.

127
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,000
Master Lu,

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm so scared.

129
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,800
Can you take me home?

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
Master Lu.

131
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,520
I found it.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
But Lady Yunqi ran into Li Jia.

133
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Leave with it first.

134
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,480
I'll save her.

135
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Master Lu,

136
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
it hurts so much.

137
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,640
Master Lu,
someone really has been following me.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm very scared.

139
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Listen.

140
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm a daughter of Prime Minister.

141
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,320
If you're a daughter of Prime Minister,

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
I would be his grandfather.

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
I will definitely kill you

144
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,800
if you dare to lay a finger on me.

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,960
Come on.

146
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,880
=Chapter 22=

147
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
Su Yunqi gets what she deserves.

148
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,600
She lost her virginity in Fuhua Mansion.

149
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,560
The Armor Guard is handling a case.

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,760
Who dares to stop me?

151
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,440
Master,

152
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,360
what do you want?

153
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,560
Hold the knife steadily
when killing someone.

154
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,640
You taught me that.

155
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,040
You did very well.

156
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,080
So this is how it feels

157
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
to kill a scumbag like him.

158
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,520
Cold.

159
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,680
Cold.

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,840
Her fever is gone.

161
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,400
Why is she cold?

162
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh no.

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,440
