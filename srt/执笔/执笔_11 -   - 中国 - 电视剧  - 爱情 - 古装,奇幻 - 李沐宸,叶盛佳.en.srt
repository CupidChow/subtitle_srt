00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,840
Lu Huai.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,160
I made you a bowl of sweet soup.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,160
Try it.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,560
It's made by the cook again, isn't it?

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,840
No, it's not.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,080
I really made this myself.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,880
Just try it.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,320
Just say what's on your mind.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,440
You saved me from poison.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,480
This is my way of saying thank you.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,440
I burned my hand red

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,960
when making the soup.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,320
Look.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,880
Su Yunqi.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,520
Sometimes,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
I can't tell if you're acting.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
I wonder if you really
have feelings for me.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,640
I...

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,160
Go hide.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
Hand over the thing.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080
And I'll spare you.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Why don't you

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,120
come and take it?

24
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,440
(Chapter 24)
(An arrow is shot from south.)

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,280
(Su Luoluo takes the arrow for Lu Huai.)

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,200
What?

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,360
Su Luoluo takes an arrow for Lu Huai?

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
How come I don't see Su Luoluo?

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,200
It was supposed to be her
who came to Lu's Mansion.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,720
But you recklessly changed the plot.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,480
Cut the nonsense.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
What happens to him
now that she's not here?

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
He'll die from the arrow.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
No need to take an arrow.

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
I can just push him away.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,520
What's the matter?

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
How could it be?

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
I thought you said

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
the arrow was shot from south?

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
I didn't say there were
no arrows from north.

42
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:10,893
=Episode 11=

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,880
This is my way of saying thank you.

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
I burned my hand red

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,240
when making the soup.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Look.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,920
Su Yunqi.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
Sometimes, I can't tell

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,560
if you're acting.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,640
What were you thinking?

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,480
You took the arrow for me.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,440
(I didn't want to take it.)

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
You saved my life again.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Again.

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
(Again.)

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,120
(He has always been good to me.)

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,920
(It must be because
I saved him when he was little.)

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
(Now that we've come to this,)

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,640
(I won't)

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
(do it for nothing.)

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
Lu Huai.

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
Didn't you ask me

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,800
if I really

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,320
have feelings for you?

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
Don't talk.

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,392
The physician will be here soon.

67
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Aren't you guys
getting into trouble too often?

68
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,720
She was rescued from poison
two days before.

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
And now she's shot by an arrow?

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
I had to treat her
in the middle of the night.

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,760
I...

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm already in my late years.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,120
Can't you have me live a little longer?

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,720
Is she better?

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,880
Luckily, no critical damage was done.

76
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,000
If it were an inch closer,

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,640
she wouldn't have made it.

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Young man,

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,960
it's not easy to meet the right one
in one's lifetime.

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
You should cherish her.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
It's too late for me now.

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Huai,

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,920
I have failed you.

84
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Mother.

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,640
Mother.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,640
Mother.

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,880
Mother.

88
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,680
I've met someone.

89
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,840
She's very noisy,

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,360
chattering nonstop.

91
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,640
She is narcissistic,

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,040
and is always lying.

93
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
She is very stubborn as well.

94
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
You used to tell me

95
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,200
that I will meet someone,

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,880
who will be with me no matter what,

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,440
and never leave me.

98
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
I didn't believe it before,

99
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
but now I do.

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
However, I might not
be able to keep her.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,280
She has her own world.

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,760
After all, a phoenix
does not belong with wild dogs.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,200
You're right.

104
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,800
She was expelled from her family.

105
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,280
But given her personality,

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,360
if she desires,

107
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
she will surely find a way
back to where she belongs.

108
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,840
She'll become
Prince Chun's devoted wife.

109
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,080
They'll be inseparable,

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,960
growing old together.

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,280
Since when did you
become a smooth talker?

112
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I learned it from you.

113
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,640
She willingly took an arrow for you.

114
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,680
Make your move now.

115
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
What are you waiting for?

116
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't you want to keep her?

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
(Keep her?)

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Taoqi.

119
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,840
My Lady.

120
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
My Lady.

121
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,480
You're finally awake.

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,040
You were in coma for three days.
I've been worried sick.

123
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
Where am I?

124
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
At Master Lu's house.

125
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,960
This is silk quilt
from Jiangnan Beauty Boutique.

126
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Lu Huai is rich now?

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
It's not just the quilt.

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,400
Look.

129
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,120
Spring and Autumn series
rouge from Stormy House.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,160
The eyebrow pencil from Bamboo Pavilion.

131
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Summer Special Face Powder
from Dream Manor.

132
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,920
Great,

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,920
you are finally back.

134
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,040
Taoqi.

135
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Hurry up.

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,320
Open them for me.

137
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,080
I want to try them.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Alright!

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Master.

140
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,960
While the weather is good,

141
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,640
air out her quilts.

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,680
Also,

143
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
from now on, she can

144
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
move around freely here.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,920
No more surveillance?

146
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
My Lady.

147
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
There's something I need to tell you.

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
Please don't be angry.

149
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,360
Go on.

150
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Lady Luoluo will cut down
madam's peach tree.

151
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,280
What?

152
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,680
My Lady.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
Mind your wound.

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,960
My Lady.

155
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
My Lady.

156
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
Stop.

157
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Sister.

158
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,224
What do you want?

159
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,400
Staying in my mother's place
and cutting down her tree?

160
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
How can you be so shameless?

161
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,680
Father told me

162
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
to arrange this courtyard as I please.

163
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,080
It was me.

164
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
I ordered the tree to be cut down.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
This is my mother's favorite peach tree.

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,680
It's just a tree.

167
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
Your mother is no longer

168
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
a member of this family.

169
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Don't take your anger out on others.

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,560
If you must,

171
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,920
just blame yourself.

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
You are arrogant,
domineering and reckless.

173
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,280
This situation you're in now

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
is the clear will of Heaven.

175
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,400
You deserve it.

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,000
Deserve it.

177
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,280
Get lost.

178
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,360
Luoluo.

179
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,960
Don't be afraid.

180
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,400
Do I really deserve everything

181
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,160
that happened to me?

182
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,360
Are you okay?

183
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Lu Huai.

184
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
In your eyes,

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
am I a bad person?

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,360
No.

187
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,520
Then am I a good person?

188
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Not either.

189
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,720
Neither good nor bad one.

190
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,680
Then what exactly am I?

191
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,880
In my opinion,

192

A clear conscience is enough.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,160

is enough?
