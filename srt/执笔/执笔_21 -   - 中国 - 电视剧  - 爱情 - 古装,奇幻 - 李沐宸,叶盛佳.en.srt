1
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,160
Lu Huai.

2
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,720
Lu Huai.

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,960
Lu Huai, I'm here.

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,120
Su Yunqi, I can't believe
you're still alive.

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
You're still alive after getting shot
and falling from such a high cliff?

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,920
What do you mean?

7
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,640
Lu Huai, don't kid about that!

8
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,040
Put her in Imperial Prison.

9
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

10
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,544
=Fortune Writer=
(Based on the original Zhihu novel)

11
00:01:56,544 --> 00:01:57,632
=Episode 21=

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,120
Let me out!

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,480
I want to see Lu Huai!

14
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,560
Who are you to see Master Lu, the
Deputy Commander of the Armor Guard?

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,320
Deputy Commander of the Armor Guard?
Isn't he Prince Su?

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
Sheer nonsense!

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
You must be muddled
after the fall from the cliff.

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,960
When did I fall off a cliff?

19
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,280
The news is all over the capital.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,640
You were jealous of your sister
as Prince Chun liked her,

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,600
so you kidnapped her to the cliff.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,560
Fortunately, Master Lu shot you
down the cliff.

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,280
Lady Yunqi, just bear the sufferings
in Imperial Prison.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,520
(Isn't what he's saying
the content of the Book?)

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,520
(The Fortune Writer did it.)

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Lady, we meet again.

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,040
It's you!

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,440
Sorry, the seedling
you asked me to take care of

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,320
couldn't be taken with me.

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
It doesn't matter.
Life is unpredictable,

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
and fate is unfathomable.

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
You remember it?

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
It's a bit dirty. Just wipe it off.

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
You believe me?

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,480
I believe you because
I have never killed anyone, either.

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Then why did you admit it?

37
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,920
Because my role is a murderer.

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Everyone in this world
has been assigned a role.

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,504
I happen to be a murderer.

40
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,280
And you are destined to be
the wicked legitimate daughter.

41
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,240
You're aware of
the Fortune Writer in this world?

42
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,960
Now that you're wronged
for something you've never done,

43
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,800
and even to be beheaded,

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,200
why do you have no resentment?

45
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,240
Because I have no attachment.

46
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,720
You scoundrel, get out here!

47
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,400
Tell me why the Fortune Writer
can control everyone's memories

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,640
except yours.

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Because I have no attachment.

50
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,800
You've completely disgraced me!

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,000
It's unfortunate of my family
to have such a wretched daughter.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,440
Come back home, and I will
punish you with family rules.

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,864
-I want to see Lu Huai.
- Isn't it embarrassing enough?

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,280
Luoluo is going to marry
Prince Chun tomorrow.

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,080
You'd better behave.

56
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,800
After the wedding,
you can go wherever you love to.

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,240
Get as far away as you can.

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,760
You'd better not push me any further.

59
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Are you trying to rebel?

60
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,280
Yunqi.

61
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,840
You've changed the plot a lot.
The world is on the verge of collapse.

62
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,840
The Fortune Writer can only adjust
all of it back to the original timeline.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,120
All the stories that happened
between you and Lu Huai...

64
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Meeting you is the only
good thing in my life.

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,960
I have fallen for you,
and I want to make you stop crying.

66
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,560
I want you to be safe and joyful
for the rest of your life.

67
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
(May you have a baby soon.)

68
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
They have turned to be Su Luoluo's.

69
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,640
It's impossible!

70
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
Lu Huai.

71
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Lu Huai, you haven't forgotten
me, right?

72
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Yunqi, what nonsense
are you talking about?

73
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,720
Shut up.

74
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,160
Lu Huai, it's impossible
for you to like her.

75
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,400
You said that you have fallen for me.

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,160
You wanted to be with me forever.
Do you remember that?

77
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,760
I remember.

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,960
I remember you were so vicious
that you almost killed your sister.

79
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,760
No, it's not true...

80
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,480
You said I am not a bad person,

81
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
and that I am an ordinary person
with virtues and flaws.

82
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,680
In my heart, you are an ordinary person
with virtues and flaws.

83
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,440
You claimed it was not my fault,
but the world's.

84
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Then it's the world that is
wrong rather than you.

85
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,280
You said you would protect me forever.

86
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,240
You don't need to be afraid of anything,
as I will protect you forever.

87
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,560
Have you forgotten it, Lu Huai?

88
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,120
It's enough, Yunqi!
What on earth are you going to do?

89
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
Prince Chun first, and then Huai.

90
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Do you have to snatch away what's mine?

91
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,240
Take her back and
discipline her with the family rules.

92
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,280
Shame on you. Kneel down.

93
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,760
Kneel down!

94
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,760
How rebellious you are!

95
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,528
My lord!

96
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,880
- Lady Yunqi, how could you...
- Yunqi, how could you...

97
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
Lady Yunqi.

98
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,400
Awesome!

99
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
You...

100
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Tell me what exactly
the Fortune Writer wants to do.

101
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,240
You refused to become the heroine,

102
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,520
so you can continue be the evil
supporting character until the end.

103
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
I will end up being killed by Lu Huai?

104
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:38,800
Exactly. You'll kidnap Luoluo at Prince
Chun's wedding the day after tomorrow,

105
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,480
and Lu Huai will shoot you to save her.

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,880
It's the wedding again.

107
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,040
When the wedding is over,

108
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,480
this story will reach
a perfect conclusion.

109
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,560
Why should I listen to you?

110
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
Even if you don't do anything,
it will still happen.

111
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,080
But Lu Huai will die from
taking an arrow for Su Luoluo,

112
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,880
fulfilling his ending as the
affectionate male supporting character.

113
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,640
Are you saying if I don't die,
then Lu Huai will die?

114
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,080
Exactly.

115
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,360
So, supporting characters are not

116
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
worth of a perfect ending just because
they are not protagonists?

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,640
Protagonists can't be set off without
distressed supporting characters.

118
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,128
(Together Forever)

119
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:57,728
(Together Forever)

120
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,720
Thank goodness, it's still here.

121
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,080
Well, I will not listen to you.

122
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
If you're upset,

123
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,560
then come out,
and let's talk face to face.

124
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:38,980
(Together Forever)

125
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
Why do you have no resentment?

126
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,720
Because I have no attachment.

127
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
(Have no attachment.)

128
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,560
(Lu's Mansion)

129
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,720
How cruel Lady Yunqi is!

130
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,440
She kidnapped her own sister,

131
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,480
and now she clings to a man
with brazen boldness.

132
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,880
How shameless she is!

133
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,600
Lu Huai, I have something for you.

134
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:36,960
(Together Forever)

135
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,720
Look,

136
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
this is what we hung on the
wish tree together, do you remember it?

137
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,040
Lu Huai, Lu Huai.

138
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,040
Think carefully. You will remember me.

139
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,840
Lady Yunqi, this kind of
ribbon can be found anywhere.

140
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,160
Jin Jiu, let me go!
Let me talk to him, okay?

141
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,760
Please let me talk to him. Please!

142
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,792
Lu Huai!

143
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,840
Yunqi, let's go back to the mansion.

144
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,960
Let's forget your kidnapping.

145
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,960
The hearsay is true.

146
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,080
Lady Luoluo is really kind.

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,800
Right, Lady Yunqi is evil and crazy.

148
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,120
Lu Huai.

149
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,360
Lu Huai, you will remember me.

150
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,960
Lady Yunqi.

151
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Lu Huai.

152
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,920
You're disgracing
the Su family right now.

153
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:53,200
Lu Huai.

154
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,760
Let's go back. Come on, let's go.

155
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,040
Let go of me! None of you can come over.

156
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,320
Don't come over, or I'll kill
anyone who does.

157
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,480
Lu Huai,

158
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,600
have you really forgotten me?

159
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,840
You remember me, don't you?

160
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,480
Lady Yunqi, please behave.

161
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,640
I don't want to upset Lady Luoluo.

162
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Su Luoluo,

163
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,040
you remembered it, right?

164
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't understand.

165
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,840
I knew you remembered it.

166
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,680
You remembered it! You did remember it!

167
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,400
You clearly remembered it.

168
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,640
- Enough!
- You remembered it!

169
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,400
