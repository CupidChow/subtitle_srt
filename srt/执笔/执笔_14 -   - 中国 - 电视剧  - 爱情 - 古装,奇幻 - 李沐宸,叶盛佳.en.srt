1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,800
Prince Chun is kind by nature.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,120
He committed disloyal acts

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,280
due to the Prime Minister's instigation.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,440
I had hoped
you could find evidence against him.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,160
and capture him in one fell swoop.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,880
But look at you.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,160
You made him escape from it.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
I've failed my duty.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,720
Please punish me.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,640
I give you ten days

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,280
to find new evidence
against the Prime Minister.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,840
If you fail again,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,560
you will be sentenced to death.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,680
Yes.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,000
(If her child is still around,)

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,640
(he should be grown up by now.)

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,160
The death penalty can be spared,

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,440
but not the punishment.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,520
You will get 80 lashes.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,840
Go and receive your punishment.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Don't take my mother away.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,760
Huai,

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
Mother!

26
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:19,744
=Fortune Writer=

27
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,080
=Episode 14=

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,960
The Prime Minister
is very obedient to Lady Yunqi.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
He gave her mother a grand funeral.

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Prince Chun will marry her
in the early spring.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,800
You can't be together.

32
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,840
You should let go.

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,880
Stop!

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,960
(Is she targeting the position
of the princess?)

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
Taoqi,

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
stew all those rabbits for me.

37
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,720
Okay.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,880
Should they be braised or steamed?

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,560
No.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,160
The rabbits are so cute.

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
Don't eat them.

42
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Make it spicy.

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Okay.

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
You now have everything.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
I truly admire you.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,720
To achieve your goals,

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
you can be so hard-hearted.

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
I heard

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
Master Lu

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,160
was punished by His Majesty
with 80 lashes.

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
What does it have to do with me?

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Aren't you worried about him at all?

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,200
Why should I be?

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,440
I'm preparing for my wedding
with Prince Chun.

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm so busy.

56
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
How can I attend to

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,960
such a small matter?

58
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Prince Chun will not marry you.

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
My marriage to Prince Chun

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
is bestowed by Her Majesty.

61
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
Prince Chun can't go against it.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
You can't go

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,640
against it either.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Master Lu.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Lady Luoluo.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,280
I heard that you were injured.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
And it was because of my sister.

68
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,040
I feel very sorry about it.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,480
This ointment for wounds
was prepared by a famous physician.

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
It is remarkably effective for healing.

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
I hope you will accept it.

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840
On behalf of my sister,

73
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
I apologize to you.

74
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm not like my sister.

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm not that capable.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm merely compassionate toward you.

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
I hope

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
you won't overthink it.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,680
Thank you.

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,240
Master Lu?

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,120
Master Lu,

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
your wound is bleeding again.

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Let me take a look at it.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,080
No need.

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,840
Just keep our distance.

86
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,520
But your wound is bleeding,
and it looks quite serious.

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,000
How about

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
I apply medicine to you?

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,280
I've said there's no need.

90
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,760
I didn't mean to.

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,040
It's okay.

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Lady Luoluo,

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
when did you get that scar?

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,120
This scar

96
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,720
is from a burn I got while working
when I was little.

97
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,280
It's been many years.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
Su Yunqi has a similar scar.

99
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,760
She has been pampered since childhood.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,960
How could she possibly have a scar?

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
(So she lied to me about this as well.)

102
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,600
Master Lu,

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,920
someone left a bottle of medicine
at the door.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
(It's her again.)

105
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
(Does she really not want
to see me that much?)

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
My Lady,

107
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
don't be too upset.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,360
How could I be upset?

109
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
Since I returned,

110
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,680
I've taken back everything I lost.

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,880
My mother's residence,

112
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
my position,

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
and the bestowed marriage.

114
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
I've already got everything I wanted.

115
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
I have no regrets.

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
My Lady,

117
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,280
what's wrong?

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,880
Since childhood,

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I have been unruly

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
and acted rashly.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,880
Everyone around me
feared and loathed me.

122
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,760
But I never cared.

123
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,960
I have been malicious.

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,800
But I have never had nightmares.

125
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,960
Because those people
got what they deserved.

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
I thought

127
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,200
I had long since developed

128
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,080
a heart of stone.

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,160
I thought that, besides my mother,

130
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,800
I would never cry for anyone else again.

131
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm fine.

132
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,760
I just find it a bit hard to let go.

133
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,800
I never thought

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
that there would be someone
in this world

135
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,080
who would treat me sincerely,

136
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
save me from peril,

137
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,080
and treat me

138
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
as a person of flesh and blood

139
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,520
and not as a puppet of someone else.

140
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,040
(Chapter 27)

141
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,880
(The childhood ties
are finally revealed.)

142
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,840
(Huai and Su Luoluo
recognize each other.)

143
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Right.

144
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,560
What was stolen

145
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,320
will be returned in the end.

146
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Father,

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,600
are you settling scores with me now?

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,560
Don't call me that!

149
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,360
Don't call me father.

150
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,080
You're not my daughter.

151
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
In the past,
you spoke without restraint,

152
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
repeatedly talked back,

153
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,560
and did quite a few outrageous things.

154
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,280
I've never had the heart

155
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,000
to deal with you, as you're my daughter.

156
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,480
But I could never have imagined

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
that you're actually not
of the Su family's bloodline.

158
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
What?

159
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,560
Prime Minister,

160
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
this is the midwife
who assisted the madam back then.

161
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
She has confessed that the madam

162
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,960
gave birth to a stillborn child.

163
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
It was she who suggested
finding a baby girl born

164
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,640
on the same day

165
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,080
from outside the mansion
to replace that stillborn child.

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,240
I feared the madam would be heartbroken.

167
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,680
So I went to the brothel
to bring over a baby girl.

168
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,600
Please forgive me.

169
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
What?

170
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Prime Minister, please spare me!

171
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,720
Someone!

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,720
Yes.

173
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Lock her up

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
in the firewood shed

175
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,280
for further punishment.

176
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,960
