Lu Huai.

5
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,764
(Wedding)

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,520
Why?

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,720
I told you I'd kill whoever hurts you.

8
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,800
Be good. Don't cry.

9
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
Lu Huai.

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Lu Huai.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,240
Lu Huai, I've stopped crying.

12
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Open your eyes.
I really am not crying. Please.

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Lu Huai.

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,280
Come, my good daughter.

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Embrace your brand new life.

16
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
What are you going to do?

17
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,000
Everything I once cared about
doesn't matter.

18
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Who dares to do that?

19
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,640
I won't let anyone take her away
before it's investigated thoroughly.

20
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Accept your fate, Su Yunqi.

21
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,480
I don't care about anything now,
including my life.

22
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,480
What else can you use to control me?

23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,120
Calm down. Drop the knife and come here.

24
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll give you everything you desired.

25
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,040
The legitimate daughter? The princess?

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Or the empress?

27
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,160
You're so afraid of me
breaking free from your control. Why?

28
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,280
I don't want to know anymore.

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,320
I'm free.

30
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,080
No!

31
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,920
Yunqi, wake up.

32
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,680
Yunqi.

33
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,400
Mother.

34
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,960
Mother, I just had a nightmare.

35
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,120
I dreamt
I became a villain in a story.

36
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,720
In the end,
I lost everything, including him.

37
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,280
Him? Who is he?

38
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,400
Today is your wedding day.
Don't say that.

39
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
Prince Chun repeatedly asked His Majesty
for the imperial edict of marriage.

40
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,960
After marrying him,
you'll gain both favor and wealth.

41
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
What about Su Luoluo?

42
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
Who is Su Luoluo?

43
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,080
I got confused. I can't distinguish
between my dream and reality.

44
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Taoqi hasn't brought the phoenix crown.
I'm gonna go take a look.

45
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:02,020
(Wedding)

46
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,440
Su Yunqi, wake up.

47
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,080
This is Fortune Writer's trap. Su Yunqi.

48
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,120
No.

49
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,360
This is just my dream. No.

50
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,880
I am real.
Everything on your side is a dream.

51
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,400
Su Yunqi.

52
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,280
What if you are the dream and I'm real?

53
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
Zhuangzi's butterfly dream.

54
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,200
Did Zhuangzi dream of a butterfly?
Or did a butterfly dream of Zhuangzi?

55
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,720
Did you dream of me?
Or did I dream of you?

56
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,480
What is the dream? What is the reality?

57
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,440
It's just a thought away.

58
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,080
If you admit I'm real,

59
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,720
you'll take back everything you've lost.

60
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,080
Your mother, the princess's title,
and Prince Chun's love.

61
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Everything?

62
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,240
Everything.

63
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:35,616
That's right. You are fake. I am real.

64
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,120
You're already very tired. Leave now.

65
00:08:53,504 --> 00:09:00,480
Yunqi.

66
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,476
Su Yunqi.

67
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:15,120
Don't go. Look.

68
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,600
The stars tonight are very beautiful,
and the peach blossoms have bloomed.

69
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,560
You have persisted until now.

70
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,520
It's not for what he said.

71
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,280
What you need to find is yourself.

72
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,400
In my eyes,
you are just Su Yunqi all the time.

73
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,440
Protecting you forever.

74
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,120
I don't know if I'm real.

75
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,880
But he definitely is real.

76
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,800
I am you. You are me.

77
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
You're going to kill yourself?

78
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,960
Yes, I'm going to kill myself.

79
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,880
It seems you have awakened.

80
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,680
What exactly are you?

81
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm the embodiment of people's desire.

82
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,800
I can gain more control of you
as your desire grows stronger.

83
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,240
You're a character created by me,

84
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,560
but you'll also
become a prisoner of your desire.

85
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,640
If the character created by you
is no longer obsessive,

86
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
you can no longer control them.

87
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,600
That's why
you can't change Yun Sheng's memories.

88
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,760
If you were Fortune Writer,
how would you write my ending?

89
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,280
Are you going to kill me?

90
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,680
From love comes sorrow and fear.

91
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,160
Those who are away from love
have neither sorrow nor fear.

92
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,280
(Imperial Prison)
(From love comes sorrow and fear.)

93
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,520
(Those who are away from love
have neither sorrow nor fear.)

94
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Your desire is to control your story.

95
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,840
I am your worst ending.

96
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Everything is possible under this pen.

97
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,840
It decides everyone's fate.

98
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,520
From now on, you are Fortune Writer.

99
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
I don't want
to decide other people's fate.

100
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,040
Everyone
is Fortune Writer of their own fate.

101
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Lady Yunqi.

102
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,040
Lady Yunqi, what's wrong?

103
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Mother.

104
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,000
Lady Yunqi, do you want
your mother or your father to die?

105
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
My mother and Du Guozhong are innocent.

106
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,000
Du Guozhong came here
to see Prince Chun and my father.

107
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,120
They met with the officials
at Fuhua Mansion.

108
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,320
Fuhua Mansion is located...

109
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Jin Jiu, surround this place.
Don't let anyone leave.

110
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
The rest of you, come with me.

111
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

112
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,200
How dare you do this to me!

113
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,520
You unfilial girl, an omen of doom.

114
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,120
You've ruined my reputation.

115
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,280
You've failed to discipline her well.
There'll be consequences.

116
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,400
Shut up!

117
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,120
You're not qualified
to be a mother of virtue and morality.

118
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,480
- Nonsense.
- You...

119
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Nonsense, you old man.

120
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,120
Aren't you ashamed
of accusing me of that?

121
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
After breaking free from the Book,
my mother is so...

122
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,600
I didn't know she's so fierce.

123
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,920
I helped you on the wedding day,
but I still dislike you.

124
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,880
Su Luoluo,
you still remember everything?

125
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,160
I also dislike you.

126
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:48,256
(Three months later)

127
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:51,360
(Lu's Mansion)

128
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,120
Have you decided?

129
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
I suddenly found my goal.

130
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
To uphold justice in the martial world.

131
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Don't worry. I'll come back often.

132
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Okay. I'm giving this sword to you.

133
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,440
Bye.

134
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
Are they beautiful?

135
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,280
You must be so touched
that you don't know what to say.

136
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
After all, who can refuse
a handsome man holding flowers?

137
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
You're still so greasy
even without Fortune Writer.

138
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,000
I have dignity.

139
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,200
It's not you refusing me now.
I don't want you anymore.

140
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,160
Wait. No man has ever
talked to me like that.

141
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,400
Interesting. You've caught my attention.

142
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
Wait for me.

143
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Sir.

144
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,160
What's wrong?

145
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,584
Can you do me a favor?

146
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,516
Help me take care of it.

147
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,640
Ms. Su.

148
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,400
Lu Huai, why are you here?

149
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm investigating the case
involving your tavern a few days ago.

150
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,400
Please cooperate.

151
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,840
The Armor Guard
even cares about such a trivial matter?

152
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
It was Duke Wei's only son
who got beaten.

153
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,360
You can find me in the tavern
if there's anything. I'm very busy.

154
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Then when can we go
to the Ethereal Valley to see fireflies?

155
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,080
You...

156
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,160
