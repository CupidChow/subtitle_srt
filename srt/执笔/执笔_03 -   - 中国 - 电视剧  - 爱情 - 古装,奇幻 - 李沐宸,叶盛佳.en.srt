1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,960
Mother, hang in there.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
Mother, hang in there.

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,080
Lu Huai.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,000
Save my mother.

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,240
If you want to live,
get out on your own.

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,200
(Mother, stay safe
and live a long life.)

7
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,520
Stay awake, Yunqi.

8
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,884
=Fortune Writer=
(Based on the original Zhihu novel)

9
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:12,192
=Episode 3=

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,560
Did he really start that fire?

11
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,120
Yes.

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Master.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
Is he really so heartless?

14
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,520
Your daughter went into
the fire to save you.

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
How is she?

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,840
The fire was too fierce,
so I could only save you. She...

17
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,360
No, no.

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,560
Qi!

19
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,440
- Someone.
- Here.

20
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
Here.

21
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,760
Sir, are we not saving Lady Yunqi?

22
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,640
If Du Ruomei learns Prime Minister
not only sent someone to kill her,

23
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,200
but also got Su Yunqi killed,

24
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
she must hate Prime Minister

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,720
and will tell us everything she knows.

26
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
However...

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,240
Once we join the Armor Guard,
we become ruthless demons.

28
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Being softened can be lethal.

29
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,200
Didn't he say not to save her?
Being softened can be lethal?

30
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,640
Quite ruthless.

31
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,680
Do you still want
to keep secrets for such a man?

32
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
He even wanted
to get your daughter killed.

33
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,640
Don't you want him to suffer?

34
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,840
I'll tell you. I...

35
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
Where is my mother?

36
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
Mrs. Du, be careful.

37
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,360
The Book of Fate.

38
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,800
(Chapter 17)
(Du Ruomei died in the fire.)

39
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,560
(Du Ruomei died
of being pierced by arrows.)

40
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,680
(Once the ink dries out,
the end will be decided.)

41
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
Mrs. Du is awake.

42
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,880
(Chapter 15)
(Du Ruomei perished after hitting a pillar.)

43
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,744
(Chapter 15)
(Su Luoluo slapped Lu Huai.)

44
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,900
(Chapter 17)
(Du Ruomei died of being pierced by arrows.)

45
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
The ink almost dries out.

46
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,200
Mother.

47
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,440
Mother.

48
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,000
Yunqi.

49
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
Yunqi.

50
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,440
Chase!

51
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes.

52
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Mother.

53
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,320
Mother.

54
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,760
Mother.

55
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,232
Qi, you must become...

56
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,760
Become the princess,

57
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,200
so you can protect yourself.

58
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Mother.

59
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Mother.

60
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,080
Why?

61
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,040
Why are you doing this to us?

62
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,120
What did we do wrong?

63
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Tell me who sent you?

64
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,560
Tell me.

65
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,680
It was Prime Minister.

66
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,440
Why?

67
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,840
Because Mrs. Du knew too much.

68
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,240
Hold the knife firmly for killing.

69
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,224
(Condolence)

70
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,120
Yunqi, your mother was morally corrupt.

71
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,920
I have treated her well
for allowing you to mourn her here.

72
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,080
Do not blame me.

73
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,568
(Condolence)

74
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,720
My mother was with you for years.

75
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,680
She couldn't even
have a memorial tablet now.

76
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,720
Is that how you treat her well?

77
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
How can you speak to me like this?

78
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,760
Sister, don't argue with Father anymore.

79
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
We should keep peace.

80
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Do you know how my mother died?

81
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,560
In the Lu Mansion,
bandits caused trouble,

82
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,440
and your mother died tragically.

83
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
Is that so?

84
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,280
For the murderer who killed my mother,

85
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,920
there is no one in the world who knows
it better than you do, Prime Minister.

86
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,200
How dare you!

87
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,320
(Condolence)

88
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,040
Get out and kneel down.

89
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,144
(Su Mansion)

90
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,160
The Master said
you shall leave Lady Yunqi alone.

91
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,600
You're just mad at Miss Su
for scolding you the other day.

92
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
But you were out there
gossiping about Lan,

93
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,640
forcing her to kill herself.

94
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,120
I dare not.

95
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,960
How dare you not
listen to the Master's order!

96
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
You!

97
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,600
I can help you take revenge.

98
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,048
Help me? My father is not a good man.

99
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,524
And you are not a good man either.

100
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
You are trying to take advantage of me.

101
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,800
Don't make me your pawn.

102
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,160
Lady Yunqi, don't you realize
you have no way out?

103
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,800
No way out? I'll fight my way out.

104
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,608
(Su Mansion)

105
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,800
(Accept your fate, Su Yunqi.)

106
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,400
Once the ink dries out,
the end is decided.

107
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,640
Then if the ink doesn't dry out,
the end can still be changed.

108
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,400
Now Su Luoluo has not
become the princess,

109
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,440
I still have a chance to survive.

110
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,172
(Su Mansion)

111
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,640
(This will only make
things worse for you.)

112
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,640
Then I'll take a gamble.
