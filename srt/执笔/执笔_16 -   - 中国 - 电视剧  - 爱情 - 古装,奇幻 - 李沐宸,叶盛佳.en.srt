00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:14,337
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
Tell me about the ledger's whereabouts,

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,880
or don't think about getting out.

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
Are you here to seek revenge on me?

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,320
Why did you do that?

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,760
He would kill me for Su Luoluo.

8
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
I merely struck first
to get the upper hand.

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
If he wanted to kill you,

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
how would he let you hurt him?

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,080
He rushed here,

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,480
exchanging Du Guozhong's confession
for your safety.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
You don't deserve his sacrifices.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,680
Moves can't be undone.

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
I never looked back.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
If you want to kill me,

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
do it.

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Instead of wasting time on me,

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,080
you'd better search beneath the cliff.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,400
Perhaps he's still alive.

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Because Lu Huai chose Su Luoluo,

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,600
you pushed him off the cliff.

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,360
You're truly the one of innate cruelty.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,920
But didn't you love him?

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
Love?

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,080
Because I love him,

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,280
should I just submit to you

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,760
and sacrifice everything for him?

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,840
That's laughable.

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,240
Not being able to sacrifice yourself
for your beloved

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
is why you can't be the heroine

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,040
but only be a supporting role.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,560
Why should I sacrifice myself?

34
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
I am the most important.

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
You're simply a stain
in this beautiful love story.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,680
Love story?

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,240
My mother loved
The Peacock Flies Southeast the most,

38
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
often listening to it
until she was in tears.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
If I were Liu Lanzhi,

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
I would never jump into the pond
to kill myself.

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,240
I would live well

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,400
to show those who abandoned me.

43
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,160
If I were Jiao Zhongqing,

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,280
I wouldn't hang myself either.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,800
Since I abandoned my beloved one,

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
there should be no regret

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
or looking back.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,680
Fulfilling others

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,880
is also fulfilling oneself.

50
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,712
(Three months later)

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
How wonderful

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,640
to be able to admire flowers
with you like this now!

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,960
I've waited for this for a long time.

54
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,600
We are getting married tomorrow.

55
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,160
There will be plenty of such days

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
in the future.

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,720
I wonder how Su Yunqi is doing now.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
After that incident,

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,760
the Prime Minister will probably not
let her off easily.

60
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,760
I have pleaded with my father for mercy.

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
He has spared her life.

62
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
Now she

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,560
must be living well.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,080
Luoluo,

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
you're the kindest girl
I have ever seen.

66
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,360
Be careful.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,760
Lady Luoluo's wedding is tomorrow.

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
If it gets damaged,

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,296
Prime Minister won't forgive you.

70
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Yes.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,320
Lady Yunqi,

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,960
The Lord ordered you

73
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
to wash all these clothes today

74
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
since Lady Luoluo
is getting married tomorrow.

75
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,080
It seems that these scars

76
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,640
have finally taught you a lesson.

77
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,480
It's also a good thing for you.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,240
The Lord doesn't bear grudges

79
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,160
and has even arranged
a marriage for you.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,560
Have you heard about it?

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
Although Butcher Wang

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
accidentally beat his wife
to death last month,

83
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,200
he does have the skills
to make a living.

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,640
After you marry him,

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,880
you won't have to starve.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
It's an immense favor

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,360
compared to the evil you've done before.

88
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,040
People must learn to accept their fate.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,440
Only then can life be a bit easier.

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,920
Luoluo, it's time to wash your feet.

91
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,640
Yunqi, why are you

92
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,920
doing this again?

93
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
I can do it myself.

94
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,120
Tomorrow, you will become Princess Chun.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,520
How can I let you do this?

96
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,000
Yunqi,

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,680
do you think

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
I will be bullied

99
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
after marrying Prince Chun

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
as a concubine's daughter?

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Yunqi,

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,880
accompany me to Prince Chun's mansion.

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
Have you forgotten?

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,200
Father has already arranged
my marriage with Butcher Wang.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,960
Father is just in a rage.

106
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
How about

107
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,840
I go and plead with him?

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Maybe

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
he will change his mind.

110
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,440
My face!

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,560
I thought you had reformed your ways.

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,920
I didn't know

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
you still resented me.

114
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
I just don't understand.

115
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,560
You are inferior to me in every way.

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
But the Book of Fate has determined
that you are the heroine.

117
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,520
You have taken everything from me,

118
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
my mother's life,

119
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,120
my father's affection,

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
and my title of princess.

121
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,840
Why?

122
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,040
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,320
What the Book of Fate?

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,520
Can't you see?

125
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,640
(Side Story. Su Luoluo
will marry the prince.)

126
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,440
The two of us

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,440
are merely puppets in the Book of Fate.

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,440
It says I'm destined to be a slave,

129
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,480
and you're destined to be the empress.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,520
But I, Su Yunqi,

131
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
simply refuse to accept my fate.

132
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,120
All I've ever wanted is fairness.

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,840
If fate is unfair to me,

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,280
I'll take it by force.

135
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,760
Brilliant!

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,000
Truly brilliant!

137
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
Cuizui,

138
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,240
your voice...

139
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,016
(The Book of Fate)

140
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
You are not Cuizui.

141
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Who are you?

142
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Me?

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm the creator of the Book of Fate,

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
Fortune Writer.

145
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,760
Fortune Writer?

146
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,280
You are both

147
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
characters created by me.

148
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,320
So all of this

149
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,600
is thanks to you.

150
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Although you are
just a supporting character,

151
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
you are quite interesting.

152
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,400
From the Prime Minister's Residence

153
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
to Lu's Mansion,

154
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,320
Moon Tower,

155
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,760
and the cliff,

156
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,240
I've been watching you.

157
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
You are very interesting,

158
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,520
always struggling with fate.

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,800
So, I am giving you a chance now.

160
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Kill Su Luoluo,

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,720
and then I will make you
the new heroine of this story.

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,480
How about it?

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
Your scar...

164
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,280
Cuizui,

165
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,760
what are you talking about?

166
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,200
What is a Fortune Writer?

167
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,640
And what is a heroine?

168
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,480
You were originally
the heroine of my story.

169
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
Look how much
Prince Chun loved you before.

170
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,240
Unfortunately, you are really useless.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
So I have to replace you.

172
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,440
You want me to replace her

173
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,360
and marry Prince Chun?

174
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Yes.

175
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,440
That's impossible.

176
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,520
Prince Chun only wants to marry me.

177
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
I made him love you.

178
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,040
What's so difficult about making him

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,280
fall for someone else?

180
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Do it.

181
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,240
You only have this one chance.

182
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
You want to kill me?

183
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,160
Kill me,

184
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,920
and then become the new Fortune Writer.

185
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
See you next time.

186
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
No.

187
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,360
Don't kill me.

♪Pen in hand,
