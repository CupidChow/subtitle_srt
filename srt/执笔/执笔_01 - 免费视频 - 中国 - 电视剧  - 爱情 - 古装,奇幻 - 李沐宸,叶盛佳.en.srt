1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,760
Strum once on the left,
bearing a noble boy.

2
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:18,400
Strum once on the right,
giving birth to a delicate boy.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,720
Strum three notes firmly on one side.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,920
The young lady will give births
to blessed children.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,280
(Both young ladies
will be wedded tomorrow.)

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,440
(The concubine's daughter to a prince
and the legitimate one a butcher.)

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,680
(Lady Luo, despite her humble origin,
is kind and innocent,)

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,200
(thus is worthy of the princess title.)

9
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,336
(Su Luoluo, the concubine's daughter)

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,200
(As for Lady Yunqi, it's all karma.)

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,120
(Su Yunqi, the legitimate daughter)

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,280
Luo, it's time to wash your feet.

13
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:03,640
(Happiness)

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,320
Sister, why are you
doing manual labor again.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,480
I can do it myself.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,840
Tomorrow you will the Princess Chun.
How can I let you do this?

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,560
Sister, will a concubine's daughter
like me be mistreated

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,720
in the prince's mansion?

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,120
Sister, you must stay with me
as a guardian.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,320
Have you forgotten? Our father has
betrothed me to the butcher Wang.

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,240
He is still angry.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Why don't I go plead with him?

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,920
Maybe he will change his mind.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,840
My face!

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,720
I thought you have repented.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,520
But obviously you are
still jealous of me.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,000
I just don't understand how you,
who's inferior to me in every way,

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,200
were chosen by the Book of Fate
to be the leading role.

29
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
You've taken everything from me.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,800
My mother's life, father's affection,
and even princesshood, why?

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,200
What do you mean by Book of Fate?

32
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:34,596
(Happiness)

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Can't you see it?

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,400
(Su Luoluo is to marry the prince.)

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,720
We are both just puppets of the Book.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,680
The Book says I'm destined
to be a slave, and you a queen.

37
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,480
But I, for one,
refuse to accept my fate.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
What I've always wanted is fairness.

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,440
If fate is unfair to me,
then I will seize it myself.

40
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,360
(Book of Fate, I am destined to be
the princess consort.)

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,088
Your scar.

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
(Take your scar
and give me my fate back.)

43
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,720
(Su Luoluo is to marry the prince.)

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,680
(Su Yunqi is to marry the prince.)

45
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,444
(The Book of Fate)

46
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:45,220
(commands the fate of all beings,
documents human emotions through time.)

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,344
(Those who vainly attempt to
defy their fate will be destroyed)

48
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,268
(and perish tragically.)
(Fortune Writer)

49
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:55,392
=Fortune Writer=
(based on the original Zhihu novel)

50
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:56,928
=Episode 1=

51
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,840
(Three Months Earlier)

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,760
Have mercy, Lady Yunqi, please.

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,600
Continue.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,440
Yunqi, you're truly the epitome
of noble women in the capital.

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,800
Like an eloquent flowers,
or a fragrant jade.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Even a heavenly fairy is no match.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Ruyi, are those the
new books you bought?

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes, the bookstore owner
said these are the most popular.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,000
Utterly boring.

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
(Fate)
What is this?

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,440
(Book of Fate)

62
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,200
I have no idea.
I don't remember buying this one.

63
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,584
(Book of Fate)

64
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,648
(Ruin the life
of the concubine's daughter.)

65
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
Quite interesting.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Miss, what is written in this book?

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,470
(Book of Fate)
The legitimate daughter of the Chancellor

68
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,816
(Book of Fate)
is vicious and arrogant.

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,960
And concubine's daughter
is kind and innocent.

70
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,440
The prince falls in love with
the concubine's daughter at first sight.

71
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,960
The legitimate daughter, envious,
schemes against her half-sister.

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,240
(Legitimate Daughter)
The High-perched bird felled by an arrow.

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,440
This is...

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,040
The verdict for the legitimate daughter
as per the preface.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,640
What nonsense!

76
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
Taoqi, burn it.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,640
Take a hike.

78
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,960
Sister.

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,476
Sister, Cuizui may be a maid

80
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,492
but all human lives are equal.
How can you...

81
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:02,883
Your life is indeed
no more valuable than hers.

82
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,883
Back in the day,
my mother saved your mom,

83
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:07,563
who repaid kindness with enmity

84
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:09,683
by seducing father
while my mother was pregnant.

85
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:13,243
You don't get to call me sister.

86
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:14,483
Exactly.

87
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:19,763
My mother has no legal status.
She's excluded from the family shrine.

88
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:22,843
Isn't that enough?

89
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:25,203
My Lady, save me.

90
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,603
Please, sister, spare Cuizui.

91
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:30,043
Sure, you take her place.

92
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,803
Let go of me.

93
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:33,643
Yunqi.

94
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:39,163
(Du Ruomei, Chancellor's Wife)
Yunqi, stop it.

95
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:39,883
Mother.

96
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:43,904
Yunqi, you should
get ready for the banquet.

97
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:47,683
Your outfit is too flamboyant.
Don't forget...

98
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:50,912
Prince Chun prefers simplicity.
I should cater to his taste.

99
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:53,043
Mother, I know.

100
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:13,523
(Su Yunqi bullies Cuizui.
Su Luoluo stands up for her.)

101
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,563
I am honored by your presence
on my birthday. Your Highness, cheers.

102
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,443
Ladies and gentlemen, cheers.

103
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:29,963
(Prince Chun)
I visited the palace a few days ago.

104
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:32,403
Thanks to Her Majesty's kindness,

105
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:35,523
I was granted this exquisite bracelet,
the Misty Hills.

106
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,123
A special gift from Her Majesty

107
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,763
(Chancellor Su)
to the future Princess.

108
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,683
Yunqi.

109
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:51,483
You must not fail
Her Majesty's generosity.

110
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:55,163
Enter the palace tomorrow
to thank Her Majesty in person.

111
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,603
Yes, Father.

112
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,603
- The engagement token.
- The engagement token.

113
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:20,723
Who's there?

114
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:32,723
What a jubilant occasion
here in the Chancellor's Mansion.

115
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:38,123
(Who is he?)

116
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,296
(Lu Huai, Deputy Commander
of Armored Guards)

117
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:02,643
(Why is it the same as the Book says?)

118
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,568
(The high-perched bird felled by an arrow.
A deserved violent death of the femme fatale.)

119
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:09,923
(The high-perched bird
felled by an arrow)

120
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:29,763
Intruding the Chancellor's Mansion,
disregarding decorum and law.

121
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:32,283
Guards, arrest him.

122
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:51,043
The Armored Guards are on duty.
All unauthorized personnel should leave.

123
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,963
(The Armored Guards?
A bunch of insolent savages.)

124
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:02,243
Arriving uninvited.

125
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:14,923
Such are the manners of thieves.

126
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:21,603
If you are a guest,
present yourself properly.

127
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,803
You intruded on my banquet
and injured my guards,

128
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:40,763
just because
the emperor favors you.

129
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,163
This is simply outrageous.

130
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,696
(Imperial)

131
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,883
The Armored Guards
are decreed to eradicate evil.

132
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,603
We can execute anyone without a trial,
including princes and officials.

133
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:03,323
Guards, bring him in.

134
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,003
Why is Du Guozhong here?
He's a commander of border defense.

135
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:19,083
The court strictly forbids meetings
between princes and border watch.

136
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,563
How can His Highness and
the Chancellor not know?

137
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:26,203
General Du is here?
Neither the Prince and myself knew.

138
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:29,088
Then it must be General Du who
snuck into the Chancellor's Mansion.

139
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,163
I've come to visit my cousin.

140
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,963
That is Du Ruomei,
the Chancellor's wife.

141
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:37,843
Look carefully,
this is an imperial token.

142
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:42,163
Any dishonest word out of your mouth
will be seen as deceiving the emperor.

143
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,560
(Imperial)

144
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,003
General Du.

145
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,923
You must tell the truth.

146
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:06,624
Ruomei and I are secret lovers.
The Chancellor is kept in the dark.

147
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:08,963
- Guozhong
- Mother.

148
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:12,083
How could you tarnish my reputation
with such lies?

149
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,923
Uncle, what nonsense are you speaking?

150
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,283
Such a disgrace to my family.

151
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:27,168
Guards, take her away.

152
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:27,723
Yes.

153
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:29,243
My Lord, I didn't.

154
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:29,923
Take her away.

155
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:30,443
I didn't.

156
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:31,083
Wait.

157
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:36,963
There are still loose ends.
Take both of them away.

158
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,123
Interrogate them.

159
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,083
- Yes.
- Yes.

160
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,323
- I dare you.
- Yunqi.

161
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:45,123
Stay away,

162
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:52,963
My mother is from a scholarly family
and cherishes her reputation above all.

163
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:55,963
No one is taking her away until
this is thoroughly investigated.

164
00:13:13,883 --> 00:13:20,803
Lady Yunqi, do you wish
your mother dead, or your father?

165
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,683
Master Lu, please let go of my daughter.

166
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:34,948
My Lord, I have never
done anything improper.

167
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:38,643
I am willing to die
to prove my innocence.

168
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:39,283
Mother.

169
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:47,163
Mother.

170
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,163
(Du Ruomei died hitting a pillar
after being wrongfully accused.)

171
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,403
(Su Luoluo, furiated, slapped Lu Huai.)

172
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,763
(Why can I see these words?)

173
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:18,592
(Hit pillar, slaps Lu)

174
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:32,323
(Once the ink dries out,
the end is decided.)

175
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,603
