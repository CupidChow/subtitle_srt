Once the ink dries out,
the end is decided.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,080
What if the ink has not yet dried?

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,080
(I'm the one that slapped Lu Huai now.)

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,400
(Will this change the end of the story?)

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,120
She's awake. Her Ladyship is awake.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Mother!

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
- Mother!
- My Lady!

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,280
Mother!

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm fine.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,120
Take General Du and Lady Du with us.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,040
Sir, my mother was merely
confused for a moment.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,800
She has realized her mistake,
please don't...

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,480
Shut up. My mother is innocent
in the first place.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,280
She doesn't need
your pleas for mercy here.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,960
No one is taking my mother away.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,880
Whoever dares to obstruct
will be punished by death.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
Master Lu.

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,920
I hope you will investigate
this matter thoroughly and quickly.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,880
We'll be waiting for an explanation.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,160
No, Mother.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,680
What?

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,320
No!

23
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,040
My Lady!

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,840

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,000

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,656
- Why
- Please.

36
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,120
stop My Lady but let her pass?

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,720
Look, ma'am.

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,720
Sir, it's freezing in the prison.
Please take care of my mother.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,600
I have nothing to repay you

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,640
except this plum cake I made.

46

accept her things?)

48

My Lady, you needn't worry too much.
There must be other ways.

Taoqi, do you see those words?

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,920
My Lady, please don't scare me.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,280
Never mind. Go on with your work.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,960

I've brought your favorite
steamed cheese.

Keep it. I'm a bit tired.
Leave me alone.

That's right. The world you live in

Su Luoluo, the protagonist.
