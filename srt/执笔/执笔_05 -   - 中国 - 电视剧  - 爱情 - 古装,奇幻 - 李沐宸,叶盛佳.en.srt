3
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,760
My lord, spare my life. I confess.

4
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Let him sign the confession
and close the case.

5
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,080
Who let you in?

7
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,600
Get out. This is not the place for you.

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,360
Thanks to you, Master Lu,
I could survive.

9
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,960
But the one who poisoned me
will certainly not let me off so easily.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Master Lu, can you help me?

11
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm begging you.

12
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Master Lu, have mercy. Please spare me.

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,360
Please spare me, Master Lu.

14
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
Numerous people have begged me.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,040
What makes you think
you're an exception?

16
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,920
I can be your pawn
and help you take down my father.

17
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Master Lu, you let blood
for me last time.

18
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,920
Isn't that what it was for?

19
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,680
(Wouldn't it be a pity to let you
fall into Su Luoluo's hands?)

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,760
I've changed my mind.

21
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
Everyone despises me,
fears me, and hates me,

22
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,000
wishing they could devour my flesh
and drink my blood.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,800
How dare you, a noble lady,
associate with me?

24
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
Lady Yunqi, please go back.

25
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,160
The imperial prison is filthy.
Do not come again.

26
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Why don't you move?

27
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,840
My legs are weak. I can't get up.

28
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,960
You're unwilling to even give me a hand.
Are you afraid of me?

29
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,840
(Imperial Prison)

30
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,960
My lady, why were you
in there for so long?

31
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,280
I was so worried.
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

32
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,960
We don't want to mess with this man.
Stay away from him.

33
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
Lu Huai, I dare.

34
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,520
I, Su Yunqi,
dare to be associated with you.

35
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,080
Actually, upon closer look,
you're not that frightening.

36
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
If it weren't for the scar
above your eyebrow,

37
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
you would look very handsome.

38
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
Lady Yunqi, your own life is in danger.

39
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
Mind your own business first.

40
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,160
I have an ointment
that is very effective for scars.

41
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll bring it to you.

♪Life is but a fleeting play♪

46
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,400
Your father said he would marry me
once he got approval from his family.

47
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
Yet he abandoned the both of us.

48
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,760
Your eyes and brows
are really similar to his.

49
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,200
(Mother, don't cry.
I'm no longer like that man.)

50
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
(You messed with Lu Huai.)

51
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,520
(When he knows the truth,
he'll only despise you more.)

52
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Oh, so what's the next part
of the story?

53
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
What if I don't do it this way?

54
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,640
(You fell into the river last time
because you defied fate.)

55
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
That's really harsh.

56
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,200
(Chapter 19)
(Su Yunqi envies Su Luoluo)

57
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,320
(and kidnaps Luoluo
to ruin her chastity.)

58
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,840
This couldn't be another damsel
in distress scenario, could it?

59
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,448
(You're correct.)

60
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,200
(Good people have rescuers,
while the wicked torture each other.)

61
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,280
We found the assassin who killed
the prime minister's wife.

62
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,360
It's A Stroke of Red.
They were last seen in the Moon Tower.

63
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,440
I want them captured,
whether dead or alive.

64
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay.

65
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Mother! Mother!

66
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,991
(Moon Tower)

67
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,240
(No. I can't exert any strength at all.
What should I do?)

68
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,520
Be quiet, gentlemen.
This is the new girl, Ming Yue.

69
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,456
She's a beauty that outshines flowers,
with a tender, delicate physique.

70
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,200
(Chapter 20)
(Prince Chun stands up for Luoluo.)

71
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,040
(Su Yunqi reaps what she sows
and loses chastity in the Moon Tower.)

72
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,760
Your Highness, I can't stand
to see my sister insulted like this.

73
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
Please let her go.

74
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,600
She wanted to harm you first.

75
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,880
If it weren't for my precautions,

76
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,280
you would be the one on the stage now.

77
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,720
But...

78
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,120
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

79
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,920
200 taels!

80
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,880
He offers 200 taels!

81
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,120
- 300 taels!
- 300 taels!

82
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,640
500 taels!

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
800 taels!

84
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,680
900 taels!

- 1,000 taels!
- 1,000 taels!

86
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
The killer is hiding in the Moon Tower.

87
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
Search the place,
but don't alert the target.

88
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,400
Any other gentlemen
wish to raise the bid?

89
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
1,200 taels!

90
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
1,300 taels!

91
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,760
That gentleman offers 1,300 taels!

92
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
Any more? Is there a higher bid?

93
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,680
(How could it be her?)

94
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,520
That gentleman!

95
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,920
1,500 taels!

96
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
1,500 taels!

97
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,360
Hold on.

98
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,096
(It's good when form serves spirit;
it's bad when spirit serves emotions.)

99
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,400
(Such fanciful thoughts shouldn't exist.
Let me cut them off.)

100
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,080
(No. The Book of Fate
is playing tricks.)

101
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
Master Lu, have you
taken a fancy to her?

102
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,960
But you know the rule.
The highest bidder wins.

103
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,120
I'm not interested in her.

104
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,920
(If it weren't for the scar
above your eyebrow,)

105
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,080
you would look very handsome.

106
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,680
I have an ointment
that is very effective for scars.

107
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,720
I'll bring it to you.

108
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
Bring her up.

109
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,040
Your Highness, I can't stand
to see my sister treated like this.

110
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,720
Please save her.

111
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Redeem her for me, no matter the cost.

112
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
Thank you.

113
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,760
Come dine with me, you little fool.

114
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,832
(Moon Tower)
1,600 taels!

115
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:21,560
Any more?

116
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,640
1,700 taels.

117
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,960
- 2,000 taels!
- 2,000 taels!

118
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
2,500 taels!

119
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,528
Take my token to our family's bank

120
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:32,580
and withdraw as much silver as you like.

121
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,720
(Thank you, Master Li.)

122
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,960
Come on.

123
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
Don't block the way.

124
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Scram!

125
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,320
Lu Huai, help! Help!

126
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,440
Lu Huai.

127
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,760
Master Lu, A Stroke of Red
has run away again.

128
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,640
Lu Huai.

129
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,200
You go ahead. I...

130
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,120
(With strings in hand, control is mine.)

131
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,920
(A puppet wishes to defy fate?)

132
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
Lu Huai, help!

133
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,840
You're blatantly robbing me.

134
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,960
- Lu Huai!
- I'm talking to you.

135
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,480
Lu Huai, help!

136
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,000
(A heartless man entwined
in affection must be severed.)

137
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Lu Huai!

138
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Lu Huai?

139
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,120
After them.

140
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Lu Huai? Lu Huai! Lu Huai!

141
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,920
You can't escape.

142
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Listen, I am the prime minister's
legitimate daughter, Su Yunqi.

143
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,480
Get out of my way if you want to live.

144
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,880
You're the prime minister's
legitimate daughter? Then I am a prince.

145
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,520
(Accept your fate, Su Yunqi.)

146
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,200
(You must yield to Su Luoluo.)
