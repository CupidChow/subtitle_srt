00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,400
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
You are so ungrateful.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,240
You are a disgrace to the Su family.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,936
Your virginity has been lost.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,440
Let alone Prince Chun,

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,320
even a man of lowly status

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,640
wouldn't marry you now.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,960
Your daughter was insulted.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,600
Instead of revenging for me,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,160
you blame me for disgracing you?

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,920
You...

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,080
Father.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,160
My sister was frightened.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,440
Please don't scold her.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,840
Sister.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,720
Father is only worried.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,880
- Don't get him wrong.
- Get lost.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,160
Stop playing innocent.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,920
Insolent one.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
So ungrateful.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,640
Look at you.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,200
You act nothing like an elder sister.

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,960
For the sake of your mother,

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,200
I have tolerated you.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
I never knew you could be
so spoiled, arrogant,

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,600
and obstinate.

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,040
Prince Chun has repeatedly
asked for marrying Luoluo.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,120
I haven't agreed.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,280
Now that you are so ungrateful,

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,200
I no longer need to be kind.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,760
Luoluo will replace you

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
to marry Prince Chun.

34
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,720
How dare you?

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,880
Nonsense.

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,400
You can make Luoluo marry Prince Chun.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,080
But if you

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
insist on disrupting
order and seniority,

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,920
I doubt those
hypocritical subordinates of yours

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
will still support you.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
You...

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,360
Father.

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,280
Sister, please say no more.

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Fine.

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Su Yunqi.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,040
I'll teach you about
order and seniority.

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,600
Luoluo.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,480
I will move your mother's tablet
to the family shrine from today,

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
giving her a legal status.

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
As for you,

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,000
you wicked one.

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
Someone.

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Expel her from my house.

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,520
Don't touch me!

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
I can leave by myself.

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,600
(Is it time for me to make way for her?)

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,680
(I will move your mother's tablet
to the family shrine from today,)

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
(giving her a legal status.)

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,800
(Someone. Expel her from my house.)

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,720
Lu Huai,

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
I have nowhere to go now.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,120
Will you take me in?

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
Master Lu.

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
Thank you for saving me.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
You'll leave tomorrow morning.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
(What's going on?)

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
(Why is he so impatient with me?)

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,960
Master Lu.

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,240
I am just a fragile lady.

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,400
Out there,

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
I'd be vulnerable to harm.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
Given your schemes,

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
no one would be able to harm you.

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
What do you mean?

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,360
You'd better leave early in the morning.

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
Don't make me escort you.

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,040
You clearly know she didn't
lose her virginity.

78
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
Li Jia's attempt failed.

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
Why did you still take her in?

80
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Lady Su has not fully recovered
from the poisoning.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,760
Now that she caught the cold,

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,080
and she is extremely weak.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm afraid this might

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
lead to her infertility in the future.

85
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,320
You just can't let her go.

86
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm only sheltering her
for a couple of days.

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,800
There will be no further involvement.

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
(What is this foul-tasting tea?)

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
(Su Luoluo wishes to gain merit
for her father, Prime Minister,)

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
(and restore her mother's status.)

91
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,840
How many chapters are there in total?

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,720
28 chapters.

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
There's seven chapters left.

94
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
The end is near.

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Is it?

96
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,320
I would like to see the rest.

97
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:12,032
(Chapter 21: Su Luoluo wishes to gain merit for her father,
Prime Minister, and restore her mother's status.)

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,560
(It seems I can only
start with Lu Huai now.)

99
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,520
(I must find out Su Luoluo's plan.)

100
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,320
(I can't make Lu Huai drive me away.)

101
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,800
Lu Huai.

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,640
You are forcing me.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Lady Su.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,400
What's happening?

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
I will end up dead

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
soon anyway.

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
I would choose my own way to die.

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,640
Master Lu.

109
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Master Lu.

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,600
For the sake of our acquaintance,

111
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
if you could collect my body,

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I would be grateful from the underworld.

113
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Lu Huai.

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,040
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

115
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Just go kill yourself elsewhere.

116
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,200
Lu Huai.

117
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:49,120
(Lu's Mansion)

118
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
Lu Huai.

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,760
Lu...

120
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
I didn't expect my sister
to be so pitiable.

121
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Why are you here?

122
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Sister, don't take it wrong.

123
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,840
I didn't come looking for you.

124
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm here to comfort Father.

125
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
What do you mean?

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,800
Please let Master Lu know.

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,280
I'd like to meet him

128
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,360
for tea sometime.

129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,520
I need to consult him.

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,560
Yes.

131
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,720
Sister.

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,120
You dropped it.

133
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Su Luoluo.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
It was really you who poisoned me.

135
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
You sure are cunning.

136
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,000
No matter how many tricks you use,

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,280
you won't replace me
to become Princess Chun.

138
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
I don't know what you're saying.

139
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Who are you trying to fool?

140
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,960
I regret I couldn't bear to harm you.

141
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
Listen carefully.

142
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,960
Stay away from Lu Huai.

143
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,680
Otherwise,

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
I will tear your face up.

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Then,

146
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,280
I'll take your heart.

147
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
You know it.

148
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,400
So what?

149
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,080
Who would believe you?

150
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Su Luoluo.

151
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,040
You finally show your true colors.

152
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,480
This is the real you.

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Sister.

154
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,680
My dear sister.

155
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,120
You were born as the legitimate
daughter of Prime Minister.

156
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,880
You are arrogant,

157
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,280
looking down on everyone.

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,400
And what am I?

159
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
An illegitimate daughter
no one cares about.

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,040
I had to earn that humble status

161
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,160
with every effort.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,280
Why do you get to have all good things,

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,800
while I act in a fawning manner?

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,040
I am also the daughter
of Prime Minister.

165
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm clearly the one Prince Chun likes.

166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,080
It's the only pure love I have.

167
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
Why do you have to take that from me?

168
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I, Su Yunqi,

169
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
take that from you?

170
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,680
You're flattering yourself.

171
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,520
Wake up, Su Luoluo.

172
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,080
For the title of princess,

173
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,920
you poisoned me.

174
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
In love, the one who is not loved
is the third wheel.

175
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,080
Prince Chun doesn't love you.

176
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Just wait and see.

177
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,880
I will take back everything

178
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,240
that's rightfully mine.

179
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,760
(I may have stopped her this time.
But what about next?)

180
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,840
(What exactly does she want
from Lu Huai?)

181
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,760
(I'm running out of time.
I must find out as soon as possible.)
