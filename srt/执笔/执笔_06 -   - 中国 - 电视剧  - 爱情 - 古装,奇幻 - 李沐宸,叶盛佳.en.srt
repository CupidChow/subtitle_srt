00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,600
(Lu Huai!)

2
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
(Help, Lu Huai!)

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,200
Lu Huai?

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,160
(Suppress the desire.
Do not let it drive you.)

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
My lord,

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,800
I beg you to spare his life.

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,560
No matter what mistake he has made,
I'm willing to exchange my life for his.

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,080
This is Yuniang from the Moon Tower.

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
(Moon Tower.)

10
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,640
The killer is hiding in the Moon Tower.

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
Search the place,
but don't alert the target.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,520
Lu Huai, help! Help!

=Episode 6=

15
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
Master Lu, are you here to mock me?

16
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Forget it.

17
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't blame him. This is my fate.

18
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,640
Thank you for coming back.

19
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,920
Now I know that there is someone
in this world who hasn't abandoned me.

20
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Master Lu, could you do me a favor?

21
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,920
What favor?

22
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
In my condition,

23
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm afraid I can't go back like this.

24
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
Could you take me in for one night?

25
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,600
Okay.

26
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you.

27
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,320
What are your orders, my lord?

28
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,960
Find a clean set of clothes
for the young lady inside.

29
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes.

30
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,440
And just do as you're told.
Don't ask questions.

31
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
Yes, my lord.

32
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,360
The power
behind the Moon Tower is great.

33
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
It would be difficult to shut it down.

34
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,360
But it has been cleared out.

35
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,480
No news will get out.

36
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Someone! Help!

37
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,000
My lord, she...

38
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
You may leave.

39
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Yes.

40
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
What are you doing?

41
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,160
Chastity is the most important thing
for a woman.

42
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,200
Now that I've lost it,
I am no longer innocent.

43
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,760
It's not that I don't want to live,
but that I don't deserve to be alive.

44
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,920
You have been insulted. The one
who should die is the perpetrator.

45
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Why does a victim like you think
you don't deserve to live?

46
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,160
How can I live on?
Forever under the disdain of others?

47
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,360
Must I live forever with my head down?

48
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,840
Then the fault lies with this world,
not with you.

49
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,280
Do you truly not despise me
because of this?

50
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,600
I never valued you highly
because of your noble status earlier.

51
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
I won't look down on you either.

52
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,520
In my eyes,
you have always been just Su Yunqi.

53
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,520
You are first the prime minister's
daughter and the future princess.

54
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,560
And then, you are Su Yunqi.

What?

70
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,320
Can I ask you something?

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Yes?

72
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,680
That scar on your shoulder...

73
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,000
I've had it since I was a child.
What about it?

74
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,720
(She must have forgotten
that she once saved me.)

75
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,560
It's nothing...

76
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,480
(Young Lu Huai was saved by Su Luoluo.)

77
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,840
(Su Luoluo is Lu Huai's fetter.)

78
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
Now, it's me.

79
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,640
(Not only did you
ruthlessly scar yourself)

80
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,680
(to steal Su Luoluo's story,)

81
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,120
(but you also feigned a loss of chastity
to fill Lu Huai with guilt.)

82
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,080
(Indeed, you are malicious at heart.)

83
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,560
(What have you done to him?)

84
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,784
I gave him some sedatives.

85
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,720
I knew you wouldn't
let anything happen to Su Luoluo.

86
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,136
It would be mostly to deal with me.

87
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,676
So I was prepared.
