1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,520
Luoluo,

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,560
don't be afraid.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,080
In my eyes,

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,920
it's not that you have a scar,

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,440
but another lady lacks such a scar.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,320
This scar on your face is like

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,080
the snow on the peak

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,520
or a dewdrop on a lotus,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,560
making you more beautiful.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,080
Do you think I am pretty with a scar?

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,280
Absolutely.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Why slap me?

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
Do you still think I'm pretty now?

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,840
Pretty.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,400
And now?

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Oh, my.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,480
I don't know what's wrong with me now.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,560
I think you are still beautiful

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,384
when you're going crazy.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,960
I have fallen deeply in love with you.

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Who would think a lady
with a scar is beautiful?

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
Snow on the peak

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
or a dewdrop on a lotus?

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,160
Hypocritical!

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
Your affection for me
was indeed arranged by The Book.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,520
It's fake.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,800
All of it is fake!

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,280
Luoluo,

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,280
calm down.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
I will get a physician
for you right now.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
I am not sick.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,120
You are the one who's sick.

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,800
It's the world that's sick.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
It's fake.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
All of it is fake.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,840
Alright.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,440
You're right.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,560
It's Su Yunqi. She's the real culprit.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
I will avenge you right now.

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,560
Su Yunqi!

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,280
Come out!

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Come out right now!

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Lu Huai,

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,920
get out of my way.

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,720
No.

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,200
She has hurt Luoluo so badly.

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
She did this to her sister,

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
and also hurt you.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,080
Why are you still defending her?

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,640
She is now my wife.

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,560
I won't allow anyone to harm her.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
Do you really think
she will be grateful to you?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
She is so malicious.

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Aren't you afraid
she'll stab you in the back again?

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,832
It's nothing to do with you.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
But as for you, Prince Chun,

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
perhaps you should consider

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
if someone is stabbing you in the back.

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,880
My Luoluo is indeed kind-hearted.

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,080
What I'm saying is

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
the Prime Minister.

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
The Prime Minister is my mentor.

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,360
Stop trying to make mischief.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,360
So, may I ask you, Prince Chun,

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,000
has the Prime Minister shown
you the ledger from Fuhua Mansion?

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm not going after this.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,720
I just hope you can think

68
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
whether he has been
falsely assuming authority,

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
benefiting from both sides,

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,720
and accepting bribes
from officials under your name.

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,480
If not,

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,360
perhaps you should look at

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,320
the ledger.

74
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,040
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Since I cannot see Su Yunqi,

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,600
I shall take my leave.

77
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,730
=Fortune Writer=

78
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,952
=Episode 18=

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,720
Your Highness,
the princess has refused to eat,

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,920
saying she'd rather starve to death.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
What's up?

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,480
Eat!

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,800
I won't eat.

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,320
I have little patience.

85
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,880
Don't push me.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Bring the cook here.

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,360
Yes.

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
As the meal isn't
to the princess' taste,

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
your hands are of no use anymore.

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Your Highness,

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,560
I can't be without hands.

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,200
I beg for your mercy.

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
You shouldn't beg me.

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,600
Your Highness,

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
I will cook well in the future.

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,760
Please, I will surely make meals
to your taste.

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
I beg for your mercy.

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Stop!

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
I'll eat.

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Are you afraid of me?

101
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,618
(Final Chapter)

102
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:18,816
(Prince Chun marries Su Luoluo.
Lu Huai shoots Su Yunqi to death.)

103
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,800
Yes,

104
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,480
I am.

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
You've turned me into this.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,440
Then you said you're afraid of me?

107
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,480
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,920
I beg you to let me go.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,200
You still have compassion for others.

110
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,960
Why do you never show me any mercy?

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,880
You insisted on staying at my mansion

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,600
and being my maid.

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,480
Well.

114
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,720
I grant your wish.

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,040
Your Highness,

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
the prince said you should

117
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,880
clean the entire residence.

118
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
If a speck of dust is found,

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
you have to redo it.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,720
Should I help her?

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,560
How did you break the vase?

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Clean it up quickly.

123
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,600
You maid,

124
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
how dare you bully me?

125
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't think you're something.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,640
You might be less important than I am

127
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,040
in the Prince's eyes.

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Is that so?

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Tell me more.

130
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,400
I pour bathwater
for the Prince every day.

131
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,360
No other servants are
allowed into the Prince's bedroom.

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,000
You've even managed to
pour bathwater for Lu Huai.

133
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
You're impressive.

134
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
How dare you address the Prince's name?

135
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,000
The water is dirty. I'll change it.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,680
-Did you do this on purpose?
- Sorry about that, Your Highness.

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,400
I'm going to prepare
the Prince's bathwater.

138
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
I was too hasty and my hands shook.

139
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,080
I must hurry up,

140
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
or the Prince will be anxious.

141
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,520
You can leave.

142
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,680
Your Highness,
the prince asked you to do that.

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
Did I let you go?

144
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,000
What are you doing?
Don't come near me.

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,480
Do you think I would
touch a woman who tried to kill me?

146
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Why do you think
that I would be still into you?

147
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
When you pushed me
off the cliff, you told me

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you chose yourself.

149
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,600
What does that mean?

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,600
Even if I tell you,

151
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,600
you won't believe it.

152
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,160
Tell me about it.

153
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,840
Everything in this world

154
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,840
has been arranged by The Book.

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,800
Do you understand what I'm saying?

156
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,280
Why do you ask
if my bath water is hot enough?

157
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,560
I said

158
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,120
I pushed you off the cliff,

159
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
because I knew

160
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,320
you definitely wouldn't die.

161
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
Are you a deity?

162
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,240
How could you foresee my death?

163
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,360
You don't even find
a reliable reason to make up a lie.

164
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
If you don't believe, forget it.

165
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
After all, I'm just heartless.

166
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,040
If you feel disappointed,

167
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,400
then let me go.

168
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,280
