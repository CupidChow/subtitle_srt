00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:14,432
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:20,960
(Lu's Mansion)

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,000
Lu Huai, you bad guy!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
I will fight you!

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,240
You bad guy!

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,080
My husband risked his life
alongside you for years.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,760
but you killed him in front of my son.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,640
Lu Huai.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,840
My husband treated you as his brother.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,720
What do you think he is?

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,120
You used him
to pave your way to success.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,400
You are heartless.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,480
You are a scumbag.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
Lu Huai.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,040
I heard that your mother
got killed by you.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,080
You deserve to be alone.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,400
You will die a tragic death.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,280
Lu Huai.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,480
You will get your retribution.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,320
You scumbag!

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,640
Give me back my husband.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
Give me back my husband.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,480
Lu Huai.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,360
Step aside.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,560
If you're scared, stay away from me.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,320
Jin Jiu, take her away.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,320
You will die a tragic death.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,960
Lu Huai, you will die a tragic death.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
As for you,

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
by the time I return,

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,160
I don't want to see you.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,080
Master.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
No more beating.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,240
I will tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,040
Prince Chun and Prime Minister
have a place

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
to meet court officials in secret.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
Where is it?

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,240
It's called the Fuhua Mansion.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,960
I don't know

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
where it is exactly.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,600
I'll go investigate.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,560
Butler,

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,240
could I ask you something?

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
You just go back.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,920
Lady Yunqi.

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Don't be that polite.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
Today, a pregnant woman said

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,920
Master Lu deserves

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,360
to be alone and will die a tragic death.

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
I think he takes that very seriously.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Why is that?

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
Master Lu is in a bad mood.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,840
I'm really worried about him.

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,440
Actually, today

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
is his birthday.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
But,

58
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,840
it's also his mother's
death anniversary.

59
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,320
What?

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
He's pathetic.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,440
Since his mother died,

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
he has never
celebrated his birthday again.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
Lady Luoluo, what are you doing?

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,640
I peaked at father's
record of officials.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
I know that today is
Master Lu's birthday.

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,440
I want to bring him
a bowl of longevity noodles.

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Lady Luoluo, you are really smart.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,480
Perhaps if he is happy,

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,120
he will stop making things difficult.

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,920
I might as well add an egg.

71
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Master Lu.

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,880
What's up?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
After my sister left home,

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,640
I've been very worried.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
I heard that you took my sister in.

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm very grateful.

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
I want to repay your kindness.

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
I heard

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,240
that today is your birthday.

80
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
So I made a bowl of longevity noodles.

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,120
Please accept it.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,880
Take a look.

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,840
I made noodles in the afternoon,

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
but they became a paste.

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Blessing amulets.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Come take a look.

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Blessing amulets.

88
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
Keep the change.

89
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
How did you know it is my birthday?

90
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,200
People who want to know it

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,400
will learn about it.

92
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,680
Actually,

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I have long been...

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,840
Lu Huai.

95
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Come with me.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Lady Luoluo.

97
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,840
I still need to scatter flowers?

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,520
Young lady.

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,640
You'll have to clean them up.

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,120
What do you want?

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Lu Huai.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Happy birthday.

103
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,880
This is my birthday gift to you.

104
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:40,263
(May you have a baby soon.)

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
The birthday gift you gave me says,

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
"May you have a baby soon."

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,360
What?

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,000
May you have...

109
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,760
No, I didn't mean it.

110
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,120
I was just too anxious,
so I bought it wrong.

111
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
I-I mean...

112
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
It means...

113
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Don't underestimate this.

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
May you have a baby soon.

115
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
That is to say,

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,960
if you can have two children,

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
then these children

118
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,560
may have many more children.

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
It won't be long

120
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
before your family grows.

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,120
So,

122
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,360
no one will ever say
you deserve to be alone...

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Enough said.

124
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll take

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,800
this gift.

126
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
What's wrong?

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,000
There's blood.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
It's dirty.

129
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,000
It's not dirty.

130
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,840
It's not dirty anymore.

131
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
This morning,

132
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,200
that pregnant woman said

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
you killed her husband

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
as you want to get promoted.

135
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
That's not true,

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
right?

137
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't you think

138
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,520
I would kill his father

139
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,000
in front of the child?

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
No.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960
I just don't think

142
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,640
you'd kill to get a promotion.

143
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,680
What?

144
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
You're the Deputy Commander
of the Armor Guard,

145
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
but your house

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,280
doesn't even have decent tea for guests.

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,760
Why would you want to get a promotion?

148
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
What do you mean?

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Haven't you noticed?

150
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
You only use

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
the cheapest tea.

152
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,720
Do you think everyone
is as picky as you?

153
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
So you see.

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,120
You're a man who doesn't
pursue quality of life.

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,280
So promotion is useless.

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,360
Her husband misconducted,

157
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,240
causing the newly top scholar to die.

158
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,480
If I don't make a decision on the spot,

159
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm afraid the Emperor
would kill his whole family.

160
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,680
So,

161
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,880
the reason you don't explain

162
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,160
is because you don't care
what others say.

163
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
Because

164
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,320
no one wants to listen to me.

165
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Lu Huai.

166
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
I want to listen to you.

167
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
You can tell me.

168
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Lu Huai.

169
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,800
Lu Huai.

170
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Can I stay at your mansion?

171
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,800
I can be a maid.

172
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,840
By the way,

173
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
the quilt is too coarse for me.

174
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,240
I have delicate skin.

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,488
Only silk quilts
from Jiangnan Beauty Boutique will do.

176
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,920
I need Fragrance mansion's
rosewood dressing mirror.

177
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,600
By the way,

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
I need the new rouge

179
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
from Stormy House.

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,560
And also, I eat...

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
Are you here to be a maid?

182
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
She said she wants to be my maid.

183
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
I just want to see
what tricks she wants to play.

184
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,920
I didn't ask.

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,920
Let's talk about something else.

186
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,216
The Emperor needs evidence
of Prime Minister's crimes.

187
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,120
If we delay,

188
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,200
we'll be in trouble.

189
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,600
I found a guy in West Market named Hu

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
was arrested for human trafficking.

191
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,160
