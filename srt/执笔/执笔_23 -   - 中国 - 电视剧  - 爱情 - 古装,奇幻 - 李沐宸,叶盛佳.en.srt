(Imperial Prison)

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
I'm here for Yun Sheng,
who's involved in Mr. Guo's case.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
He was executed yesterday.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,720
(He couldn't break free from the fate
decided by Fortune Writer either.)

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,280
Wait. He asked me
to give this letter to the person

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,640
coming to visit him after his death.

9
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:50,404

(Yun Sheng)
(From love comes sorrow and fear.)

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,440
(Those who are away from love
have neither sorrow nor fear.)

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
What's on your mind?

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,400
I think I lost something very important.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,440
Sister, why did you come here?

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
I came to congratulate you.

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
Sister, I'm sleepy.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Let's talk after my wedding.

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,000
It's just the two of us here.
No need to pretend.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
I don't understand what you're saying.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
Clearly, you remember everything.

21
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,360
You know all of this
has been altered by Fortune Writer.

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,264
I don't know what you're talking about.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,720
Really?

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
Just admit it.

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,840
Yes, I admit I remember everything.

26
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,000
But so what?

27
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,960
You want to stand against
Fortune Writer.

28
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,360
You've overestimated yourself.

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,280
What's wrong with accepting fate?

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,680
Now I have everyone's love.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,440
You've lost to me.

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,680
Are you sure their love is sincere?

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
It doesn't matter.

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,600
I've wanted to escape
from Prime Minister's Residence.

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,360
I didn't expect
someone is willing to stay in this cage

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,080
to be a puppet forever.

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Tomorrow,
I'll follow the plot in the story.

38
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,240
I hope you'll never regret

39
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,800
after the story ends perfectly.

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,920
- Congratulations, Your Highness.
- Thanks.

41
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,400
May you be deeply in love
and have children soon.

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,120
Congratulations, Prime Minister.
I'm leaving.

43
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,896
(Virtue and Peace)
Congratulations, bye.

44
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,960
Today is my wedding day.

45
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Sister, I'm truly happy that you came.

46
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,760
Everything disappears
in the blink of an eye as time flies.

47
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I wish you a harmonious
and long-lasting marriage.

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,480
Su Yunqi, what are you doing?
Let Princess Chun go.

49
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,240
Princess Chun?

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,320
She has taken everything from me.
I want her to die with me.

51
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
What does it take for you to let her go?

52
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,360
A life for a life.
You come here to replace her.

53
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,920
Fine, I accept your condition.

54
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Your Highness.

55
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,520
Don't come any closer!
Take one more step and I'll kill him.

56
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,232
(Virtue and Peace)

57
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,000
Su Yunqi, what on earth do you want?

58
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,640
Who are you?

59
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
What?

60
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,520
Fortune Writer likes you the most.

61
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,440
He changed the heroine,
but he has never done anything to you.

62
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Listen carefully.

63
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
If you don't come out
by the count of three,

64
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
I'll kill your male lead.

65
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,080
One.

66
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Are you insane?

67
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
This is insanity.

68
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
- Three.
- Stop!

69
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:20,580
(Wedding)

70
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
(Honest and Upright)
Let Prince Chun go!

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,160
Should I call you Father
or Fortune Writer?

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,440
Nonsense. Archers, get ready.

73
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Stop!

74
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,680
Are you Fortune Writer?

75
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,640
You shouldn't have let me
know your existence.

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Your appearance has made me realize

77
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
all of this is fake.

78
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,920
Honey, I'm the princess now.

79
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,160
I want to ask
if your men can listen to my order.

80
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,240
You know I can't refuse you.

81
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,720
Good.

82
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,800
Everyone, kill him!

83
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

84
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,160
You really are disobedient.

85
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,520
Kill her.

86
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,760
This is the final chapter you want.

87
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,960
Who are you to control me? Loser.

88
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:29,824
(Eve of the wedding)

89
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,920
Why are you here?

90
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
I don't know.

91
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,600
But a voice in my heart
told me I had to come.

92
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
Or I'll regret throughout my life.

93
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,520
Have you remembered anything?

94
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,632
I tried to recall everything about you,

95
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,280
but nothing came to my mind.

96
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,640
But whenever you get close,

97
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
I can hardly control
my painful feelings.

98
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,160
Perhaps I'll never remember who you are,

99
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,320
but I'm willing to keep my promise.

100
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,760
What promise?

101
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Protecting you forever.

102
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,880
You said you'd protect me forever.
Have you forgotten?

103
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,600
You guys really are surprising.

104
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Only one of you can live.

105
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,600
Do it.

106
