1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,120
Someone! Come here quickly!

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,080
Her Ladyship's face has been scratched!

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,240
My face!

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
Su Yunqi, you have ruined my face!

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,120
Someone! Hurry up!

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,200
Su Yunqi, you have ruined my face!

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
(Side Story)
(Su Yunqi will marry the prince.)

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,080
Luoluo!

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Luo...

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,040
You troublemaker!

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,360
How dare you
commit to such a heinous act!

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
Come on!

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,480
You want to kill me, right?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,440
Su Luoluo's face has been ruined.
If you kill me,

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,360
who else can marry Prince Chun?

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,880
If you kill me,

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,640
the ledger from Fuhua Mansion

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,160
will soon be made public.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,840
Then we will both

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,960
go down in flames.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,040
You...

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,320
You are too malicious!

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
I am malicious?

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,440
Father,

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,600
I learned it all from you.

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,760
What exactly do you what?

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
I want the title of the princess.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,240
I want a high position,

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
admired by all.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,280
I want luxurious attires

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,480
and exquisite carriages!

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
I want...

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,600
What if I want your life?

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
You can take it anytime.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,960
I want...

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,440
I want...

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,000
I want everything.

38
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,561

40
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,837
(Su Residence)

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Don't be foolish.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,440
You don't understand

43
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,920
how much trouble it is to be with me.

44
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,720
I am not afraid.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,400
I like you.

46
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,480
What are you doing?

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Lu Huai?

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,840
How come it's you?

49
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,280
Are you disappointed?

50
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,624
Where is the Prince Chun?

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,384
What did you do to him?

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Why don't you ask

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
how I have survived?

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,880
What did you do to Prince Chun?

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,800
Have you lost your mind?

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,400
Are you so keen to marry him?

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,280
Why?

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,960
I want to be a princess.

59
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
But he

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,440
can't come anymore.

61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Let go!

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Why are you crying?

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
You don't understand.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,880
You shouldn't come back.

65
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
It will only make things...

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,720
You'd better stop talking.

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120
Right now I want to

68
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,880
strangle you.

69
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,800
Do it then!

70
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,640
You pushed me off the cliff.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Have you ever regretted it?

72
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,760
No.

73
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Not even a bit?

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Not for a moment?

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,160
No.

76
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,960
Have you given up?

77
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Make your move!

78
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
I can make you

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
suffer a lot.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Let go of me!

81
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,240
Lu Huai!

82
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,480
Let go of me! Don't!

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
- Greetings to Princess Su.
- Greetings to Princess Su.

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Princess Su?

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,440
What Princess Su?

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
- Greetings to Prince Su.
- Greetings to Prince Su.

87
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
You may leave now.

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

89
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,120
Prince Su?

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,360
What does that mean?

91
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
It's all thanks to you.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Lu Huai.

93
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Wake up, Lu Huai.

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,640
Why?

95
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,400
Your Majesty,

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,640
the people sent to
Qinghe have verified it.

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Lu Huai, Master Lu,

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
is indeed your son.

99
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Huai,

100
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,640
you have suffered these years.

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,400
I will immediately proclaim
your identity,

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,120
appoint you as Prince Su,

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,040
and posthumously appoint
your mother as Consort Nian.

104
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,040
Your Majesty,

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,120
I only have one request.

106
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,920
Your wish will be granted.

107
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
At tomorrow's wedding,

108
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,480
please allow me
to marry on behalf of Prince Chun.

109
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,400
Lu Huai, you have quite the nerve!

110
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
Rest assured.

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
The one marrying me tomorrow

112
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
won't be Lady Luoluo either.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,960
So the one who just married me...

114
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,640
It was me.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,360
I was the only one kept in the dark.

116
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,040
Didn't you scheme
all along to be a princess?

117
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Isn't this perfect now?

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,000
It should satisfy you.

119
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
If you married me to insult me,

120
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
are you satisfied now?

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,640
This is just the beginning.

122
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
I will make you

123
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,320
suffer a lot.

124
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Guards!

125
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
Watch Princess Su.

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,000
If she escapes,

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,920
you will be whipped twenty times.

129
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,480
Did you say I will be killed by Lu Huai?

131
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
That's right.

132
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
Absurd.

133
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
If I push Su Luoluo off the cliff,

134
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,240
then she must be dead.

135
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
In the Book of Fate,

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,080
main characters don't die easily.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,640
Your Highness,
the prince asked to meet you.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Get out!

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,720
Instead of spending
the wedding night alone,

140
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,840
you should have killed Su Luoluo

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
and become the heroine.

142
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Fortune Writer?

143
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,520
I've said I've always been watching you.

144
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I handed you the knife,
but you're so disappointing.

145
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,680
I did want to kill her,

146
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
but you are just way too repulsive,

147
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,160
which even makes her
seem somewhat endearing.

148
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,600
You shouldn't have defied me.

149
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
I am the Fortune Writer.

150
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,240
Nonsense!

151
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,240
You're high and mighty,

152
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,600
manipulating everything

153
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
and making us
puppets for your amusement.

154
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,280
Why?

155
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
You ruined everything of me.

156
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,000
You nonchalantly ask
me to be your heroine now

157
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
as if I should bow down to you

158
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
for gratitude, right?

159
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,160
If you don't do it,
Su Luoluo can continue to do that.

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,560
She wants to be your puppet,

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
then let her be.

162
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,320
But as for me,

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll only be Su Yunqi.

164
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,160
(Final Chapter)

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,360
(Prince Chun marries Su Luoluo.)

166
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,480
(Lu Huai shoots Su Yunqi to death.)

167
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,280
Luoluo, let me in.

168
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
I didn't get married.

169
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,560
Luoluo,

170
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,960
open the door!

171
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,960
Open the door!

172
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Heroine...

173
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Luoluo,

174
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,600
open the door!

175
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,200
Fortune Writer...

176
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
Hurry up and open the door!

177
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,080
You were originally
the heroine under my pen.

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,280
Look how much
Prince Chun loved you before.

179
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Too bad you've
become completely useless,

180
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,720
so I had no choice but to replace you.

181
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
It's all fake.

182
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,000
It's all fabricated.

183
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,760
So what is real?

184
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
Luoluo,

185
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,080
my love for you will not change.

186
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Love?

187
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
Open the door.

188
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,280
Love is real.

189
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Your Highness,

190
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
what do you love about me?

191
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,040
Ah?
