00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:14,496
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,880
Peach tree.

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,760
It's really my mother's peach tree.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,080
Lu Huai, you...

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
I passed your residence
and saw this lush peach tree.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It'd be a pity to cut it.

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,000
So...

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,240
Thank you.

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Thank you so much.

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
This peach tree

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,960
was planted by my mother

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,280
when I was born.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,040
Then,

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,040
we'll take care of it together.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,680
We?

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
He said,

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
"we".

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,920
My Lady.

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
I brought you some Steamed Cheese.

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Eat while it's hot.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,080
My Lady.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,720
Madam's peach tree

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,400
is growing even better here.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
So beautiful.

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,040
Flowers withered away

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
in a flash.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
How could the flowers withstand

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,640
the cold winds and rain?

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,560
My Lady, what does it mean?

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,800
Life is short.

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
Time is limited.

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,840
(Chapter Twenty-Five)

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,320
(Su Luoluo returns the ledger
to the Prime Minister.)

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,280
(The Prime Minister puts her mother's
tablet in the family shrine.)

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
Taoqi.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,440
If the person

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,000
you love

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,080
has something you really need,

40
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,680
but if he loses it,

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,520
he might die,

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
will you take it from him?

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,440
My Lady, what are you saying?

44
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,160
How could I do such a despicable thing?

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
But if the situation reverses,

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
when he's in need,

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm willing to give him anything.

48
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,680
Why?

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Because I love him.

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,160
That's why I'm willing.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,120
The one who loves more

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
is the one who loses.

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,360
Taoqi.

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I think

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
I love myself the most.

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,200
My Lady.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,520
Where are you going?

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
Don't rush.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,040
Take your time.

60
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
No rush.

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,040
See?

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,800
I can be really kind.

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,880
I want to be a good person too.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
But I have no choice.

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,480
I can't help it.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
I really can't help it.

67
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,800
You can ask me a question.

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,920
This time I will tell the truth.

69
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,480
I will surely not lie to you.

70
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,400
Think twice.

71
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
You only get one question.

72
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,080
How can I make you stop crying?

73
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,640
No.

74
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,280
I said you only get one question.

75
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
Perhaps

76
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
you should ask me...

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,920
Ask me

78
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,440
what is my purpose with you?

79
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,200
What do I really want?

80
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,560
I'm serious.

81
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
So am I.
