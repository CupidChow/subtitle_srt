00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,464
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,760
You know it, don't you?

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,504
Enough!

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,880
Lu Huai.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,440
Lady Yunqi, we have only met
a few times. Please behave yourself.

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,440
Master Lu.

8
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,600
What's wrong?

9
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,040
Lady Yunqi has been waiting outside.

10
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,680
And then, she fainted.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,440
Ask someone to take her home.

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,040
Now everyone in the capital
is gossiping that she's mad.

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,000
She has become a laughingstock.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,160
Somehow, I feel a bit sorry for her.

15
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,880
(When did I have this memory?)

16
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Lu Huai, you haven't
forgotten me, right?

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,760
You said you have fallen for me.

18
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,320
and want to be with me forever.

19
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,800
You said you'd protect me forever.
Have you forgotten?

20
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,320
(Is everything she said true?)

21
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
My Lady, you've finally woken up.

22
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,200
My Lady, you mustn't go looking for
Master Lu again.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
He simply doesn't care about you.

24
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,480
It's me who carried
you back from Lu's Mansion.

25
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,920
There's a place I must go to.

26
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,000
My Lady.

27
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,688
(Zhuque Street)

28
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Coachman.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,280
Miss, where would you like to go?

30
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,670
- Ethereal Valley, okay?
- Yes.

31
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,520
I see. Your beloved one
must have been waiting for a long time.

32
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,720
That's quite enviable.

33
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
I just want to go see the fireflies.

34
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,576
Ah.

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
Lu Huai, look, so many fireflies!

36
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,920
You said, when we come
to Ethereal Valley,

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,720
the mountain god would
bless us to be together forever.

38
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,360
But if I grow old,

39
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,840
my hair turns white,
all my teeth fall out,

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,960
and I become old and ugly,
will you still love me?

41
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
I know you will.

42
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,920
But if you become old and ugly,

43
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,440
then I will dislike you.

44
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm drawn to the new
and averse to the old.

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,920
But when it occurs to me

46
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,480
I can grow old with you slowly,

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,200
it feels like it's actually quite nice.

48
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,880
What do you think?

49
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,120
You think it's quite nice too, right?

50
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,080
Because Lu Huai is the big fool
in the world.

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,600
He treats me, a bad person,
like a treasure.

52
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,600
Then, let me be merciful.

54
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,040
Let me make a wish
to the mountain god for you, okay?

55
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,360
First, I wish my beloved
a thousand-year life.

56
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,920
Second, I wish myself
a healthy body forever.

57
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,640
Third, I wish we'll to see each other
every year like swallows on the beams.

58
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Let it be. Next time you definitely
won't break our appointment.

59
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,192
- Lu Huai.
- Stop there.

60
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,112
- Lu Huai.
- Who are you?

61
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Let her come over.

62
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
Lady Yunqi, how long do you
want to keep making a fuss?

63
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,920
Lu Huai, I miss you so much.

64
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,480
Wait.

65
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,280
Master Lu, do you believe in fate?

66
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,520
I don't.

67
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I didn't, either.

68
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,600
But now I do.

69
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,400
What do you mean?

70
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,360
Lu Huai, it's not you to blame.

71
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,520
Because you can't control yourself.

72
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,080
It's me to blame

73
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
for thinking of counting on others.

74
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,400
It's you who forgot about me,

75
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,120
so I should keep moving forward.

76
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,280
It turns out that I can
only rely on myself.

77
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,400
You finally believe in fate.

78
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,560
Tell the Fortune Writer
I resign to my fate.

79
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,960
I'll assassinate Su Luoluo at the
wedding tomorrow as the chapter states.
