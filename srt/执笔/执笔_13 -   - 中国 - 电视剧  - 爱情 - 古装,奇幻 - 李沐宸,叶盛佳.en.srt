00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:14,432
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,720
What is this?

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,040
Before my mother died, she asked me
to take it and find my father.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,880
I don't care about a scoundrel
who abandoned us.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,040
But,

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
this is the only thing
my mother left me.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I want you to have it.

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,240
No.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,640
It's too precious. I can't accept it.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,400
I...

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
(I'm not worthy of it.)

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
I have fallen for you.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,160
I want to keep you.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,720
I want you to stop crying.

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,040
I want you to live in peace and joy.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,600
You have feelings for me too,

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,600
right?

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Lu Huai, don't be foolish.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,960
You don't understand.

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,240
Getting involved with me

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,640
will bring you a lot of trouble.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm not afraid.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
You're not afraid?

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
What if I destroy

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,960
everything you risked your life to earn?

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,480
What if I want your life?

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
You can take it anytime.

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
This sleeve arrow

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
is good for self-defense.

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,640
I wanted to give it to you.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
Don't think I wouldn't dare.

33
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,320
One day I might use it to shoot you

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,440
without even blinking.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Just you wait.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,360
What's wrong?

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
I bit my tongue.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
Now this courtyard is mine,

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,480
the title is mine,

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,520
and the position of the princess

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
will also be mine.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Sister,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
what else is yours

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,160
in the Prime Minister's Residence?

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,240
Luoluo.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,480
Look.

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,840
Guess what I brought you?

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,320
Such a cute bunny.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
Silly girl.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
Once you marry me,

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
all the bunnies in the capital

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,880
can be yours.

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
Your Highness.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,600
Don't say such things.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,320
A secret betrothal

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,160
is doomed to be laughed at.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,840
I've made it clear to your father.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll marry no one but you.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Had Su Yunqi and Lu Huai not sabotaged,

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,880
you and I would've been
a married couple long ago.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
(Are they really trying
to undermine my efforts?)

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm hungry.

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,760
Will you dine with me?

64
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Lu Huai.

65
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,800
Lu Huai.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,600
Lu Huai.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,160
Lu Huai.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
Lu Huai.

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,080
What's going on?

70
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:52,160
(Chapter 26)

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
(Lu Huai was wounded by an assassin.)

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,160
(The wound worsens fast.)

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
Do you think you can
do whatever you want in my story?

74
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,920
This happened to him because of you.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,480
Because of me?

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,360
You altered the scene where
Su Luoluo took an arrow for Lu Huai,

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
effectively ending the romance
between Lu Huai and Su Luoluo.

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,120
Therefore, he's of no use now.

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,320
(He can't die. What should I do?)

80
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,640
(Su Luoluo.)

81
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,880
Lady Yunqi.

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,560
Sister.

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,440
What are you doing?

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,200
Lu Huai is sick.

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Come with me.

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
How is he now?

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
The physician says the wound
is getting worse.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
Whether he can live depends on today.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
But he is unconscious.

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,080
I can't make him take the medicine.

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,360
What do we do now?

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,560
You do it.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Master Lu.

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
It seems

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,600
there's only one way.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
What are you doing?

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,400
You'll feed him mouth-to-mouth?

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,480
No need to focus on that.

99
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,760
You couldn't do it with a spoon,

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,120
but you can with your mouth?

101
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
What?

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,080
Do you think there's a switch on him

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,520
that opens his mouth with a kiss?

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,520
Move.

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,240
(Only when they develop feelings)

106
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,960
(will Lu Huai be safe.)

107
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
(Do you want to save him?)

108
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,400
I am busy.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,640
I'll leave now.

110
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,720
You're leaving now?

111
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
I'm not a physician.

112
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm not helping here.

113
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,680
I will take good care of Master Lu.

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
Look,

115
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,920
she's here, isn't she?

116
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,400
Master Lu, you're awake.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Maybe the tea here

118
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,520
doesn't really suit me.

119
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
Master Lu.

120
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Lady Luoluo?

121
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,840
What are you doing here?

122
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
You've been unconscious for days.

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,320
I've been taking care of you
the whole time.

124
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
What about Su Yunqi?

125
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
She didn't even see you
these past few days.

126
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Master, is it worth it

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,600
to treat her so?

128
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,240
The ledger is gone.

129
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,440
What?

130
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
So is Su Yunqi.

131
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:44,128
(Su Residence)

132
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,120
Su Yunqi.

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,400
You really are

134
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,040
a smooth operator.

135
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,400
Master, stay calm.

136
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,400
Although I don't know

137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,920
what my sister did,

138
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,360
I am willing to go
check on things for you.

139
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,280
Yunqi.

140
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,240
Good girl.

141
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,600
You have really

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,280
solved a big problem for me.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Father.

144
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,880
If you want the ledger,

145
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,560
you have to promise me three things.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,040
Sure.

147
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,600
I can do better than that.

148
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,360
I'll promise you 30

149
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
or even 300 things.

150
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
First,

151
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
I want you to publicly announce

152
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
that my mother is innocent,

153
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,800
and put her tablet

154
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
back into the family shrine.

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,560
Okay.

156
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,720
I promise you.

157
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,360
Father.

158
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,760
Daughter.

159
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,200
Continue.

160
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,600
Second,

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
I must be your only

162
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
legitimate daughter.

163
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,120
Su Luoluo's mother

164
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,080
will never be acknowledged.

165
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,920
If you don't agree now

166
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,200
I'll give the ledger to Lu Huai.

167
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
No.

168
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Daughter,

169
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,160
I promise. I do.

170
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,880
Father.

171
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Shut up.

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,880
You have no say here.

173
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,280
Good daughter, continue.

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,680
How come it's only the half?

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,880
Third,

176
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,280
I want you to ensure my safety.

177
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,440
If anything happens to me,

178
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,640
the other half of the ledger

179
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,000
will be made public.

180
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
Su Yunqi.

181
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,120
Father.

182
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
Just a verbal agreement

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
won't convince me.

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,760
I kept the other half somewhere safe.

185
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
As long as you keep your promises,

186
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,080
I will give it to you.

187
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,760
You are so manipulative.

188
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
(I'm sorry, Lu Huai.)

189
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,000
(I can't gamble with your life.)
