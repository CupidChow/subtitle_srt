1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,440
Go inside!

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
Now you understand
why you are a born scoundrel, right?

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,200
You're of humble birth.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,400
My mother would never do such a thing.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,960
You returned domineeringly
with the ledger

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
and want
to take everything away from Su Luoluo.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,640
You need to be taught a lesson.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,120
Why are you laughing?

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,960
To defeat me

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,720
and help Su Luoluo,

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,480
you used such despicable means

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,440
to make her appearance

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,280
reasonable and legitimate.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,040
In your story,

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,760
only those of noble birth are respected.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,240
A lady

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,080
would be worthless
if she loses virginity.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,640
So ridiculous.

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,400
This is the world you depict.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,000
So absurd.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,320
So

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,560
disgusting.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,320
(Final Chapter)

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,920
(Su Yunqi
pushes Su Luoluo off the cliff.)

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,720
(Lu Huai shoots Su Yunqi to death.)

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Are you saying

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll be killed by Lu Huai?

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,010
=Fortune Writer=

29
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,384
=Episode 15=

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,280
What's wrong?

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,480
It's about Lady Yunqi.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
But you probably don't care.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
Indeed, I don't care about her.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,040
But keeping it to yourself
must make you very uncomfortable.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
So

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,040
tell me.

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,720
Prime Minister locked her up.

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
I heard
she's not his biological daughter.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
The specific details are unclear.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
But she's been locked up for days.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
What? Are you going to save her?

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
To Interrogate someone.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,160
Whom?

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,040
Du Guozhong.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Confess or not?

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,880
Lu Huai,

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,360
you disregard the court's law.

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll petition His Majesty

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
to punish you.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
Get me the Nine-section Needle.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes.

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Sister,

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
it's only been days.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
How did you become like this?

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Sister,

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,280
you think you can unlock it like this?

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,560
That's hilarious.

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
I have nothing to do.

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,760
I'm just filing my nails.

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
You're still so sharp-tongued.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,760
I really admire you.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,040
No matter what the circumstance is,

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,920
you always maintain your noble image.

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
You won't bow your head

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
like a gamecock.

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Compared to you,

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
indeed, I'm better.

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,520
Why do you

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
have this jade pendant?

70
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
Guess.

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
Of course it's because Master Lu

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,440
gave it to me.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Impossible.

74
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,160
This is left by his mother.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,280
He can't possibly give it to you.

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Master Lu said what happened this time

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,960
has made him see someone's true colors

78
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
and realize his true feelings.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
This jade pendant

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,080
is a love token.

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,560
He insisted I accept it.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
Sister,

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,720
don't be sad.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,080
After all,

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
you pushed him away.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
Who are you?

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,320
Tell Prime Minister

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Master Lu came
with Du Guozhong's confession.

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Su Luoluo,

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
you're so stupid.

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,440
You think I'll fall apart

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,840
after hearing what you said?

93
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Help!

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,880
Stop!

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Give me the key

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
and prepare a carriage.

97
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
Or I'll kill her!

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
Prime Minister,

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,120
Lady Yunqi kidnapped Lady Luoluo
and left in a carriage.

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,240
What?

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Stop!

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,680
Luoluo!

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,920
What are you doing?

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
Don't hurt Luoluo.

105
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,560
Let her go!

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,200
If you dare to take another step,

107
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,880
I'll kill her.

108
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,000
Lu Huai,

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
you do want to kill me for her?

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
Su Yunqi,

111
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
if you don't let me go,

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,960
Master Lu will surely kill you.

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,776
(Final Chapter)

114
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,280
(Su Yunqi pushes Su Luoluo
off the cliff.)

115
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
(Lu Huai shoots Su Yunqi to death.)

116
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,000
Master Lu,

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,960
I know you care about me.

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,640
Su Yunqi has gone mad.

119
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Save me.

120
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm indebted to her.

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
Let her go.

122
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,640
Su Yunqi,

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,320
you've been arrogant for so many years.

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,600
Finally, you're gonna get
what you deserve.

125
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
If you hurt me,

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,560
Master Lu will surely not let you go.

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,960
Shut up!

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry.

129
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
I choose myself.

130
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:38,480
(Final Chapter)

131
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
(Su Yunqi kidnaps Su Luoluo.)

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,120
(Su Yunqi pushes Lu Huai off the cliff.)

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Once the ink dries out,

134
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
the end is decided.

135
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
Mother,

136
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
