1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,560
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,150

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,090
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,540
  Episode 16

5
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,350
 Usurpation of the throne notice: The current throne occupant, Lee Kang,

6
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,100
 usurped the throne from the young king in exile in a treasonous manner.

7
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,950
 As his blood brother, I urge the people to help me rectify this situation.

8
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,650
- Are you done?
 - Let's go.

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,430
  The sky is dark (profound mystery) and the earth is yellow (warm).

10
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,450
 (This is the first line of the "Thousand Character Classic," a poem that is used as a primer for teaching Chinese characters.)

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:35,490
"Chun Ji Hyeon Hwang." 
  (The sky is dark and the earth is yellow).

12
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,310
The sky is dark and the earth is yellow.

13
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,080
Isn't the sky blue?

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,660
Its meaning is connected to "Woo Joo Hong Ang" that will come later.

15
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,090
Between the sky and the earth, space is large and broad, so it is limitless.

16
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,570
So, it's shedding light on how large this world is.

17
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,160
This won't do. I'll start by teaching you easier things.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,650
Let's see.  This is "in," meaning a person.

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,510
A person cannot live alone.

20
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,050
We have to lean on each other, that's what the word signifies.

21
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,380
But, instead of this,

22
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,290
I want to learn Hwi's name.

23
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,520
I did see before

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,530
how to write Hwi's name, but...

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,330
Look closely.

26
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,200
 Hwi

27
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,560
 Hwi

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,770
Why is it so complicated?

29
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,840
When you practice, it'll get easier.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,790
Oh, but, what are they talking about in His Highness' room?

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,450
I don't know.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Do you want to know?

33
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,390
It wasn't enough to push the king out of the way and

34
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,430
send him into exile, but now he wants his life too?

35
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,770
He's feeling the burden of the former king.

36
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,880
As long as he's alive, he will be accused of stealing the throne.

37
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,440
Could it possibly be a trap?

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,400
To give you the order among so many others he could have given it to.

39
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,610
Even if it's a trap, we must go and save His Majesty.

40
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,820
We can't go, but we can't not go.

41
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,750
Even if you declined, Uncle would have sent other assassins.

42
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,050
Let's say we'll receive the order and bring the former king back.

43
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,630
Pardon me?

44
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,460
What are you doing there?

45
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,070
The Moon is bright so I was learning martial arts from Roo Shi Gae.

46
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,980
- If you're curious, come in. 
 - Your Highness.

47
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,410
What is there to hide between us or keep secret?

48
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,140
Don't be anxious out here and just come in.

49
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,430
The more heads, the better.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,170
I will not be going by myself.

51
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,060
Grand Prince Yang Ahn attached security to me.

52
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,780
We have to take His Majesty away before the assassins arrive.

53
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,990
It won't be easy but can you delay their travel as much as possible?

54
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,030
We may be able to get rid of some of them by ensnaring them in a trap along the way.

55
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,440
If we go head to head with the guards posted at the king's exile,

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,590
we will suffer casualties.

57
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,060
If you consider all of that and care about it, we can't fight.

58
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,990
You just have to focus on saving the former king.

59
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,750
I have a thought.

60
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,110
Can you get us court ladies uniforms?

61
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,890
 Usurpation of the throne notice

62
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,340
The king we have now

63
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,460
is not who you thought he was.

64
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,990
 Usurpation of the throne notice

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,100
How big is the group of traitors

66
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,120
that they're disturbing the capital like this?

67
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,540
They're all the same people.

68
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,400
They took the lady from the Seong family,  tried to kill me,

69
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,890
and put up the posters accusing me of usurping the throne.

70
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,080
They are all of the same group.

71
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,010
Let's lower the guards.

72
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,970
If they become complacent, they might slip.

73
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,460
Find out if the chief's scholars go anywhere on a regular basis.

74
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,390
Check it again.

75
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,330
I said you can't. You have to stay here in the mountain temple to be protected.

76
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,360
Then, how is this different from a Jeongubwon (temple for female monks)?

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,530
It's dangerous.

78
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,490
That applies to you, too, Your Highness.

79
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,230
- If I tell you to not go, will you listen to me? 
 - Please.

80
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,110
You said that we'd do it together, but when we're actually doing it, you tell me to stay aside since it's dangerous.

81
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,920
When you said you respected me, were they just shallow words?

82
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,930
I am not insisting for no reason.

83
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,340
There is a place for me in our efforts to save the former king.

84
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,550
I think we can eat this now.

85
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,420
Ho Chi!

86
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,070
Keep digging.

87
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,300
What is this?

88
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,960
You've got a rash.

89
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,460
Is it poison again?

90
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,610
There was no issue with the food tasting.

91
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,550
Hurry and take it away.

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,500
Don't you dare touch.

93
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,720
Call the royal doctor.  Get the royal guards to shut down the royal kitchen.

94
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,400
Arrest everyone who had anything to do with the meal preparation today.

95
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,960
Let go!  Let me go!

97
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,690
Let go!

98
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,080
Let's go.

99
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,330
- Do well with your work. 
 - Yes, sir!

100
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,950
It is not some type of drug.

101
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,430
It appears to be an allergic reaction to a food you're not compatible with.

102
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,990
What food made His Majesty like this?

103
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,240
When I looked at the foods, I noticed there was marinated crab.

104
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,520
Raw crabs can affect some people and

105
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,890
cause rashes and itchiness.

106
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,840
What nonsense are you saying?

107
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,200
You think I've never had marinated crab before?

108
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,530
Raw or cooked, I've never had such reaction from eating crab before.

109
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,570
Are you on the same side as them? Do you wish for me to die, too?

110
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,380
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

111
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,450
Your Majesty, reactions to food can come and go.

112
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,590
It may start to reoccur even after an absence of it.

113
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,660
After you rose to the throne,

114
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,160
since you couldn't get sleep and lost your appetite,

115
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,000
the reaction can happen when one becomes weak.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,310
What kind of remedy is there for reaction to crab?

117
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,850
If the reaction goes away after your treatment, then we will know it's due to the crab.

118
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,990
Tree bark from five different trees

119
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,800
will be boiled for the tonic,

120
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,090
and you will be given acupuncture to regain strength.

121
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Looks like the rash has gone down a bit.

122
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,060
If you drink the tonic and watch the progress,

123
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,710
it might prove that it's from the food and not poison.

124
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,500
There is not a hint of a lie in what you're saying?

125
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,720
I will put my life on the line, Your Majesty.

126
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,940
Advise the royal kitchen to not serve the marinated crabs again.

127
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,860
Yes, Your Highness.

128
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,440
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

129
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,090
After I wore these clothes, my body felt itchy.

130
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,910
They even put poison on my arrow. Wouldn't they do the same to my clothes?

131
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,280
Take this and inspect it to see if the inner layer was coated with something strange.

132
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

133
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,850
What he eats, what he wears, and where he sleeps,

134
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,920
he inspected every spec of dust,

135
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,070
and trusts none of the guards or the court ladies.

136
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,930
According to the doctor, this has to do with his sensitive mind.

137
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,170
Given what he went through the other day,

138
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,660
his unease is understandable, but the severity of it is worrisome.

139
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,200
Won't he get better with time?

140
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,380
The problem is that

141
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,600
every day for His Majesty has become hell.

142
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,580
He thought that if he came into the palace and rose to the throne, everything would be settled.

143
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,370
But, he gets worried about something new every day.

144
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,230
You must hurry and have a wonja (to-be crown prince).

145
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,670
If a son is born,

146
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,950
the king will feel stable.

147
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,230
  If you sit in a spot where you weren't supposed to,

148
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,930
  your whole life will feel uneasy. There will never be a relaxing day.

149
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,270
  At night, you won't be able to sleep.

150
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,480
 You will be suspicious of every spoonful of rice and every drop of soy sauce.

151
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,100
 Silk clothes will cut into you and the royal bedding will feel like a bed of nails.

152
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,390
Your Highness, it is hard for you too, right?

153
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,440
Are you missing the time when you went about with no political power?

154
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,350
I do not like it either.

155
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,250
Rather than smiling in a poor thatched roof house,

156
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,730
I prefer to cry in a luxurious palace.

157
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,550
Even if I'm lonely or in pain,

158
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,700
I like this clothing and the Gyotaejun (Queen's pavilion).

159
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,460
Mother.

160
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,370
Hey.

161
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,410
Hey!

162
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,370
Ho Chi!

163
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,200
Oh la la!

164
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,450
Are you okay?

165
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,900
Looks like we will have to stop and replace the horse.

166
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,890
What are you doing?

167
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,370
Find a horse, then hurry and follow me.

168
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,970
Let us go.

169
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,750
- This was never planned. 
 - How can there be a person like that?

170
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,230
To dismount his subordinate and take the horse.

171
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,660
Captain, let's follow them.

172
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,790
In a situation like this, we have to follow them no matter what.

173
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,850
It will be hard to get ahead of them.

174
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,120
Let's hurry.

175
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,990
Who are you?

176
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,090
You are working hard.

177
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,980
Did you come from the palace?

178
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,520
We came from the queen's palace.

179
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,030
After the queen sent her young son off, she was worried.

180
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,890
So she asked us to bring something for the hard-working guards

181
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,230
to build up your strength.

182
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,710
Would it be alright to receive such a thing?

183
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,910
It's not a bribe, nor is it money.

184
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,230
It's just food you can eat.

185
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,860
Our Hanga (court lady to-be) brought the drinks that the king drinks too.

186
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,580
Do you guys drink?

187
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,580
Wine that the king drinks?

188
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,700
Set up the table, quickly.

189
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,750
We really shouldn't do this.

190
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,030
Ah, really.

191
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,620
Honestly.

192
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,650
Your Majesty.

193
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,350
Your Majesty.

194
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,750
Your Majesty.

195
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,510
Uncle.

196
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,920
I came to get you out of here.

197
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,690
Will you take me

198
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,660
to my mother?

199
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,340
We will take them on, please hurry.

200
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,940
We will take His Majesty. Make way!

201
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,820
- No way. 
 - What group do you belong to?

202
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,950
Let go of His Majesty!

203
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,690
Grand Prince Eun Seong?

204
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,830
Shut up!

205
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,940
I will take the one running away.

206
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,720
You people!

207
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,470
They arrived here too quickly.

208
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,300
They didn't get snared in the trap.

209
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,150
They were pushing very hard to get here.

210
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,200
Then, what do we do now?

211
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,610
Please go to the capital.

212
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,950
What are you going to do?

213
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,660
I will lure them to another direction.

214
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,680
Once we take care of them we will follow you on the horses.

215
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,430
Stop!

216
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,810
I found it suspicious that you kept delaying our journey.

217
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,140
You were a part of the traitors.

218
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,570
You must have taken them out of Gyodong Island too.

219
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,980
You're the real traitors.

220
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,010
Today this will turn into your grave.

221
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,930
Go, Grand Prince!

222
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,070
Gi Teuk!

223
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,990
Get on and leave first.

224
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,100
Let's go.

225
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,170
From here on, you should take care of His Majesty and go by yourself.

226
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,200
What are you saying?

227
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,950
You must get out of this area, Your Highness.

228
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,310
So, hurry and get on.

229
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,160
Until now, I've had a job to do.

230
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,680
But from here on, I will only be a hindrance to you.

231
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,900
What are you talking about?

232
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,490
Put simply, three people cannot be on one horse.

233
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,570
You will get caught by those riding the horses on their own.

234
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,990
I cannot leave her behind.

235
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,640
You're not leaving me behind. You are taking care of His Majesty.

236
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,000
Eunuch Park and I will find the others and follow you immediately.

237
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,340
Why are you being so difficult?

238
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,030
Please go. I am not a weak woman you need to protect.

239
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,310
I am your companion who fights alongside you.

240
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,690
Trust me, please.  We have the general, Eunuch Park, and the others.

241
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,990
Don't worry about me and please get out of here quickly.

242
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,620
Uncle.

243
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,730
We'll meet in the capital.

244
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,090
I'll trust you with the lady.

245
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,380
- Lady. 
 - Do not follow me. I'm taking the wench.

246
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,650
Stay where you are! Don't get close!

247
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,750
 If the enemy holds you like this, use the elbow.

248
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,840
Hey!

249
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,550
Bastard.

250
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,500
This way!

251
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,500
Bastards, honestly.

252
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,750
Thanks to you, we lived.

253
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,720
- Are you alright?
 - Yes, what about Hwi?

254
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,060
He took the His Majesty and left.

255
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,490
We've lost him.

256
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,820
I will take care of him.  Please get to the capital now.

257
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,130
- I'll trust you with the lady. 
 - Do not worry.

258
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,480
Let's get going.

259
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,770
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

260
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,990
Thank you for making the difficult decision.

261
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,630
It's a long and arduous trip to Ming China.

262
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,920
If I go there safely,

263
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,300
there is a request I must make to you, Your Majesty.

264
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,870
Tell me.

265
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,620
I would like my daughter, who is at the Jeongubwon

266
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,510
to be returned.

267
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,390
If you do the country an honor,

268
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,950
you can take whatever reward you want.

269
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,560
When I get an opportunity, I will request it from Queen Mother.

270
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,450
Thank you for your grace.

271
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,810
You could have greater fortune visiting upon your household.

272
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,300
- Chief Scholar became the king's envoy? 
- Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,140
Is there no one else?

274
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:39,980
He was a traitor and the father of Ja Hyeon, who caused turmoil in the king's life.

275
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,000
There is no one as qualified as him to take care of the important document.

276
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,280
No one who's willing to take on the hard work either.

277
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,580
If his power becomes stronger,

278
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,270
would he leave his daughter at Jeongubwon?

279
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,740
He should have had her commit suicide for the sake of the family.

280
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,060
Please pay a visit there.

281
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,570
See if she's quietly praying to the Buddha with her head shaved,

282
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,000
or what nonsense she's thinking of in her head.

283
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,260
I think it's time I heard about it.

284
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,220
Understood, Your Highness.

285
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,430
It's tasty!

286
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,040
How do you know about this type of berry, Uncle?

287
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,810
There was a time when I had to live only off of these berries.

288
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,970
Why did you have to eat only these?

289
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,480
You should have eaten rice and meat as well.

290
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,230
When you get older, you must remember, Your Majesty.

291
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,420
In this world,

292
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,500
there are people who must pick berries from the mountains because they have no rice or meat.

293
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,080
A king must take care of those people first.

294
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,110
A flea can't run very far.  I was expecting to see you here.

295
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,090
- You traitor. 
 - You people are the real traitors.

296
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,150
Rebels who betrayed the king and his people.

297
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,100
The former king was not at the place of his exile.

298
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,430
Isn't this the security I attached to you?

299
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,820
He was a spy for the enemy.

300
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,760
When I was chasing after the people who took the former king,

301
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,870
he blocked my way.

302
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,940
He was killed so I brought him here.

303
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,620
It looks like you will have to drag out

304
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,670
those among your servants who are communicating with the enemy.

305
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,500
Your Highness!

306
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,390
- Your Highness!
 - Your Highness!

307
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,330
Are you all okay?

308
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,920
Are you hurt? Did you get stabbed?

309
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,940
It's not my blood.

310
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,890
Did you go close enough to get their blood on you?!

311
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:19,170
I'm safe. I'm not hurt anywhere, so don't worry.

312
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,570
We're the ones who fought them off, and we're the ones who got hurt.

313
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,510
They slashed my arm.

314
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,870
My arm hurts so badly too.

315
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,480
I can't see. I can't see!

316
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,490
Why you! I ought to just...

317
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,010
Oh, I can see!

318
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:48,140
I can see. I can see.

319
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,980
I can see.

320
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,580
I think I can understand how Roo Si Gae feels.

321
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,970
Roo Si Gae?

322
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,420
It can't be compared to being together for three years,

323
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,400
but now that I've gone through life and death situations and joy and sorrow with you,

324
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,270
I feel closer to you.

325
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,360
And it feels as if we are inside each other's hearts.

326
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,990
No thanks.

327
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,280
I don't want to go through this suffering of the heart again.

328
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,000
Next time, stay behind quietly.

329
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,240
If you follow me one more time, my heart will not survive.

330
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:13,650
Will we able to protect him well?

331
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,730
 - Protect them.
 - Your Majesty.

332
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,060
 You have to protect our family.

333
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,110
 Don't let anyone die.

334
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,910
 You have to save our bloodline.

335
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,850
He asked me not to let anyone die.

336
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,490
I...

337
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,530
In order to carry out my brother's will,

338
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,790
I have made myself into someone who is

339
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,790
no longer in this world.

340
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,970
Everyone thinks I'm dead, don't they?

341
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,220
The day you go out into the world again

342
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,460
will be a day of victory when you show them

343
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,970
that truth and justice have won.

344
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:21,160
But even if that day comes, I'll be in pain.

345
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,050
Because the one who has to be punished

346
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,620
is none other than... my brother.

347
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,610
Because we are now destined to fight within the family

348
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,830
pointing swords at our own blood relations.

349
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,640
That has now become our destiny.

350
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,590
Ow, it hurts!  It really does.

351
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,950
Such a crying baby for a big guy.

352
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,960
We found the wrong hiding place,  I'm telling you.

353
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,690
If you want to recover your strength after a fight, you have to eat some meat

354
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,430
and other stuff of nutritional value.

355
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,210
But we settled down in a temple where we can only eat greens day and night.

356
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:41,550
No matter how we try, how can our bodies recover at this rate?

357
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,330
Shall we go hunting outside?

358
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,490
We can grill and eat the game outside the temple.

359
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,240
Don't you know that Grand Prince Jin Yang did the same thing and got blasted by the chief priest?

360
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,530
That's why I said let's eat the game outside the temple.

361
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,340
Didn't you say it hurt?

362
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,820
♫   If I just keep walking like this endlessly   ♫

363
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,050
♫   It feels like I'll be able to see you   ♫

364
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:29,070
♫   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   ♫

365
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:35,080
♫   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   ♫

366
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:45,480
♫   The weaning and filling up,   ♫

367
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,470
♫   how much more do I have to watch it to know?   ♫

368
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,530
♫   I don’t think I can do it anymore   ♫

369
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,050
♫   no matter what I blame   ♫

370
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:06,230
♫   But wherever I look, it’s only painful roads for me   ♫

371
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:14,110
♫   I just wanna follow this path to a place no one knows  ♫

372
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:21,140
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

373
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,050
 From: Mai Jin Myeong, Governor of Gangwon Province, Senior 2nd Rank Officialdom. Date: May 10, 1453. Notification of offense: The rebels committed a tyrannical crime and together with unknown men, took off with the former king.

374
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,230
 Two guards from Yeongwol County Bureau died by arrows shot by three unknown men who took off with our former king. Our guards have searched everywhere but in vain. They have sneaked into the county and are hiding within it.

375
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,140
You couldn't capture that child?

376
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,770
No, Your Majesty.

377
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,900
Rebels entered the place of exile and

378
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,000
fought off the guards and took the former king away.

379
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,810
What did I tell you?

380
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,820
Didn't I say they're the same people?

381
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,020
I am issuing an order to Chief Investigator.

382
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,450
Investigate everyone in the court no matter whom.

383
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,200
Find out who's leading the rebels.

384
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,700
And make sure you find the lost child.

385
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,530
I will obey, Your Majesty.

386
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,510
But if you fail again, be ready to leave your public post.

387
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:30,170
I will definitely catch the rebels and bring you peace of the mind.

388
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,580
 From: Governor of Hamgyeong Province, Hong Chun Pil. Date: April 29, 1453. Chieftain Li Man Zhu of Jurchen's Huligai Tribe seeks permission from Your Majesty to allow him to send an entourage to attend your ascension ceremony.

389
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,630
It's a letter from the Governor of Hamgyeong Province. 
  In the past, with regrets, please forgive your subject for such invitational oversight. The Jurchens will bear substantial congratulatory gifts. Please advise a time for dispatch.

390
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:56,250
The Jurchens want to send an entourage to congratulate you on your ascension to the throne.

391
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,520
They want to see me.

392
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,160
Send the Hayangtongsa (regional representative).

393
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,560
They want to congratulate me, so I should accept it.

394
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,520
Queen Mother, let me leave the palace.

395
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,280
I don't know where in the country my Myeong is wandering now.

396
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,370
I don't know if he is alive and safe.

397
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,000
I have to find him myself.

398
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:53,120
This might be the beginning of hope.

399
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,590
But Myeong has disappeared!

400
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,930
Who would know which bastards took him away?

401
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,710
If they intended to harm him,

402
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,290
they would've done it then and there.

403
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,180
The reason why they took him away from the house of exile

404
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,520
is probably because they wanted to save him.

405
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,790
I will find out who's behind this

406
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:20,990
by talking to Chief Royal Secretary.

407
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,920
How did you manage to live, Queen Mother?

408
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,780
My blood is running dry like this because I don't know if my son is dead or alive.

409
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,860
You lost His Majesty, and then you had to send away Grand Prince Eun Seong.

410
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,510
How did you bear it?

411
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,850
I'd already been dead

412
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,260
as a mother.

413
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,580
To make my only remaining son, Kang

414
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,910
not bother the former king any longer,

415
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,300
that's my remaining duty to the royal household.

416
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,070
Because of that, I can't die.

417
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,460
So I live.

418
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,150
But, who would've tried to kill my brother?

419
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,400
All the servants who could go against Grand Prince Jin Yang have been killed.

420
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,970
People think you've died, as well, Your Highness.

421
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,050
We never made a move,

422
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,200
but there is another group who is trying to kill Grand Prince Jin Yang.

423
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,490
That can only mean an opposition is brewing in the royal court.

424
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,670
We can think of it backward.

425
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,680
To make you, Your Highness, a traitor,

426
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,150
he turned our wedding into a bloodbath and harmed himself.

427
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,930
Then, this time, too...

428
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,350
They were close enough to get their hands on Grand Prince Jin Yang's bow and arrow.

429
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,430
Why wouldn't they have poisoned his food right away?

430
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,630
Only his skin was affected but his life was not in danger.

431
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,080
Who would have benefitted from that situation?

432
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,930
As a result, the former king was dethroned

433
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,020
and sent away in exile.

434
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,760
After that, Grand Prince Yang Ahn ordered us to assassinate him, as though he was expecting it.

435
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,170
Right. Grand Prince Yang Ahn.

436
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,870
He was the one who dragged you to the north and entrapped you.

437
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,680
Did Hyungnim order it or was he acting independently?

438
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,280
What makes me believe that Grand Prince Jin Yang did not order it himself

439
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,500
is that the horror he was experiencing from it seemed real.

440
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,720
All the people around Grand Prince Jin Yang are not safe.

441
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,090
They are all paranoid thinking someone's after their lives.

442
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:01,270
Then... let's attack my uncle.

443
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,770
I heard this from my mother once.

444
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,360
The reason why my eldest brother did not have an heir for a long time was due to someone's scheme.

445
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,170
My brother's queen and concubines endured problems each time any of them were pregnant.

446
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,360
So the former queen was sent to her home during her pregnancy.

447
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,210
How should we attack Grand Prince Yang Ahn?

448
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:28,000
We have to let Hyungnim know that Grand Prince Yang Ahn is the culprit.

449
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,380
Court Lady Hong who's been his spy from the time he was at the private house,

450
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,600
the royal doctor and the nurses who were able to be near him,

451
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,460
and all officers and ministers who are close to Uncle.

452
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,360
We should be able to find evidence by looking into them.

453
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,130
If Grand Prince Yang Ahn is the culprit,

454
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,790
how would Grand Prince Jin Yang react?

455
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,560
He won't stay still about it.

456
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:00,340
This time, the line has been crossed.

457
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,040
Buy sweet toffee.

458
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,660
Buy some rice cakes.

459
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,650
Buy sweet toffee.

460
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,910
I'm from the Royal Investigation Agency.

461
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,640
What's the matter?

462
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,350
There is something I need to investigate.

463
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,870
- Please come. Escort her.
 - Yes.

464
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,120
What are you doing?

465
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,220
Let go of my hand!

466
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,800
Let go!

467
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,890
What is the matter?

468
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,340
Criminals look at the face of the crime.

469
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,790
Here is the witness right here.

470
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,780
Hurry and speak!

471
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,630
If this continues, there won't be anyone left in this palace.

472
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,830
People working at the royal kitchen feel like they are putting their lives on the line with every meal.

473
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:49,540
And now he's going after the infirmary.

474
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:56,030
His Majesty at least listens to what you have to say.

475
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,340
Please, stop him!

476
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,610
Why is it that if I wear your clothes, my body itches and hurts?

477
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:18,200
I used the exact same material as the ones used

478
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,900
for previous royal robes, Your Majesty.

479
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,590
Then, is it you people? Did you put something on the clothes that were brought over?

480
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,200
No, Your Majesty. This is an unjust accusation.

481
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,010
- This is an unjust accusation, Your Majesty. 
 - We do not know about it.

482
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,440
Your Majesty, the reason why you have hives

483
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,340
is because you have not been eating properly from stress,

484
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,920
and you are malnourished. That is why.

485
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,340
If you eat properly and take the tonic regularly,

486
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,340
you will be able to recover from it naturally.

487
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,100
Try it on.

488
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,460
Prove that my robes are safe, just as the doctor said!

489
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,280
Y-Your Majesty.

490
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
Wearing your robe is a treasonous act!

491
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,140
So? You won't wear it.

492
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,370
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Yang Ahn and Chief Royal Secretary are here.

493
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,250
Bring them in.

494
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,250
Let them hear the confessions of the traitors with me.

495
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,870
Your Majesty.

496
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:31,530
Welcome, Uncle.  We had another attempt on my life today.

497
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,340
Now, they have put poison on my robes to kill me!

498
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,760
Everyone, leave.

499
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,120
Uncle, we have to get their confessions.

500
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,580
- Leave, I said. 
 - Everyone, leave.

501
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,200
Hurry!

502
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,970
- What's going on?
 - We've found the culprit that caused his Majesty's illness.

503
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,950
Who is it?

504
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,730
Why are you doing this, Uncle?

505
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,600
Your Majesty.

506
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,320
Right now, you are suspicious of a traitor that does not exist.

507
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,000
A traitor that does not exist?

508
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,960
Did you not see it yourself?

509
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,170
You saw those countless attempts on my life.

510
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:48,100
You are suffering from a mental illness.

511
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,200
I am responsible for having caused it at the beginning.

512
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,270
What are you saying?

513
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,570
Get yourself out of here, Secretary!

514
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,640
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Yang Ahn is the traitor.

515
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,470
A royal guard and the doctor confessed.

516
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,390
The guard contaminated the arrow,

517
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,180
and the doctor falsely claimed that it was poisonous.

518
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,580
Then, that wasn't poison?

519
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,560
Your face was affected because of poison,

520
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,360
but it was not put on to harm you.

521
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,160
- If not—
 - I needed an excuse to

522
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,350
depose the former king.

523
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,000
To bring down the innocent former king,

524
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,690
you risked harming the king's body?

525
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,600
Misguided loyalty can be treason, Your Majesty.

526
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,750
I will take Grand Prince Yang Ahn to the investigation agency.

527
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,350
Why did you do it?

528
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,460
It was for you, Your Majesty.

529
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:14,010
Do I still look like a child who shakes in fear

530
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,220
and cries over the death of a young maid?

531
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,180
The reason why I got rid of the former king

532
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,190
was to cement your position on the throne,

533
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:25,080
and to secure your position in the royal line.

534
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,330
I could've done it!

535
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,910
To have wise servants and to bestow grace upon the people,

536
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:39,170
so as to bring a prosperous, long future to this country.  I could have done that.

537
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:46,180
Uncle, do you not believe in me, either?

538
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,100
Just like my mother who doubted me endlessly.

539
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,700
What is the difference?

540
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,530
I wanted to make your path easier.

541
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:02,820
Uncle, you have made me into a puppet.

542
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:48,790
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

543
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:53,230
♫   In a life together  ♫

544
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,110
What happened today did not happen.

545
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,840
Your Majesty, even though it is not poison,

546
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,020
to do something like this is a treason.

547
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,260
If the news of this event goes out in any way,

548
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,520
I will behead everyone who is here.

549
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:14,630
But, Uncle, you will be relieved of your position as prime minister

550
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:17,770
and go back to being a grand prince.

551
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,230
- Your Majesty. 
 - Do you understand?

552
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:27,150
You are now unable to go out into the world.

553
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,300
Until the day you die, inside your room, your house,

554
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,120
you will live,

555
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,200
longing for the monster you made.

556
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:14,610
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

557
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:23,990
Chief of Royal Guards will take him.

558
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,130
Be careful of Do Jung Gook.

559
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:08,210
I sent him to take care of things and he had our guys killed.

560
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,830
And put a wedge between me and the king.

561
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:17,490
- Are you sure?
 - I have no proof but doesn't the result speaks for itself?

562
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,000
Is anything suspicious going on at the chief scholar's house?

563
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,640
There is a temple her maid goes to often.

564
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,720
She doesn't escort a superior or anything,

565
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,910
but she suspiciously carries bags of things back and forth.

566
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,280
Where is that temple?

567
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,460
This way.

568
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,450
Thank you all for coming such a long way to see me.

569
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,220
Our chief wanted to congratulate you as soon as possible,

570
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,650
so we hurriedly made our way here.

571
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,870
Along with the famous horses and leather we've brought from our land,

572
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:15,330
and special gifts of silk, we give you our greeting.

573
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,010
You are good at speaking our language.

574
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,470
I will not need a translator.

575
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,550
We have to live together.

576
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:26,410
There are many people on our land who speak Joseon's language.

577
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,130
We will prepare you gifts as well.  Please take them to your leader and make him happy.

578
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,780
There is something else our leader is waiting for.

579
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:41,090
We would like you to fulfill the promise you made before you ascended to the throne.

580
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,340
And fulfill the protocol as a tertiary state to our tribe.

581
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,350
That will ensure the long-lasting friendship between us.

582
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,710
This is what our leader is waiting for.

583
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,810
Keep my promise?

584
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,250
Did you come to threaten the king of Joseon?

585
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,840
What do you mean threat?

586
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,290
We are merely asking you to keep your promise.

587
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:17,230
One can have a different feeling going than coming back,

588
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:23,350
but when was it when you rose to the throne with our help?

589
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,210
Are you pretending to not remember now?

590
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:52,850

591
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,970
What in the world are you doing?

592
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,740
What is this?

593
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,210
Deliver this message to your tribal leader.

594
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:13,360
Since he dared to keep one of our princes a hostage for three years,

595
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,570
it makes sense to punish them,

596
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:18,620
but we have not taken revenge because

597
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,670
a child king was at the helm.

598
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,170
Now that I'm on the throne,

599
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:29,440
I am prepared to show our strength.

600
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,000
So if he doesn't keep to etiquette, I, along with a large army, will pay him a visit and demolish you.

601
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,910
You cannot, Madame. The lady is in hiding right now.

602
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,810
If the whole family visits her like this, she will be found out.

603
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:58,040
Nothing's happened even though you've been coming and going all this time.

604
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,640
I will pretend to be praying to the mother earth and see my daughter's face.

605
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,520
She's fine. She must feel very compatible with the place.

606
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,090
Her face has gotten round and plump.

607
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,130
Let's go.

608
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,440
Young Master.

609
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,490
Don't worry.  I will be escorting you so nothing will happen.

610
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,740
It's been some time since the person keeping an eye on our household disappeared.

611
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,510
If something happens on our way there, I'll take care of it.

612
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,650
But... Ow!

613
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,990
Madame! Oh, gosh!

614
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,370
Madame, Madame!

615
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,310
Wait a minute, Madame!

616
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,580
Please wait here for now.

617
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,660
To make sure the lady doesn't get shocked, I'll go in and tell her.

618
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,770
You're sure she's in there, right?

619
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,140
She will be at her living quarters.

620
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,720
Madame! Madame!

621
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:24,660
Wait here.

622
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,220
Hold on. You're caught.

623
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,590
Hold on.

624
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,390
Hey, hey!

625
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,610
Be careful with her. She could get hurt practicing with you.

626
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:43,420
Have you seen an attacker acting like it's just practice?

627
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,940
That's that, but...

628
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,300
I'm fine, Your Highness.

629
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,550
Ja Hyeon.

630
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,980
Mother.

631
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:53,990
