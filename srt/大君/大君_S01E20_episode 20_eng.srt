1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,680
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,060

3
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,990
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,690
Roo Si Gae!

5
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,180
Don't touch her! She is my person!

6
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I understand your obedience but this is not loyalty.

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,420
The king has already been adjudged by history and dethroned.

8
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,790
He's been confined and is awaiting punishment.

9
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,140
Bring the king here if you don't want to see this wench  die.

10
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,990
Put away the sword now!

11
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,550
Release Roo Si Gae!

12
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,080
Bring the king here!

13
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,640
- Attack!  
- Attack!

14
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,430
Roo Si Gae!

15
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,060
Roo Si Gae! Roo Si Gae!

16
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,630
Roo Si Gae!

17
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,830
Roo Si Gae.

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,340
Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae!

19
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,600
Roo Si Gae!

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,610
Gi Teuk.  Gi Teuk!

21
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,800
Send someone to the infirmary and bring a royal doctor!

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,570
Hurry!

23
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,820
The wound is too deep.  It will be impossible to recover from it.

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,600
She has lost too much blood.

25
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,410
Treat her! Save her life!

26
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,150
Make the blood hemorrhaging stop and heal the wound.

27
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,070
This girl Roo Si Gae is really tough.

28
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,260
She is not a person. She is more like a beast.

29
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm telling you she is stronger than an ordinary person.

30
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,050
She will live. You can save her!

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,330
Are you coming to your senses?

32
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
Are you alright? Does it hurt a lot?

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,800
I told you to not get hurt.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,610
I even made you a protective shield to wear.

35
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,410
Don't try to talk. Save your energy.

36
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,720
Beautiful "Hwi."

37
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,320
Your Highness, it's your name.

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,510
You have learned to write.

39
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,140
My name.

40
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,630
You know how to write it.

41
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,800
Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae! Wake up.

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,300
Roo Si Gae!

43
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,500
No! Roo Si Gae! Don't go!

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,350
Roo Si Gae!

45
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,690
Roo Si Gae!

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,720
Roo Si Gae! Don't leave us.

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,150
Roo Si Gae. Don't go.

48
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,280
Roo Si Gae.

49
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,150
Roo Si Gae.

50
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,460
Hey you, wake up.  Wake up.

51
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,870
Roo Si Gae!

52
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,370
There is so little

53
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,060
I've done for her.

54
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,920
She has saved me countless times.

55
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,210
Following me for three years, all she did was suffer.

56
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,580
Now that good times lie before us,

57
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,390
I wanted to repay her for her kindness.

58
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,650
Instead of scorched rice,

59
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,010
I wanted to serve her proper food,

60
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,650
to dress her in fine clothes

61
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,100
and silk shoes.

62
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,180
I was going to make her a norigae (female ornament)

63
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,190
to wear around.

64
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,030
But it was only suffering

65
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,750
we shared with her.

66
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,910
My heart bleeds for her.

67
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,810
She lived looking only at you.

68
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,570
She's done nothing but give to us.

69
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,920
Fool.

70
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,700
Mother.

71
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,800
You've grown a lot since I last saw you.

72
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,090
You've grown taller and bigger.

73
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:47,290
Aunt and Uncle have treated me well.

74
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,640
Did you say your aunt?

75
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,570
Yes, pretty Aunt.

76
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,420
You think we can get into the palace?

77
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,670
On the North Gate side, there is a wall we can climb.

78
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,120
It's a secret path the king used to go in and out.

79
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,810
After we get into the palace?

80
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,300
We have to bring the king out.

81
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,910
As long as the king is alive, we can mobilize the troops.

82
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,190
What about the queen?

83
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,740
Once we enter the palace, we will travel in two groups.

84
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,150
I will escort the king and you will look after the queen.

85
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,890
Your Excellency.

86
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,570
Court Lady Hong.

87
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,930
I waited for you here because I thought you would come this way.

88
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,020
What's happened to the king?

89
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,210
He's being held at the Secret Pavilion.

90
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,840
The queen's being confined at Gyotaejeon (queen's quarters).

91
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,680
It appears as though he will be punished when the sun comes up.

92
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,840
Let's get back here once we secure our king and queen.

93
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,880
Who are you?

94
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,360
We are the next shift.

95
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,460
But it hasn't been long since the last change—

96
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,510
Intruders!

97
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,050
My apologies for being late.

98
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,740
- We will accompany you.
 - Where to?

99
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,330
Once we get out of the palace, I will arrange for a place to stay.

100
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,980
There are vacant houses owned by the officers.

101
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,380
Are you telling me to live in hiding?

102
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,430
Minister of Right  has died and Chief Royal Secretary has betrayed us.

103
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,230
Chief Scholar has completed your mission but there is a high chance he will side with them.

104
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,040
There is no one on my side. Is that what you are telling me?

105
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,770
Your Majesty, please plan for the future.

106
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,070
For now, you have to survive.

107
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,480
So now I have to be worried about my life?

108
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,690
Where did Court Lady Hong go?

109
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,340
Shouldn't someone tell us what's going on outside?

110
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,080
Please calm yourself, Your Highness.

111
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,720
Brother!

112
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,650
Court Lady Hong!  Her Highness, please, hurry!

113
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,140
Yes. Your Highness.

114
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,290
Brother! Brother!

115
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,240
It's the queen. Arrest her!

116
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
Brother!

117
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,150
- Brother! 
 - Your Highness.

118
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,070
Search for her everywhere.

119
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,590
Yes, sir.

120
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,680
Your Majesty. Your Majesty?

121
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,810
If I leave the palace now, will I be able to return?

122
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,030
Eun Seong and Prince Seung Pyeong aimed at my royal procession

123
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,190
because it was difficult for them to come into the palace.

124
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
I cannot leave.

125
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,820
Your Majesty!

126
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,420
Even if I die, I will stay in the palace to see the final outcome.

127
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,590
As long as Eun Seong is gone, all will be well. If only Eun Seong is gone,

128
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,300
that child and Queen Mother cannot fight me.

129
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,350
But, the Commander  of the Five Guards took control of the military.

130
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,850
Chief of the Palace Guards is with him too. We cannot trust anyone.

131
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,860
I don't trust anyone anyway.

132
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,740
Your Majesty!

133
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,800
Your Majesty, my brother... my brother!

134
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,860
Minister of Defense was killed by Commander Do.

135
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,160
Your Majesty, you need to leave now. The palace is too dangerous.

136
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,270
- Court Lady Hong is to escort the queen. 
 - Your Majesty.

137
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,890
Please go ahead first.  I will avenge your brother.

138
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,200
I don't want you to be in danger as well.  You have to protect your royal body.

139
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,850
Our numbers are too small.

140
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,500
It grieves me to tell you we do not have enough to go against the rebels.

141
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,190
This is a rebellion, not a war.  Once we get Eun Seong,

142
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,050
we'll have things under control.

143
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,740
I am staying with you.

144
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,870
I can't leave you behind, Your Majesty.

145
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,880
You're pregnant.  Please think of the baby in your womb.

146
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,270
Court Lady Hong.

147
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,300
If you are not there, what will become of the child?

148
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,980
You need to be there so that there will be meaning in tomorrow.

149
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,040
I know you must have been upset with me about a lot of things.

150
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,460
I will pay you back one by one.

151
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,910
When I avowed loyalty to you when we were living outside,

152
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,600
it was out of

153
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,260
my desperate attempt to win your heart, Your Majesty.

154
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,560
Since you've had another woman in your heart,

155
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,060
by promising to be your servant,

156
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,220
I wanted to convey my truth.

157
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,950
It was not to share the power with my husband.

158
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,880
It was not based on such greed.

159
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,980
I simply wanted to be

160
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,580
Your Majesty's woman.

161
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,790
Your support and your passion

162
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,020
have always made me feel strong.

163
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,030
I've been grateful.

164
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,840
Until we meet again,

165
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,330
take care of yourself.

166
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,180
Your Majesty.

167
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,180
I will wait at the main hall.  Bring Eun Seong to me.

168
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,340
If you tell him it's my request, he won't reject it.

169
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,430
He is that kind of a boy.

170
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,300
Escort the king.

171
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,960
Yes, sir.

172
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,600
Your Highness, you need to hurry and distance yourself from the palace.

173
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,110
Is it okay to leave the king like this?

174
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,990
He is a man of firm resolve.  You know that.

175
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,460
Once he makes up his mind, he doesn't change it.

176
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,600
Whether I shouldn't be staying with him,

177
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,980
should we be making him this lonely?

178
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,860
Think of the future, Your Highness.

179
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,520
There is a saying, "Even if the sky falls, there is always a room to get out of."

180
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,640
Let us go please, Your Highness. Hurry.

181
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:24,550
Your Highness, we got Minister of Defense but lost the queen.

182
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,280
If the minister came in, Chief of the Palace Guards would be in as well.

183
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,630
What happened to Hyungnim?

184
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,910
He's waiting for you at the main hall.

185
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,730
Did he escape the Secret Pavilion?

186
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,920
It's my job to keep the king alive.

187
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,390
I tried to take him outside of the palace but he wishes to see you.

188
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,860
Don't go. Who knows what sort of trap awaits you?

189
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,820
He's looking at his last moment.

190
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,600
I can't let him go like this. He has to live

191
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,820
so that he can pay for his deeds.

192
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,650
I will bring Queen Mother there.

193
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,830
You two will have to persuade Grand Prince JIn Yang.

194
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,500
You don't want to kill your brother who is your own blood.

195
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,620
- Escort her. 
 - Yes.

196
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,730
Jin Yang escaped the Secret Pavilion?

197
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,510
He wants to see Grand Prince Eun Seong alone.

198
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,300
I was going to tell him to

199
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,930
relinquish the throne and live quietly outside of the palace,

200
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,660
but my son insists on seeing blood.

201
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,930
Your Highness.

202
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,880
If you want to save both of your sons, please show your affection.

203
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,330
Grand Prince Jin Yang is standing on the edge of a precipice.

204
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,520
If you are harsh with him, no one knows how he would react.

205
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,010
To my child who did wrong,

206
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,620
I thought a scolding would suffice.

207
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,800
That I still love him,

208
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,650
I should have told him.

209
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,790
Regret is piercing my heart.

210
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,800
It's not too late.

211
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,250
You still have a chance, Your Highness.

212
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,010
Let us go.

213
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,440
Open the way.  I will see my hyungnim.

214
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,500
Your Highness.

215
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,210
Go.

216
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:43,950

217
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,500
Please come down.

218
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,600
That is no longer your seat, Hyungnim.

219
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,950
It was never yours to begin with.

220
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,300
If it wasn't for you

221
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,220
tomorrow I would open the morning assembly

222
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,700
with the officials right here.

223
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,650
Now it is all over.

224
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:39,510
You cannot reclaim the throne, or overturn the rebellion.

225
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,270
You think this is because of me?

226
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:46,830
Or because you have a nephew who can carry on the throne

227
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,810
and a mother who doesn't acknowledge you?  Not so.

228
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,480
You don't have the support of the people.

229
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,300
If I only had time.

230
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,430
If I had time to rule the nation properly and change their view,

231
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,280
I could make the country strong and give them wealth and hope.

232
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,440
I could have been a good king who gives them long-lasting prosperity.

233
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,490
People are not stupid.

234
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,140
The people who brought you down

235
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,700
and put their lives on the line to put the king back on the throne,

236
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,530
they didn't do it to eat well and live well,

237
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,320
nor to secure a place for themselves after the rebellion is over.

238
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,020
They knew they could die

239
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,580
and knew this could be their last chance, but still did it.

240
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,850
They didn't get much from the nation but at a time of need,

241
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,830
they are the people who would put their lives on the line.

242
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,890
It is that support that never rested on you.

243
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,940
You never had an honorable way to be on the throne.

244
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,060
Once you became the king by unnatural force,

245
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,970
you could not protect the throne.

246
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,040
Even I

247
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,270
know now.

248
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,310
That's why

249
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,620
I couldn't gain love either.

250
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,920
I wanted to steal her because she was your woman.

251
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,780
But this time, I wouldn't let her die like Yeon Hee.

252
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,670
I was going to steal her from you

253
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,280
and have her heart to come to me.

254
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,850
I thought that would be proof

255
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,590
that I am a man who is worthy of such love.

256
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,610
You already have your wife.

257
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,710
It was with that feeling I married,

258
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,690
and even afterward I didn't give up.

259
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,370
Once I became king, I thought

260
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,930
all of that would become mine.

261
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,980
That everything I wanted would become reality.

262
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,660
That's what I believed.

263
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,290
Please come back now

264
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,780
as a member of our family.

265
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,070
As my brother,

266
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,170
even dethroned,

267
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,520
adjudged and punished.

268
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,310
Once your exile is over, you can live.

269
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,010
Even though not a king,

270
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,690
our family will stay beside you.

271
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,940
- Let's do that in our next life. 
- Hyungnim.

272
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,840
No, in our next life

273
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,960
I probably should not make these choices to start with.

274
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,390
Kill me.

275
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,780
Living in hell does not suit me.

276
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,060
Rather than a long pitiful life,

277
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,670
I will pay back with my life.

278
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,050
You will

279
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,420
not think of the family to the end.

280
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,580
Do you want to do that to Mother?

281
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,970
Can't you do it?

282
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,510
A long and pitiful life in hell

283
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,010
is the punishment you must accept.

284
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,050
Please accept it.

285
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,860
Right. That's the kind of brother you are.

286
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,210
A proper grand prince.

287
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,480
Nice and pure man.

288
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,260
But you know already,

289
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,770
I'm the evilest man under the sky who tried to kill his brother many times.

290
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,240
Don't do this! I said don't do it!

291
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,790
Do I have to kill my own brother?

292
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,110
If not, you die!

293
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,870
Why on earth?

294
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,080
Why? Why? WHY?

295
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,770
If he got into a fight with you,

296
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,290
since you couldn't do it

297
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,390
he asked me to slay him.

298
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,420
He came

299
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,140
prepared to

300
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,150
die.

301
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:07,060
♫  Believing and believing  ♫

302
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,850
 You need to finish my last place.

303
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,410
 Your Majesty.

304
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,480
 Eun Seong won't be able to do it.

305
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,870
 How can you give me such an order?

306
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,560
 When I think of it,

307
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,800
 you are the only one who is my person.

308
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,790
 Your Majesty.

309
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,620
 I don't want to die by any other man's blade.

310
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,610
 You do it, please.

311
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,180
 I can't, Your Majesty.

312
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,210
 Your Majesty.

313
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,860
Your Majesty.

314
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,920
Kang!

315
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,710
Kang! My son.

316
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,620
My Kang.

317
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:40,490
Mother...

318
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,530
I am sorry.

319
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,390
♫  In a life together  ♫

320
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,460

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,750
Don't cry.

324
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,880
My younger brother.

325
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,170
Hyungnim.

326
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,870
The people

327

I love

00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,550
are all here.

Don't you cry, either.

330
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,300
No one is to cry.

331
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,830
Not for me.

332
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,810
Hyungnim.

333
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,460
Now that I have let go of everything,

334
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,990
I feel free

335
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,780
and comfortable.

336
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Kang!

337
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,030
- Kang! 
- Hyungnim.

338
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,220
Kang!

339
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,670
Hyungnim!

340
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,180
Kang! Kang!

341
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,070
In your next life

342
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,260
live receiving lots of love.

343
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,270
Since we are not allowed to keep a dead person in the palace,

344
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:32,020
I will move Roo Si Gae to our house and make preparations.

345
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,230
Thank you.

346
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,010
I can't even hold a funeral for her because I'm the grand prince.

347
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,910
Why do you say thank you?

348
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,940
She was like family to me.

349
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,240
Your Highness.

350
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
What's so great about being the king

351
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,470
that my brother was ready to rip out the hearts of his own family

352
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,170
to keep it?

353
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,290
He was difficult to understand.

354
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,880
He always watched me with sad eyes.

355
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,460
I wondered why he looked as if he was crying inside

356
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,530
when he is clearly a bad person.

357
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,660
For some reason, he made me feel like I did something wrong.

358
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,820
Don't blame yourself.

359
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,410
It's not your fault.

360
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,670
Being born into the royal family

361
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,930
was not a blessing but a tragedy.

362
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,250
You live too close to the highest seat of power

363
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,650
so you're very vulnerable to its temptations.

364
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,670
His hunger for power grew till it overshadowed his family

365
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,310
and created this bloodbath.

366
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,130
His Majesty passed away?

367
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,230
He told me let's meet again.

368
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:47,350
He told me to be careful till we meet again.

369
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,100
That's what he told me.

370
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,050
It seems he was already prepared to meet his end

371
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,790
when he decided to stay in the palace.

372
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:02,620
He made his last request to Eo Eul Woon.

373
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,820
What do you want me to do? What about me?

374
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,970
How come you never spared a thought for me

375
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,660
till the very end?

376
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,100
I trusted you and dedicated myself to your great cause.

377
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,820
So you should take responsibility!

378
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,990
I'd rather you said let's die together.

379
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,550
Your Highness, we have to flee.

380
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,380
They're going to find this place soon.

381
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,040
Go where?

382
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,410
Is there even a place in this land where I can stay?

383
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,700
Think about your child.

384
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,810
If you give birth to a son, it's almost certain

385
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,740
they'll kill him.

386
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,920
Look what happened to Prince Seung Pyeong. His Majesty tried so hard to kill him

387
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,410
because he was a threat to his power.

388
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,210
His Majesty's heir will be a seed of dispute.

389
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,310
If it's a girl, she'll be made a lowly maidservant.

390
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,840
You have to live even though His Majesty is gone.

391
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,360
As a mother, you have to protect your child.

392
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,860
It's good that the throne has been restored and our future is secured, but

393
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,400
this mother who's sinned greatly

394
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,780
has not only seen Grand Prince Eun Seong die and come back twice,

395
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,150
but has had to witness the tragedy of Grand Prince Jin Yang dying in front of my eyes.

396
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,830
I brought it upon myself by trying to

397
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,190
interfere in the nation's affairs as a foolish woman.

398
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:02,740
Until the young king grows into a full adult,

399
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,960
I will relinquish the regency to Grand Prince Eun Seong.

400
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,300
But Your Highness, normally

401
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,230
if the queen or the queen dowager is alive,

402
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,240
no one else takes over the regency.

403
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,250
Even though it may be difficult, it's only lawful that

404
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,800
Your Highness take over the regency.

405
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,690
I've gone through so much recently

406
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,130
and I don't have the strength even to get out of bed.

407
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,810
It'll be more than 10 years before His Majesty comes of age.

408
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,570
Do you think I'll stay alive till then?

409
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,030
Even though he was sent into exile under false accusations,

410
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,410
Grand Prince Eun Seong never gave up and investigated what really happened,

411
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,370
and he risked his life to set the royal lineage right.

412
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,230
There's no one more suitable to the task than him.

413
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,240
Until your nephew grows up,

414
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,270
just like Duke of Zhou did for his young nephew king in China,

415
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,120
please create a beautiful history

416
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,880
that will be remembered in history, as a model.

417
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:12,800
I know what many of you are worried about.

418
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,400
Among you are ones who worried about the young king being restored to the throne

419
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,920
and warned my brother about the rebellion,

420
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,630
as well as those who dreamed of a stronger Joseon

421
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,860
and supported our cause, I know.

422
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,570
However, my brother took all of our burdens with him.

423
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:37,210
Everyone who was Hyungnim's servant, as well as those who supported the rebellion,

424
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:42,650
all of you have different perspectives but acted with the good of the nation in your heart.

425
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,390
Queen Dowager and I wish to forgive your past deeds

426
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:48,940
so that there will be no more sacrifices.

427
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,300
and make a royal court unified under a common cause.

428
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,280
Please help us.

429
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,590
Don't go.

430
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:27,080
I've faced so many deaths and unwanted goodbyes.

431
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,820
How can I endure it if you also leave my side?

432
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,490
I apologize.

433
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,290
Your Highness, when I look at you

434
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:39,100
I can't help but think of Roo Si Gae.

435
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,610
I start to hate myself for not being able to protect her.

436
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,050
Is this how you're going to punish me?

437
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,260
Please forgive me. Right now, my remorse towards Roo Si Gae

438
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,600
is greater than my loyalty to you.

439
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,890
So I cannot serve you well.

440
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,710
It's difficult to see the lady too.

441
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,250
If, with time, I learn to suppress my longing

442
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,840
and my pain grows faint...

443
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:20,320
if I feel I can serve you well again,

444
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,010
then I will return.

445
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,380
Promise me that you will.

446
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,620
Be healthy.

447
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,690
Are you asking me to just come and live in your house?

448
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,750
I don't want another wedding ceremony, and I don't want to live in the palace.

449
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,150
If I wear a wedding dress, I feel I'll be reminded of that day

450
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,990
when so many people died and you were falsely accused.

451
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:08,840
And it'll be depressing to live in the palace quarters because it reminds me of Grand Prince Jin Yang.

452
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,990
It's weird to hold another wedding ceremony when we have already consummated our marriage.

453
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,970
Watch what you say in the broad daylight!

454
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,950
Since I can't live inside the palace, you just come out.

455
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,800
I want to become a filial daughter to my parents who went through so much.

456
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:39,170
If you like being apart from me, then you may as well live alone in the palace.

457
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,840
I worry that living with the in-laws could be uncomfortable for you.

458
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,230
So what if he is uncomfortable?

459
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,140
He has to bear at least that much, considering all the suffering he put our daughter through.

460
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,150
Honey.

461
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,950
What? Did I say anything wrong?

462
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,120
Mother.

463
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:31,130
I will spend my life repaying the debt I owe to you.

464
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,640
I know how much hardship I've brought to you all this time.

465
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,730
We will live treasuring each other under your care.

466
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,700
Please give us a chance to be filial to you.

467
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,940
I will keep my eye on you.

468
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,640
Mother, if you keep acting prickly we could move out on our own.

469
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,190
Who would be short-handed by that?

470
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,120
This is the room we prepared for you.

471
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,700
It's not as large as in the palace, but still, pretty clean?

472
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,180
It's nice, sure, but I don't really care since I won't stay here.

473
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,060
If you are not planning to stay in your room, where will you be?

474
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,860
In your room.

475
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,790
Well, that is... we can visit each other, but

476
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,180
it's proper for a couple to have separate rooms.

477
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,760
How many months have we stayed apart?

478
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,320
From now on, I plan to stay right beside you.

479
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,780
In my life, there will be no separate rooms.

480
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,450
My family will speak ill of us.

481
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:54,110
So? Are we the kind to be afraid of such a thing?

482
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,670
You have the job of regency.

483
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,000
If you are not planning to leave my side, how will you take care of the country?

484
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:07,230
From now on, only make promises you can keep.

485
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,120
When the regency is over, I will leave the court and live in the country.

486
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,850
From then on, I will only live for you.

487
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,410
I'm fine. You are only doing what you have to after all.

488
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:24,010
Even after the regency is over, you don't have to live for me.

489
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,230
Go forward on the path that makes you happy.

490
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,890
I will be beside you.

491
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,440
 10 years later

492
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,490
Ten years is a long time to hold myself back.

493
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,370
Until when do we have to accept the endless and bottomless demands of the Jurchens.

494
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:54,180
Your Majesty,  the reason for the situation with the Jurchens is that, under the brief rule of Grand Prince JIn Yang a long time ago,

495
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:59,630
he entered into an agreement that was highly unfavorable to us,  and we've been trying to

496
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,850
- work through it ever since.
 - So what have we gained from it?

497
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,380
They are the ones who are making big gains in all our dealings.

498
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,650
Instead of being grateful, their demands are becoming larger every year.

499
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:15,920
If so, you should conquer them.

500
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,280
Grand Prince.

501
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:25,450
It is true that an unfair agreement was entered into ten years ago.

502
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,650
If you think our external relationship with them is inadequate,

503
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,400
you can do away with it and confront them forcefully.

504
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,070
Are you picking on the fact that I'm still young and inexperienced in military affairs?

505
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,910
If you hesitate, you can't gain experience.

506
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,880
You should make a decision. If you feel we need to conquer, we will do it.

507
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,780
I don't know why His Majesty is acting like that.

508
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,920
He's especially going against you this year.

509
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,160
He eventually follows your suggestions anyway.

510
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,870
Why does he have to show his opposition in front of the ministers?

511
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:20,740
Are you really smiling?

512
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,330
Father-in-law.  I think it's time.

513
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,260
Haven't you been saying you want to rest?

514
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,790
I think your wish will come true soon.

515
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:47,340
No, Your Highness.  The king still needs your help.

516
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,820
The national affairs have just been stabilized.

517
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,960
If you leave his side, I fear we will have instability again.

518
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,050
The king has the former king's wisdom and

519
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,300
the strength of Hyungnim Jin Yang.

520
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,080
Not only in domestic affairs but in foreign relations, he has a unique way of making his own decisions.

521
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,470
He no longer needs the assistance of regency.

522
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:19,160
If you leave, won't the young king be shaken by the older courtiers?

523
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,700
No matter how intelligent he is, his inexperience can't be ignored.

524
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,380
We will begin by getting rid of the prime minister.

525
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,390
Prime minister?

526
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:31,370
The father-in-law of the uncle who was his regent.

527
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:36,420
If he eliminates the strongest man in the court and begins his sole rule,

528
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:42,690
no court minister will look down on him for being young.

529
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,010
Would the prime minister retreat so easily?

530
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:52,510
He's asked to resign at least twelve times.

531
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,220
He will gladly take the step if it's for the king.

532
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,560
Then, can you wait until the king gets married?

533
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,790
That will be best.  Once the queen's quarters is established,

534
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,910
he can begin his own rule.

535
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,800
You want me to fire the prime minister?  Aren't you being too harsh?

536
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,310
You have to go at least that far if you want to take control of the court

537
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:24,060
and manage the national affairs.

538
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,300
Can't you just stay where you are?

539
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,310
Am I the king? You are.

540
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,140
What are you going to do when you leave the capital?

541
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,250
Since I have a beautiful wife, unlike you,

542
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,340
I have a lot to do when I go home.

543
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,120
But do not worry.

544
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,390
Since the royal bride selection process has begun,

545
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,640
you will soon have a queen.

546
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,790
Did you not choose your own bride?

547
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:00,560
Well, if the truth be told, I think she might have chosen me first.

548
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,780
It's a bit complicated.

549
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,080
I want to choose my own wife as well!

550
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,240
Is that not possible?

551
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,650
It's rather strange

552
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,440
how you've taken up

553
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,900
the traits of all three sons in my family.

554
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,380
- Please help yourself. 
- Congratulations!

555
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,260
Are your elders doing well?

556
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,840
Please eat a lot.

557
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:56,090
You traitor!

558
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,760
How am I a traitor?

559
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,550
When I decided to resign from the post Grand Prince Jin Yang gave me and go for the national examinations,

560
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,630
you should have waited for me, but no, you got married?

561
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,400
You are a yangban (noble class). I am a servant.

562
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,170
We would never have worked out anyway, so why wait?

563
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,790
You should have trusted me.

564
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,910
Ja Hyeon waited for her love even when she was told he'd died.

565
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,260
You couldn't wait for someone who was well and alive?

566
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,940
I waited for three years.

567
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,440
How can you write exams for ten years?

568
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,700
There are many who don't get it done in ten years.

569
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,770
How excellent.

570
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,610
And now, you can get married.

571
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,070
- Traitor!
 - Coward!

572
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,160
Traitor!

573
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,540
Who are you?

574
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,910
Come on in.  It's a special celebration today and everyone is welcome.

575
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,050
Anyone is welcome and there is a lot of food!

576
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:04,610
Want to try this?

577
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,840
I have something to ask.

578
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,100
Ask away.

579
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,290
Is this His Excellency Seong Eok's house

580
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:20,350
Where Grand Prince Eun Seong and Lady Ja Yeon live?

581
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,540
How do you know Mother and Father?

582
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,920
Are you a lady of this household too?

583
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,290
I am here to see my aunt.

584
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,450
Aunt?

585
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,030
I heard my aunt lives in this house.

586
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,550
What is it? Is she someone you know?

587
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:56,190
My long-lived revenge is now finished.

588
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:04,430
What does that mean?

589
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,610
Life can be endlessly meaningless,

590
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,290
and good fortune can turn into a disaster in an instant.

591
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,390
Is that why you gave away a chance to be something else?

592
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:17,460
I didn't think you'd go back to being a gisaeng once the rebellion was over.

593
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,900
You have to be entitled in order to receive a reward.

594
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,930
I'm lucky to avoid being punished.

595
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,450
Even if I no longer try to become noble,

596
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:30,380
whether I am a gisaeng or anything else,

597
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,270
I've discovered I am a precious person.

598
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,180
Where did you get this?

599
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,530
My mother gave it to me.

600
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,370
Her close friend gave it to her.

601
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,570
What is your name?

602
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,760
So Hwa. I'm So Hwa.

603
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,330
Lee So Hwa.

604
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,580
Little Flower. What a pretty name.

605
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,610
How did you come all the way here?

606
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,250
Mother brought me here.

607
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:20,090
Are you two really my uncle and aunt?

608
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,400
Honey.

609
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,750
I thought you had died.

610
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,720
The world is big with many places to go.

611
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,220
It's been ten years, ten years.  You should have at least contacted me once a year.

612
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,570
If you keep going like this while I'm eating, I'll get indigestion.

613
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,870
- I will go back.
 - Are you still threatening me?

614
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,530
Are you going to forget everything now?

615
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,850
Have you forgotten?

616
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:37,340
Sadness has subsided but I cannot forget.

617
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:44,010
Roo Si Gae, Jooni, Deokman and Hochi.

618
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,520
I can still see them in front of me.

619
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,910
Now that I see you,

620
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,400
it feels good.

621
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,960
I've sent our So Hwa to Ja Hyeon.

622
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,710
She can raise her better than I.

623
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,370
How is it where you are?

624
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:25,670
Are you acting the role of king that you've wanted very well?

625
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,410
If not,

626
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,610
are you lonely there too,

627
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,150
and longing for this world?

628
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:50,450
Isn't it time for you to call for me?

629
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,820
I want to see you.

630
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,970
I miss you, Your Majesty.

631
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:12,800

632
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:20,800

633
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:30,600

634
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:40,040

635
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:49,750
Hyungnim, So Hwa is here.

636
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:55,600
She's pretty like her mother and strong like you, Hyungnim.

637
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,330
We will raise her well as our daughter.

638
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:04,410
We will give her lots of love.

639
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:08,070
What was my father like?

640
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:18,330
He was the most handsome and brave among all brothers.

641
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:22,970
When you are able to understand more as you grow up,

642
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:27,180
your uncle will tell you a lot about your father.

643
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,250
Auntie!

644
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,280
Ah, you're home.

645
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,400
- Unni.
 - You're here, Danbi.

646
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,620
She is your aunt's cousin on her mother's side.  She comes often to learn to draw.

647
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:02,110
She's older than you so you can get along well like sisters.

648
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,450
Do you want to be eliminated from the royal bride selection?

649
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:11,330
Yes.  I don't want to be queen.

650
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:15,020
I told my parents I really don't want to be wed to the palace

651
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,150
and went on a hunger strike but they are not budging.

652
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,990
That's why I've come to see you.

653
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:26,790
It's something that the queen's court decides.

654
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,300
It's not something I can help with.

655
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,490
Then, can you tell me how I can fail it?

656
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,790
Why do you hate it so much?

657
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:38,610
His Majesty is smart and strong.  Not bad looking either.

658
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,750
I can hardly handle being a noble lady.

659
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,970
How can I handle the palace or the queen's court on top of that?

660
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:49,530
It's to the benefit of the palace that they don't get a daughter-in-law like me.

661
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,040
Where would the blood of our family flow (similar to each other)?

662
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,600
Why do you take after me when we are only cousins?

663
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,510
Me?

664
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,340
Uncle.

665
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,820
How many times have I told you?  Royal bride selection is the responsibility of the inner court.

666
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,650
If you are going to have a temper tantrum you have to go to your mother or grandmother.

667
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,850
I can't get through to them.

668
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,500
You are the one who knows my feelings on this.

669
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,790
It sounds like I am easy pickings.

670
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:20,950
You met your wife without going through the selection process.

671
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,150
You didn't want to marry someone without knowing what she looked like.  Why won't you understand me?

672
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,360
I was a grand prince but you are a king.

673
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,110
You are the king of this nation, Joseon.

674
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:33,500
So, did I say I will just meet with anyone on the street

675
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,210
or go on dates ignoring all of my duties in managing national affairs? I didn't.

676
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:41,120
I just want to be able to see the candidates and have the final say.

677
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,710
Is this greed too big?

678
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:47,510
What kind of woman are you looking for anyway?

679
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,940
Someone who's totally different from my mother.

680
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:54,990
Someone who's strong enough to go on horses and go hunting with me.

681
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,440
Please take good care of her.

682
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,470
Please don't worry.  Even someone like Roo Si Gae

683
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,470
couldn't do anything in front of me.

684
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,660
No matter how tomboyish,

685
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,310
she's a lady from a noble family.

686
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,810
I will trust you, Court Lady Jang.

687
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,870
When you sit, sit like a flower landing on the ground,

688
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:43,170
softly, with both of your knees—

689
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,860
As someone who's been selected to be a candidate

690
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:59,670
of the royal bride selection, what's going on here?

691
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,410
Someone who is the most reckless couldn't be as bad as you.

692
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,060
That's why, please talk to the masters at the palace.

693
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:10,050
Please tell them a lady called Danbi is utterly unsuitable to be queen.

694
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:12,060
She will wreck the king's palace.

695
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:16,570
That's why you need to practice.  Practice.

696
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:20,710
Do not give up yet.  Again.

697
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:31,160
Seriously, you can only look.

698
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,980
If you do anything, we will be in big trouble.

699
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,720
Uncle, don't worry too much.

700
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,690
This is not the first time we've been in disguise.

701
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:45,110
Your head is not a decoration.

702
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,920
Don't pay attention only to your outer appearance.

703
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,250
You have to gain knowledge.

704
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:56,510
In that vein, will someone do a reading?

705
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,710
How dare you steal a look at the ladies?  Who are you and where do you live?

706
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,970
I will make sure you're humiliated for this.

707
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,750
Where I live is—

708
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,570
Stop there!

709
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,730
Why?  Do you see something?

710
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:50,810
Stop looking at me and get to your painting.

711
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,360
It's good.

712
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,180
That I look dirty?

713
01:08:56,410 --> 01:09:00,580
It's a beautiful day and we are out here drawing.

714
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,000
I know.  How long has it been?

715
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,790
We can come out every day from now on.

716
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,300
With your words, you can bring me a star from the sky.

717
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,760
I have lots of time now that I've quit the regency.

718
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:20,810
Even if you are no longer a regent, His Majesty will call for you day and night.

719
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,330
Speaking of which,

720
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:28,040
how about if we leave the capital and move to the country.

721
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,890
You think you can leave?

722
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:34,610
I've fulfilled all my duties as a grand prince.

723
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:38,280
I want to live the rest of my life the way I promised you.

724
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:43,670
We can draw together and have a drink at a picnic.

725
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,140
What else did we promise to do?

726
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:51,350
The ocean will be nice.  We can go fishing.

727
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,780
Would the kids like it?

728
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:59,390
Our children are happy as long as their busy father

729
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,720
will stay with them.  They'd go to the smallest shack.

730
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,910
What about you?

731
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:20,630
I'm sorry.  It wasn't intentional.

732
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,500
Wife.  Wife.

733
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,850
One moment.  Wife, Wife.

734
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,770
- Come here. 
- One moment.

735
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,960
No.
