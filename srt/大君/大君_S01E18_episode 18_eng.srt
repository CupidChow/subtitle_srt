1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,640
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:12,070

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,110
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,380
- Eun Seong! 
   Episode 18

5
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,100
Eun Seong!

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,640
Will you take the poison Grand Prince Jin Yang bestowed upon you?

7
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,720
Or will you take the sword wielded by Do Yeong Soo's son?

8
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,960
You bastards!

9
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,140
 Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe, Chieftain Li Man Zhu.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,130
Your Majesty, Grand Prince Yang Ahn has passed away.

11
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,380
He rejected the poison and ultimately took Do Jeong Gook's sword.

12
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,780
Even though he is a criminal, have his tomb set up as royalty.

13
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,840
For my whole life, he was like a father to me.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,560
He should at least be treated well on his final path.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,250
Are you alright?

16
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,980
He was my

17
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,430
one and only family.

18
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,410
I knew that he was using me to satisfy his grudge for not being able to ascend to the throne,

19
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,170
but, still, the only person I could rely on was Uncle.

20
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,180
I still cannot believe it,

21
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,720
that Grand Prince Yang Ahn truly had traitorous intentions.

22
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,690
Look at me.

23
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,880
Am I not the person who held traitorous thoughts towards my own older brother?

24
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,790
I am the great man who deposed his nephew and killed his younger brother.

25
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,300
A person like me... Could I trust anyone?

26
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,330
Am I different from my uncle?

27
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,760
Shall I bring you something to drink?

28
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,960
That person.

29
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,120
I miss her.

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,170
I will escort her here.

31
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,800
No.

32
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,660
It is not the time yet.

33
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,190
If she comes here, she will only go through hardship again.

34
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,220
  I am Joseon's king, the eldest son of the former king, Lee Myeong.

35
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,120
  While he was a grand prince, he conspired with the barbarians in the north.

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,710
  In exchange for Joseon territory, he caused the barbarians to wage war. Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,190
 forced Grand Prince Lee Hwi, third in line to the throne, to a field of death.

38
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,230
  He forcibly usurped the throne. He is a traitor.

39
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,770
  I, who experienced several assassination attempts while in exile,

40
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,620
 was able to escape death thanks to the help of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,910
  We are informing Joseon's people. Let us oust the criminal Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang.

42
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,770
  I hope that the citizens will gather their strength together to return the legitimacy of the royal family.

43
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,540
Is this real? Is it true that our king seized the throne?

44
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,270
They said that he tried to kill the deposed king!

45
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,290
Then, did he kill Grand Prince Eun Seong, too?

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,340
They say Grand Prince Eun Seong is alive, though.

47
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,290
He's alive?!

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,400
What do we do? The poor baby prince!

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,300
What is this?

50
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,520
He is probably suffering somewhere right now!

51
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,480
If a person has committed a crime, then it is only right for him to be punished!

52
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,830
Kkeut Dan.

53
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,210
This is a place where women's clothes are made. Men cannot enter.

54
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,930
If she's going to take her measurements, she has to at least take off her jacket.

55
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,800
Are you trying to come in or what?

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
We will wait in front of the doors.

57
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,200
Let's go.

58
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,030
You are in pain, right?

59
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,490
Even if you hated him, he was still your uncle.

60
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,170
I know that it's hard for you.

61
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,100
I thought of my older brother.

62
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,110
I thought that, now, maybe I'm the same person as him.

63
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,110
You are different from him.

64
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,180
It wasn't for your own sake,

65
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,720
but you did it to make everything right again.

66
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,210
Even though my goal was different,

67
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,480
what makes my path so different?

68
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,720
It fills me with shame.

69
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,320
If you want to fight an enemy, you must step into the muddy water.

70
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,270
There is no way to stay clean while fighting to win.

71
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,080
You have changed greatly.

72
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,720
So, do you dislike me?

73
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,580
You have become stronger.

74
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,050
You have become more beautiful.

75
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,750
Now, you are not someone I need to protect.

76
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,060
You are a person I can lean on and rely on.

77
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,830
You are a reliable companion.

78
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,460
Will you inform the queen dowager's palace now?

79
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,050
Without the help of the higher-ups, it is impossible to succeed in this.

80
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,190
It is time for me to inform my mother

81
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,410
that the abdicated king and I are alive.

82
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,970
Please give me the letter. I will enter the palace.

83
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,540
You cannot. Have you forgotten how you were treated the last time you were there?

84
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,160
That's a different situation from now.

85
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,860
I have confidence that I will return safely. Do not worry.

86
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,150
Your Highness.

87
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,110
Do you believe in my brother that much?

88
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,620
I believe in myself and in you.

89
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,540
I believe that if something happens, you will save me.

90
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,980
I will bring silk from this store.

91
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,450
If you write it on there, I'll deliver it.

92
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,930
♫   If I just keep walking   ♫

93
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,710
♫    like this endlessly   ♫

94
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,020
One moment.

95
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,960
Since we're being separated after being together, it's harder.

96
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,030
There was a time when I didn't see you for three years.

97
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:31,450
Right now, even a day is so difficult.

98
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,240
♫   How much more do I have to watch it to know?   ♫

99
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,570
If you cannot fall asleep at night,

100
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,620
if you miss me so much,

101
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,680
think of our past days.

102
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,410
When we met at the art store, when I fell into the water,

103
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,790
when you pretended to be a performer and confessed to me to make me feel better,

104
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,650
in the barracks at the battleground.

105
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,950
Then, you will be able to hold it in.

106
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,920
You will be able to endure it.

107
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,950
♫   I just wanna follow this path to a place no one knows  ♫

108
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,680
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

109
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,730
I'll hold this.

110
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,100
Is there anywhere else to go?

111
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,650
No, she's going back home now.

112
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,500
I am envious of the lady.

113
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,920
You two treasure each other and long for each other so much.

114
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,110
There was a time when she was envious of you, too.

115
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,240
She said you played the flute well, and that you were beautiful.

116
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,550
She lamented quite a bit while drunk.

117
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,560
Could I compare to the beauty of woman being loved?

118
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,270
I have never seen a woman so beautiful like the lady.

119
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,320
You should find meaning in life too.

120
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,900
Wherever you are and whatever you do, a person who has found meaning

121
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,700
will not be shaken by others.

122
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,160
I know that you are helping me out of revenge right now.

123
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,600
When a good day arrives, you'll receive your reward too.

124
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,820
But, if you truly find meaning in working and living for your nation,

125
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,110
even though you are a low-ranked individual and a woman with an injured eye,

126
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,880
you will become a precious person.

127
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,940
No, this is also incorrect.

128
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,380
People are already all precious.

129
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,910
The remnants of the rebellion are impersonating Prince Seung Pyeong.

130
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,550
They are shaking public sentiment.

131
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,090
The schemes of the people deceiving the royal family

132
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,250
are playing with our foolish subjects.

133
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,380
Your Majesty, since Grand Prince Yang Ahn has passed,

134
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,990
those rebels will gradually lose their power!

135
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,570
But, why

136
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,730
can you not trace the whereabouts of Prince Seung Pyeong who disappeared from Grand Prince Yang Ahn's house?!

137
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,600
Why are the baseless posters continuing to appear every day?!

138
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,420
Prince Seung Pyeong has lost his guardian. Would he be alive?

139
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,700
All of these crises have arisen from the fact that the government affairs are unstable.

140
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,560
You should appoint a well-qualified individual to the public office position as soon as possible.

141
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,050
And if all power is pushed towards suppressing the rebels,

142
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,830
your worries will ease, Your Majesty.

143
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,100
After I ascended to the throne,

144
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,340
the great and small crises have never ceased.

145
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,660
Do Jeong Gook, who was at a local government post,

146
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,180
gave himself up in the name of loyalty and did many great things for the country.

147
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,060
Therefore, Do Jeong Gook will be given the position as Commander of the Five Guards.

148
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,220
We will praise his great deeds.

149
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,350
I ask that you continue to assist me in the future.

150
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,480
Your Majesty!

151
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,600
Find Prince Seung Pyung and the rebels as soon as possible.

152
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,540
Make me happy.

153
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,550
Even though I am lacking in my ability, I will show my loyalty

154
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,060
and serve you, Your Majesty!

155
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,520
Your Majesty, what the court ministers need right now

156
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,070
is for the empty position of prime minister to be filled.

157
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,490
I have not found a capable individual yet.

158
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,880
However, for now, we will make decisions without the state council.

159
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,070
I plan on having a six-minister administration.

160
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,130
Your Highness! There are many wise subjects in your court.

161
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,360
A six-minister administration, you say?

162
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm saying I'll personally take care of state affairs.

163
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
I am neither weak from illness nor a young child.

164
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,370
I don't plan on listening to each and every one of your opinions,

165
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,700
and carry out politics like a student.

166
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,600
His Majesty does not trust us.

167
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,970
We risked our lives to be loyal to His Majesty, and this is what we get?

168
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,290
It seems that the shock of Grand Prince Yang Ahn's betrayal has not yet settled.

169
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,230
Let's say it's obvious that you reap just what you sow.

170
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,280
But it should be fair!

171
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,270
The Chief of the Investigation Bureau was promoted to a higher position.

172
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,950
Why are you, Minister, in the same position?

173
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,280
Well, it hasn't been too long since I became a minister.

174
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,620
The prime minister position is empty, and I, an excellent candidate, am right here!

175
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,020
Using a six-minister administration, he's making me into a scarecrow.

176
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,450
Isn't that what he's saying?

177
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,500
We shouldn't do this outside, let's go to the meeting room.

178
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,700
Let's go there and talk.

179
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,090
A pact.

180
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,830
This is Eun Seong's handwriting.

181
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,480
Who is the bastard that's going so far as to imitate his handwriting

182
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,680
to humiliate me?!

183
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,890
Capture the members of my uncle's household and the rest of Eun Seong's rebels,

184
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,700
even the Confucian students from Sungkyunkwan and the royal court ministers!

185
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,080
After finding anyone that can use a brush,

186
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,890
find the one who has written this document!

187
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,560
Your Highness, I believe that Grand Prince Eun Seong is alive.

188
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,740
Didn't you personally confirm the corpse and conduct his funeral?

189
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,760
Even though I inspected the corpse,

190
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,890
he was shot with an arrow and fell into the ocean, and his face was shattered. So it was a questionable assumption.

191
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,910
When I went to the temple where the lady was,

192
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,000
I thought I saw a similar face there.

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
Why are you telling me this now?!

194
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,780
I thought I saw wrong. I thought it couldn't be and brushed it aside.

195
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,290
Since you're saying that the document is in Grand Prince Eun Seong's handwriting,

196
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,070
a streak of suspicion won't disappear.

197
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,020
Eun Seong is alive?

198
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,650
Congratulations.

199
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,780
You became the highest commanding officer in Joseon.

200
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,020
Congratulations to you, as well. You should move to my area for the Commander of Five Guards.

201
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,600
You should become my deputy and do great things with me.

202
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,030
Are you taking me with you?

203
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,340
Aren't we people with shared trauma?

204
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,850
I lost my father in a civil war, and you lost your older brother.

205
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,190
We must go together and command them together.

206
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,060
Miss Ja Hyeon is asking for an audience with the queen dowager?

207
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,320
Having left the Jeongubwon (temple for female monks) is great enough to cause a situation.

208
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,800
It's a matter related to Hwi... I mean, Grand Prince Eun Seong.

209
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,900
She said she wants to deliver his possessions.

210
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,420
The lady has something to give her.

211
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,700
But you still haven't learned proper manners?

212
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,570
Truthfully, you know how to speak formally, right?

213
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,060
You're not using it on purpose, right?

214
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,350
Do you not have sweets with you today?

215
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,200
Stand in line.

216
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,910
Be careful when you leave.

217
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,650
Oh, Your Excellency!

218
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,140
He's here!

219
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,380
Look at me!

220
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,320
How could he be so brazen?

221
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,790
That's the queen's brother. He's supposed to be Minister of Defense.

222
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,680
Is he making them stand in line at his front door and acquiring bribes?

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,960
In a cave without a tiger, the rabbit plays the role of the king.

224
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,590
Because Grand Prince Yang Ahn is no longer here, he's taken over his role.

225
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,480
Grand Prince Jin Yang warmly welcomes corruption.

226
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,780
As long as they don't rebel against him, they can privately accumulate wealth.

227
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,240
Even if they receive bribes, he turns a blind eye.

228
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
The Minister of Revenue Jeon Gyeon and the Right State Counselor Park Boo Gyung.

229
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,750
They're all excited at the prospect of accumulating wealth.

230
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,450
What are the three of them doing? Aren't they afraid of the citizens' eyes?

231
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,450
Because he's a king with a foul background,

232
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,650
his weaknesses have been revealed to his subjects.

233
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,640
They've reached a mutual agreement

234
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,470
to cover each others' wrongdoings.

235
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,180
The only ones that are dying are the citizens.

236
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,060
The posters and the anger towards the royal court

237
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,660
are shaking up public sentiment.

238
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,490
If you just throw in a match, everything will come burning down.

239
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,120
Any king that has ascended to the throne

240
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,340
must participate in the ancestral rites at the tomb of King Taejo, who founded the nation.

241
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,800
He will definitely do that soon.

242
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,150
I'll find out what the king's plans are.

243
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,040
Let's act when he leaves.

244
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,440
Daring to go against your command,

245
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,990
she left the Jeongubwon by herself.

246
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,380
This is something that cannot be left alone.

247
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,330
Doesn't this attitude stem from not taking royalty seriously?

248
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,220
I heard that the Lady of the Seong family hadn't been feeling well.

249
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,240
I heard she temporarily went back to her home in order to feel better.

250
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,080
Even if she's ill, she should die there.

251
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,410
Why would a Buddhist nun move locations?

252
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,250
Your Highness, this is not the time to be thinking about different things.

253
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,190
You need to take proper measures to prepare for your birth.

254
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,350
We don't know enough about your pregnancy.

255
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,610
Send for the royal physician and have him take your pulse.

256
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,370
We need to see when we should start preparing for your pregnancy.

257
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,100
Your Highness, the daughter of Chief Scholar

258
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,930
Seong Ja Hyeon is here.

259
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,060
Have her come in.

260
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,460
Your Highness.

261
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,770
I wanted to hear her side of her story, so I called her in.

262
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,890
I'll deal with it myself, so you can go back.

263
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,510
You really have guts. Where do you think this is?

264
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,300
Do you really want to die?

265
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,170
Have you been healthy, Your Highness?

266
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,480
They say you're pregnant.

267
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,770
- Congratulations.
 - Why are you doing this?

268
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,270
- What are you trying groaning about now? 
 - After being shut in the Jeongubwon,

269
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,870
having the same life as a prisoner,

270
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,360
I thought it would be better to wear silk clothes and eat good foods

271
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,620
while I live trapped here in the palace.

272
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,550
Are you crazy? Are you really going to be a concubine?

273
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm visiting the Queen Mother to ask for forgiveness.

274
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,490
I might tell them that I'll do what the king wants of me.

275
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,810
Don't dream of it.

276
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,310
You need a son.

277
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,020
If it's a daughter, isn't that an irrelevant existence when it comes to the throne?

278
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,640
If a concubine has a son,

279
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,260
that son will become a king.

280
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,110
Her Highness is waiting.

281
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,870
Hurry and come in.

282
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,830
You said you were ill. Are you feeling better?

283
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,890
Because of your concern, I'm doing well.

284
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,650
You said you had some of Eun Seong's possessions?

285
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,990
Isn't this silk?

286
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,470
 Mother, it is I, your unworthy son Hwi.

287
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,900
 You must have heard that I died while trying to escape,

288
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,310
 but that is not true.

289
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,820
  Thanks to the help of righteous people, we have taken the abdicated king and we are in hiding.

290
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,770
 Brother has made a deal with the Jurchen people with our nation's land

291
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,890
 and has tried to harm both the young majesty and me.

292
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,010
 Thankfully with the help of the shrine and others, I was able to save the young majesty.

293
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,500
 However, I cannot just stand and watch brother's actions any longer.

294
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,650
 When I finish my preparations, I will overthrow my brother.

295
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,460
 Allow me to raise the young majesty to his rightful position.

296
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,930
  Help us protect our work and the abdicated king.

297
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,540
  Wait for the day when I am healthy and a celebratory ceremony is held.

298
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,940
 From, Hwi, your unworthy son.

299
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,820
The grand prince is alive?

300
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,160
He is taking care of the young majesty.

301
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,970
Is this the truth?

302
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,580
Is he unscathed? Is he healthy?

303
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,170
He's growing up very well.

304
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,440
I thought maybe.

305
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,430
In a corner of my heart, I thought, what if my son had not died?

306
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:05,130
What if he had saved his young nephew and was safe and alive?

307
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:11,260
I wanted to expect this and think all those things like a dream.

308
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,280
Is my son really

309
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,400
alive?

310
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,220
We went to Yeong Wol together

311
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,570
and saved the young majesty.

312
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
The daughter of the Seong household is here?

313
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,960
Yes, Your Majesty. It is said that she's

314
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,920
visiting the queen mother.

315
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,230
Because there are guards at my home, it is difficult to move about.

316
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,620
For me to enter the palace freely and

317
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,450
deliver news on the grand prince and the young majesty to the two of you,

318
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,490
I would be thankful if you were to issue a permit for entry.

319
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,780
I'll let Court LadyJang know and grant you this.

320
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,460
You must be careful.

321
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,910
My son's future is in your hands.

322
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,020
That's not it.

323
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,480
The grand prince is protecting his majesty with all his might.

324
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,130
I am merely performing errands.

325
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,150
You must have carried resentment towards me.

326
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,760
I didn't even know you were trying your best behind the scenes.

327
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I only treated you cruelly.

328
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,610
That's not it, Your Highness.

329
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,620
The grand prince only believes in you.

330
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,030
Pretending to be deceased

331
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:47,150
to protect the young majesty, how horrible must it be?

332
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,820
To come back to life

333
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,310
and be able to serve His Majesty under the bright sunlight,

334
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,740
I ask you both to help him.

335
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,190
His Majesty orders you to meet him before you leave.

336
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,550
What brings you to the palace?

337
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,870
I have to make a good impression on the queen dowager

338
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:04,130
in order to smoothly enter the palace in the future.

339
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,300
You're using your head like that now?

340
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,170
Staying foolish has put me in this position.

341
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,970
Losing the one I was engaged to and being tortured,

342
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,670
I almost spent my whole life locked up in the Jeongubwon (temple for female monks).

343
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,800
Should I say that the newly reformed you is admirable?

344
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,090
I will enter the palace once in a while to visit the queen dowager.

345
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,020
If the opportunity allows, I may be able to see you again.

346
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,540
Why have you changed?

347
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,040
I have thought about when you have started to change.

348
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,060
Yes. After facing such things, a person can change.

349
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,300
Eun Seong is dead anyway.

350
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,620
After some time has passed, you have come to your senses.

351
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,080
Didn't you say you desired to become my queen?

352
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,340
You surprised me at the temple with such a request.

353
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,490
Was there something

354
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,530
or someone that must not be revealed?

355
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,710
Isn't Eun Seong alive?

356
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,040
Isn't Eun Seong the one who saved you?

357
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,330
You two have been living together at the temple.

358
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,340
Then I came, so you wished to help Eun Seong escape.

359
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,660
You said you wanted to become a queen and that you wanted to go home.

360
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,970
Isn't that what you did?

361
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,290
Without knowing that, I

362
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,860
was happy for a moment.

363
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,760
At your deception, at your mockery,

364
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,220
I was shaken beyond belief.

365
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,250
I heard that the queen is pregnant.

366
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,850
If she gives birth to a son, you won't have a reason to dethrone her.

367
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,930
Because you cannot give me what I desire,

368
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,360
are you trying to escape by bringing back the dead?

369
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,560
If I really

370
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,340
do make you my queen,

371
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,940
what will you do then?

372
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,430
It won't matter who births sons or daughters.

373
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,220
If I make you my queen,

374
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,650
the Eun Seong who's living will experience hell.

375
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,490
Keep your promise.

376
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,800
I will always be waiting.

377
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,030
Your Majesty.

378
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,340
Chief Scholar has returned from China.

379
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,830
When I am approved as an emperor, my position will be even more secure.

380
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,640
Even if Eun Seong was alive,

381
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,360
there is nothing that will change.

382
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:28,310
Your Majesty, Chief Scholar has returned.

383
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,780
China have finished their approval.

384
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,380
Current king does not have the right to be king.

385
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,060
With Eun Seong's life on the line, he sold off our land to Jurchens.

386
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,770
It must have been Grand Prince Yang Ahn's doing.

387
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,780
Do you think he didn't know?

388
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,340
What happened to Eun Seong and Seung Pyeong is all his doing.

389
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,730
But Your Highness, is revealing this situation the best thing to do?

390
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,230
What are you trying to say?

391
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,360
If all of our despicable wrongdoings come to light,

392
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,730
and shake up the throne again, will that help?

393
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,430
What will the citizens think of the royal family?

394
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,230
The current king is also your son.

395
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,600
Brother, just because I birthed him,

396
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,800
if I were to forgive and ignore his treasonous and murderous nature, what would become of this nation?

397
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,790
After forgiving his actions, should I live on as if nothing has happened,

398
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,520
even if this nation collapses?

399
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,790
Setting a son, who is sharpening his knife, on the right path,

400
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,210
that is the path a mother should take.

401
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,390
China's envoys are coming to meet with Prince Seung Pyeong?

402
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

403
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,560
They will be checking whether it was right to abdicate a king in front of a royal audience.

404
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,540
Why are you doing your job like that?

405
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,280
You should've received the will!

406
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,600
They say that they will follow the procedures.

407
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,870
I didn't have reason to say no.

408
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,320
If we bring Prince Seung Pyeong back from exile and have him meet the envoys—

409
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,230
I'm saying this because Prince Seung Pyeong is not here right now!

410
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,550
While Chief Scholar was away, there were many things that happened.

411
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,270
While Grand Prince Yang Ahn was trying to kidnap Prince Seung Pyeong,

412
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,490
he was executed.

413
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,180
Before the envoys arrive, find Prince Seung Pyeong,

414
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,850
even if we have to search this city or the entire country!

415
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,210
I'm telling you to find the child.

416
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,660
You went through a lot.

417
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,020
In China, I intentionally mentioned the existence of the abdicated king in order to postpone the approval of the king.

418
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,200
I'm not sure if it will be of use.

419
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,680
There's someone you should meet.

420
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,620
If Eun Seong is alive, what would he do?

421
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,700
He would probably try to reinstate the former king.

422
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,500
I will trace his path from the house of exile again and find his hideout.

423
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,570
- If you kick up a ruckus to find him, he'll hide even more.
 - Then?

424
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,310
If we wait, he'll come to us.

425
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,740
He will pursue his plan.

426
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,420
Looks like there will be another bloodbath.

427
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,310
Hurry and come!

428
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,700
Oh, thank you!

429
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,880
Aigoo, hurry up.

430
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,760
I didn't dare dream you were alive.

431
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,700
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

432
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,970
It's nothing.

433
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:13,130
Ja Hyeon must have been so happy.

434
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,930
Can I trust you with the court ministers when they're going on the Royal Ancestral Ritual Procession?

435
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,290
I just have to take the ministers back to the palace?

436
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,260
If the former king returns to the palace while we detain my brother,

437
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,510
the queen mother will gather the ministers

438
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,780
and issue a command to reinstate the former king.

439
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,820
If it goes according to the plan, it will be perfect.

440
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,220
If the former king reclaims the throne without a hitch,

441
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,520
Grand Prince Jin Yang will be arrested as a criminal.

442
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,930
The ministers might resist.

443
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,130
After Grand Prince Yang Ahn died,

444
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,150
the battle line collapsed.

445
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,620
If we take out the Minister of Defense and Eo Eul Woon, the remaining ministers

446
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,010
will go with the flow.

447
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,310
Are you sure the word will not get out?

448
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:07,210
If a rebellion fails, it's usually because of the infidelity of the people in it.

449
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,360
But only three people know of our entire plan.

450
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,770
Prince Eun Seong, me, and you.

451
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,630
The soldiers in the area for the Five Guards will follow the orders of the Commander.

452
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,270
They don't even know that this is a rebellion.

453
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,510
Everyone has their part in the plan,

454
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,370
but only the Commander Do and I know the big picture.

455
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,340
What's going on?

456
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,030
Don't be too surprised.

457
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,190
When did all these people...?

458
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,730
Your Highness!

459
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,360
Since you were going through a hard time,

460
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,010
I asked anyone who could come to the capital to come.

461
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,800
They all gave up their livelihoods and rushed here.

462
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,320
Why?

463
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,500
I cannot protect your lives if you join hands with me.

464
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,550
You could die!

465
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,250
Grand Prince, you went through life and death together with us,

466
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,700
and you helped us escape that hellish prison.

467
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,340
If it weren't for you, we would already be dead.

468
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,400
Since we have already died once, we are ready to give our lives for you.

469
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,090
We give you our lives.

470
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,770
We missed you. Welcome!

471
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,450
Thank you.

472
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Are you worried?

473
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:11,140
Our household has already made our choice. All of us.

474
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,160
Before you came to work for the captain for the royal guards, weren't you working for the crown prince?

475
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,770
When the abdicated king,

476
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,270
I mean, when Prince Seung Pyeong was still the king, I heard you served at the crown prince's palace.

477
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,210
There are many people who moved from working for the crown prince to being a royal guard.

478
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,970
There's someone who wishes to see you.

479
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,170
Grand Prince!

480
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,980
We are taking care of the abdicated king.

481
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,620
Will you protect His Majesty again?

482
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,180
 Cashier Record Books

483
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,780
Are these documents real?

484
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,510
The person who was managing the funds for Grand Prince Jin Yang's rebellion gave them to us.

485
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,200
So many spies and so many bribes. This is...

486
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,180
It's proof that the former king didn't abdicate the throne,

487
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,270
but rather it was snatched from him by force.

488
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,530
The posters that said that he conspired with the barbarians!

489
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,070
Were those rumors true?

490
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,840
There were documents in Grand Prince Yang Ahn's house that were sent back and forth between the Jurchens.

491
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,150
The king had his uncle, Grand Prince Yang Ahn, killed in order to get rid of those documents.

492
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,800
If you were given a chance to follow the will of the late king

493
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,410
and to pledge your loyalty to the abdicated king once more,

494
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,330
what would you do?

495
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,540
To be honest, I used to think that Prince Jin Yang's enthronement

496
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,620
was unavoidable since the former king was so young.

497
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,510
But this is not right. If people like this rule the country,

498
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,090
what will happen to our future?

499
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,910
Queen Dowager sent a royal physician.

500
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,050
I will take care of it myself. Return.

501
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,150
I am not feeling well today.

502
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,470
That means you need a check-up even more. I will ask them to treat you.

503
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,570
I said I don't need it!

504
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,280
What right do you have?

505
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,310
Now is not the time to act the head of the royal household,

506
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,470
but to discipline yourself.

507
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,430
What's wrong, Your Highness?

508
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,460
She came here to check up on you

509
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,240
under the queen dowager's instructions.

510
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,470
I said I don't need it.

511
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,920
I will take care of my own body.

512
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,050
Are you really pregnant?

513
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,100
What are you so afraid of that you won't have your pulse checked?

514
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,440
Tell the truth!

515
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
It's still too early

516
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,190
to diagnose anything.

517
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,490
Another month must pass before we might know something.

518
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,440
Did you instruct the doctor to say what he said, Your Highness?

519
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,620
There's a chance that my lie may turn out to be true by that time.

520
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,220
Is it true this time?

521
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,510
I don't know yet.

522
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,830
I have to wait.

523
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,150
I won't! I won't!

524
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,610
Did anyone make you?

525
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,330
It's you who wanted to try it.

526
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,910
You do what you are good at.

527
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,940
We'll make the myeongab (protective shield).

528
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,640
Are you going to put it on Hwi?

529
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,670
It's for you.

530
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,170
Were we making this for her?

531
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,600
She is fighting with men neck and neck.

532
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,250
If she wears the myeongab, she is less likely to be hurt.

533
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,990
Then what about Hwi?

534
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,660
Later. After I make yours.

535
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,670
They will halt Grand Prince Jin Yang's palanquin here.

536
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,630
Station the archers over there.

537
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,360
Once his palanquin arrives and its doors are opened,

538
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,270
we shoot arrows before he steps out.

539
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,990
When panic breaks out around the royal carriage,

540
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,430
Lord Seong Eok (Chief Scholar) will lead away the frightened ministers.

541
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,660
Meanwhile, our palace guards will smuggle away the palanquin with Grand Prince Jin Yang.

542
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,030
But we must get rid of Eo Eul Woon.

543
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,380
If we fail,

544
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,590
you will not be able to avoid death.

545
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,620
If we succeed, my late father's resentment will be lifted.

546
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,550
We will be able to show the citizens

547
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,560
that virtue wins in the end,

548
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,840
and that that's the path Joseon must take.

549
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,090
Lady, please be safe.

550
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,530
Yeah.

551
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,400
Excuse me.

552
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,910
What's the matter?

553
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,020
It's nothing. You may go.

554
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,130
Are you okay?

555
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,940
Let's move to the room. I'm worried that someone may see.

556
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,130
It has not been that long since I ascended to the throne.

557
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,940
There are not many people that I can trust within the royal court.

558
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,250
My uncle has passed away. I have the Minister of Defense

559
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:54,130
and Captain of the Royal Guards with me , but they are military officers.

560
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,830
I do not have a civil servant who will assist me.

561
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,750
If the eldest son from Chief Scholar's household assists me,

562
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,630
there would be no one more reliable.

563
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,640
Would you come into the royal court?

564
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,690
Your Majesty, I am still a Confucian student from Sungkyunkwan who hasn't passed the exam.

565
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,940
How could I deal with the matters of the royal court?

566
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,330
How about you start as a part of the Ministry of Physiognomy (face reading to judge character)?

567
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,910
It is a job that deals with my seal. It is a great, important job.

568
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,630
That seems like a position that a student like me is unworthy of.

569
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,010
This is just the beginning.

570
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,690
If you want to protect your sister the right way,

571
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,650
you should hurry and become a big support for the royal court.

572
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,330
I am unworthy of your grace, Your Majesty.

573
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,130
His father is an envoy sent to Ming, and his daughter seeks the position of a queen.

574
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:13,170
His son doesn't feel happy when being offered a government position. Seong Deuk Sik is a simple person.

575
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,740
His aversion to taking a government position, there is a reason why.

576
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,710
To be honest, there is something bothering me about the Commander of Five Guards, Do Jeong Gook.

577
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,830
Isn't he a person who shot an arrow at Eun Seong based on family resentment?

578
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,360
Before he died, Grand Prince Yang Ahn advised me to be cautious of Do Jeong Gook.

579
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,290
I wonder if you promoted him too quickly and gave him too much authority.

580
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,920
I was just showing how if people are loyal to me, they will be honored.

581
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,200
But, if you are suspicious of him, keep an eye on him.

582
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,480
How do you feel about postponing the funeral tomorrow?

583
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,510
In the end, you have to run no matter what. You hear me?

584
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,850
Don't even look back. Just look forward and run.

585
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,190
You're the one who has to do well.

586
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:44,880

587
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:56,730
It's weird, right? I don't think fancy things suit me.

588
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,660
It's better than having a male disguise.

589
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,930
When tomorrow passes, everything will be finished.

590
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,820
Everyone will go back to their rightful place

591
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:29,150
and we will have our long-awaited marriage. We'll be together forever.

592
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,270
But, do not forget.

593
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,170
If this fails,

594
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,870
you and your father knew nothing about this.

595
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:51,190
Grand Prince Jin Yang is suspicious about whether you're alive or not.

596
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:55,260
But, still, we can't stop.

597
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,910
There is only one chance. When my brother leaves the palace,

598
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:04,960
this is the only time. If we miss it, we have to wait for the anniversary of the death of the former king.

599
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:10,310
Go back and wait for me.

600
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:15,390
I will not go.

601
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,660
The time when I waited for you,

602
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,390
do you know what I regretted the most?

603
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:32,240
When we had the promise ceremony at the temple, I regretted that I didn't become your wife.

604
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,360
I don't want to have those regrets again.

605
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,360
Right now, I am not considered to be alive in this world.

606
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,960
I am considered to be a dead person.

607
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,630
You are alive in front of me, Your Highness.

608
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:54,620
During the past three years, do you know what I thought I had done well?

609
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,530
I thought it was good that I hadn't gotten married to you before leaving.

610
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:04,480
We cannot promise life or death on this land. I don't know if I'll die today or tomorrow.

611
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,320
I considered it to be a great relief that I had not restrained you with our marriage.

612
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,010
That's a lie.

613
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:18,200
You always longed for me every day and regretted it every night.

614
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:25,890
I'm not scared.

615
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,460
Today, I will become your bride.

616
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:40,190
♫   What do I do with myself?   ♫

617
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:46,730
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

618
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:54,450
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

619
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:01,170
♫    As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

620
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,410
What's wrong?

621
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,770
When those two finish talking, I'm going to see Hwi too.

622
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:11,450
They won't finish tonight, you fool.

623
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,510
They'll have so many things to talk about on a night like this.

624
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,690
This might be their last, so they must feel uneasy.

625
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:26,570
What about us?

626
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,690
It might be the last, so we should be with him.

627
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,500
You can just be with me.

628
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,610
I'm hurting.

629
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,660
It hurts here!

630
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:46,120
My heart hurts! It feels like someone's ripping it apart.

631
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,120
That's because your heart hurts.

632
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,920
Fool!

633
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,740
When everything is done and

634
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,480
His Highness and the lady get married and live together,

635
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,480
you should live with me.

636
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,620
I don't want to. I'm going to live with Hwi.

637
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,600
And every day, you're going to make your heart hurt like this?

638
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,800
Just suffer through one more day, tomorrow. You should stop protecting people now.

639
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,120
There is no need for you to protect His Highness or the lady.

640
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,040
I will protect you now.

641
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,210
You fight worse than I do.

642
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,860
I'm good at fighting!

643
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,230
The lady is a bit late.

644
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,210
She threw the guards off track and went to see His Highness.

645
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,660
Don't worry about it. They think that they lost her somewhere along the way.

646
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,690
I told them that she's at home sleeping.

647
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,570
Kkeut Dan.

648
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:14,080
Is this truly for Ja Hyeon's sake?

649
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:35,470
Grand Prince Jin Yang is already the king.

650
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:39,470
Bringing that king down again,

651
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,980
is it possible?

652
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,960
I don't really know about things like that.

653
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,580
It's just what the lady wants.

654
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,810
The lady only concerns herself with His Highness.

655
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,420
I'm just following along.

656
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:00,840
Our family barely escaped a disastrous hole that almost wiped all of us out.

657
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,580
Going into that hole again

658
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,190
is scary for me.

659
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,860
I'm scared, too. Our destiny

660
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,150
could fall further downhill from here.

661
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:18,870
But, seeing the prince of this nation suffering makes me more scared.

662
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:16,770
♫   If I just keep walking like this endlessly   ♫

663
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:24,340
♫   It feels like I'll be able to see you   ♫

664
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:32,190
♫   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   ♫

665
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:39,250
♫   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   ♫

666
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:48,630
♫   The weaning and filling up,   ♫

667
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:54,850
♫   how much more do I have to watch it to know?   ♫

668
00:57:54,850 --> 00:58:02,090
♫   I don’t think I can do it anymore, no matter what I blame   ♫

669
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:09,260
♫   But wherever I look, it’s only painful roads for me   ♫

670
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:16,830
♫   The places I want to go to, the places I need to go to   ♫

671
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:24,350
♫   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   ♫

672
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:32,150
♫   I just wanna follow this path to a place no one knows  ♫

673
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:39,170
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

674
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,460
I can't do it anymore.

675
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,680
Today, you must hide someplace far away—

676
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,910
I regret and regret it, that I have made it all the way here holding your hands.

677
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,450
If things fail today, you will die.

678
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,600
I don't regret it.

679
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,000
Even if this life ends today,

680
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,570
I do not regret it.

681
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,990
Still, please return.

682
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,440
I'll be back.

683
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,600
Why are you so surprised?

684
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,660
It's nothing.

685
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,500
Is there a message you must deliver to the queen dowager's palace?

686
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,050
It is not something you need to know about, Chief Royal Secretary.

687
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,430
Eun Seong is saying that he will send in Prince Seung Pyeong today.

688
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,650
Chief Royal Secretary has caught onto something.

689
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,910
He must just feel uncomfortable that I don't discuss matters with him anymore.

690
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:59,070
But, what can we do? We don't even know what will happen after this.

691
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,360
- What's happening?
 - Your Majesty.

692
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,480
I think you should push your plans to leave the palace for another day.

693
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:25,660
What are your reasons?

694
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:33,230
There may be a group with a grudge out to get you on your way there today.

695
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,420
Who would be out to get me?

696
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,120
Do you have a report of treason?

697
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,950
There are widespread rumors that Prince Seung Pyeong and Grand Prince Eun Seong are alive.

698
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:50,020
I do not think it is a time for you to be making a royal visit.

699
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:55,480
It also bothers me that the Commander of Five Guards is taking you today.

700
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,900
Do I need to wear my armor?

701
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:40,050
When you get the message, you will move.

702
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,820
I will trust you with the lady and the former king.

703
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,480
I will come back.

704
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:05,730
No one should get hurt.

705
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:08,190
Lady, don't worry about it.

706
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:13,240
When we return, please prepare something for us to celebrate.

707
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,490
Meat, too.

708
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:22,170
Return safely. We will have a special table prepared for you.

709
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:40,010
Did you wear it?

710
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,810
Don't get hurt.

711
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:19,620
Let's get going.

712
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:51,870
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

713
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,870
♫  In a life together  ♫

714
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:05,710
♫  Living and living  ♫

715
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:12,900
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

716
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:07,330

717
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,480
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
