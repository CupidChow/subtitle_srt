1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,620
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,970
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,820

4
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,360
Who is it?

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,650
Whose order did you receive?

6
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,890
Eun... Eun Seong.

7
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,880
It was Grand Prince Eun Seong's order.

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,120
What were you trying to do?

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,010
If Eun Seong killed Right State Minister Kim Chu and the ministers assisting the young king,

10
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,980
Grand Prince Eun Seong would get the throne.

11
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,460
Your Highness! Are you okay?

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,110
Did you hear?

13
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,430
The lady's husband, my brother! They said he plotted treason.

14
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,650
It cannot be.

15
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,500
Those men are slandering him.

16
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
Excellency!

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,940
Isn't it that you already knew?

18
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,630
What are you doing?

19
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,670
Those men tried to kill me.

20
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,450
I'm asking, weren't you also a part of that?

21
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,020
It is the day of my wedding! It was the day I was to be a bride!

22
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,570
Is there such a ridiculous woman who would willingly fill the happiest day of her life with blood?

23
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,120
Don't be fooled by the tricks of those men.

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,790
Don't you know better than anyone else

25
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,950
that your brother is not that kind of person?

26
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,910
My brother who returned after three years... he was a different person.

27
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,630
That's right. He came back a different person.

28
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,310
He came back with  even more intense feelings of a loyalist.

29
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,080
Take the lady.

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,450
Yes.

31
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,790
Your Highness!

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,410
Let me go! How dare you touch me?

33
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,940
- Lady! 
 - Dad! Mom!

34
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,190
Why are you taking our daughter?

35
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,320
If the words of that rebel are true, then she will be the wife of a traitor.

36
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,860
This household will become the in-laws of a traitor.

37
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,330
Until the situation is settled, you and your family will be protected by my people.

38
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,920
We will protect your daughter.

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,270
- What wrong did our daughter commit? 
 - Let's go to the palace.

40
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,120
If there has been a coup that was staged, then you must go and protect the king.

41
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,900
Do you still not know what's going on?

42
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,170
If Eun Seong is a traitor, it will be the end of your household.

43
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,970
 Dragon Tiger

44
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,310
Let's hurry.

45
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,820
Lady! No, you bastards! Lady!

46
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,320
Don't worry about me! Protect Mother and Father!

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,550
No! Lady!

48
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,120
Kkeut Dan! Kkeut Dan!

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,380
Lady!

50
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,540
Lady!

51
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,430
Kkeut Dan! Kkeut Dan!

52
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,920
Lady!

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Lady! No!

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,360
Lady!

55
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,280
There is a way for you to survive.

56
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,730
If Eun Seong is a traitor, then stand with the opposing side.

57
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,340
You can become a witness and relieve yourself from the snare of crimes.

58
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,160
What are you saying?

59
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,540
I'm saying, depending on your actions,

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,820
your daughter can die as a wife of a traitor

61
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,260
or live on her own as the child of a loyal servant.

62
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,010
Hand him to the Ministry of Justice!

63
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,410
We are going to the palace!

64
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,860
Your Excellency! What is going on?

65
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,390
What will happen to our Ja Hyeon?

66
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,120
Here is his identification as Grand Prince Eun Seong.

67
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,740
A rebellion has started.

68
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,350
Right Minister Kim Chu and Minister of General Affairs Do Hyeon Soo were murdered.

69
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,230
Close the palace door! Don't let anyone in!

70
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,710
Yes, Grand Prince!

71
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,330
The wound is deeper than I thought.

72
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,090
It's what I was hoping for.

73
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,500
Your Highness, there seems to be a fire in the King's pavilion.

74
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,610
Where is the king?

75
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,380
Court Lady Hong is inside with him.

76
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,850
His Majesty's pavilion is filled with smoke.  What are you doing not helping the king escape?

77
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,580
We were trying to figure out where it was coming from.

78
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,230
The court lady said to not move hastily.

79
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Grand Prince!

80
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,780
Your Majesty!

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,080
What are you doing? Why are you here?

82
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,510
Do not do this!

83
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,230
I should've gotten rid of you earlier.

84
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,210
The smoke is drifting in the air and you were helping His Majesty sleep as if nothing had happened?

85
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,130
Do you dare bring danger to His Majesty as Hyungnim's ganja (spy)?

86
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,250
Uncle.

87
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,740
I will take care of you.

88
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,890
Let's go to Changdeok Palace.

89
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,230
We'll inform Mother and the queen of the trouble that has occurred.

90
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,430
What is it?

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,240
It's the rebel. We need to extract a confession about who ordered him.

92
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,480
Drag him in!

93
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,110
You can't enter now.

94
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,620
Grand Prince Eun Seong told us to not let anyone into the palace.

95
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,200
That order came from a rebel.

96
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,550
Grand Prince Eun Seong staged a coup and killed Right State Minister Kim Chu, along with other court ministers.

97
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,180
Quickly inform the queen's palace! The king is in danger.

98
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,470
Please wait.

99
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,020
A person died? Are you saying that at Eun Seong's wedding, a tragedy happened?

100
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,830
Eun Seong's rebels killed all the ministers,

101
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,660
and Jin Yang was hurt by a sword!

102
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,230
Jin Yang got hurt?

103
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,280
They are at the Gunchoo Gate  at the moment, 
(Gunchoo Gate:  eastern gate at the Gyeongbok palace)

104
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,900
and requesting to enter the palace.

105
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,280
Eun Seong has taken the king and closed the gates of the palace.

106
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,640
He must've done that to protect the king.

107
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,450
Are you suspecting Eun Seong right now?!

108
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,790
There was a rebel caught at the scene.

109
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,460
If you interrogate him you will find out the truth.

110
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,070
The only person who can settle this situation is Jin Yang!

111
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,810
Please consider his loyalty based on him running to the palace first even though he was injured.

112
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,390
I will go to the king.

113
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,990
I need to see both Jin Yang and Eun Seong!

114
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,850
- Stop where you are! 
 - Move aside!

115
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,330
Capture Grand Prince Eun Seong, who has raised an army of rebels and killed court ministers!

116
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,140
What nonsense is that?

117
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,980
Give the king over.

118
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,950
The rebels may be aiming for the Gyeongbok palace and the King's pavilion is full of smoke.

119
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,770
Evacuating the king comes first.

120
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,730
We've received an order not to allow anyone to leave the palace.

121
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,420
No one can escape!

122
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,430
I gave the order to close the gates!

123
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,630
Move aside.

124
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,270
- Queen Mother! 
 - What's the matter?

125
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,960
Step back! Get your hands off the king.

126
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,650
Hyung-nim.

127
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,070
We need to arrest Eun Seong.

128
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,190
The rebel captured at the scene has confessed that Eun Seong ordered him.

129
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,680
No, Mother, that is a false accusation!

130
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,730
There's no way Eun Seong did that.

131
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,230
The right state minister died in front of my eyes.

132
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,450
The Minister's of General Affairs lost his life.  Do you not see the injury on my arm?

133
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,360
I almost died there, too!

134
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
What scheme are you spouting?

135
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,450
Let's begin the interrogation and if there is nothing, it's nothing.

136
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,900
I hear we've already gotten a confession.

137
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,320
We should see what he says and look after things based on that.

138
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,120
Even though you are our mother,

139
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,480
if you shelter a traitor, I won't let it go.

140
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,940
Don't you see that the king is shaking?

141
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,450
In front of the king and Queen Mother,

142
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,710
do you want to fight with the soldiers using swords?

143
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,480
Was everything

144
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,900
your plan?

145
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,260
The day of my wedding, seeing blood in front of my bride–

146
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm the one who was hurt by a sword. I want to ask you about

147
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,370
what your purpose was for creating this situation on a day when you were to become a happy husband.

148
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,870
It's not me!

149
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,360
Say it at the royal guards' office.

150
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,020
Pass the king over.

151
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,690
Don't worry about it.

152
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,860
Go on and answer questions.

153
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,700
I trust you.

154
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,270
What are you doing instead of taking Grand Prince Eun Seong?

155
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:28,530

156
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,410
Change into this. I thought you'd be more sad wearing those clothes.

157
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,960
Was this the reason why you wanted me to get married, no matter what?

158
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,170
- Was this it? 
 - You must've seen it clearly with your eyes for sure.

159
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,310
We are not the ones who plotted treason.

160
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,410
It's Grand Prince Eun Seong. Your husband.

161
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,280
His Highness wouldn't do that.

162
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,740
His feelings about this nation, his loyalty to the king...

163
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,800
He'd give his life first.

164
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,790
He's not someone who would cause injury upon others.

165
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,610
He put aside his older brother to become a saejae (king's younger brother as an heir)

166
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,720
and took over the position of Minister of the military out of his ambition.

167
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,010
- It was to save the king! 
 - Nice justification.

168
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,960
Today was the day of our wedding.

169
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,750
Why would a husband cause such a situation on a wedding day? Start saying things that make sense!

170
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,560
If he became king, whether it was ten or nine women, they would be lining up for him.

171
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,170
Is that wedding of yours a big deal?

172
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,660
Poor little thing. You should've listened to me and gotten married to Prince Wol Yeong.

173
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,830
Then, you wouldn't have seen something like today happen.

174
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,630
His Highness has fallen into a trap.

175
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,510
Let's just suppose that was the case.

176
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,180
But, do you know?

177
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,310
You also fell into that trap.

178
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,740
Even though you might be uncomfortable, endure it for a while.

179
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,200
If the grand prince is innocent, you'll be released for sure.

180
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,420
If not, you'll be transferred to a prison.

181
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,770
The wedding clothes are so pretty.

182
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,310
What a shame.

183
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,770
What are you trying to do with me?

184
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:09,560
You won't be able to leave until the interrogation of the witness is done.

185
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,550
Do not even touch

186
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,130
Chief Scholar's daughter!

187
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,150
Your bride

188
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,570
will be protected well by me.

189
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,060
Did you say you were falsely accused? Do you feel that way?

190
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,190
Is that why you feel like your heart might burst?

191
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,790
People have been suspicious of me all of my life.

192
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,770
What do you think it was like for me?

193
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,210
When I was little, I wanted to be like other princes and live in the palace.

194
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,880
I wanted to be

195
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,620
next to Father and Mother.

196
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,760
I didn't even know the face of my younger brother, you.

197
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,060
I envied you so much. Did you know?

198
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,820
So? Are you saying you bred a traitorous mind?

199
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,660
Do you think that's an excuse?

200
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,600
Mother and you people,

201
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,500
the world, the royal family, all suspected me and goaded me!

202
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,710
So, did you decide that you'd make those suspicions come true?

203
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,360
What kind of nonsense is that?

204
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Hand it over.

205
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,700
The dirty evidence that you have against me.

206
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,340
That secretive document that you said you picked up.

207
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,180
You pushed your brother to the edge with that document.

208
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,350
It's not too late to give up.

209
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,160
The king has already risen to the throne.

210
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,990
The royal family, court ministers, and the people

211
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,770
cannot acknowledge an unjustifiable coup.

212
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,810
You must've forgotten.

213
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,270
The person who staged the coup

214
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,360
is not me, but you.

215
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,560
I will give you time to think.  Eunuch Park, whom you love like a brother,

216
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,910
the Orangkae (derogative term for Jurchens) wench you brought from the north,

217
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,280
and even your bride who must be shedding tears as though the sky has fallen.

218
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,170
Those lives

219
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,180
all depend on you.

220
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,860
Do you

221
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,380
really want to kill me that badly?

222
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,780
Am I not even your family?

223
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,780
Not even once

224
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,520
has there been a time where I tried to do something to you with my own hands.

225
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,320
Try to remember.

226
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,320
The person who first pushed me away

227
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,670
was always you.

228
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,500
Protect him well.

229
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,510
Yes, Your Highness!

230
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,720
It's me, Roo Si Gae.

231
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,330
You know me!

232
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,000
Leave. The palace is not open today.

233
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,310
My father passed away?

234
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,340
He was killed by the rebels.

235
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,660
Your Highness!

236
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,870
Mother!

237
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,200
Your Highness!

238
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,530
Mother! Mother! Mother!

239
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,170
Your Highness!

240
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,940
On whose order did you kill the ministers?

241
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,070
We received the order

242
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,820
at Grand Prince Eun Seong's house.

243
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,210
If we killed the ministers on the list,

244
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,670
our lives would be changed forever.

245
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,990
That's the promise he made.

246
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,720
There should not be a trace of a lie in what you say.

247
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,210
That is all I know.

248
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,600
You have to interrogate him and bring all the people involved.

249
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,900
Once you bring everyone involved, you will know the truth.

250
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,870
What group do you belong to?

251
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,120
Name all the people involved.

252
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,560
Make them open their mouths.

253
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,990
Yes!

254
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,620
The man who was brought to the royal palace guards,

255
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,990
has admitted that he was acting on your behalf.

256
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,380
No, that's not it, Mother.

257
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,150
This is a setup. It's a scheme.

258
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,990
I believe you, but someone has died.

259
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,250
And the person who was caught is pointing at you.

260
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,470
It's the scheming of my older brother, who is trying to remove me from the king's side!

261
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,070
Are you saying that Jin Yang has made a plot of treason against you?

262
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,960
He's always been seeking the throne, has he not?

263
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,280
When he got kicked out of the palace without a title, he came up with this scheme,

264
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,290
Since Jin Yang was hurt by a sword and is now professing his patriotism,

265
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,940
the court ministers seem to believe Jin Yang's words.

266
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,270
Do not fall for it, Mother.

267
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,500
You can't go along with it.

268
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,050
If this is a plan Grand Prince Jin Yang  came up with to get you,

269
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,790
even if the truth is uncovered,

270
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,900
I will lose your brother.

271
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,240
No matter whose side I'm on, my suffering

272
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,110
will never end.

273
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,060
Follow him!

274
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:18,070
The other rebels who were caught are all pointing to Grand Prince Eun Seong as the leader.

275
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,640
There is only one way for you to escape this, Your Excellency.

276
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,910
Throw away your son-in-law.

277
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,850
Then, your family can live.

278
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,550
Your son who has a bright future ahead of him,

279
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,720
and your unfortunate daughter are whom you should think of.

280
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,670
Grand Prince Eun Seong is not the type of person to do such a thing.

281
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,900
It was three years.

282
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,720
Amongst those animal-like Orangkaes,

283
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
he was whipped and lived as a slave.

284
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,900
During that time, what thoughts would've gone through his mind? How would he have endured all of that?

285
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,620
How badly would he have resented the court ministers and the royal family who had all sent him there?

286
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,690
Even though we might not know for sure, he's probably full of the desire for revenge.

287
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,630
His anger and grudges are probably piercing the Heavens right now.

288
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,460
Control of the military was given to a person like that.

289
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,060
People do change.

290
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,010
If it's too late, it's useless.

291
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,970
Now that everything is over, even if you confess to everything,

292
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,470
you will have to be punished accordingly, and your household will be destroyed.

293
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:49,290
You should not delay even by an hour. That's how you can live.

294
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,470
With or without your help, Eun Seong dies.

295
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,600
But without your help, your family members will die!

296
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,730
If it were me, as the head of the household, I'd save my family.

297
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,760
Let's go.

298
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,820
Your Excellency!

299
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,460
It's a relief that you are safe.

300
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,750
Where did you get hurt, and how much?

301
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,000
Where's the bride?

302
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,880
Let's get you treated first. I'll call the doctors.

303
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,460
I've already been treated at the palace. I need to see the bride.

304
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,470
Did you lock up the bride?

305
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,340
She didn't even commit any wrongdoings. How could you treat her like that?

306
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,690
She is the woman of the person who committed a crime.

307
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,960
Is it not natural that her treatment would change with the changing circumstances?

308
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,940
It's not like we brought Ja Hyeon here to treat her like our superior.

309
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,150
We brought the daughter to appease the chief scholar.

310
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,100
If he knew how his daughter was treated under our care,

311
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,580
I bet he'd be so thankful, right?

312
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,250
Bring her to the guesthouse. I'll meet her there.

313
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,760
Come out.

314
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,070
I said, come out.

315
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,580
You can leave, my wife.

316
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,740
- Your Excellency. 
 - There is something I must talk about with the bride.

317
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,920
I'll leave.

318
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,790
Just stay.

319
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,260
Your bridal clothes fit you very well.

320
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,870
What will happen to His Highness? Where is he?

321
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,280
Is he safe?

322
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,010
He is safe and well at the palace.

323
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,220
Why did you bring me here?

324
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,570
Please return me home.

325
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,340
Your father trusted me with you, Lady.

326
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,650
Being by my side will bring you the greatest safety.

327
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,170
My family is worried about me. I'll return.

328
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,670
What do you think your position is now?

329
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,450
Are you Eun Seong's bride because you're wearing those wedding clothes,

330
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,430
or since the tragedy struck before the ceremony happened,

331
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,120
do you consider yourself unmarried?

332
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,120
Depending on how your life changes in the slightest,

333
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,910
it could mean your life or death.

334
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,010
I am His Highness' bride.

335
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,550
It was decided a long time ago.

336
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,570
He will lose his life.

337
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,790
I already know what the pain is like when you're left all alone.

338
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,870
If we die together, it'll be a blessing.

339
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,210
Your words are right.

340
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,680
Dying might be a better option.

341
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,120
Should the precious daughter of a noble family

342
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,050
become a slave that gets taunted by every man and does hard labor with those delicate hands,

343
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,970
it will be no different than living in hell.

344
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,520
Are you threatening me right now?

345
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,170
I'm giving you an opportunity.

346
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,090
Abandon Eun Seong.

347
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,720
Then, you can live, Lady.

348
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,200
I'd rather die with him.

349
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,730
It's not something you can take on by yourself.

350
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,440
Don't you know that a traitor's family suffers for three generations?

351
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,430
One word from you will determine the life and death of your family.

352
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,360
His Highness has not done anything wrong.

353
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,610
Your father and older brother will die.

354
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,230
Your mother will become a slave just like you.

355
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,880
Your family will be scattered throughout the eight regions of the country.

356
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,380
Until they die, you will all be separated for your whole lives.

357
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,670
I don't know what you have done,

358
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,640
but the truth will be uncovered in the not too distant future.

359
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,930
By then, it'll be too late.

360
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,520
If your feelings change, call me whenever.

361
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,450
I will protect

362
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,870
you and your family with all that I have.

363
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,530
You may enter.

364
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,160
 Fear of Ouster Notification by Chief Scholar Seong Eok.

365
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,950
Your Excellency! What are you doing?

366
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,090
Get down.  Get down, quickly! Quickly!

367
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,360
Is there nobody out there?

368
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,360
Every one of the captured criminals

369
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,540
are pointing at you as the prime suspect.

370
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,950
- They are all people I'm seeing for the first time. I've never met them before. 
 - That little...

371
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,150
We were taken to your family and received the retainer fee.

372
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,680
A lady who was covering her face gave a list out of all the court ministers to get rid of on wedding day.

373
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,280
That house is regulated by my brother.

374
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,890
Ask my brother about who was allowed to come in and out of that house.

375
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,260
He also prepared the gift chests that were filled with the weapons.

376
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,630
Did you set up a trap to hide all your wrongdoings like this?

377
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,220
Did you not say that you were preparing the gift chests

378
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,340
so that you could give your best to the bride?

379
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,630
That's a lie, all of it!

380
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,460
Hyung-nim!

381
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:59,960
- What is this?  
 - This is the document that reports the act of treason, written by Chief Scholar, who couldn't be here today.

382
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,140
 Gobyeonsa:  a document that testifies the treasonous actions.

383
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,420
He realized Hwi's ambition quickly.

384
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,950
Due to being busy with his efforts in looking after his daughter's wedding,

385
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,090
he was not able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.

386
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,450
That's his confession.

387
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,010
 Gobyeonseo: a document containing charges and accusations of  a treasonous plot, in this case, it's one that's masterminded by Grand Prince Hwi.

388
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,820
What are you saying? Why would Chief Scholar say that?

389
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,140
That was Chief Scholar's suicide note.

390
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,730
From the guilt that he couldn't stop his son-in-law, he wrote that and was going to commit suicide.

391
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,200
That disaster was barely avoided.

392
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,300
He's on the brink of death.

393
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,570
Do you know now?

394
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,260
As you keep resisting, the number of people who get hurt will keep increasing.

395
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,170
Right now it's Chief Scholar,

396
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,390
but what about Lady Ja Hyeon, who escaped to my house?

397
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,270
What if her thinking goes awry and she commits suicide or something?

398
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,150
What will you do then?

399
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,550
I told you not to

400
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,960
mess with my wife!

401
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,250
We're doing our best to protect her.

402
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,060
Since her sadness is profound,

403
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,180
don't you think she'll make the same choice as her father?

404
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm worried about it.

405
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:47,570
Just because he's a royal family member, we can't treat a traitor differently.

406
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,490
Until his punishment is rendered,

407
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,050
we'll have to keep him locked up.

408
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,620
It's been a long time that he's been thinking treasonously,

409
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,880
but I'm guilty of not seeing that out of my brotherly feelings,

410
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,330
and wasn't able to stop him from doing such an evil thing.

411
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,990
I am going to be punished for my own wrongdoing.

412
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,150
Take the criminal to the prison.

413
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,680
Yes, sir!

414
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,140
It's a setup! It's not the truth!

415
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,950
I'm not a traitor!

416
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,440
Let me go! Let go! Let go! Hyung-nim!

417
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,730
 Let me go! Let go!

418
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,740
 I'm not a traitor!

419
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,620
Chief Scholar committed suicide?

420
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,200
We were barely able to save him after he tried to hang himself.

421
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,360
But, he left his report about the treason as his suicide note.

422
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,950
It said that Grand Prince Eun Seong was breeding a traitorous mind.

423
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,660
Your Highness.

424
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,920
What is your thought on this?

425
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,740
Did Eun Seong do it?

426
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,760
Is it Jin Yang's scheming?

427
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,620
Grand Prince Eun Seong isn't the type of person to do that,

428
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,900
but since the evidence is so clear, I don't know what to do.

429
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,300
No matter how much we torture the rebels,

430
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,650
they do not change their statement that Grand Prince Eun Seong started it.

431
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,110
At a time when his life is on the line,

432
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,840
there is not one person whose word differs from the other.

433
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,190
There is not a lot that Right Minister can do.

434
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,840
Your Highness.

435
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,530
Your Highness, who in the world...

436
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,870
Are you hurt anywhere? How are you feeling?

437
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,360
Keep your mind focused.  We've endured through worse than this.

438
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,640
We will definitely get through this.

439
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,380
Grand Prince has

440
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,840
planned all this to hurt you, right?

441
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,530
His goal isn't to hurt his younger brother, but

442
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,290
it is to become the king.

443
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,310
I am someone who is standing in the way of his plan.

444
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,860
When we were fighting in the north, the enemy was someone we had to kill,

445
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:33,050
but now, we can't kill the enemy even though we know who they are.

446
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,400
Even though I

447
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,720
went through such  time of struggle,

448
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,410
out of love for the people,

449
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:54,070
I couldn't give up on the love of my blood family.

450
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:59,410
I was foolish.

451
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,230
Would anyone ever

452
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,430
have imagined this?

453
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,060
Would they have dreamed this?

454
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,360
That on the day that a person's younger brother was getting married,

455
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,640
he'd have people killed at the bride's house

456
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,130
to frame his own brother as a traitor?

457
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,830
You were not the one who was foolish.

458
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,440
Grand Prince Jin Yang is the one who's evil.

459
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,630
He is not human.

460
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,180
I had false hope.

461
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,420
Since we were family,

462
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,450
since we had grown up together, that he was still human, after all.

463
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,270
I thought, no way, he wouldn't have done that. He couldn't.

464
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,300
Even after suffering through that, I could not throw away

465
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,680
the small bit of feeling for my hyungnim

466
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,610
and caused the death of Ministers of Right and General Affairs.

467
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:56,040
I caused the court ministers to die.

468
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,690
It's not your fault, Your Highness!

469
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,760
My wife.

470
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:08,660
My Ja Hyeon. What should I do?

471
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,980
Come out.

472
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,440
I will take you home.

473
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:03,490
Don't worry. It means you can return now.

474
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,090
You and your family will be safe now.

475
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,430
Take the lady back home.

476
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,940
Yes.

477
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,780
Please get into the palanquin.

478
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,800
I can walk there.

479
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,290
You're still wearing your wedding clothes.

480
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,510
If you go out like that, everyone will look at you.

481
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,490
That's alright.

482
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,800
Follow her quietly.

483
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,340
Come back after you've seen that she has gone home safely.

484
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,330
Yes, Your Highness.

485
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,850
She has always been shameless and fearless.

486
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,300
Do not worry about it.

487
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:04,170
In order for us to accomplish the great cause,

488
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,770
we need to appease that woman.

489
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,900
Is that really the only reason?

490
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,960
Even if it's not,

491
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,840
do not question the actions of your husband.

492
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,100
I will not explain or make excuses about

493
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,420
my actions to you ever again.

494
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,270
I also

495
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,420
put my family reputation on the line for this.

496
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,990
My brother also.

497
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,370
When I put my family at risk of being destroyed altogether,

498
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,320
should you be treating me so carelessly?

499
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,630
Was it really for me?

500
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,690
Not out of the greed to be the mother of the nation (the queen)?

501
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,510
Was it solely for me that you put your life on the line?

502
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,450
I will respect the formalities.

503
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,410
You will not see me throw away my one and only wife,

504
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,480
so just follow me without creating all that fuss.

505
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,850
I will get going now.

506
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,450
- Roo Si Gae. 
 - Where's Hwi?

507
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,690
The palace isn't letting me go in.

508
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,940
No one's at the grand prince's house, either.

509
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,070
Where did Hwi go?

510
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,200
Dying would be better.

511
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,720
What is this thing that you did just for us to live?

512
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,440
What do we do with Ja Hyeon?

513
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,830
Don't tell Ja Hyeon for now.

514
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:21,930
If she finds out that Grand Prince Eun Seong dies because of her father, she will not let it be.

515
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,670
You shouldn't think about anything else, Your Excellency.

516
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,700
We have to be alive to pay back.  Dying is the most cowardly thing to do.

517
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,180
Look for a way to straighten everything out.

518
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,700
We don't know if Grand Prince is purely innocent.

519
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:44,820
All of the witnesses are pointing at him as the traitor.

520
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:49,610
Grand Prince Jin Yang is the one who's been accused of wrongdoing all along.

521
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:53,590
Our son-in-law was just trying his best to protect his late older brother and his nephew.

522
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:56,300
Our son-in-law, you say? Be careful with your words.

523
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,740
To us, Ja Hyeon has not yet gone through with the marriage.

524
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:07,790
Madam, the lady has arrived! Lady Ja Hyeon has come back!

525
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,960
Mother.

526
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,310
Did you eat?

527
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,140
Let's get you out of these clothes.

528
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,340
My daughter, why is it so hard to send you off to get married even once?

529
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,090
Did you hear about what happened to His Highness?

530
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,580
What did the palace say?

531
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,920
Where did you meet her?

532
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,880
Why did you bring her here?

533
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,880
In Grand Prince's absence, we need to look after her.

534
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,100
Where is Father? Is he back?

535
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,300
Is he home?

536
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,300
He's not feeling well.

537
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,060
Change your clothes and eat first. You can meet your father later on.

538
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,280
Did he get hurt that day? Where?

539
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,250
It's not like that.

540
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,300
Let's go quickly.

541
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,630
Let's wash it and iron it well.

542
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:05,800
One day, I will wear these clothes again.

543
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,930
I will bow in front of the grand prince,

544
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:13,750
and he will take off my bridal headpiece in our newlywed's bedroom.

545
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,780
We will then all forget all of these terrible memories.

546
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,980
Don't cry.

547
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,420
I don't care about what happens to Grand Prince Eun Seong.

548
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,900
It doesn't matter.

549
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:38,130
I just feel so bad for you, my lady.

550
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,560
What do we do now, my lady?

551
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,380
He will get himself out of these false accusations.

552
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,650
The truth is always strong.

553
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,280
I know.

554
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,750
Right Minister had faith in Grand Prince Eun Seong,

555
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,420
and asked that he be the Minister of Defense.

556
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,810
He was not satisfied with that position.

557
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,310
He knew he couldn't succeed in his rebellion without getting rid of Minister Kim Chu.

558
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,000
That's why he aimed at his own wedding when no one would be on their guard.

559
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,910
That's not something a human being would do.

560
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,890
He told me himself that he lived like an animal.

561
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,830
It was not a month or a year. It was for three years.

562
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,660
During that time, Eun Seong changed.

563
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:37,560
We are receiving endless petitions for the death of  Eun Seong from the scholars.

564
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,080
We are in a state of emergency due to the rebellion.

565
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,740
If it drags on, we don't know what'll happen next

566
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,560
since it's true that the king is young...

567
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,330
What are you telling me to do? I cannot kill my son with my bare hands.

568
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,020
I will protect the king.

569
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,520
Give me the position of prime minister.

570
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,330
If not the position where we can settle the grievances from the thousands,

571
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,460
we will not be able to control the unrest of the rebellion.

572
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,870
Can you promise me that you won't want anything more after that?

573
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,480
I'm asking you if you'll be satisfied with the position of prime minister.

574
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,770
We will punish the treason, and protect His Majesty.

575
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,530
If you see another path you can follow, please take that one.

576
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:27,890
Right now, I'm telling you the best that I can offer you.

577
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:41,210
Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang having put to rest all of the rebellious actions,

578
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,160
and having accomplished many good deeds with his generous effort and good will,

579
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,010
and wisdom and courage,

580
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,390
is hereby appointed as Prime Minister.

581
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:54,730
Along with Yoon Ja Jung who's newly appointed as Minister of Defense,

582
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,030
please protect His Majesty with your utmost loyalty.

583
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:02,130
Your graciousness knows no bounds.

584
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,860
Acknowledge the fact that it was a plot of treason that you came up with.

585
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,600
Chief Scholar has reported the treason for the sake of his daughter.

586
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,210
You have to acknowledge in order for that lady to become a daughter of the witness,

587
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,640
and prevent her being destroyed along with you.

588
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,460
If you continue to be stubborn,

589
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,160
the lady will become the wife of a traitor

590
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,510
and not be able to avoid becoming a slave.

591
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,650
I told you not to mess with my wife!

592
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,720
If you insist that she is your wife,

593
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,630
don't you think that it'll become more dangerous for her?

594
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,620
Make a choice. Save the lady and die,

595
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,100
or you both die in hell.

596
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,800
I know there are no such documents.

597
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,590
If you had picked up evidence, you wouldn't have come this far.

598
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:54,930
Still, that doesn't mean that

599
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,890
your actions will simply disappear.

600
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,870
You want me to let go of His Highness?

601
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,890
You have to do that for our household to survive.

602
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:18,260
It's pretty clear that Eun Seong committed treason.

603
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,270
It's obvious that he'll be put to death by poison. Then we'll all die.

604
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:25,460
Because of your love play, does our whole family and household have to die off?

605
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,020
Come to your senses. Our parents are sitting on pins and needles all day.

606
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:32,480
When will you stop obsessing and crying over a man?

607
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,080
He was falsely accused. We have to at least try and save his life!

608
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,450
Because of you, Father–!

609
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,270
If you want to die, die by yourself. Don't drag our whole family down with you.

610
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,350
  If your feelings change, Lady, call me whenever.

611
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,420
  I will do my best for you and your family, Lady.

612
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,860
Your contribution was great in our latest effort.

613
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,850
Every one of them confessed that it was Grand Prince Eun Seong's doing.

614
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,910
In front of the man on top, everyone gets down on their knees.

615
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:33,280
I just made them believe everything to be the truth.

616
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,950
 List of names and designations of seven government officials.

617
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:37,810
  This is a list of all the people you must get rid of.

618
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:42,290
 Right Minister Kim Chu, Minister Do Hyeon Soo.

619
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,180
  What do I do with Grand Prince Jin Yang?

620
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,740
  So that no one suspects anything, attack both grand princes.

621
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,720
  Don't kill them.

622
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,260
  Grand Prince Jin Yang must live and receive the punishment.

623
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,900
  What about Chief Scholar Seong Eok?

624
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,080
  There was an order to not harm the wife and her family.

625
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,580
  He probably wants to protect the wife and her family, right?

626
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,590
 If they act as security for Grand Prince Eun Seong,

627
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:07,510
 it will be easy to get onto the premises if you carry the wedding gift chests.

628
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,180
 It is the wish of Grand Prince Jin Yang that we go in as the groom's entourage.

629
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,690
  If you tell the groom you need to prepare something for him he will trust and let you do it.

630
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:21,390
  If the rebellion fails,

631
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:25,280
  Grand Prince Eun Seong's name shouldn't slip out.

632
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,590
  But, if you succeed, the world is yours.

633
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,090
There's still more to go.

634
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,620
Don't let down your guard.

635
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:52,170
What I desire is not wealth, do you not know?

636
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:57,660
I don't want you to misunderstand but I have enough wealth.

637
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,590
Do you want the spot of royal concubine?

638
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,640
My lifelong grudge is in being a low caste.

639
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,850
Please allow me to live a new life

640
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,510
with the new power you will soon have.

641
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,190
You want to become noble.

642
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,950
Keep what I have given you already.

643
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,330
There is a lot you will need to do.

644
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,680
I can wait.

645
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,640
There's something I must tell you.

646
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,000
Do you have a request to make?

647
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,870
Since you remembered my promise, I'm thankful.

648
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,520
It's related to Grand Prince Eun Seong.

649
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:18,750
I'd be concerned if it's related to you and your family.

650
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,610
He's your younger brother, not a stranger.

651
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,820
But Eun Seong

652
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,510
treated me like a stranger all his life.

653
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:35,680
Never has he shown me honesty or believed in me.

654
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,930
Just because I am his brother,

655
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,030
am I to be in one-sided love relationship with him?

656
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:46,390
Brotherly love must be

657
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:49,360
won after both parties work on it.

658
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,220
It's not good enough for one person to do.

659
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,300
Please let him live.

660
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,180
If you let him live, I won't ask for anything else.

661
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,550
We will live together on an island far away, never leave for our whole life,

662
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,610
just the two of us.

663
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:17,440
Then, what will you give me, Lady?

664
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,910
Do you have something amazing

665
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:25,780
that could be traded for Eun Seong's life?

666
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:41,260
Lady, I'm asking you what you can offer me.

667
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:56,010

668
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:03,500
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

669
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:10,530
♫   In a life together   ♫

670

  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
 Episode 12 Preview

671
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:18,060
  Let us not give up, no matter what happens. Believe in me.

672
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,690
  Remember this clearly. Your household killed Grand Prince Eun Seong.

673
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,720
  Once we take care of Eun Seong with his exile,

674
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,200
  we will have to cut off mother's limbs one at a time.

675
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,500
  What are you going to do with Hwi? How are you going to save him?

676
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,020
  Come see me when you are ready to make a deal with me.

677
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,810
  This is now Grand Prince Jin Yang's world.

678
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:39,430
  With what determination did you get on the palanquin all the way here?

679
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,920
  Do you still want me?

680
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,020
 I will offer all of me.

681
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,520
