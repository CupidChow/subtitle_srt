1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,610
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:40,080

3
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,050
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,590
 Episode 13

5
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,340
Two people to Ganghwado, please.

6
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,720
I want at least five nyang for that.

7
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,990
I'll give you what'd you like for the fare. Just, please, take us.

8
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,020
Okay, then. Get in.

9
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,080
Oh, she hasn't finished her Buddhist prayer yet.

10
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,660
Even if she were doing the 108 bows (Buddhist praying ritual), she would've done it ten times by now.

11
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,870
How can she take the whole day!

12
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,140
Oh, no, you can't!

13
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,270
Lady, let's go. The sun will set soon.

14
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,460
Oh, yes.

15
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,800
You two...

16
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,150
It's not the lady!

17
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,590
In the north, all we could do was hunt.  It's much better being on an island.

18
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,220
We can even fish.

19
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,760
I hear outsiders are not allowed here. I hope we're not too big a burden on you, Grand Prince.

20
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,950
Didn't you hear?  They do allow some slaves.

21
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,080
Just tell them we are all your slaves.

22
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,640
Right, Gi Teuk?

23
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,420
We won't be here for long.

24
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,960
Let's get out of this place.

25
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,050
You'll escape?

26
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,380
We managed to escape from the jaws of the vicious Jurchens.

27
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,080
Couldn't we find a way in our land in our own country?

28
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,830
But, it  took you three years.

29
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,760
Don't you think waiting is better?

30
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,300
When your exile ends, some time—

31
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,740
Would my older brother truly let me be free?

32
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,830
Can my mother alone block the attacks of my brother and my uncle,

33
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,210
and protect the throne of the young king?

34
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,340
But... What could you do if you escaped as a criminal?

35
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,760
I can't go there as a criminal. They'd just run after me.

36
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,720
Right?

37
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
I need to get my freedom.

38
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,570
You want to say that Grand Prince Eun Seong already tried to escape.

39
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,980
And that he died while on the run from the guards?

40
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,450
To do that, we will have to get him to leave the premises.

41
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,650
If we attack, he'll try to escape first.

42
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,740
We need to figure out his escape route and set a trap in between.

43
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,560
We get rid of him and report him as an escapee.

44
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,890
We will take care of the business in the capital.

45
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,120
Did Grand Prince Jin Yang approve of this?

46
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,680
Once this mission is complete, you'll be called to the capital.

47
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,520
If the son is able to fill the position vacated by his father,

48
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,630
would it not please the spirit of your deceased father who died in pain?

49
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,620
Did you help a woman cross the river today?

50
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,960
She's a young woman.  Could be in a disguise.

51
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,220
There are so many customers coming and going.

52
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,110
How would I know who's who?

53
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,260
It's so dark that I can't go any further.

54
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,190
We can't stop.  We are in a hurry.

55
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,590
People need to sleep at night.

56
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,580
It's too hard to be rowing deprived of sleep.

57
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,970
If you give me more for the fare, then maybe...

58
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,260
What I gave you earlier is all I have.

59
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,760
With that much, we can only go this far.

60
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,750
Get off. I know how to row.

61
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,290
I don't need you. Just get off.

62
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,700
We are on the water. How can I get off?

63
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,170
That's none of my business. Get off.

64
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,090
I thought you guys were customers, but you're thieves.

65
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,620
Why are you trying to steal my boat?

66
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,770
You...

67
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,450
Ow, ow!

68
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,370
Ouch!

69
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,080
- Oh, my. 
 - Do you want to get off, or do you want to keep going?

70
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,720
Oh.

71
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,100
I'll take you there.

72
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,560
Oh, my.

73
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,480
Roo Si Gae, you're pretty good.

74
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,120
At Korean?

75
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,970
She wasn't even at the Mapo Ferry?

76
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,050
No, Your Excellency.

77
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,530
Her destination is most likely Gyodong Island.

78
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,920
- Go and bring her. 
 - Yes.

79
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,120
If you lose her again,

80
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,900
you won't live.

81
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
Ja Hyeon went where?

82
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,260
Madame!

83
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:09,680
You're telling me she followed him all the way over there?

84
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm sorry, Madame.

85
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,980
Why are you like this, Kkeut Dan?

86
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,790
This isn't like looking around a polo arena or out looking at flowers for  a bit.

87
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,530
How could you go along with it?

88
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,000
I was afraid

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,490
that Lady would die.

90
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,050
I'm sorry, Madame.

91
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,500
Let's let go of her.

92
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,780
In this Seong household, let's let go of her.

93
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,630
Mother.

94
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,980
We can't do what she likes.

95
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,930
She can't live here.

96
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,100
We have nothing to do but to end our relations with her.

97
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
Lady will return!

98
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,880
She didn't say she'd be living there.

99
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,580
She said she'd return!

100
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,410
We don't have a daughter now.

101
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,510
Mother, I'll go and find her. She probably hasn't gotten far yet.

102
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,030
Don't concern yourself with her.

103
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,000
She's a stranger now.

104
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Madame! Madame!

105
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,420
No one is here. I think he caught on and ran away.

106
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,640
He's there! Catch him!

107
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,240
How does one stay alive?

108
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,810
Hey, hey!

109
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,730
We will lure them away.

110
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,520
Follow them!

111
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,460
Did my brother send you here?

112
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,610
I will avenge the death of my father.

113
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,200
I cannot see anything. I'll have to confirm his corpse.

114
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,350
Since the tide is going out right now, when the tide comes in tomorrow morning, his corpse will be there on the beach.

115
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,890
If you must confirm right now, you can jump in and fish him out.

116
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,370
Wait here.

117
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,150
Found him!

118
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,460
It's hard to recognize the grand prince's face.

119
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,400
When the corpse was coming in to the shore, it was damaged.

120
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,450
It's the same spot where we pierced him.

121
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,520
The clothes are the same, too.

122
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,600
Take care of the body!

123
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,190
Yes, sir!

124
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,450
Stop.

125
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,390
Lady.

126
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,570
Do not look.

127
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,290
Whose corpse is it?

128
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,610
Where's the grand prince?

129
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,700
I heard that he was in exile on this island.

130
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,810
I need to see his face to make sure he's safe.

131
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,620
Who are you?

132
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,300
Who are you to be asking about the life of a criminal?

133
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,990
Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi has died.

134
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,300
While being a criminal, he pushed his luck trying to escape this island.

135
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,390
He ended up like this.

136
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,250
Reveal your identity.

137
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,160
Are you on his side? Did you plan in advance to take him off the island?

138
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,530
Stop. I will take care of her.

139
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,950
Is this really Hwi?

140
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,350
The clothes that His Highness wore...

141
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,930
Lady!

142
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,260
Your Highness! In the food, this poison...

143
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,200
Inform her that I have arrived. I need to speak to Queen Mother.

144
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,880
Your Highness, Grand Prince Jin Yang has arrived.

145
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,160
Inform her again.

146
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,030
- Your Highness. 
 - Let him come in.

147
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,400
Your Majesty!

148
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,390
What are you doing? The king!

149
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,900
Protect the king! Protect him!

150
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,860
Look around!

151
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,880
What's the matter, so early in the morning?

152
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,350
Do not be shocked, please.

153
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,670
I came here myself because I was worried about you.

154
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,060
We have received a report from Gyodong Island.

155
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,430
Is Eun Seong ill?

156
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,850
He died.

157
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,250
He acted unreasonably rashly and tried to escape

158
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,020
and died from an arrow shot by one of the guards.

159
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,070
They say he fell into the water and drowned.

160
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,770
Queen Mother.

161
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,590
No, this happened before, too.

162
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,510
Eun Seong, who had supposedly died, came back after three years.

163
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,270
He's not someone who can die that easily.

164
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,820
There was a corpse.

165
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,970
It's a different case this time around.

166
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,080
Eun Seong's death

167
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,790
is an unmistakable truth.

168
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,950
No it's not! My son...

169
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,450
My son has not died!

170
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,500
You and I made great efforts to try and save his life.

171
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,030
My young brother could not even stay still on that island where he went into exile.

172
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,480
He brought tragedy upon himself.

173
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,580
Were you waiting for this?

174
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,230
You waited for your older brother to die

175
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,700
and you killed your younger brother.

176
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,780
Queen Mother!

177
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,930
Now, all that's left is for you to kill me, your mother.

178
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:40,190
Then, you can do whatever you want with the eight regions of Joseon!

179
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,380
Grand Prince Eun Seong

180
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,970
has died?

181
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,240
Please compose yourself, Your Highness.

182
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,580
Who is even alive anymore?

183
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,110
Who will protect my son and me?

184
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,460
Are you thinking of Grand Prince Eun Seong?

185
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,500
I will

186
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,610
not think of anyone.

187
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,240
I will not miss anyone.

188
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,930
I will not regret anything.

189
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,500
Please stop.

190
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,990
It's the grand prince.

191
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,320
Is it okay for the funeral of royalty to be done in this manner?

192
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,700
He isn't royalty. This is the funeral of a criminal.

193
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,030
It's a custom to bury an exiled person at the place of their exile.

194
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,860
Use a coffin, at least.

195
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,290
I will prepare a coffin.

196
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,700
- Put him in! 
 - Yes, sir!

197
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,180
You can't! You can't!

198
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,280
Don't look.  Let's go.

199
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,220
I won't watch this.

200
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:12,260
That's not Hwi. It can't be.

201
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,050
You must leave. The boat will leave soon.

202
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,220
Even though Grand Prince Eun Seong died, we lost the rest of them.

203
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,670
We need to catch them all.

204
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,980
We'll deal with that ourselves.

205
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,580
It's an island. Without a boat, there's no way for them to leave.

206
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,920
With their leader dead, if they surrender, we will make them slaves.

207
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,230
- If they continue on, we can slay them.
 - Gi Teuk.

208
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,140
Don't you worry about it and go back to the capital.

209
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,910
What happened to the barbarian girl?

210
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,580
Find her!

211
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,820
Please give it all to Grand Prince Jin Yang, Queen Mother!

212
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,110
I lost my brother and my father.

213
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,620
But I was hanging on.

214
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,340
But, I cannot live if I lose my child.

215
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,750
The king is not just your son.

216
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,920
He is the one and only royal line of this country.

217
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,960
He is a king who has already risen to the throne.

218
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
Please give the throne to his uncle!

219
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
I am scared.

220
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,900
Please save my son and me.

221
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,950
Your Highness!

222
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,800
The king's royal meal had poison in it.

223
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,770
A tile fell from the path that the king was walking through.

224
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,240
Uncle's spies are everywhere.

225
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,870
I do not feel safe about what he dresses in, what he eats and drinks...

226
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,050
Living like this isn't living.

227
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,590
I'm sorry to say this to you, who have lost your children.

228
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,950
I do not want to suffer through the same things as you, Your Highness.

229
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,360
I have seen too many deaths already,

230
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,800
and I have lost too many relatives.

231
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,260
Please save my son!

232
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,380
Don't you know that he would be in more danger

233
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
if he vacates the throne?

234
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,170
I'll have to ask a favor of his uncle.

235
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,100
I'll give him the throne, so I'll ask that he protects my son's life.

236
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,570
Come to your senses!

237
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,070
Do you think your position is like every other mother?

238
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,060
I lost my husband, too.

239
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,230
I lost two of my sons.

240
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,740
Do you think I don't know what sadness is?

241
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,800
Do you think I was never in pain?

242
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,220
Queen Mother!

243
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,500
Rather than the pain of a mother,

244
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,350
the spot as the queen came first.

245
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,460
I suppressed my feelings

246
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,030
and thought of my duty as I lived.

247
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,710
I am not you, Your Highness.

248
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,260
I cannot do that.

249
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,470
Your Highness!

250
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,000
I am just a mother.

251
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,160
I could not even be a proper daughter or younger sister.

252
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,740
I made them all die!

253
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,980
I must at least be a proper mother.

254
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,790
Please take away my spot as the mother of the nation (queen).

255
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,970
I dislike the throne of a queen and queen mother!

256
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,130
I will only be a mother to my child!

257
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,780
Have a safe return.

258
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,300
Let's go.

259
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,260
Is he really the person whose younger brother died?

260
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,490
Why's he like that?

261
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,650
He's sad.

262
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,620
Even if he's happy, he doesn't know how to enjoy it.

263
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,860
When he's sad, he doesn't know how to cry.

264
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,350
He's crying with his whole body like that.

265
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,800
One who knows the feeling of the queen regent

266
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,860
is you, Royal Secretary.

267
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,910
Eun Seong died while in exile.

268
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,940
The queen goes to the queen regent's palace daily

269
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,440
to make a fuss about giving up her son's throne.

270
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,110
Isn't it good for everything to flow the way it was meant to?

271
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,700
Natural flow?

272
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,860
Hasn't it been following the natural flow all along?

273
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,140
Listen to what the people are saying.

274
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,830
To have a baby king after the previous king who was ill?

275
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,800
It hasn't been long since the unrest in the north was settled.

276
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,070
Don't you hear the concern of the people who worry about another rebellion?

277
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,500
Do you not hear it?

278
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,340
When you have someone who's prepared to be the king,

279
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,440
what's the point of taking the rough road?

280
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,520
If you, the chief royal secretary, give your power and support to Jin Yang,

281
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,150
won't it be an honor to carry on with your power through the maternal side of the family?

282
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,220
What do you mean power through the maternal side of the family?

283
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,960
I was just worried about the future of the country.

284
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,850
Think back to Kim Chu's last days.

285
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,760
While supporting the wrong king, he had a violent death.

286
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,520
Think about it carefully.

287
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,060
A momentary decision can mean life or death,

288
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,040
honor or humiliation.

289
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,720
Lady!

290
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,200
Lady!

291
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,890
Where are you going?

292
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,320
Madame.

293
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,930
Since the moment you left without my permission,

294
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,150
you couldn't care less about all my organs shriveling (from worrying).

295
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,520
Ever since you started to follow that man around,

296
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,340
you haven't been a daughter of this household.

297
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,950
We are not accepting you here.

298
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,000
Mother, scold her inside.

299
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,120
Listen well, everyone.

300
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,290
If anyone lets Ja Hyeon into the home,

301
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,730
you'll be sent away, too!

302
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,960
She is greatly shocked right now. Let her come in.

303
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,870
Grand Prince Eun Seong has died on the island of his exile.

304
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,400
Lady confirmed it herself.

305
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,940
Why did you go there?

306
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,750
Why would you go and see such a harsh sight?

307
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,300
How will you live now?

308
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,330
How will you live with that memory?

309
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Is that true?

310
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,850
Is it true that Grand Prince Eun Seong died while in exile?

311
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,340
Instead of repenting over there,

312
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,660
he was shot by an arrow while escaping with his treasonous mind.

313
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,230
Had he lived quietly, he would've been pardoned eventually and could return.

314
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,760
A person who gets a treasonous mind once does not know how to give up.

315
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,030
Grand Prince Eun Seong is your nephew, just as Grand Prince Jin Yang is.

316
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,110
How come you only protect Grand Prince Jin Yang?

317
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,380
How could you be so harsh to his younger brother Grand Prince Eun Seong?

318
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,090
Even his mother and father favored the eldest and the youngest son only and isolated Jin Yang.

319
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,720
I, at least, must treat him warmly.

320
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,460
Are you satisfied?

321
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,820
A nephew who has grown up to be a monster, and his younger brother who died a violent death.

322
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,890
Are you satisfied watching all of that now?

323
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,960
Did you think the king's throne is for a mere human being?

324
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,190
That spot was once mine,

325
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,720
but I could see it when I lost it.

326
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,800
A mere human spirit cannot fulfill the role,

327
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,300
so I raised him to be strong,

328
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,090
to give sympathy to the dogs (throw away feelings).

329
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,740
He needs a cold heart and burning ambition.

330
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,200
That's the only way.

331
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,670
Grand Prince Eun Seong or Grand Prince Jin Yang, they are not the treasonous ones.

332
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,730
You are the treasonous one, Grand Prince Yang Ahn.

333
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,160
Absolutely not!  What do you mean, treasonous?

334
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,020
I am returning things to where they should be.

335
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,390
It is my long-held loyalty.

336
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,910
You have helped to make things turn out this way too.

337
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,060
Everything is all my wrongdoing.

338
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,900
I should have told the truth even if I were to disappear like the morning dew at an execution.

339
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,110
I made the wrong judgment due to their relenting pressure.

340
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,450
What do I do about my wrongdoing?

341
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,440
It's too late.

342
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,070
Queen Regent and I alone

343
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,990
cannot protect the young king.

344
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,500
Then, are you saying that we should just

345
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,300
let Grand Prince Jin Yang take the throne?

346
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Had the king been older than ten years, we could have endured.

347
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,810
But, he is too young.

348
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,000
Time is not on our side.

349
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,950
As the long time passes, Grand Prince Jin Yang will strengthen his power.

350
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,280
If things don't work out as he planned, blood will be shed.

351
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,070
Could the queen regent, who's lost two sons already, endure it?

352
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,560
I don't have the confidence.

353
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,760
Then, what do we do with the courtiers?

354
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,740
Who do we give our loyalty too?

355
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,560
Let's choose the king who can bring peace

356
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,330
and stabilize the north and south.

357
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,330
Lady.

358
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,470
Eat slowly and have water.

359
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,340
You should just cry.

360
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,350
Or you could shave your head and enter the temple.

361
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,590
Why are you doing this?

362
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,090
Ja Hyeon.

363
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,890
Young Master.

364
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,520
Is she still like this?

365
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:08,400
For a few days, she just continuously took baths.

366
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,170
Now, she's been constantly eating.

367
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,550
She's pretty much living in front of the food table.

368
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,930
Grand Prince Jin Yang rose to the throne.

369
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,930
After Grand Prince Eun Seong died, petitions came in from everywhere

370
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,540
expressing anxiety over the fact that the king was too young.

371
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:34,270
Finally, Queen Regent issued an edict, relinquishing the throne.

372
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:41,160
Now, the king of Joseon is Grand Prince Jin Yang.

373
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,230
Lady, Lady!

374
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,660
Lady, have water.

375
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,690
Oh, Lady!

376
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,360
The day after you left, or two days afterward,

377
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,070
the laborer at the boat ferry brought it.

378
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,620
Before Grand Prince Eun Seong died, he wrote it while in exile.

379
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,990
 Your home is in the capital,

380
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,610
 and my home is now in Ganghwa province.

381
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,000
  Even if we miss each other, we cannot see each other.

382
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,290
 When it rains on the paulownia tree,

383
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,920
 our longing hearts will be no longer.

384
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,160
Your Majesty, how could you pass away before me?

385
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:47,300
Afterward, it has made my life very difficult.

386
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,550
After receiving the instructions you left behind after your death,

387
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,850
I have scarred my children.

388
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,920
Was what I did a good thing?

389
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:14,960
With my own hands, I brought my grandson down.

390
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,280
I have placed Jin Yang on the throne.

391
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,420
Will you scold me?

392
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,400
Eun Seong...

393
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,990
Is Eun Seong doing well?

394
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,750
Does he not

395
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,240
resent me, his mother?

396
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,970
With the grace of this royal court,

397
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:34,310
and the wise decision of the merciful queen regent,

398
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,780
while being strengthened by the prolonged loyalty from all of you,

399
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,790
I, who am very inadequate, have risen to a position much bigger than myself.

400
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,880
I will serve the former king who's still very young

401
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,840
and straighten the affairs of the nation that's been in chaos.

402
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,710
So that we can fulfill the dream of the founding fathers

403
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,790
for a strong and beautiful nation, which is also my wish,

404
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,060
please help me with this important task

405
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,460
in building the new era of our nation.

406
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

407
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,700
I wish to fill the prime minister's position, which is vacant because of my ascension,

408
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,370
with a member of the royal family who's been with me,

409
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,380
from the frontline to this court, Grand Prince Yang An.

410
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,660
What is your opinion?

411
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,300
Do Jeong Gook, the son of the loyal subject Do Yeon Soo,

412
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,160
will be put in charge of the Royal Investigative Agency.

413
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,710
Uh Ul Woon, who's been devoted to me will become

414
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,560
the head of the royal palace guards,

415
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,010
so that he can continue to protect the royal family.

416
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,360
While it's a beautiful act to place the right people in the right places,

417
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,240
there is a process for doing this type of thing.

418
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,350
Please follow the procedure for appointment—

419
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,330
After rising so quickly to the throne,

420
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,520
I have not had the chance to follow the process myself.

421
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,480
Do you have a problem with the process of my ascension too?

422
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,240
It is not that.

423
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,250
If you have differing opinions, speak up.

424
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,840
You who are my true servants,

425
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,290
I am curious about your opinions.

426
00:45:53,050 --> 00:46:00,150

427
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,290
Queen Mother, now I am doing my duty as a daughter-in-law.

428
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:27,560
While I was married, I lived outside of the palace until now.

429
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,230
The fact that I was undutiful by not being close to you was distressful to me.

430
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,210
Now that I can greet you in the morning and night and serve you within the same household,

431
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,010
my happiness is limitless.

432
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,020
Even though I am lacking, I will do best by you. Please teach me many things.

433
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,180
Are you happy?

434
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:49,020
Is winning the queen's palace

435
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,020
such a joyous experience to you is what I'm asking.

436
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,060
Queen Mother, what I am happy about is not the spot as a queen

437
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,350
but the fact that I can serve you close by.

438
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,940
You should try experiencing

439
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,640
how heavy and painful that spot as a queen is.

440
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,970
Please look after the former queen more than me.

441
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,450
You might be sisters-in-law in private homes,

442
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,340
but in the palace, she is your superior by far.

443
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,560
Make sure to pay her greetings in the morning and night and treat her with a devoted heart.

444
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,120
I will keep that in mind.

445
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,720
The old ladies of the backroom are going to make me go through the daughter-in-law ritual?

446
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,140
Do they still not know who has the lifeline?

447
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,990
It's been a long path indeed.

448
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,030
It was my spot in the end.

449
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,130
And things happened the way they did.

450
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,250
Where should we serve you tonight?

451
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,480
Will you rest at Gangnyeongjeon (the king's chamber)

452
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,860
or Gyotaejeon (the queen's chamber)?

453
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,690
Bring the lady from the Seong family.

454
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:54,110
Your Majesty, it's your first day of ascending to the throne.

455
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,880
If I want to make the lady from the Seong family my royal concubine,

456
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,710
would Queen Mother  approve of it?

457
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,670
Would my wife go along with it?

458
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,430
It's an impossible act, Your Majesty.

459
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,110
You must allow her no time for excuses or delay.

460
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,000
I intend to take care of the deed before the queen is formally installed.

461
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,200
I will request that she be my concubine once I've bedded her.

462
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,920
I don't want to report and ask for permission beforehand.

463
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,380
This is not something that could work like that. Bring the lady from the Seong family.

464
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,140
If the lady doesn't come along easily—

465
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,990
Force her to come, then.

466
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:51,760
Even though she did not get wed, she was engaged to his younger brother.

467
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,100
Even with the unlimited power of the king, what kind of beastly conduct is this on his first night?

468
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,610
If he really wants my daughter to be his royal concubine,

469
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,610
tell him to formally ask and have a wedding before doing so.

470
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,470
If he's the king, he should be treating her with respect.

471
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:08,290
How can he call a lady from a noble family in the middle of the night like a stray cat?

472
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:13,310
The lady and His Majesty have already made a promise about these matters while the king was still in his private home.

473
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,410
What kind of nonsense?

474
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:19,940
The whole capital knows that my daughter and the late Grand Prince Eun Seong were deeply in love.

475
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,620
What kind of promise would a woman like that have made with another man?

476
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,450
Stop cajoling without regard to basic manners and please leave.

477
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,870
Leave my house right away!

478
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,090
Lady, what do we do?

479
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,480
Grand Prince Jin Yang... I mean, the new king

480
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,090
has called for you at this time of night.

481
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,480
Lady Na Gyeom... I mean,

482
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,990
the new queen, you know what kind of person she is.

483
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:55,810
You don't know what she'll do to you.

484
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,590
Eo Eul Woon brought his soldiers and is insisting that this was all promised.

485
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,340
What do we do, Lady?

486
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,570
If you go to the storage room, you will find

487
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,200
castor powder drained of all oil.

488
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,690
Bring that to me.

489
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,890
Why?

490
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,830
I need to use it somewhere.

491
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,960
It's a royal order.

492
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,720
If you don't follow the order, then I'll take that to mean something else.

493
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,380
- If it's a royal order, we have to follow even if it's a beastly order? 
 - My wife.

494
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,530
Why do you only know one thing and not the other?

495
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,960
His Majesty wants to save the lady for the sake of Seong family.

496
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,020
Hell is already the fate of our family.

497
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,380
We have no greed to escape or to reclaim former glory.

498
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,790
Just go back.

499
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:28,210
Our household will just live quietly as though we don't exist.

500
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,670
I'll go.

501
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,580
Ja Hyeon.

502
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,390
What he's saying is right.

503
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,550
This is something that's already been promised.

504
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:47,490
Ja Hyeon.

505
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,860
I was the loved one of Grand Prince Eun Seong,

506
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,800
but he isn't here anymore.

507
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,310
I'm a bride who's never gone through even the first night.

508
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,320
If the king calls, I must go.

509
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,830
I'll go.

510
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,960
I'll go in your stead and tell him of the unfairness of his request.

511
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,040
Father, please do not violate

512
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,620
your principles for the sake of your family anymore.

513
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:18,410
Doing what you don't wish to in order to save your daughter...

514
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,170
Once was enough.

515
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,710
Ja Hyeon.

516
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,200
Now it's my turn.

517
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,080
I'll do it.

518
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,150
I will do it.

519
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,320
What are you going to do?

520
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,610
Ja Hyeon.  Ja Hyeon!  Ja Hyeon!

521
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,600
There will be an order appointing her concubine by tomorrow.

522
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,390
It is an honor, so don't worry. Just wait here comfortably.

523
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,020
You jerks! You jerks! Give me my daughter!

524
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,090
Ja Hyeon!  Ja Hyeon!  Ja Hyeon!

525
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,130
Is he not coming to Gyotaejeong (the queen's quarters) tonight?

526
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,830
No, Your Highness.

527
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:57,230
- He says he has a lot to do so he will rest in his chamber but... 
- But...

528
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,500
According to the servants, they are preparing everything as though they are receiving a new bride.

529
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,700
They don't have a bride yet, but the way they're preparing the royal bedding and

530
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,850
the way the royal kitchen is preparing an evening snack the size of a feast,

531
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,810
it seems like something isn't right.

532
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,410
On this historic night of my entrance to the Gyotaejeon,

533
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,610
what tramp is disturbing the peace of the mother of the nation?

534
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,050
I'll go and see for myself.

535
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,930
You cannot wear a dress from a private home.

536
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:30,740
You have to be bathed and put on new clothes.

537
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,420
Give it here, please.

538
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,740
It's something I will decorate myself with.

539
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,260
It's very expensive, so I will keep it with me.

540
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,350
Have a seat.

541
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,820
I thought you might not come.

542
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,850
A promise is a promise.

543
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:27,810
Since the security collateral I had is no longer alive,

544
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:31,360
even if you broke the promise, there was nothing I could do.

545
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,600
That's what I thought.

546
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,800
As you said, that person is not living anymore.

547
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,520
What can we do about someone who isn't alive in this world?

548
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,660
Hav your feelings changed since

549
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,480
I became a king from a grand prince?

550
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,150
Do my feelings have any meaning to you?

551
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,100
I am sorry that I cannot follow the formal process.

552
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,620
Tomorrow, the world will change.

553
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,720
If you did, it would have made me more uncomfortable.

554
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,520
Will you pour me a drink?

555
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,400
Before that,

556
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,880
can you send the servants away?

557
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,820
There are too many eyes and ears in a place of sleep.

558
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,680
This is the law of the king's bedchamber.

559
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,100
Send them away.

560
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,460
Have the servants leave the premises.

561
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,730
Your Majesty, that is impossible. For your safety—

562
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:56,950
Just go for today.

563
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,790
Neither she nor I are used to the rules

564
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,020
so step away for today.

565
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,910
 In that case

566
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,100
we will step away a little.

567
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,170
This is the first night on the throne, but he's not asking for the queen.

568
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,980
I came to ask if His Majesty is all right. Let me see him.

569
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,790
Please go back, Your Highness.

570
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:51,220
It's different in the palace.  You cannot see the king whenever you want to.

571
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,940
You dare to look down on me because

572
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,190
I'm new to the palace, Court Lady Hong?

573
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,180
I'm the queen of this nation.

574
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,350
How dare you block the path of the mother of the nation?

575
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,800
You are not the queen yet, Your Highness.

576
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,600
You've come to the palace but you have not been installed as a queen yet.

577
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,790
On a day like this, if you bother him,

578
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,600
then you may be in danger.

579
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,330
Adhere to the rules of the palace, please.

580
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:20,090
I'm the one and only wife of the king.

581
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,100
If it's not me, who in the world is receiving the king's grace?

582
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,530
You must not do this, Your Highness!

583
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,020
Move aside!

584
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,930
With what heart

585
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,780
and thinking did you come into the palace?

586
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,330
To want someone so badly, but

587
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:07,480
now that I see it up close it doesn't seem real.

588
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,560
Is the person in front of me really Ja Hyeon?

589
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,330
Hwi had to die.

590
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:19,950
Hwi had to disappear

591
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,960
for you to come to me?

592
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,990
Even if he died.

593
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:31,300
Even if he is no longer in this world,

594
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:35,760
I could not go to anyone else.

595
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:44,950
Then why?

596
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,720
Because I've become the king now?

597
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,480
Do you want to hear my answer?

598
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,380
In order to wreak my revenge!

599
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:32,820
I came here in order to kill you myself.

600
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:40,380

601
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:48,110
♫  Believing and believing  ♫

602
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:55,060
♫  In a life together  ♫

603
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:01,910
♫  Living and living  ♫

604
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,660
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love 
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

605
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,270
 You've even dared to come to the palace.

606
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:11,890
 Who ordered it? The queen?

607
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,560
 What resentment would the lady of the Seong family harbor?

608
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,860
 You've become like this for picking a flower you should not have.

609
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,250
 You must punish Ja Hyeon as a traitor.

610
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:25,430
 The only way to settle all this turmoil is for her to kill herself or get married.

611
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,760
 Just kill me.

612
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,250
 Grand Prince
