00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,580
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:15,410

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,980
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,500
 Episode 12

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm asking you what you can offer me, Lady.

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,830
Every deal comes at a cost.

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,570
If you decide to accept a deal,

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,710
you can find me again at that time.

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,980
Your Excellency.

10
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,160
Your friend found me. Please send her back.

11
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,650
This doesn't seem like the best time.

12
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,980
You've come to the wrong person to implore.

13
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,650
The one who made your man die isn't His Excellency.

14
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,880
Didn't you know?

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,030
The one who reported Grand Prince Eun Seong's treason

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,550
was none other than your father.

17
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,980
Is he feeling okay?

18
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,670
After writing the report of treason and attempting suicide,

19
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,500
he was saved at the last moment, they say.

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,990
Are you slandering my father, too, now?

21
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,410
You're the only one who didn't know, I see. Ask about it when you get home.

22
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,090
It's no different from your father giving Grand Prince Eun Seong the poison tonic.

23
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,340
Remember this clearly.

24
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,870
Your household killed Grand Prince Eun Seong.

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,390
He'll die because of you!

26
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,530
Would you like to have a nightcap before you go to bed?

27
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,250
It's raining. The rice wine has also been fermented well.

28
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,290
Is Lady Ja Hyeon outside still?

29
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,350
She has gone back home.

30
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,870
She seemed to have walked here by herself. Did you get her a palanquin?

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,740
This isn't the time for us to treat her well.

32
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,330
It's raining so much in the middle of the night.

33
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,080
Are you saying that you sent her back without an umbrella?

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,590
It was what she wanted.

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,510
Ja Hyeon, what are you doing there?

36
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,780
Why are you getting hit by the rain here? Let's go in.

37
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,260
It's not true, right? What you did?

38
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,690
Let's get in first.

39
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,730
- Let's go. 
 - Say it isn't true!

40
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,980
Say that it wasn't you who's going to make His Highness die.

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,220
I had to save you.

42
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,330
You have killed me.

43
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,140
Do you think I can live in a world without His Highness?

44
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,180
You aren't the only person in this household. Your mother and brother

45
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,480
are all people I need to protect in this family!

46
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
How thankful I am.

47
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,550
Since you have killed my lover to save me, your kindness

48
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,850
just cuts through me.

49
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,980
How ungrateful of you. It was a decision made to save our whole family.

50
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,000
After that, he was in such agony that he chose to attempt suicide.

51
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,570
Had the chief royal secretary not saved him,

52
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,840
you wouldn't have been able to act in such a wicked manner towards him like today.

53
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,140
Please stop, my wife. It is all my fault.

54
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,360
Is your love the only thing that's heartbreaking? Is your man the only one who is important?

55
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,250
Can you not even see your parents? Does your family not matter to you?

56
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,110
I will not see anyone make my man hurt.

57
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
Can you not see the feelings your father had when he took that path?

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,110
Can you not see his tears of blood (tears from suffering)?

59
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,180
I can see them gushing out even now.

60
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,080
Come to your senses. What do we do with Hwi?

61
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,210
How are we going to save him?

62
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,310
In the north, I could save him.

63
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,310
Hwi also saved me many times, too.

64
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,340
But, here? I can't do that.

65
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,800
I can't even enter the palace.

66
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,350
You have to do it.

67
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,680
It was a deadly situation they came up with to remove you.

68
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,890
You already know how much I love her.

69
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,970
Why would I have filled the happiest and most beautiful day of my life with blood?

70
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,530
Why would I do that?

71
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,960
But, her father reported you for treason.

72
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,480
That report is evidence that has made it into an immovable truth.

73
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,790
He most likely wanted to save his family.

74
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,620
Someone most likely coerced Chief Scholar into his choice.

75
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,170
So he wanted to wash his own sins through death.

76
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,140
Your innocence is only based on your firm belief,

77
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,350
but the allegations of wrongdoing against you

78
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,940
have material evidence.

79
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,580
I must see Queen Regent.

80
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,030
She is the only one I can ask for a favor.

81
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,620
For now, I will let her palace ladies know.

82
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,090
And, what about a visit to the prison?

83
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,870
I am not in control of that.

84
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,590
Isn't there another path? If you tell us the way—

85
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,270
There isn't much I can do,

86
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,270
but doesn't money open all the paths in the world?

87
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,440
Tell one of the men in your household to take the lead.

88
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,740
- It isn't somewhere for women to be going in and out. 
 - Your father would never.

89
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,690
Maybe Young Master?

90
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,310
You've arrived?

91
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,650
- I'll trust you. 
 - Yes, yes.

92
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,510
Please follow me.

93
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,650
This way.

94
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,340
Keep it short. You will only have time to look at each other.

95
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,960
Your Highness.

96
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,770
Your Highness, it's me.

97
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,600
Ja Hyeon is here.

98
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,290
Ja Hyeon!

99
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,300
Are you okay?

100
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,020
Are you hurt anywhere?

101
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,460
Did you go through torture?

102
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,640
Even if they falsely accused me as a traitor,

103
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,570
they can't touch the kindred of the king so easily.

104
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,830
I feel wronged at heart, but my body is okay.

105
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,740
Why did you

106
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,190
come to this wretched place?

107
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,880
I didn't want you to see me like this.

108
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,460
Is your family alright?

109
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,500
What about Roo Si Gae? What happened to her?

110
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,150
I am keeping her with me.

111
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,240
Is your father safe?

112
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,890
Please forgive us.

113
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,590
No. Please don't forgive us.

114
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,950
My family placed you in this situation.

115
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,110
You must hate us and resent us.

116
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,350
Father is already living in hell.

117
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,940
I would've done the same.

118
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,320
If I could save you,

119
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,310
if I could protect my family,

120
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,880
I would've done even more terrible things.

121
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,560
Don't hate your father.

122
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,450
At first, I couldn't understand why he did it,

123
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,250
and I resented him for what he did.

124
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,210
But then I realized that it was a way for you

125
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,580
to avoid the misfortune of being labeled as a traitor's family,

126
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,510
and I couldn't be grateful enough.

127
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,120
He put his life at stake

128
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,380
to express his ardent fatherly love.

129
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,590
I cannot forgive him.

130
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,250
I will rectify his mistake

131
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,230
and save you.

132
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,640
Don't be like that.

133
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,260
I can't put your family in danger again

134
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,590
so that I can live.

135
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,590
Your Highness!

136
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,850
On our wedding day

137
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,300
you looked so beautiful.

138
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,030
But we ended up like this before we even exchanged our vows.

139
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,690
When I fall asleep

140
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,800
I dream of that day.

141
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,200
In the dream, I am a happy groom.

142
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,020
I smile at you.

143
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,990
I take off your headpiece.

144
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,000
But...

145
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
♫   So I keep walking   ♫

146
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,540
♫   till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   ♫

147
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,060
♫   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   ♫

148
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,780
Haven't we gone through worse in the past?

149
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,720
There were days that you thought I was dead.

150
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,600
We never gave up even back then.

151
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,560
Let's not give up. Let's not get weary.

152
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,530
Since we are alive, there's still hope.

153
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,680
No matter what happens... please believe me.

154
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,050
No matter what happens,

155
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,150
you cannot give up hope.

156
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,320
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

157
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:19,900
♫    Following this path, following you, I'm wandering   ♫

158
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,600
Be quiet! If we get caught, we'll be in big trouble!

159
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,040
You're going to meet the chief royal secretary?

160
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,580
He is the brother of the Queen Regent.

161
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,380
I'll tell him that father's report of treason wasn't true

162
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,110
and ask him to tell the Queen Regent of the grand prince's innocence.

163
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,530
Then we can clear him of the false accusations, can't we?

164
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,910
You fool. Then our father will end up dead!

165
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,150
Do you want to kill your father to save your man?

166
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,130
Do you want to ruin our entire family?

167
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,830
I did my duty as your brother by letting you see Grand Prince Eun Seong.

168
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,870
Since I granted your wish, keep your promise and stop protesting to Father.

169
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,960
Ja Hyeon, if Father tries to hang himself again

170
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,320
will you be satisfied?

171
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,800
Your Majesty, the Chief Scholar's daughter is requesting an audience.

172
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,670
Will you see her?

173
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,190
For their own survival,

174
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,270
her family pushed my son to the brink of death.

175
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,410
Forget it! I never again want to

176
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,060
associate with that family.

177
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
Her Highness is not in good spirits right now.

178
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,590
It will be difficult to meet her today.

179
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,010
I will wait.

180
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,240
Lady!

181
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,530
It's okay if it gets late. It's okay even if I have to stay up all night.

182
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,000
I must see Her Highness.

183
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,270
If it's about settling Prince Eun Seong's case, you should meet

184
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,120
Prince Jin Yang, not Queen Regent.

185
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,260
Well, Prince Jin Yang is the Prime Minister, and his brother-in-law is the Minister of Defense.

186
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,240
Even if she wanted to save Grand Prince Eun Seong,

187
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,920
she is helpless if the ministers oppose.

188
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,180
It's Prince Jin Yang's world now.

189
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,050
 Then what will you give me?

190
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,140
 Is there something grand that you wish to exchange for Eun Seong's life?

191
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,260
 Since we are alive, there's still hope.

192
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,770
 No matter what happens, do not give up hope .

193
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,330
Lady!  Lady!

194
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,890
Ladyi Please wake up!

195
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,200
Lady! Oh, Lady!

196
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,930
Lady!

197
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,400
Lady, are you regaining consciousness?

198
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,390
The doctor was here.

199
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,580
He said that you haven't eaten for a few days.

200
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,890
You were standing all day in the sun on an empty stomach, so you collapsed from exhaustion.

201
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,710
Where am I?

202
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,240
Prince Jin Yang who was leaving the palace

203
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,740
escorted you here when you collapsed.

204
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,520
Bringing a noblewoman to a gisaeng house

205
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,080
is an insult.

206
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,380
It's a different situation from the last time you came here.

207
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,640
So you recognize me?

208
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Gisaengs have sharp eyes.

209
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,580
I will call a palanquin for you to travel home in.

210
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,210
I want to meet the grand prince.

211
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,070
Lady!

212
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,320
There should be one reason why you came to see me.

213
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,430
But, I cannot do anything about your wish.

214
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,890
My brother, Eun Seong

215
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,960
will be subject to this nation's laws.

216
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,360
Do you still want me?

217
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,610
I'm not sure.

218
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,190
I will offer you all of me.

219
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,610
Even if offered the entire country or the entire sky,

220
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,360
I do not regard it as

221
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,350
more precious than a person's life.

222
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,230
So, I will

223
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,100
throw away all of myself

224
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,640
to you, Your Excellency.

225
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:22,050
Please kill me and let His Highness live.

226
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,880
I believe that the path to my father's repentance for his sin

227
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,190
is a path where I am thrown away.

228
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,750
Do as you wish.

229
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:47,750
♫   Living and living   ♫

230
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,440
Is coming to me

231
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,660
the same as dying to you?

232
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,410
You'd come to me

233
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,150
to die?

234
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,170
Even if he is young,

235
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,590
destabilizing the former king's chosen successor

236
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,250
by raising the rebels

237
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,200
and murdering the Minister of General Affairs and others,

238
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,780
Prince Eun Seong Lee Hwi must be punished for bringing disrepute to the Royal Court.

239
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,110
Please restore the dignity of the Royal House.

240
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,770
He must be beheaded.

241
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,320
Please rescind Prince Eun Seong Lee Hwi's royal position,

242
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,770
thereby showing the tragic consequence of being a traitor

243
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,970
and to ensure there are no more royal family members who desire succession to the throne.

244
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,520
Grand Prince Eun Seong must be beheaded!

245
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,330
Grand Prince Eun Seong must be beheaded!

246
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,910
No matter how severe his wrongdoing is,

247
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,780
I cannot kill a grand prince, my son, with my own hands.

248
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,210
Instead of beheading him, we must exile him and give him a chance to repent.

249
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,450
No, Your Highness.

250
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,150
If you show empathy to a traitor, it will send the wrong message

251
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,930
to all others who might think of the same deed.

252
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,040
Please show your allegiance to the law of the nation.

253
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,150
He must be beheaded, Your Highness!

254
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,630
How can you be so cruel?

255
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,070
It hasn't even been a long time since the late king passed away.

256
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,140
Are you telling me to lose another son?

257
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,280
Do not personally think of him as your son,

258
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,830
but as a person who threatened the king's throne.

259
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,010
No, I cannot. Even if he has committed a wrongdoing,

260
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,400
we cannot behead a grand prince!

261
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,680
Please think of the Royal Court, Your Highness!

262
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,690
Please understand, Your Highness.

263
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,180
Even though my brother, Grand Prince Eun Seong, deserves to die,

264
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,320
with the continuing tragedies in the royal family, the morale of the people has fallen,

265
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
and Queen Mother's worries have reached the heavens.

266
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,780
It's embarrassing to be a  member of the royal family and be seen by the people.

267
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,470
As a son, I am deeply ashamed.

268
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,890
Although the rebellion was evil, the king is safe.

269
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:55,100
Since Queen Regent is suffering greatly,

270
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,160
if we send him to a place where he can reflect on his actions,

271
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,010
the generosity of the royal family will be known far and wide.

272
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,890
While rebels have confessed,

273
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,770
the accused prince is denying all allegations.

274
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,290
We should keep him alive so that we will have the wherewithal

275
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,410
to search for an unjust reason that may exist.

276
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,240
Let us accept

277
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,170
Queen Regent's wish.

278
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,680
Out of his desire for personal gain, he waged a rebellion.

279
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,090
Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi,

280
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,360
will lose his title of Minister of Defense along with all its attendant privileges.

281
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,420
He deserves to die for the crimes he committed,

282
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,380
but considering his military service in the north and being a direct relation of the king,

283
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,730
he will be sent to Gyodong Island in exile.

284
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:12,130
Live your whole life being sorry and reflecting on yourself.

285
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,990
- Your Highness. 
 - Our lives were spared.

286
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,470
We should be thankful to my mother and the king.

287
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,430
Oh, I'm sorry!

288
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,470
I'm sorry!

289
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,850
Your Highness!

290
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:04,520
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

291
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:12,230
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

292
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:19,120
♫   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,   ♫

293
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,930
♫    You spread across my heart   ♫

294
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,190
Your Highness.

295
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:30,220
♫   Love is so mean    ♫

296
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,900
Why would you come here? The wind is cold due to the river.

297
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,310
I wanted to at least see your face once.

298
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,730
This isn't the last time.

299
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,130
This can't be the end for us.

300
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,050
Wait a little longer.

301
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,470
I will return to you. I will.

302
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,990
Take me. I want to go, too.

303
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,170
Protect the lady.

304
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,440
It's a favor I'm asking of you.

305
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,720
Still, unlike the past, I know where you will be.

306
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,350
I will know that you're alive.

307
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,580
Unlike the time when you were out in the war,

308
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,610
I will be in less agony.

309
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,200
I will send you letters.

310
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,560
I should be able to send letters from there.

311
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,120
I will respond to you.

312
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,270
You must get on the ship.

313
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,110
Even if you leave now, it takes two days.

314
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,040
Your Highness.

315
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,640
♫   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,   ♫

316
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,940
I'll trust the lady with you. 
 ♫   You spread across my heart   ♫

317
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:59,480
♫   Love is so mean   ♫

318
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:07,310
♫    Why do you keep shaking up my heart?   ♫

319
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:14,770
♫   I always get hurt because I cannot have you, but    ♫

320
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:19,940
Your Highness! 
 ♫   Today, I love you   ♫

321
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,490
Do not worry.

322
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:30,200
Your Highness. 
 ♫   I'll love you forever    ♫

323
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,780
Your Highness.

324
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,170
Your Highness!

325
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,160
You have made a mistake.

326
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,770
You should've removed Eun Seong during this opportunity.

327
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,560
Did you become weak because he was your family?

328
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,630
The chief of security for Gyodong Island is

329
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,670
the son of Doh Yeon Soo, who was killed by the rebels.

330
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,390
The enemy who killed his father has fallen into his hands.

331
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,430
Do you think he'd leave him alone?

332
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,000
Even if I cannot do it directly myself,

333
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,390
if we send someone from here, he'll acquiesce.

334
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,040
Making Queen Regent into an enemy was burdensome as well.

335
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,370
After the rebels confessed and Chief Scholar reported treason,

336
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,830
Eun Seong, who miraculously survived in the north,

337
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,260
has become a mythical human to the people.

338
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,720
Since he usually had a gentle nature,

339
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,470
there are those who question why he would have done something like that. Half believing and half not.

340
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,610
Then, what will you do?

341
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:50,210
Eun Seong won't simply be peacefully painting things on the island.

342
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,450
He'll be planning a comeback. He might escape the island

343
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:58,900
or make contact with someone from the capital city. When he does, we will attack.

344
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,800
Out of his own foolishness if Eun Seong engages in a risky activity,

345
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,500
the superiors will have no choice but to deal with him.

346
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,640
Send Eo Eul Woon right away.

347
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,140
It is necessary to immediately start discussing this with the governor over there.

348
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,490
Yes, Your Excellency.

349
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,990
Once Eung Seong is taken care of in his exile,

350
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,980
we will have to push aside my uncle, Chief Royal Secretary

351
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,200
who's not on my side.

352
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,240
  My love, my Hwi.

353
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,930
  When I say your name, it becomes a whistle.

354
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:30,910
  By saying your name, I started to fall in love.

355
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,020
  We became fated.

356
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,540
  The life we dreamed of having together was very simple.

357
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,920
  Living in one house, eating together at one table,

358
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,730
  we'd sit side by side and draw things.

359
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,910
  But, I know now.

360
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,840
  That short dream is hard to make come true.

361
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,810
  It's nearly impossible.

362
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,630
  Fate has blocked me from going to you in this life,

363
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,240
  but death cannot block me.

364
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,030
  I will go first and wait for you.

365
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,220
  Hopefully, after a long time has passed,

366
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,490
  please come to me.

367
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,420
  I will become a flower and wait for you.

368
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,350
Lady, a palanquin was sent from the grand prince.

369
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,380
You're not going, right? Should I send it back?

370
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,280
Listen carefully.

371
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,700
Keep these two letters, and if something happens to me—

372
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,670
Lady!

373
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,610
If by some chance it ever does happen is what I'm saying.

374
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,100
The blue one is for Mother.

375
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,710
The red one... Send it to Gyodong Island.

376
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,030
To Grand Prince Eun Seong?

377
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,060
What are these?

378
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,910
They're just letters.

379
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,350
But, why would you give a letter to elders who live in the same house as you?

380
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,580
Just in case.

381
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,990
Keep them well.

382
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,930
Don't go, Lady. Why are you going there?

383
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,650
I told you I have things to discuss with him about our house.

384
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,930
Then, why can't I follow you?

385
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,660
I'll just go and come back on this palanquin, anyway.

386
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,810
Don't worry. Stay home.

387
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,660
Lady.

388
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,240
Welcome.

389
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,420
This is where you will dwell, Your Highness.

390
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,130
What are you doing?

391
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,320
Even if he is in exile here, he is this country's grand prince.

392
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,190
You cannot let him stay here.

393
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,010
Gi Teuk.

394
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,890
Find a better place that His Highness can reside in.

395
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,390
Is he here as a tourist?

396
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,520
How rude of you!

397
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,420
If he's here as a criminal, he should suffer and repent.

398
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,330
But he expects to be treated differently as soon as he arrives here.  How pathetic.

399
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,570
Finished talking?  I'm talking about the protocol you need to keep for a royal family member.

400
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,790
Enough. It's enough.

401
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,760
To these people, I am not royalty but just a criminal.

402
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,390
It was just a false accusation. You haven't done anything wrong, Your Highness.

403
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,460
I'm Chief of Security, Do Jeong Gook. Hello, Your Highness.

404
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,390
If you're Do Jeong Gook...

405
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,270
Yes, that's true.

406
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:19,230
The Minister of General Affairs Doh Yeon Soo, who was beheaded on the day of the rebellion.

407
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,520
That person is my father.

408
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,130
I resigned so that I could work on getting revenge,

409
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:34,660
but I put it aside and waited, after hearing you'd be here.

410
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,690
Aren't you looking forward to your days of exile?

411
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:48,670
We will make sure you don't feel uncomfortable here.

412
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,530
Give criminal Lee Hwi rice, salt, and soy sauce.

413
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,760
Other than the servant he brought, don't let anyone else onto the premises.

414
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,510
Yes, sir!

415
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,500
Grand Prince Jin Yang intentionally sent you here.

416
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,840
To someone who believes you've killed his father,

417
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,100
he handed us over to someone who wants revenge.

418
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,330
Let's not do this. Let's clean up.

419
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,820
It has a roof and walls. What more could we ask for?

420
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,460
We are trained to sleep well in any condition. So, this is like a palace...'

421
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,180
What's wrong?

422
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,740
It's nothing.

423
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,330
Nice to see you again, Madame.

424
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,260
Why are you here? The grand prince isn't here.

425
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,190
Today, I came to see you.

426
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,870
I thought you'd need to know the reason why

427
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,330
His Highness let Grand Prince Eun Seong live instead of dying by drinking poison tonic.

428
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,810
After being severely scolded by you,

429
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,800
I realized that I needed to offer you and any person belonging to Grand Prince Jin Yang

430
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,530
my loyalty.

431
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,530
If you have something I don't know, please tell me.

432
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,620
The daughter of Chief Scholar Seong Eok, Lady Ja Hyeon.

433
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,860
What about Ja Hyeon?

434
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,610
She has made a deal with His Excellency.

435
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,830
To save Eun Seong's life,

436
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,830
she said she'd do whatever he wanted. What would that mean?

437
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:14,800
Sure enough, as soon as Grand Prince Eun Seong was sent off on exile,

438
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,570
Ja Hyeon was called to the home she was to live after she got married.

439
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,210
I see.

440
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,750
If you need to confess things in the future, come find me whenever.

441
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,210
For a lowly person like me to live unscathed,

442
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,770
I know that I shouldn't mess with people who have tempers like you, Madame.

443
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,750
If there are more things you must be aware of in the future, I will let you know.

444
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,520
If you know your place, you will not step outside of it.

445
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,230
I understand your praiseworthy intentions.

446
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:49,390
Excuse me, Madame, but keep this a secret from Grand Prince Jin Yang.

447
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:54,990
If he finds out, it will be hard to tell you this and that.

448
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,470
I understand. Don't worry.

449
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,870
What would I gain from opening this? I can't even read the letters.

450
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,580
Roo Si Gae!

451
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,930
Do you know how to read Chinese characters?

452
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,570
I'm illiterate (using a slang).

453
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,490
Where'd you learn that phrase?

454
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,400
Gi Teuk always teased me for being illiterate.

455
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,960
Illiterate Roo Si Gae, I have a favor to ask you of.

456
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,480
Can you go to her old house? I'm worried that something happened to the lady.

457
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,060
You can just go yourself.

458
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,740
My role is different from yours.

459
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,970
How so?

460
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,100
I use my head.

461
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,750
You use your body.

462
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,940
I'll have scorched rice ready for you at dinner tonight.

463
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,100
- Two lumps. 
- I'll even spread rice syrup on them.

464
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,990
Be careful!

465
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,880
Of course. No one's been able to resist scorched rice.

466
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,800
Among the servants, scorched rice has absolute authority.

467
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,930
I thought of the past.

468
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,640
When we first met,

469
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,670
you were pouring me tea.

470
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,850
Today, will you make me a cup of tea?

471
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,460
Hasn't his room changed a bit?

472
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,310
I once wondered if you'd be spending your days here.

473
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,520
How can you be so cruel?

474
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,320
It's a house that was designed in order for me to live here daily with Grand Prince Eun Seong.

475
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,360
Just looking at the wall makes my heart crumble.

476
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,630
Passing the doorsill makes me unable to breathe.

477
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,280
How could you touch this place and call me over?

478
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,230
How do you think I felt?

479
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:35,770
I had to pick out a house for you to live in with Eun Seong.

480
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,740
My feelings when I had to hand this house over while smiling.

481
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:26,220
With what feelings and what resolve, did you get into the palanquin to come here today?

482
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,450
I came here to keep my promise.

483
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:37,740
Feeling greed over my brother's lover...

484
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,370
this was not the first time.

485
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,920
Should I tell you the story of Eun Seong's first love?

486
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,660
When I was living outside of the palace and entered the palace for the first time,

487
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,480
there was a young maid called Yeon Hee who was at his palace-pavilion.

488
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,300
With an injured arm in a brace, she wiped his shoes.

489
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,920
What great loyalty she had.

490
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,020
It was affection.

491
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:10,230
A deep affection for sure.

492
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,570
No matter where Eun Seong went, she followed him.

493
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,590
All day long, she'd look at him like a sunflower.

494
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,880
When Eun Seong smiled,

495
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,890
she was happy as if she had everything in the world.

496
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,640
When Eun Seong was angry, she was hurt over it as if her world had crumbled down.

497
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,880
I wanted her.

498
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,710
I wanted her to be mine.

499
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:43,000
What happened to her?

500
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,100
She died.

501
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,610
I could've treated her well.

502
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,690
I would have

503
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,880
treated her as well as any other.

504
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,180
What do you think I'll do with you?

505
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,890
Go back and wait.

506
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:38,600
I'm not going to go after you like some lowly guy on the street.

507
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,760
I will wait for the time.

508
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,810
I will follow the protocol when I come to you.

509
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,320
Do not have any nonsensical thoughts.

510
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,570
Keep yourself safe.

511
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:56,800
It isn't following the protocol if you want your brother's lover.

512
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,510
That kind of manner feels more like hell.

513
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,720
Do you think I am not genuine?

514
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,650
Even after having ninety-nine,  wanting one more, isn't that greed?

515
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,460
That isn't even loving.

516
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,230
That's just an obsession.

517
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,380
Do you not think obsession is love?

518
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,290
It's the same feeling of suffering when you don't get what you want.

519
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,700
My feelings, my greed.

520
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:29,450
Okay, let's say it isn't love.

521
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,810
But, why is it this hard?

522
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,290
I know

523
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,070
what you're thinking.

524
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,330
You want to die.

525
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,290
But, Eun Seong is still alive.

526
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,830
You can't even throw away your hope, so it must be hard to die.

527
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,360
You can return. At least for today.

528
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:35,090

529
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,850
There should be a palanquin outside of the main gate.

530
00:52:54,990 --> 00:53:01,990
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

531
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:08,920
♫   In a life together   ♫

532
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,820
♫   Living and living   ♫

533
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:24,790
♫   In eternal darkness   ♫

534
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:59,130
Assign someone who can keep an eye on things at Chief Scholar's house.

535
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,140
She's someone who may run away at any point.

536
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,030
Yes, sir.

537
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,130
Will you live as a concubine in my household?

538
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,600
I don't expect anything like friendship from you at this point, but this isn't it.

539
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,460
Did you decide to be a beast?

540
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,990
What is this?

541
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:39,040
If I can make sure the grand prince lives,

542
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,390
I can be worse than a beast.

543
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:47,700
Think who is worse than the beast.

544
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,130
Grand Prince JIn Yang who threatens his brother's life and covets his brother's woman.

545
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,260
You who abandons her friends and family in the name of ambition.

546
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,660
Who's the one who just got out of a house after being with someone else's husband?

547
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,390
Do you think I wanted to? Does it look like I came here because I wanted to?

548
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,750
Grand Prince Eun Seong will die in the end.

549
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:08,300
To save him,

550
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,720
even if you throw away your body,

551
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,830
he will die anyway.

552
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:18,220
What are you saying?  Grand Prince escaped death.

553
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,430
He was exiled to an island!

554
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,800
You think the world will keep a traitor alive?

555
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,970
He wasn't given the chance to live because of your tears and pleas.

556
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,130
The deal that you had with His Excellency, that promise

557
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,700
you were trying to keep. He wasn't given the chance to live because of those things, either.

558
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,640
So, listen carefully.

559
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,150
Don't linger around my man.

560
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,900
I can tolerate a gisaeng but not you.

561
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,360
You sacrificing yourself to save Grand Prince Eun Seong,

562
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,130
that kind of nonsense out of ignorance of the reality nauseates me.

563
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,830
I have no intention of bringing you into the house as a concubine.

564
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,890
Don't come near my flower garden (my life) again.

565
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,500
My lady!

566
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,330
Let's go, Lady.

567
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,540
Get out.

568
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,130
Good work, everyone.

569
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,370
Keep an eye on her.

570
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,280
They're stuck to us. How annoying.

571
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,590
Why'd you speak politely to me and call me lady earlier?

572
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,520
Because we were in front of an annoying woman.

573
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,530
I need to go to Gyodong Island.

574
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,620
His Highness is in danger.

575
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,110
You can't go because of the people watching you.

576
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,240
I'll go alone.

577
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,000
I'll go. You can't speak our language very well.

578
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,790
What if you can't find where His Highness is?

579
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,130
 Ja Hyeon

580
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,120
 I'm living by the river... missing you endlessly...

581
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,810
Gi Teuk?

582
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,380
General!

583
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,120
If it's because of the grudges you have against me due to your father,

584
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,070
alright, then. Cut me down.

585
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:08,680
But, the culprits who made your father die

586
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,930
will be buried in history forever.

587
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,100
Shut up. The greed to become a king

588
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,540
- made you humiliate the young king and kill the ministers. 
- That was not me!

589
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,220
Then, you held onto your life based on the fact that you were royalty.

590
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,370
I'll take this as the Heaven's will for me to pass judgment on you.

591
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:26,920
I'm angry for being accused of a crime I didn't commit.

592
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,610
If the loyal servant's sword in the hands of his filial son

593
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,840
kills me, I will take that as an honorable death.

594
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,150
Your Highness, are you alright?

595
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:31,170
- Ho Chi. 
 - I'm sorry.

596
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,990
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

597
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,770
Your Highness!

598
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,450
- Your Highness. 
 - Look who it is!

599
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,800
Your Highness!

600
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,020
What is this? Why are you doing things you didn't do before?

601
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,460
Hyung-nims!

602
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,830
Gi Teuk! Gi Teuk!

603
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:12,850
Why are you all the way over here? How did you know?

604
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:17,360
When you were in the capital city, we thought we'd be a bother so we could come find you.

605
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,360
But, after knowing that you were suffering,

606
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,280
we couldn't just do nothing about it!

607
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,180
What kind of person would charge you for such a heinous crime?

608
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,430
They have no idea what kind of person His Highness is.

609
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,150
He risked his life to save his people.

610
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,650
Right, right! Gi Teuk!

611
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,250
Guests are here.

612
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,930
The son of the late Minister of General Affairs Doh Yeon Soo.

613
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:04,130
Chief Security Do Jeong Gook, right?

614
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,750
I'm Do Jeong Gook.

615
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,680
We have come from the capital city.

616
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,880
We have something to tell you, Chief.

617
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,760
Stop where you are.

618
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,020
Where are you going?

619
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,970
The lady is going to offer a Buddhist prayer in the mountains.

620
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,050
We will accompany you.

621
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:32,420
We will go by ourselves.

622
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:36,210
I was ordered by the grand prince to accompany her wherever she goes.

623
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,630
Let's go.

624

♫   If I just keep walking like this endlessly   ♫

625
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:43,510
♫   It feels like I'll be able to see you   ♫

626
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:52,590
♫   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   ♫

  Give it to his uncle! Please, save my son and me.

01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,400
  Grand Prince Eun Seong has passed away.

631
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,230
  The lady has confirmed it.

632
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,410
  Now, Joseon's king is Grand Prince Jin Yang.

633
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,020
 What is this beastly conduct the day before the ascension to the throne?

634
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,500
  If the king calls for me, I must go.
