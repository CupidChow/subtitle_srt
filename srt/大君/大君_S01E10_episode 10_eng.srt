1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,650
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,270

3
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,130
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,960
  Episode 10

5
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,360
That secret letter given to the chieftain of Huligai Tribe.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,640
If that dirty negotiation is revealed to the world,

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,540
never mind the throne you coveted all this time.

8
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,610
It will be difficult to keep your position as grand prince.

9
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,400
No minister at court will stand with you.

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,230
Neither will any of our people be able to submit to you.

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,050
As a servant of the royal house who serves the saeja (crown prince),

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,430
be loyal to the saeja and Queen Mother.

13
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:25,020
If you do, I will bury it so that no one will know.

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,500
You think you will be safe making up such a scheme?

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,470
Is it not so?  What's the reason for changing the security of the saeja in a hurry?

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,040
What about the reason for pressuring Queen Mother who has just lost her son?

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,370
Show me the proof.

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,990
The proof that I was involved in a dirty negotiation!

19
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,590
I have that secret document.

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,530
Whenever you get distracted, think of the proof I am holding in my hand.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,930
And remember that you will have to live like that for your whole life.

22
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,330
Do not make up a scheme.

23
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,870
I wish this was a made-up scheme

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,370
more desperately than anyone.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,690
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Excellency!

26
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,480
Your Excellency, you can't!

27
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,800
Why are you being like this?

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,350
If Grand Prince Eun Seong gets killed in our house without a plan,

29
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,170
how will you deal with the future consequences?

30
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,210
I waited three years, and it turned out to be a complete waste of time.

31
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,210
A child with a runny nose is in charge of the national affairs.

32
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,430
Anymore,  political intrigue and fighting for reputation

33
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,940
no longer matters.

34
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,860
I need to know how far

35
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,490
each of you are willing to go with me.

36
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,170
If we succeed, it will be a revolution. If we fail, it will be treason.

37
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,180
If we stay together from start and finish,

38
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,840
and accomplish the great project, we will be richly

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,390
rewarded for many generations to come.

40
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:22,160
If we fail, we will become traitors to be condemned for generations.

41
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,250
I am asking if you are prepared for all of that.

42
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,990
We've drawn the sword already.

43
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,820
Have we not decided on our king a long time ago?

44
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,220
 Pledge of Alliance

45
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,700
 A covenant to oust saeja (crown prince) from ascension to the throne.

46
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,390
Are you suggesting we move up the national mourning period by invoking  Yi Il Yeo Wol Jae? 
 (Yi Il Yeo Wol Jae:   A rule of calculating one day as one month so that national mourning can end in 27 days instead of 27 months).

47
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,250
If we did that, we could have the ascension ceremony tomorrow. 
 (Yi Il Yeo Wol Jae:   A rule of calculating one day as one month so that national mourning can end in 27 days instead of 27 months).

48
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,940
Didn't Grand Prince Jin Yang threaten you earlier today, Your Highness?

49
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,510
We need to put the saeja (crown prince) on the throne at the earliest possible date.

50
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,740
The fact that our prosperous future lies with the saeja (crown prince), even though he is still young,

51
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,870
has to be voiced in unity by the court for the sake of our country,

52
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,370
so that Hyungnim will acknowledge that fact as well.

53
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,180
Then, you should come to the court as well.

54
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,990
If we want to protect the saeja, you, the grand prince who received the late king's last will,

55
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,800
have to be a great help to the queen in her work as the king's regent.

56
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,020
I have a request.

57
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,230
Please make Ja Hyeon's marriage proposal be like it never happened.

58
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,450
That's not such an easy thing to do.

59
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,840
It has to be done in order for everything to go back to its proper place.

60
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,610
Who is the female Orangkae (derogatory term for Jurchens) wench you brought here?

61
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,610
She's my life savior.  She was raised by the Jurchens but she's the daughter of a Joseon hostage.

62
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,560
She couldn't stay any longer after helping us escape, so she came with us.

63
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,610
- Is that all? 
 - Yes.

64
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,790
Since you've been washed and clothed, it's not obvious that you're an Orangkae.

65
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,860
Your natural look and form do not look too bad.

66
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,880
Sit down.

67
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,000
Get up.

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,460
I said to get up now!

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,540
Sit down again.

70
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,290
In front of an adult, you must sit gently like how flower petals rest on the ground.

71
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,060
You rest both of your knees upon the ground and sit.

72
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,190
I don't want to.

73
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,190
My leg hurts.

74
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,440
Wait.

75
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,670
Yes, at that speed, gently.

76
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,590
Eat it.

77
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,640
The grand prince brought a woman?

78
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,070
Yes, he did.

79
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm sure there's a reason. Maybe she was a captured prisoner.

80
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:13,210
It's been three years.  He could have married and had kids there.  Is he not a man?

81
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,130
What are you saying right now?

82
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,060
Lady never stopped waiting for him for three years.

83
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,890
Are you going to spread nonsensical gossip and upset her?

84
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,340
It's not a rumor! It's real! There's a witness!

85
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,030
- Leave, leave, leave! 
 - Why, why, why?

86
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,900
Don't you dare show up in front of the lady again.

87
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,340
Someone even came by my room, even though I have not stayed there yet.

88
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,540
We must cut off the court lady from the king's chamber.  She's tied to Grand Prince Jin Yang.

89
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,300
Should we report to the authorities?

90
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
- Leave it.
 - Your Highness.

91
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Even if we cut her off,  she would be replaced by someone else.

92
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,250
It's better for us to know who it is so that we can monitor her.

93
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,960
Hyungnim planned all of this.

94
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,090
Hyungnim really threw me away

95
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,720
and negotiated with the Orangkae.

96
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,290
Congratulations, Your Highness!

97
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,250
Please become a wise king for all the people in our nation.

98
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,790
As per the petition of many ministers who wished the affairs of the state to return to normal as soon as possible,

99
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,250
we moved up the state funeral and completed the process of bequeathing the throne.

100
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,840
Being a woman, I am full of worries regarding the duties of regency that have been entrusted to me.

101
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,780
As you know, Grand Prince Eun Seong's contribution in settling the rebellion in the northern region is great,

102
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,740
and he narrowly escaped death in returning after toiling hard for three years in the enemy camp.

103
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,420
Since the young saeja (crown prince) has risen to the throne,

104
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,670
I intend to appoint Grand Prince Eun Seong as the Minister of War

105
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,630
and entrust him with the king's safety.

106
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,940

107
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,520
I, Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi,

108
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,390
will serve Your Majesty with my utmost loyalty.

109
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,710
Your royal grace is immeasurable!

110
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,610
You slandered me for something I didn't do and then seized the military power.

111
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,630
I think you're the one having ulterior motives.

112
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,990
The queen dowager's intention was to secure the young king's safety

113
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,650
by appointing kindred of the king to the post.

114
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,410
Are you the only kindred of the king?

115
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,510
I was appointed because of the years I spent in the war zone, so I guess I should thank you.

116
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,420
Because you sent me to the northern region, I was able to become the Minister of War today.

117
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,580
You worked hard serving the late king all this time.

118
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,460
I will transfer you to the central military administration instead of being the Chief of Palace Security.

119
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,490
I hope your heavy burden will be lightened.

120
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,400
Are you demoting the chief of royal guards because he is my brother-in-law?

121
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,950
Demoting?

122
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,650
How can I demote someone from the same rank as me?

123
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,020
If it is not to your liking, I will think of a position in the countryside

124
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,130
where you can relax and get some rest.

125
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,660
How far do you  intend to go?

126
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,680
Till you give up everything,

127
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,700
till His Majesty comes of age,

128
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,210
I will not stop for a moment.

129
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,190
Does this make sense?

130
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,670
That man has returned from the dead and started to shake up the royal court.

131
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,130
What are you going to do?

132
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,800
I have to act the elder brother.

133
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,530
Marry him off and teach him about the world.

134
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,780
Are you saying that we should hasten Grand Prince Eun Seong's marriage?

135
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,400
Even though we've shortened the national mourning period due to the ascension ceremony...

136
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,880
I know I'm being impudent,

137
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,560
but since the situation is what it is when it comes to Grand Prince Eun Seong...

138
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,260
Once I was reluctant to welcome my friend Ja Hyeon as the wife of my husband's brother.

139
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,550
But they were separated by the war for three years.

140
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,190
I feel that it would do no good to the energy of the royal family

141
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,340
to keep the lovers pining after one another.

142
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,620
There's a truth to what she says, Queen Mother.

143
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,630
I feel pity for the lady of the Seong family.

144
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,490
Even in the previous eras, royal marriages have taken place

145
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,860
during the national mourning period under special circumstances.

146
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,670
Why don't you approve of it, Your Highness?

147
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,780
I am concerned about preserving customs since the king is so young.

148
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,320
What if they say that the proprieties have collapsed because the king is too young?

149
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,220
No, Queen Mother. I consulted a seer just in case.

150
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,710
It was said that Grand Prince Eun Seong's marriage would revive the royal household.

151
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,000
Please inform the seo woon gwan (office of divination) and get an auspicious day.

152
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,210
 (Seo Woon Gwan: an office that determined dates for important events based on Korean astrology).

153
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,800
 Dragon Tiger

154
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,620
Lady! Lady!

155
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,910
What's the matter?

156
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,450
The grand prince's wife is here.

157
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,700
- Na Gyeom? 
 - She's in the sitting room.

158
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,380
What is she up to now?

159
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,030
These are the matrimonial dates from Grand Prince Eun Seong.

160
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,330
Huh?

161
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,970
I thought that the marriage was not going to happen any time soon.

162
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,020
I implored Queen Mother to move up the wedding.

163
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,990
I am so grateful.

164
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,310
I was sad to watch Ja Hyeon slowly becoming an old maid.

165
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,710
It's good to have friends.

166
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,260
Thank you. Thank you!

167
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,870
But in return, she has to agree to not hold the wedding officially.

168
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,230
It has to be a low profile wedding.

169
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,730
That's why I've brought the matrimonial date, contrary to the royal protocol.

170
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,140
Aigoo, I understand that.

171
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,660
You have to see Ja Hyeon before you leave.

172
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,680
Yes I should.

173
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,900
There she comes!

174
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,500
My daughter, your friend brought some really happy news.

175
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,380
 It's an ornament of friendship.

176
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,320
 How pretty. I will treasure it.

177
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,630
What are you up to?

178
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,720
I am  disappointed. I went through all this trouble for you.

179
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,460
You were dying to marry me off to some other family.

180
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,670
Why do you act as if you're on my side all of a sudden?

181
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:49,080
I just wanted you to forget your dead lover and meet someone new.

182
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,380
Do you expect me to believe that?

183
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,810
Like it or not, we are fated to become in-laws.

184
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:00,890
Shouldn't we make up at least for the sake of peace in the royal household?

185
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,280
I brought the official date for the nuptials.

186
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,470
I'm sure you still hate me.

187
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,850
To be honest, I too am not comfortable around you.

188
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,350
But still we can't continue as enemies, can we?

189
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,520
The two brothers' relationship is not too good either.

190
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,770
What good will come out of it if the elders find out about our grudge?

191
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,750
Are you being sincere?

192
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,800
Time will tell what my sincerity is.

193
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,120
As to what I am thinking, you will have to watch as time passes.

194
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,890
But if you wish to become a member of the royal family,

195
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,540
I hope you'll get along well with me even for appearance's sake.

196
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,550
If you accept me, I too will make an effort.

197
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,240
I do not wish to make the elders worry either.

198
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,550
Go back inside.

199
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,380
Don't trust her, Lady. She's a snake.

200
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,190
Have you forgotten how much she tormented you for no reason all this time?

201
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,420
How can I forget that?

202
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,030
She always rubbed salt in my wound.

203
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,520
Exactly!

204
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,950
But we are going to become family now.

205
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,910
Whatever we have in our minds, we both have to make an effort to get along.

206
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,740
If you succeed, the grand prince will give you a greater prize.

207
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,570
Money is not the problem.

208
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a way out of your lowly origin into a better world.

209
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,880
There won't be any armed men around, so things will go smoothly.

210
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,900
I know that

211
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,960
not even a rat can make it out alive if your men set their minds to it.

212
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,860
Give me a list of people we must eliminate.

213
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,940
 Selection of Auspicious Date

214
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,440
This is the date of our great cause.

215
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,560
 The wedding day will be on April 3rd, 1453 (Year of Tenth of Ten Heavenly Stems, and Tenth of Twelve Earthly Branches)

216
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,030
Isn't this the day of Eun Seong's wedding?

217
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,730
It's a day when our enemies will be gathered in one spot.

218
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,580
Right State Minister Kim Chu normally travels with his guards around him.

219
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,540
We haven't had opportunities at home or outside,

220
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,010
but this will be the day when they will feel no need to have security.

221
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,220
Tell our ministers not to attend the ceremony.

222
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:23,030
It's a singular opportunity to get rid of Grand Prince Eun Seong and all of our enemies at once.

223
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,320
What about the king?

224
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,880
We'll leave him to Eun Seong.

225
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,080
Once Grand Prince Eun Seong runs to the king, we will have smoke coming out of the king's quarters.

226
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,710
Once he evacuates the king believing there is a fire,

227
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,430
we will use it as an evidence of Eun Seong's treason.

228
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,080
Once I finish the job at the wedding ceremonial house,

229
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,120
I want you to go and tell the queen dowager this, Uncle.

230
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,800
That out of his desire to ascend to the throne, Eun Seong

231
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,310
killed Right Minister Kim Chu, and attacked the palace.

232
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,470
Therefore she needs to place Eun Seong under arrest.

233
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,680
Eun Seong will not take this lying down.

234
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,950
Does he not have the weapon that he could threaten you with, my nephew.

235
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,490
That's why we need to take this path.

236
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,870
We don't know when he will come out to attack us with it.

237
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,610
Before we are attacked we have to hit him first.

238
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:26,090
Rather than living in fear of being found out all my life,

239
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,510
I will be the victor and take everything Eun Seong owns from him.

240
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,700
Queen Regent will not believe this easily.

241
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,600
A witness will appear.

242
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,230
Someone everyone will have absolutely no choice but to believe in.

243
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,970
Is there no chance that Eun Seong will become suspicious of this?

244
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,730
He's so deep in the dreamy state of being a groom, he will not know anything.

245
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,200
He's doubted me the whole time he's been back,

246
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,030
but he couldn't possibly think that his wedding day will also be

247
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,750
the day of his death.

248
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,900
They'll need to like their newlywed home.

249
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,080
Whose house is this?

250
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,860
I don't know. Queen Mother sent me to visit it with you.

251
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,630
First, let's go in.

252
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,450
You're asking for it, aren't you?

253
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
Welcome.

254
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,620
Why are you here?

255
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,980
Queen Mother asked me to show you your new home.

256
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,620
Since taking care of the royal houses was my duty in your absence, I took care of this house, too.

257
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,510
Take a look around.

258
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,770
I've heard that you didn't want a new house.

259
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,290
I didn't think we should build a new house when there are many vacant homes.

260
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,820
Even if it isn't a new house, is that okay?

261
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Why would it matter?

262
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,200
As long as I am with you, I don't mind even if it's a house with a thatched roof.

263
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,090
Sounds like the lady who even followed him to the battlefield.

264
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,160
This is your living quarters, Lady Ja Hyeon.

265
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,290
You can go and look at it.

266
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,590
How does it feel to be with your loved one after traveling such distances?

267
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,110
I'm always scared every night.

268
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm scared that if I wake up from my sleep, I won't be in Joseon's land

269
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,950
but in that terrible prison.

270
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,090
The comfortable bed I sleep on is unfamiliar to me.

271
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,750
These soft silk clothes seem like they belong to another person.

272
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:23,220
The lover in front of me, I do not know if she is a dream or reality.

273
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,120
After returning alive from almost dying and having the woman you want,

274
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,200
you should live happily with her.

275
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,270
Don't put your life on the line for politics that you've never cared about before.

276
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,360
I've seen it.

277
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,510
Our people who were taken to another country like horses and cows

278
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,910
and living a life like that of the animals.

279
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,020
The life of prisoners of war, which was much worse than that of slaves.

280
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,900
Their life of pain and suffering even though they were innocent,

281
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,410
I experienced it myself as well.

282
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,750
His Majesty is still young and has a long way to go before he can rule on his own.

283
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,900
Because of your greed, you sold off this nation

284
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,010
and pushed innocent people into the valley of hell.

285
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,960
Therefore, you have no right to be a king.

286
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,610
Please do not forget about my warning.

287
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,500
You don't know the feeling of having something you want taken from you, do you?

288
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,120
That's because I have never wanted something that wasn't mine.

289
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,550
One day, you'll realize it too,

290
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,050
how painful that frustration is.

291
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,730
This will be your chamber, right, Lady?

292
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,430
It's large, isn't it?

293
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,440
Come inside and see.

294
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,540
Come inside, I said.

295
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,530
Have a seat.

296
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,130
I heard that you helped His Highness for a long time.

297
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,050
I wanted to repay you.

298
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,390
Is there anything you need?

299
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:41,350
Hey, say something. Do you not know how to speak our language?

300
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,050
I do.

301
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,960
You know how His Highness lived in the past three years, right?

302
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,060
How he suffered through hardships and what he did.

303
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,090
- You're curious? 
 - Why are you speaking informally–

304
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,590
It's fine, since she's not great in speaking our language (Korean).

305
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,220
As long as she understands the meaning of what we say, it's okay.

306
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,270
We were ...

307
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,130
together day and night.

308
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,440
You!

309
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,030
Hwi, Gi Teuk, and I stuck by each other.

310
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,780
Smallpox was going around in the winter in the north.

311
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:30,630
The Joseon prisoners couldn't even get treatment and many died.

312
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,530
Your Highness, are you alright?

313
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,920
Your Highness! Your Highness!

314
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,530
Your Highness, come to your senses!

315
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,690
Let me go! Your Highness!

316
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,350
His Highness is alive!

317
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,340
Your Highness!

318
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,160
Your Highness!

319
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,190
Your Highness!

320
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,020
I saved his life.

321
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,810
Had it not been for me, Hwi

322
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,260
would've died.

323
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:41,160
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

324
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:48,210
♫  In a life together  ♫

325
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:55,020
♫  Living and living  ♫

326
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:04,160
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

327
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,140
Your Highness! Your Highness!

328
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,310
- What do we do? 
 - Come on.

329
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,310
Roo Si Gae!

330
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:21,650
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

331
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:28,540
♫   In a life together   ♫

332
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,890
I will never forget you.

333
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,500
Please live a long life.

334
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,250
Be well, everyone.

335
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Your Highness!

336
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,470
Your Highness.

337
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,460
Please live a long life.

338
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,350
Hwi, who came back alive, brought out all the prisoners of war.

339
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,390
Everyone went back to their homes.

340
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,840
Your name's Roo Si Gae, right?

341
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,720
I envy you.

342
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,010
You've spent more time next to Hwi than I have.

343
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,540
You know things I don't know.

344
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,960
You overcame a life or death moment together with him.

345
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,790
You traveled a long path with him.

346
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,700
Perhaps, you have a stronger relationship with him than I do.

347
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,300
Why are you envying a commoner who was serving the prince?

348
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,290
Just give her what you brought and send her off.

349
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,870
I didn't know what you'd need, so

350
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,810
I brought you ribbons, socks, and clothing ornaments.

351
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:57,210
If I could know your size, I want to give you a chima-jeogori (traditional dress and jacket), too.

352
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,660
If you need anything else, you can tell me.

353
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,640
Thank you

354
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,060
for protecting His Highness.

355
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,500
Why do you keep crying?

356
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,460
I didn't know His Highness had suffered so much.

357
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,600
I was just so happy when he came back.

358
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,510
If you're done looking around, we can go back–

359
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,370
What happened?

360
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,550
Why is she crying?

361
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,270
Did you say something strange?

362
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,970
This, why would she leave this? Hey, take this!

363
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,420
If you dislike this house, we don't have to live here.

364
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,010
There are many royal houses, so we could ask them to give us another house.

365
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,700
Why are you crying?

366
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,920
The past three years,

367
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,130
when you were going through a hard time and suffering,

368
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,010
when you were scared and starving, the fact that I couldn't go through that with you

369
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,520
hurts me so much.

370
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,300
You had to suffer through that by yourself.

371
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,980
I regret it so much.

372
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,100
Lady, you were always by my side.

373
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,600
When I fell, you yelled at me to get back up.

374
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,170
When I cried, you wiped my tears away.

375
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,790
When I was feeling exhausted, you encouraged me to cheer up.

376
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,210
Every moment, your prayers were

377
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,990
endlessly reaching me. I felt them.

378
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,580
Do not feel hurt over our past goodbyes. Now,

379
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,160
let's be happy for the rest of our lives that we'll spend together.

380
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,920
- What's wrong with you? You have to serve His Highness first before going. 
 - I'm not.

381
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,460
If you don't, then is there anywhere for you to go?

382
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,810
What's wrong?

383
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,370
I don't like that woman.

384
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,150
Hey, she's about to be the prince's bride.

385
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,290
Since His Highness accepted your behavior, you must think it's okay to fool around.

386
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,950
This is Joseon. The rules of the palace are strict.

387
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,410
- Can't we just go back? 
  - You've gone crazy.

388
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,700
There are too many people here.

389
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,710
I can't even go to see Hwi as I wish.

390
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,770
Why are you still freely saying His Highness' name–

391
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,220
If you guys aren't going, then I will.

392
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,270
Do as you wish. But if you go back, you could be beaten to death.

393
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,540
If that's truly your wish, then go.

394
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,310
Don't be stubborn. Hurry and come.

395
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,840
How was it? I had people working on it here and there.

396
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,490
If you want to fix something else, tell me.

397
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,070
Not at all. You took care of everything well, so it seems like a new house.

398
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,860
We just need to fill it with our own things.

399
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,750
Are you happy?

400
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,960
To the point that I'm scared.

401
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,960
In all the time you were waiting,

402
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,060
- was there never a time when your feelings wavered? 
 - Hyungnim.

403
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,860
I never had a chance to.

404
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,010
Day and night, every moment, I missed the grand prince.

405
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:36,360
I couldn't think of anything else.

406
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,500
I trust that you know that more than anyone else.

407
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:50,760
Live well, you two. Happily.

408
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

409
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,380
If my brother gives you a tough time, let me know whenever.

410
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,850
- I'll solve them all for you. 
 - I'll make sure I live so that nothing becomes part of your business.

411
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,640
Do not worry. He is not someone who will break a promise.

412
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,980
You even kept your promise and came back.

413
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:37,230
♫   If I just keep walking like this endlessly   ♫

414
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:44,760
♫   It feels like I'll be able to see you   ♫

415
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:53,030
♫   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three   ♫

416
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm sorry. If we'd waited a bit more,

417
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,880
we could've made the wedding a bit more elaborate and decorated our house better.

418
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,810
No, I like how things are right now.

419
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,350
The word is that they couldn't make us wait any longer so we had to do it this way.

420
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,090
The royal family that had a young king rise to the throne

421
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:20,260
would need my father as one of his ministers as soon as possible.

422
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,380
Did you know?

423
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,950
I am a court minister's daughter.

424
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,710
The reason is good enough since I will be by your side.

425
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:37,220
♫   The places I want to go to, the places I need to go to   ♫

426
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:44,700
♫   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   ♫

427
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,050
♫   I just wanna follow this path to a place no one knows  ♫

428
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,960
- Go in. 
 - You can go first.

429
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,660
I will see you go in first.

430
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,120
Your Highness, I want to see you leave first.

431
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,290
♫   That it's you   ♫

432
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,940
I feel weird.

433
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:20,310
Roo Si Gae seems closer to His Highness than I am.

434
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,450
You should have her taken away.

435
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,120
She's not even a court lady. Why is she sticking by his side?

436
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,750
He said she saved his life.

437
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,380
They were together for three years as if they were one body.

438
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,050
I should be thankful to someone like that. How could I carelessly tell her to do this and that?

439
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,430
Lady, I feel like

440
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,270
I might or might not know what you're feeling, but

441
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,700
for the remaining days, you'll be together with him.

442
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,610
So don't worry about it.

443
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,230
Really?!

444
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,050
How can she be so careless toward someone's gesture of goodwill?

445
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:25,740
Roo Si Gae, or whoever, what if she has other ideas?

446
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,190
- Bring it over here. 
 - Yes.

447
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,060
Move this over.

448
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,690
Have you prepared the gift boxes?

449
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,740
Yes, Your Excellency.

450
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,740
Will you be okay by yourself? We can do it together if you need it.

451
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,190
You need to take care of my mother, Uncle.

452
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:08,720
- When I send the message, go to the queen's palace right away. 
 - Okay.

453
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,600
Have you secured the militia for the king's quarters?

454
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,260
They are not ones to betray me because I'm no longer part of the royal guards.

455
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,180
They've lived on the money coming from this house for many years.

456
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,730
They will do what I ask them to.

457
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,420
Take care of Ja Hyeon, my wife.

458
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,560
Are you telling me to bring Ja Hyeon here?

459
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,290
If we really want to make the right deal with the chief scholar,

460
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,780
the traitor's bride has to be the hostage.

461
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,130
I will lock her up well.

462
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,290
Don't let her get hurt.

463
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,790
We will get rid of all those who messed up the politics hiding behind the baby king.

464
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,520
Then, we will have no obstacles in the future.

465
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,580
Tomorrow, the world will change.

466
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,840
Our daughter is finally getting married.

467
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,640
I thought I'd need to live with you for the rest of my life.

468
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,880
I'll visit frequently.

469
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,810
As if.

470
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,430
There's one advantage to getting married into the royal family.

471
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:42,210
What advantage? There's going to be a lot that doesn't work out and a lot that you'll need to keep your eyes on.

472
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,160
Living apart from Mother-in-law.

473
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,680
I will be the boss since I don't have to live with the in-laws.

474
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,230
No one's going to say anything when I come back home.

475
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:55,930
Conniving already?  You could get into big trouble and get hauled into the palace.

476
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,660
What if they make you live in the palace?

477
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,200
Other people cry on the day of their wedding because they don't want to leave their family.

478
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,950
-  Are you really that happy? 
 - I am.

479
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,560
I don't even want to see you.

480
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,480
Then, should I not get married?

481
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,720
Do it. Go.

482
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,450
Live well.

483
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,340
You guys are fated lovers.

484
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,250
Until now, you've suffered a lot.

485
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,040
Starting tomorrow, you only have to walk on a flower path (live happily).

486
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,530
I'm sorry for making your heart break in the past.

487
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:48,140
Because of you, my lifespan has shortened by years.

488
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,940
I'll start being devoted to you from now.

489
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,740
Living well is your filial duty.

490
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,700
When you get married, you become an adult.

491
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,840
Even after getting married and becoming an adult,

492
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,360
I will never stop being your daughter.

493
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,880
Gosh, you scared me.

494
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,190
Are you that upset over the lady getting married?

495
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,420
Why are you crying?

496
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,060
Do you think I'm crying over Ja Hyeon?

497
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,940
Did something get in your eyes?

498
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,970
Does it really not matter to you?

499
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,940
Me? I'll follow the lady, anyway.

500
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,740
Once the lady gets married, nothing big will change.

501
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,220
For more than a decade, you had happy and sad moments in this house.

502
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,430
You're leaving me. Does it really not matter to you?

503
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:10,470
- Young Master. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Come to your senses!

504
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,670
I thought I'd live in this house with you for the rest of my life.

505
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:20,050
My heart hurts so much. You never even looked at me!

506
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,050
So, what?

507
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,180
Will you get married to me?

508
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,260
You can't, right?

509
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,470
Wow.

510
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,080
Then, what?

511
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,240
Should I wait until you get married and become your concubine?

512
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,850
Yeah. I was thinking—

513
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,850
- I don't want to. 
 - What?

514
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:46,620
Then, the chance that something could happen between us

515
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,240
doesn't even amount to this much, does it?

516
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:59,220
I have to wake up early tomorrow. Go in and sleep in haste. Okay?

517
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,100
This isn't how it should've been.

518
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,470
Let's go.

519
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,750
Are you really not going?

520
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,180
We're leaving now.

521
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,720
Come to your senses. His Highness is this country's grand prince.

522
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,390
If you have intense feelings, you'll be the only one getting hurt.

523
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,260
My feelings are my own.

524
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,060
Then, don't bring those out.

525
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:38,430
Keep your own feelings to yourself.  Don't show them to others.

526
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,170
Okay, here, here.

527
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:16,320
The groom has arrived. Let them know that the groom, Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi has arrived.

528
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,890
Yes.

529
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,100
Mother, the groom has arrived.

530
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,910
Really? You're ready, right? You're not missing anything?

531
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,410
Yes!

532
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,230
I'm the one who's nervous.

533
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,140
You went through a lot coming here.

534
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,110
Wait, why are there so many wedding gift boxes?

535
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:02,050
We agreed that it'd be a small wedding, but how many wedding gifts did you bring?

536
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,050
Will you see?

537
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,420
The wedding has to carry on first.

538
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,860
Why are you opening the wedding gifts first in the yard?

539
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,720
What are you doing?

540
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,080
Who the heck are you?

541
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,690
Mother, you must escape first!

542
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,240
Father!

543
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,280
What's this noise?

544
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,530
Lady, hold on. I'll take a look outside.

545
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,200
What's happening?

546
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,390
Lady!

547
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,710
- Hyungnim! 
 - Are you okay?

548
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,050
Call the security, now!

549
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,440
Yes.

550
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,340
Lady!

551
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:22,400
- Lady, it's a war! 
 - What?

552
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,980
People are dying and everyone's fighting!

553
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,720
No! If you leave, you'll die!

554
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,700
Lady!

555
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,850
Your Excellency!

556
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,280
Your Excellency!

557
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,750
- The palace. Go to the palace, Your Highness! 
 - Let's go together!

558
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:09,530
They are rebel army... Please go and protect His Majesty!

559
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,550
Something may happen to the king.

560
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,790
Your son died instead of me, as well.

561
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,630
I can't leave you behind.

562
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:25,440
Please do not let me die in vain.

563
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,510
Go and protect the king!

564
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,390
Your Excellency!

565
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,090
Your Excellency!

566
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,150
Your Excellency!

567
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,670
Your Highness!

568
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,710
Don't come close!

569
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,090
What is this? Who would do this?

570
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:12,140
We don't know yet. Stay close behind me!

571
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:22,930
Let's go to the palace.  Something serious has happened.

572
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:27,480
Hurry.  What if they attack the palace?

573
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:39,010
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

574
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,630
You should go.

575
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,880
Please go and protect the king.

576
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,020
Leave your brother with me.

577
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,140
We'll take responsibility for this household's family members.

578
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:00,270
Hurry and let the palace know of this situation.

579
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,000
Nothing will happen.

580
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,110
Your Highness, what's going on here? They were after Grand Prince Jin Yang and the ministers.

581
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:38,290
Let's get to the palace first and check if the king is safe.

582
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,530
Ja Hyeon!

583
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,580
Are you okay? Are you not hurt anywhere?

584
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,070
What about you, Father? Mother, are you okay?

585
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:25,130
Who is it? Whose order did you receive?

586
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:45,340
I asked, who ordered you to do this?

587
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,220
I don't know.

588
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,890
Eun Seong.

589
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,580
Eun Seong.

590
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,820
It was Grand Prince Eun Seong's order.

591
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:27,200

595
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:48,760
 Arrest the grand prince for starting a rebellion and causing the death of ministers!

596
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,270
  I will protect the king.

597
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,260
 Give me the title of prime minister.

598
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,770
 Can you promise that you won't want anything more than that?

599
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:59,810
 I will punish the traitors and protect the king.
