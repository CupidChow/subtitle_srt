1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,640
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,340
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

3
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,870

At the palace today, I'm sure they fervently discussed the installation of the king's younger brother as the heir.

4
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,910
  Without any royal offspring, the next one in line for the crown is you.

5
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,670
  There's no need for you to be anxious.

6
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,920
  Your brother as the crown prince? How dare they?

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,350
  Even if Uncle has ill intentions,

8
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,110
 it will be fine if my brother isn’t swayed.

9
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,000
  I roamed across the mountains all day, looking for things that could nurse you back to health.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,460
  He is a greedy child. He's different from Eun Seong.

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,180
  Lady. Lady.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,130
  You got cut from the bride-to-be classes.

13
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,550
  I heard that you were ditching? Because of that, you're prohibited from leaving.

14
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,750
  You're not only rude but also shameless.

15
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,330
  What makes you think you can speak informally to me?  How old are you?

16
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,360
 Who told you to speak informally to a lady from a noble family, just because she's a woman?

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,800
  Then why don't you speak informally, too?

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,400
  Please don't forget my face and my name.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,800
 I thought he was only good at literature and art, but he's pretty good at horseback riding too.

20
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,770
  But still, we have you.

21
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,560
  You are the best at martial arts in the city.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,790
  Still, we'd need an alternative plan.

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,200
  I want to draw living things.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,570
  Things that are this big and aggressive.

25
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,920
 The blue-clothed team will have a player replacement!

26
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,890
  Oh, wow.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,960
  What do I do? What do I do?  What should I do?

28
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,750
 Episode 3

29
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,900
- Sim Jung Cheon (Deep Blue Pigment)?
- Lee from Gwanggwang District?

30
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,360
You made a big deal about being a maiden from a noble family, but today you're a house servant.

31
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,530
Who are you exactly?

32
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,160
What does that have to do with you?

33
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,820
Move aside. I have to leave.

34
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,350
I think the intruder here is you, not me.

35
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,610
I got lost and came into the wrong room. That's all.

36
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,650
Which palace spy are you? Are you the one who messed with my horse, too?

37
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,260
What are you talking about?

38
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,230
We met at the art supply store, and you were hiding in my room, of all places?

39
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,750
I don't even know where this place is.

40
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,650
Please tell me honestly.

41
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,720
If you aren't a spy from another palace,

42
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,740
are you one of those looking to change her fortune?

43
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,680
You must be one of the many girls

44
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,700
who are fixed on becoming royalty?

45
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,600
That's what I'm asking.

46
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm not interested in lowly, royal playboys.

47
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Whether I am or not, that's none of your business.

48
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Whether I am a maiden from a noble family or a house servant,

49
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,860
there's no reason for me to be hearing these nasty insults from you.

50
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Didn't you come intentionally to see me?

51
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,450
I said I got lost.

52
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,040
I was on my way out!

53
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,500
Then, why were you hiding in the first place? What are you after?

54
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,750
Congratulations.

55
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,060
Congratulations on the win, Your Highness. It was a great game.

56
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,000
A soldier leaving his post during a battle?

57
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
Had it been a real war, you would've been dead.

58
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,520
I apologize. An unavoidable thing came up.

59
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,930
Know that you'll be spared today due to our win.

60
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,520
From now on, Seong Deuk Sik will be left out of the key players.

61
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,950
At today's celebration,

62
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,750
it'll be better for you not to show your face.

63
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,380
That Ja Hyeon...

64
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,570
Do you want me to tell you again?

65
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm not after anything. I came here not knowing where this place was.

66
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,790
If it hadn't been for you, I would've left already.

67
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,500
Which family's daughter are you?

68
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,080
Or whose house servant—

69
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,880
Gosh.

70
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,420
You should have a doctor look at it right away.

71
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,630
Did you come back because you were worried about me?

72
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,600
It's not that I was worried about you.

73
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,410
But if you died after losing blood,

74
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,810
I thought I'd be blamed for it.

75
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,450
Okay?

76
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,530
Ah, I thought you'd come to take back what you left behind.

77
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,270
There.

78
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,430
Drawing horses should be different from drawing orchids.

79
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,630
For the horse's mane, you should've used a rough brush to draw it in a tough manner.

80
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm crazy. I should've known better than coming here to hear good things.

81
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,050
Who are you?  Where do you live?

82
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,140
Tell me your identity.

83
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,380
I have to know who you are.

84
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:30,550

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,540
What are you doing standing there? Hurry up and leave.

86
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,990
Sh-She entered the wrong room.

87
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,700
Come in.

88
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,490
Let's go to your quarters. A royal physician will be waiting there.

89
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,830
There's no need for that. It's nothing anyway.

90
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,880
Thanks to you falling off the horse, I won the game too easily.

91
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,250
They say that luck is a skill too.  The red team was stronger.

92
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,620
Next time, let's properly compete.

93
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,190
We should congratulate the victorious and console the defeated.

94
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,790
I've arranged for the best gisaengs in the city to be on standby for my brother.

95
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,590
Please, what gisaengs.

96
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,220
You say you want to get married but what if you don't know what to do on your first (wedding) night?

97
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,000
Tonight, I'll make a real man out of my brother.

98
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,350
Aish.

99
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,670
Why in the world do we run into each other all over the place?

100
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,780
That.  That. That's...

101
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,170
Is that girl really our Ja Hyeon?

102
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,150
Won't you stop right there?

103
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,610
- Hey! 
 - Ugh!

104
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,280
Ugh, that-that!

105
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,270
Let go of this.

106
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,730
This is embarrassing. Why are you like this?

107
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,920
If you are embarrassed, how can you come here looking like that?

108
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Ah, really.

109
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,580
What could she be thinking acting like that?

110
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,110
Is she crazy? Where does she think this is?

111
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,710
This place is filled with royal family members and Sungkyunkwan Confucian scholars.

112
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,240
Look at her clothes. What is that?

113
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,630
It's obvious. She's not allowed outside so she disguised herself.

114
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,080
This is too precious to be seen alone.

115
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,500
- It's cute. 
 - If she acts cute one more time, it could be the end of her.

116
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,180
Let's go visit her later.

117
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,690
Let's listen to the whole story.

118
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,940
She is the Chief Scholar's daughter.

119
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,160
She wasn't a maid, but Deuk Sik's sister?

120
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,020
The Chief Scholar's daughter was visiting the Grand Prince in the waiting room.

121
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,210
We'll have to change the location of the after party.

122
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,980
Please wait in your quarters.

123
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
I'll alert you when the baby is born.
  Queen Mother Shim

124
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,320
Has the royal physician arrived?

125
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,980
Leave it to your mother.

126
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,440
If the child is born safely, it is good news for the nation.

127
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,570
However, if anything goes wrong...

128
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,460
- Mother!. 
 - Then we have to bury it like it never happened.

129
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,180
Starting from the previous queen,

130
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,640
whenever the royal concubines have become pregnant, we have lost all the heirs.

131
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,440
The people believe that our royal family is cursed.

132
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,280
Leave and wait. Quietly, as if nothing is happening.

133
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,940
 Hyo Bin (of the family) Kim
(royal consort)

134
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,950
The head.

135
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,820
The head.

136
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,380
We do not see the head.

137
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,830
The baby is upside down.
  Yeok Ah (breech birth): not a head-first delivery.

138
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,470
If the feet come out first, she must prick them with a needle to change its (the baby's) position.

139
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,370
When it has turned somewhat, hold the baby in the womb by the head and turn it.

140
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,410
Keep the baby alive.

141
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,200
The baby is more important than the mother.

142
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,620
The mother must live for the baby to survive.

143
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,550
If the mother loses strength, the baby will be in danger.

144
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,430
No matter what, you need to save the baby.

145
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,740
If you lose the royal heir again, you will not be forgiven.

146
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,660
If you can't touch the baby's head, apply salt to the mother's stomach,

147
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,160
grab the baby's ankle and pull it out.

148
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,250
Is it alive? Is it a son?

149
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,990
Is there no one there?

150
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,420
Hurry and bring me snacks.

151
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,780
I'm peckish.

152
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,090
Here is what you asked for.

153
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,440
Do you need anything else?

154
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,680
Yes, try to massage my shoulders.

155
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,970
Ah, not there.

156
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,590
Right, that's right.   More pressure.

157
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,300
That's it. It's very refreshing.

158
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,330
Madam!

159
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,280
You wench! Rather than stopping your lady,

160
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,420
you help her by taking her place?

161
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,110
You're really trying to get kicked out, aren't you?

162
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,890
Do you want to be sold off to some far-off island?

163
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,010
I made her do it! I did.  I forced her to take off her clothes.

164
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,640
She was forced to do it and yet she was laughing and pretending to be a lady?

165
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,010
I heard it all outside.

166
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,190
Madam, I'll never do it again!

167
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,260
I think scabs are going to grow on my ears.

168
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,210
It isn't the first or second time I've heard that out of your mouth.

169
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,730
It's all my fault. Kkeut Dan only did what I told her to do.

170
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,260
Nothing we can do even if it's her misfortune to meet a bad mistress.

171
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,250
I have no choice but to send you away.

172
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,930
- Madam! 
 - Mother!

173
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,450
I can't send my own daughter away, can I?

174
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,010
- Lady! 
 - No!

175
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,730
- Take her away! 
 - Mother!

176
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,440
My lady! I did wrong, Mom!

177
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
Kkeut Dan!

178
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,660
Send her to the broker.

179
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,280
I don't care about the price. If anyone wants her, tell them to sell her right away.

180
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,350
Madam, I've done wrong. Please save me.

181
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,710
Please don't send me away.

182
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,570
What?  Why is Kkeut Dan the one being punished?

183
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,370
If you want me to take the lashing, I will. I'll starve if you ask.

184
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,270
Won't you change out of those clothes?

185
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,430
You can't do this to her.

186
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,590
If you didn't have a maid, you would have never dreamed of doing this.

187
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,250
This is all because of that wench who backed you and helped you.

188
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,020
I'm ordering the two of you to be separated, as requested by your father.

189
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,700
Then I'm leaving too!

190
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,920
- What? 
 - If you send Kkeut Dan away, I'll shave my head and go into the mountains

191
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,970
to become a monk!

192
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,860
You! Are you threatening your mother?

193
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,090
Do you think I can't?

194
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,620
Mother, Mother, this is not the time to do this.

195
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,210
No. This time, I have to really give them an example—

196
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,400
The Grand Princes are coming to our house.

197
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,190
What? The Grand Princes? Why? Where?

198
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,580
Prince Jin Yang has given us the honor of putting on a celebratory feast at our house.

199
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,940
- Oh my. 
 - It is a golden opportunity for me to recover from the match.

200
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,270
Prince Jin Yang told us to merely provide a location and that

201
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,600
he would prepare all the other food and necessary things,

202
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,780
but how could we meet him with empty hands?

203
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,660
- Please hurry! 
 - This isn't an honor. It's being struck by lightning.

204
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,260
You, and you. What do we have in the kitchen?

205
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,910
No that's not it, the storage rooms. Open the storage rooms.

206
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,730
Kkeut Dan!

207
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,460
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

208
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,270
Don't worry about this. I'll take care of it like nothing happened.

209
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,650
Take her inside and give her some calming medicine or something.

210
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,020
Did you have to act like you recognized me?

211
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,080
- What? 
 - If you'd just closed your eyes, none of this would've happened.

212
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,800
Are you seriously not thinking of what you did, but blaming me instead?

213
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,420
How can you not let anything go by, even once?

214
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,870
Because of you, I couldn't even play polo and ended up like this.

215
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,920
I could've been killed by Grand Prince Jin Yang.

216
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,700
Are you all right? Shouldn't you see a physician?

217
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,330
How could he whip someone?

218
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,810
If you block my path again, it won't be Kkeut Dan who gets kicked out, but you.

219
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,140
So please just stay in your room as if you were dead.

220
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,810
Stop embarrassing the family.

221
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,240
Brother...

222
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,190
How did I do? Was I scary like a tigress madam?

223
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,560
They were shaking in their boots.

224
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,930
I thought Kkeut Dan would be sold off for real.

225
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:44,170
If I hadn't come forward and made such a big deal, the men in this household would've killed Ja Hyeon by now.

226
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,780
You are really considerate.

227
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,880
Should I use this opportunity to transform from a soft person to a strict, tigress madam?

228
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,800
How about just doing things the way you normally do?

229
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,190
- I should, right? 
 - Yes.

230
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,760
It doesn't really suit me, right?

231
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,630
No, it does not, ma'am.

232
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,570
- For the rice, use the best ones. This and this. 
 - Yes.

233
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,420
- First, cook the rice. Send someone to the butcher shop to get all the beef and pork they have. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

234
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,550
Then, catch three to four big chickens from the chicken coop.

235
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,010
Then, open the liquor storage. I'll have to see which ones are worthy enough to put on the table.

236
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,020
Of course, ma'am.

237
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,540
- Since we have to do all these things in a short time, it won't be enough with the people we have now. 
 - Yes.

238
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,790
Ask around the at neighbors' for skilled female cooks.

239
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,320
Yes, Ma'am.

240
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,450
You, go find them quickly.

241
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm Cho Ee.

242
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,460
I'm Nae Yang.

243
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,870
I'm Weol Hwa.

244
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,690
Left State Minister Kim Chu is making a big deal about picking the king's wife.

245
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,060
To order a selection for a queen and creating a commotion at a time like this.

246
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,370
That's putting a lot of pressure on the royal family.

247
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,650
Since his daughter's a concubine, he's after the queen's title.

248
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,990
Since the concubine has been pregnant, my mother has been keeping an eye on her. 
  Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang

249
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,850
What good is it? No one has been able to deliver an offspring for the king. 
  Grand Prince Yang Ahn

250
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,940
The queen and the royal concubines were able to conceive, but never able to give birth.

251
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,260
That's the fate of those people.

252
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,190
This is the chance indeed.

253
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,300
A time when there is no queen and no heir.

254
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,630
Uncle, you made those women's fates that way.

255
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,600
You even swayed the opinion of the court ministers.

256
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,750
Surely a decision will be made soon.

257
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,940
Oh, yes.

258
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,660
I am Cho Yoo Kyung.

259
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,940
Don't we have to find out the truth about who's behind this?

260
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,410
It's either someone who's wishing for the blue team to lose,

261
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,590
or someone who's hoping to see me get hurt. 
   Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi

262
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,430
That's what I mean, sir.

263
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:43,070
Who do you think it'd be? If it's the former, it's a player on the opposing team.

264
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,540
If it's the latter, it's someone who hates me.

265
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,100
Even if both of them are discovered, it just causes a commotion.

266
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,590
Your Highness!

267
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,790
The royal family has been feeling gloomy with a series of royal funerals.

268
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,490
I don't want to cause any more commotion.

269
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,690
Every time something like this happens to you, you try to move past it.

270
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,100
What do you think a grand prince's duty is?

271
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,520
This royal family has been created through a bloodbath and chaos.

272
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,390
While the king dreams of being a good ruler, what do you think I should do as his brother?

273
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,320
For the king to do that, my duty is to promote the peace and harmony of the royal family.

274
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,940
What about you, Your Highness? Do you have no other dreams?

275
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,860
Is that all that you wish for?

276
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,820
I'm sorry toward this kid.

277
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,800
This animal that cannot talk has suffered due to a human's nasty act.

278
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,680
I worry about you more than this horse, Your Highness.

279
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,570
You're the ginyeo (entertainer/gisaeng) who threw the ball today.

280
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,780
It's an honor that you recognized me.

281
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,500
Do you know who caught your ball?

282
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,670
It was your younger brother, Grand Prince Eun Seong, right?

283
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,170
He's been let down after losing today. Can you comfort him?

284
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,720
Is that what you want?

285
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,870
Hwi does not know much about women yet.

286
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,630
If you make him into a man, I'll give you a great prize.

287
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,010
I'm a trainee who is practicing to become a musical entertainer (type of gisaeng).

288
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,710
I'm not some kind of lowly gisaeng who uses her body carelessly.

289
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,330
The gisaeng that playboys in this capital are selling their house deeds

290
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,700
and lining up for is you.

291
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,600
She's rumored to be arrogant and cocky.

292
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,150
The thrill of seeing beautiful women is taming such arrogance.

293
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,070
Why are you passing her to your brother? You should have her first.

294
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:54,910
I'll make the choice. I'll see which of the two grand princes wins my heart.

295
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,660
What'd you say?

296
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,830
You're putting too much faith in your beauty and playing recklessly.

297
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,520
How dare you covet me? Just get my younger brother.

298
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:26,930
If you fail, all the talk by those men about who you are will be for naught.

299
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,830
Then, I'll see you at the party.

300
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,510
She's quite something, is she not?

301
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,420
Why don't you have her? Why give her to your younger brother?

302
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:29,720
With her beauty and that kind of nerve, it's a waste to keep her as a mistress.

303
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,760
- Then what?  
- Instead of making her my woman, I'm going make her one of my people.

304
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,340
If she were to be one of your people...

305
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,980
Of the methods used to fight, there is none greater than using one's beauty.

306
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,490
If it's Cho Yoo Kyung, don't you think her beauty would be the best weapon I could have?

307
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,440
If you're going to accomplish great things, you need all sorts of people.

308
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,180
A person is the weapon?

309
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,860
The after-party is at Chief Scholar's house, right?

310
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,480
Minister Seong does not reveal his mind easily.

311
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,910
It's hard to tell whether he's our friend or foe.

312
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,850
Wasn't his son on the red team, like you?

313
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,010
He also has a daughter.

314
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:30,820
If my wife-to-be, from the Yoon family who has no father, was from that family, he would be on my side.

315
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,350
Just go with the flow.

316
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,710
You said to make the flow.

317
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,070
I'll see you at the party. Let's go together.

318
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,020
I can't just squeeze in amongst young people so shamelessly.

319
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,790
A back room elder like me has other things to do.

320
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,920
Your Highness.

321
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,690
You are to come to the house of the Chief Scholar before the sundown.

322
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,940
Grand Prince Jin Yang has left already to make preparations.

323
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:53,380
You mean the young master from the art supply store had his clothes off?

324
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,310
Not all of over, just the upper half.

325
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,950
What are you going to do, my lady?

326
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,610
Gosh, now your  chance of getting married is ruined. It's over, it's done.

327
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,510
It's not like I wanted to see it. He didn't know I was there when he took off his clothes.

328
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,710
You should have screamed of something. You should have stopped him.

329
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,740
I was so surprised, I couldn't think of anything.

330
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,070
How was it? 
 What do you mean?

331
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,640
He is really handsome. Does he also have a nice body?

332
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,680
How inappropriate of you.

333
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,110
Huh? Tsk.

334
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,800
Who's the inappropriate one? Who's the one who saw him? Am I not allowed to ask?

335
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,190
I can't possibly unsee it. I have to forget it. I'm just going to erase it.

336
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,240
In a world where brushing past someone else is due to fate, if you keep meeting him like this, isn't this destiny?

337
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,600
What an exaggeration. If it's destiny, you have meet them three to four times.

338
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,160
You'll see him later, then. You said he played polo. He'll be coming to the after-party, right?

339
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,260
Whether he comes or not, why would I see him?

340
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,950
Destiny is just what we have between us.

341
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,410
Don't get married then.

342
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,500
I was touched earlier, so I will keep serving you throughout my life.

343
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,410
Sounds good. But, don't you get married, either.

344
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,820
I can still serve you even if I get married.
 Traitor.

345
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,410
Let's see who betrays whom first.

346
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,200
Is it all done?

347
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,560
Hurry and come in. Please take care of us.

348
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,480
  Drawing horses should be different from drawing orchids.

349
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,160
  For the horse's mane, you should've used a rough brush to draw it in a tough manner.

350
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,550
This way.

351
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,320
The food hasn't been prepared yet. If I knew you'd come this early, I...

352
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,930
Didn't I say that I would take care of everything?

353
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:59,060
Since this wasn't planned before, you just need to provide the place.

354
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,830
It is an honor to have such a precious guest like you here.

355
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,890
How could I meet you empty-handed?

356
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,300
I came early in order to apologize about what happened during the day.

357
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,490
How is your shoulder? I was a bit harsh.

358
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,690
No, you weren't, Your Highness.

359
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,450
At the game area earlier, I found this household's daughter in the waiting room.

360
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,770
Our Ja Hyeon?

361
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,450
If you have anything to say, you can say it now.

362
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,560
No, Grand Prince. My sister just wanted to find me.

363
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,620
Oh, I was just wondering.

364
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,280
Then, while we wait, why don't we have her pour some tea for us?

365
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,860
Sorry?

366
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,440
Is that such a difficult request?

367
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,180
- Come out, quickly! 
 - You shocked me!

368
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,260
- Quickly, my lady! 
 - Now, you don't even announce when you're here anymore.

369
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,090
This is not the time to be painting. Someone called for you.

370
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,570
- Who?
 - What do you mean who, the young master of course.

371
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,650
He's with the Grand Prince and wants you to bring tea.

372
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,480
- Why me? 
 - Because he's an honored guest!

373
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,740
He told me to stay still and not even show a strand of my hair outside.

374
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,030
Aren't you curious about what the grand prince looks like?

375
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,750
- Not at all.
 - I'm curious.

376
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,320
This is your only chance to see what a royal looks like.

377
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,480
If you don't go, I won't get to see him.

378
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,990
Why would I go over there? Gosh, seriously!

379
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,190
What is it, my lady?

380
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,830
Are you sure that person is the grand prince?

381
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,680
The maids went crazy saying he's Grand Prince Jin Yang.

382
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,360
What are you doing there? If you've come, introduce yourself.

383
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,960
What are you doing with your back turned? It's not good manners.

384
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,510
I have asked for a noble family's maiden to join us for tea. I hope I'm not intruding on our first meeting.

385
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,410
My lady, hurry and go up there.

386
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,300
Here.

387
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,520
My lady! Ah, I can't live.

388
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,400
- Are you okay? My lady!
 - I'm not okay.

389
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:43,000
Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?

390
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,310
I'm alright.

391
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,790
You should be more careful. What are you doing in front of His Highness?

392
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,880
I didn't know that you had such a beautiful sister.

393
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,390
Beautiful? She's such a tomboy.  My family has all but given up on her.

394
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:41,120
Is that so? Is that why her clothes were so different today?

395
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:47,700
That's because we prohibited her from going out but she stubbornly came up with the plan to disguise herself.

396
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,160
I know what her personality's like.

397
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,950
When she wants to do something, she has to do it.

398
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,680
If she'd been born as a boy, no one would make a fuss about it.

399
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,450
Since she's born a girl but acting like that, I'm greatly worried as her brother.

400
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:10,360
Who knows? If she was given wings, she might become a brilliant butterfly.

401
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,450
As of now, she is just a caterpillar that hasn't broken out of its skin.

402
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,980
You've pointlessly picked out a flaw about her tomboyishness.

403
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,300
Her manner is ever so gentle.

404
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,390
It's fake. She's pretending because Your Highness is here.

405
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,060
See? This is how she is.

406
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:05,540
If you'd stop picking on me, I'd be able to concentrate and do better.

407
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:20,040
Today's tea is not for Your Highness, but for my brother.

408
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,000
Hey! What are you trying to say?

409
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,240
Because of such an immature sister, he was disloyal and was treated as if he was an animal.

410
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,730
Hey!

411
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,860
You must wish for those under you to fear you, instead of respect you.

412
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,690
You punished a mistake using a whip.

413
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,610
I'm to blame for it. I can't be a person who comforts someone for a mistake.

414
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:52,450
If we have to pick something, I could be called a brave general.

415
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,530
Cruelty is not one of the qualities of a brave general.

416
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,190
Shut up! What do you know to be speaking in such a manner?

417
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,440
You have a good sister.

418
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,560
Her dedication to you is admirable.

419
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,410
I did apologize. What else should I do?

420
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm relieved that you've apologized.

421
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,850
Then will you forgive me?

422
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,270
It's not me who needs to forgive you, but my brother.

423
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,170
Are you crazy?

424
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,830
Come here.

425
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,820
Don't you know who you're talking to? Get out! Get out!

426
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,660
I'm sorry. It's my fault for not teaching my sister properly.

427
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,080
Please don't be offended by the words of a foolish girl.

428
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,530
It's the grand prince. Are you not even scared, my lady?

429
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,830
So what if he's a grand prince? He's a hooligan who whips people.

430
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,620
But he's handsome and really tall too.

431
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,580
The royal family is just so rude—

432
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,460
Oh my.

433
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,610
What brings you to our house?

434
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,450
He's probably here for the after party.

435
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,640
So I can speak comfortably (informally).

436
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,230
Since we agreed to lower honorifics until the end.

437
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,430
If you keep your manners, I will too.

438
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:57,310
Thank you for this afternoon. I apologize for the rudeness on my part.

439
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,970
And for the rudeness at the art shop.

440
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,200
I knew I was in the wrong, but I couldn't apologize right away.

441
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,250
Men sometimes are needlessly arrogant like that.

442
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,590
Doesn't being a real man mean knowing when

443
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,280
to acknowledge his wrongdoing?

444
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,740
It seems like I'm not a real man yet.

445
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,360
May I ask for your forgiveness?

446
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,610
It appears you're a real man right now.

447
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,740
Then, please come inside.

448
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,820
His Highness and my brother are waiting for you.

449
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,740
Excuse me.

450
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,950
Is that the guy you saw naked?

451
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,410
It's true, isn't it? I'm not making things up.

452
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,200
Be quiet. Are you trying to prevent me from getting married?

453
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,500
You're the one who said you didn't want to get married.

454
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,440
I meant I didn't want to. That's different from not being able to.

455
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,050
Since twice has become thrice, it's undoubtedly destiny.

456
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,900
I said not to put that label on just anything.

457
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,450
- Just a little.
 - Be quiet.

458
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,690
Now that we've initiated the discussion on appointing the younger brother as the heir,

459
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,770
Your Excellency must put his influence on it.

460
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,770
If the royal family members try to interfere, we must appeal.

461
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,650
Do not worry. We're prepared and waiting for our turn. 
  Prince Yang Ahn

462
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,350
If the ministers are not careful and come forth, we may be labeled as traitors.

463
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,830
The royal family members must come forth carefully. 
  Minister of Central Government: Jung Yeon

464
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,700
For the royal family, I gave up the chance to be king.

465
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:07,070
If I offer counsel for the royal family, who will speak against me?

466
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:12,980
However, His Majesty continues to push the decision toward the queen dowager.

467
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,230
Your Excellency! Something terrible has happened!

468
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,250
What is it?

469
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,260
We have heard there is trouble from the palace. 
  Yoon Ja Joon

470
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,770
Look at him, Your Majesty.

471
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:40,350
Finally, Your Majesty has an heir.

472
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:00,410
Would you like to hold him?

473
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,010
Your Majesty.

474
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,410
Thank you.

475
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,800
You have fulfilled the long-cherished wish of the royal family.

476
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,200
You have done a huge deed.

477
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:55,050

478
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,600
I think we may be too late.

479
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,560
For a celebration, isn't it suitable after the sun sets?

480
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,040
We came to see Ja Hyeon after all.

481
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,790
Really? Not me.

482
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,830
With that excuse, I came to see the men gathered at this house.

483
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,830
Why?

484
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,650
Let's go.

485
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,260
Congratulations on your success.

486
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,060
Could you kindly pour me a drink?

487
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,220
Your brother's love for you is deep.

488
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:12,890
I have received a command to accompany you tonight.

489
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:16,220
I normally quite enjoy your paintings and calligraphy,

490
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,090
so it  is an honor to accompany you.

491
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,560
There must be a mistake. I do not need a woman.

492
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:36,490
Didn't I warn you earlier? My brother is shy.

493
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,380
Am I not to your liking?

494
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,690
What kind of pathetic man lets himself be chosen by a giesang?

495
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,460
If you've said what you came to say, you can leave now.

496
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,680
To think that the day has come when Jo Yoo Kyung is rejected.

497
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,870
Do not speak so harshly.

498
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,100
My brother is normally not captivated by women.

499
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,700
Today is not the only day.

500
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:18,150
He is at his prime, and the night returns every day.

501
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,070
It's your mistake, Brother.

502
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:25,200
You shouldn't leave resentment in a woman.

503
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,430
So the grand prince is in the guesthouse?

504
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,640
Looking at the food and the gisaengs who came, it looks like they'll be up all night.

505
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,990
How many gisaengs came? Are they all pretty?

506
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,320
I didn't see any of them.

507
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,950
Shall we go and look?

508
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,300
To see how the grand princes are playing with gisaengs.

509
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,170
We can't go where they are,

510
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,000
so we have to make the grand princes come here.

511
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,760
Why would they come here? We can't do that.

512
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,450
Please.

513
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,450
Before I get married, I want to see the prince at least once.

514
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,620
The court ladies noticed me and I received goodwill from them,

515
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,020
but I want to know what my husband-to-be thinks of me.

516
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:30,520
Rather than what he thinks of you,  find out what kind of person he is.

517
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,720
You're going to help me, right?

518
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,980
You're working hard so late.

519
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,820
I don't know if you've eaten.

520
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,090
I mean, since you're guests who've come to our home.

521
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:01,380
I know how you feel, serving someone.

522
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,590
Since you're also working hard,

523
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:06,850
I thought I might bring you some pancakes.

524
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,650
My real intention is this.

525
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,190
Our lady told me to give this to the grand prince.

526
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:28,830
I didn't want to bring it up so abruptly, so I was working up to it.

527
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:31,510
No need to be that harsh.

528
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,950
Let's have a drink.

529
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,510
Have a shot.

530
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:42,450
My lady, do you still have more to scold me about?

531
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,350
How do you do?

532
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,020
Who are you?

533
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,940
I am your soon to be wife,

534
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,240
daughter of the Yoon family, Na Gyeom.

535
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,650
I am best friends with the young lady of this house.

536
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,440
After learning that you were here,  I hesitated before asking for your presence.

537
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,660
If I hadn't known you were here, I wouldn't have. But, I thought that it would be mannerless of me if I didn't greet you.

538
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,750
Before the wedding, you've called over the person you're to marry.

539
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:33,170
You are indeed the woman who pushed aside her older sister in order to take the spot as the royal bride-to-be.

540
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,910
When the court ladies came to my home, my older sister was not feeling well.

541
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:44,210
I met the guests instead. Then, I was sent in the report to the palace instead of my sister.

542
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,740
Why was your sister sick on that day, of all days?

543
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:55,770
Your sister was sick, but why wasn't the meeting delayed?

544
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:00,720
Don't you pull lowly tricks like this again.

545
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,330
I drugged my sister.

546
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,660
I connived and went to the court ladies instead of my sister.

547
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,270
I did all that so that I could be your wife.

548
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:19,450
I did that for the husband that I desired and to get the high position I wanted.

549
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,200
My older sister got that chance because she was the eldest, even though she didn't have the qualities.

550
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,720
No matter how outstanding I was, since I was the second daughter, I had to give it all to her.

551
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,180
Is there anything more unfair?

552
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,300
Do you think I'm a lowly gisaeng who's dancing in a guesthouse?

553
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,300
Didn't you want me?

554
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,880
It's true that I wanted to be your wife, Your Highness,

555
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,510
but I haven't allowed you to act rudely that way towards me.

556
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:15,270
So it's not me but my position in the royal family you are after.

557
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,990
I'm not disappointed.

558
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,880
I expected it.

559
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,020
Listen up, team members!

560
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,960
Have another drink.

561
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,600
Here.

562
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,730
That's right.

563
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,510
Why?

564
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:02,460
Uncle, you're late.

565
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,600
Have a seat first.

566
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,720
Where's your brother? He must return to the palace.

567
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,340
Did something happen?

568
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,710
A prince has been born.

569
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,750
Is he healthy? Is the mother well?

570
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,240
I'll go find my brother.

571
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,290
Here you go. I've put some food together.

572
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,930
You should bring this to your mother.

573
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,950
Thanks.

574
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,220
By the way, how was it with the grand prince?

575
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,230
Did he treat you well? Was he cool?

576
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,620
He said he was also curious about what kind of person I was and what I looked like.

577
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,590
He said he'd learn how to long for me until the day of our wedding.

578
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,410
It'd be hard to hear anything sweeter.

579
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,690
Be safe on your way home.

580
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,130
I'll be going.

581
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,880
Me, too.

582
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,360
Why'd she go and lie about it in front of us?

583
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,450
Did she think we'd be deceived?

584
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,860
Why are you doing this?

585
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,460
I went after you called for me, but another woman was waiting for me.

586
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,670
I thought you'd be happy if you saw your bride-to-be.

587
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:03,720
Is that what friendship between girls is like?

588
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,470
Na Gyeom is the smartest among my friends.

589
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,580
You could not measure up to her overflowing qualities.

590
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:16,070
If I were her, I would've run away and not looked back.

591
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:24,450
Not only do you care for your brother, but you also care greatly for your friend.

592
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,750
You act recklessly and look down on royalty, all for a friend.

593
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,860
Do you not value your own life?

594
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,600
Are you threatening me right now?

595
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,450
Threatening you? Don't you see that I'm showing you mercy?

596
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:48,820
You could be killed for your sin of contempt for the royalty.

597
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,950
I'm letting you stay alive like this.

598
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,080
I'll be going.

599
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:06,160
If you truly dislike the fact that your friend is paired with me, how about this?

600
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,430
You could take your friend's spot.

601
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,250
I'm saying that you should marry me.

602
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,860
You really are completely insane.

603
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:37,860

604
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,660
♫   The places I want to go to   ♫

605
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,450
♫   The places I need to go to   ♫

606
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:51,440
♫   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   ♫

607
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,720
♫   I just wanna follow this path   ♫

608
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,490
♫  To a place no one knows  ♫

609
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,830
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

610
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,190
  There's nothing like fate that you have to worry about.

611
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,800
  He sent me the same flower as the one I've been drawing.

612
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,960
  If you meet them three times, it's fate.

613
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,570
  Instead of canceling the marriage, I'll prove it through my death.

614
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,360
  You're showing that your pride is hurt in such a noisy way.

615
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,200
