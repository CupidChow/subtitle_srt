00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,670
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:41,860

3
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,930
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,860
  Recap of past episodes

5
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,970
  Your Majesty!

6
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,810
  Your Majesty!

7
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,860
  The king is unconscious?

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,680
  The barbarians are attacking from the north, and the king is unconscious.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,970
  We desperately need a strong leader who can face this crisis head on.

10
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,840
  As they wish, let us select a saejae (King's younger brother as an heir).

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,660
  Be a saejae? Why would I?

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,670
  It cannot be your brother. You have to accept it.

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,930
  As his brother, I can't approve of this marriage.

14
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,830
  I have already completed my introduction to the queen dowager.

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,040
  The woman I love is to become my sister-in-law. Is that even possible?

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,850
  Grand Prince Eun Seong and I are connected by fate. No matter how much you hate it,

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,800
  you can't end our connection.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,340
  You will be able to see the power of a person who overcomes heaven's will.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,140
  The saejae His Majesty and I have decided on

20
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,880
  is not Grand Prince Jin Yang, but Grand Prince Eun Seong.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,290
  Did you know this?

22
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,600
  Mother has been thinking of Eun Seong as saejae all along, not me.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,570
  I'm going to take Eun Seong to the battlefield.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,800
  If he is an existence that endangers my nephew's future, I must get rid of him.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,470
  I guess you were nothing to him.

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,660
  That you're his fated lover,  isn't it the most terrible fate of all?

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,340
  Is there something wrong?

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,130
  You've deceived me again, Your Highness.

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,150
  I hear you're going to the battlefield.

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,170
  It's not like that.

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,830
  Then, are you not going?

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,410
  I have come to fully understand how insignificant I am to you, Grand Prince.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,310
  Lady!

34
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,370

Signs affixed to the gate as a talisman (bujeok) for protection from disaster,  to bless the house, and to ward off evil spirits.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,180
  Am I really nothing to you?

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,120
  Will you not go if I tell you not to?

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,250
  I will make sure to come back alive.

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,890
  My life is yours.

39
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,230
  It's a pledge of loyalty that I offer to you.

40
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,020
 I wish to be of help to you in your great cause.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,780
  I will stake my life and the fate of my family for the sake of your cause.

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,150
  Is this the place you wanted to visit with me?

43
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,300
  There's something I need to do with Your Highness here.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,790
  I, Seong Ja Hyeon, take my fated love, Lee Hwi, as my husband.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,560
  I swear to love and treasure her with all my heart.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
  I swear. Don't forget

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,870
  that I'll be waiting for you.

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,520
  Episode 7

49
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,520
From which household are you?

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,680
I am from the household of Grand Prince Yang Ahn.

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,890
I am from Chief Scholar's household.

52
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,250
But, there must be a lot of people in your household.

53
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,680
Why would they send a young one to such a harsh place?

54
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,220
Ja Hyeon? To see your brother off...

55
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,640
Where did this girl go again?

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,370
Did she go by herself to see him off?

57
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,130
What is this?

58
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,360
 Mother, I will see Brother and the grand prince off and return.

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
 Even if I'm late, don't worry too much.

60
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,360
If she were going to see her brother off, she should've gone with us.

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,010
What secret plan did she have to leave the house alone?

62
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,830
Oh, my!

63
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,420
- Aigoo!  
 - Madam!

64
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,580
- Hey, hey, that's a rag! 
 - Oh, a rag!

65
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,410
Ah, what should I do?

66
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,460
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo, I don't need any of this.

67
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,950
Go and get Ja Hyeon. When did she leave?

68
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,470
You knew already, didn't you?

69
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,810
She isn't home?

70
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,950
She went to see Grand Prince Eun Seong off.

71
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,590
Alone?!

72
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,220
That's why it is strange.

73
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,560
She didn't pack her stuff and go after him, did she?

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,530
Check if there is anything missing!

75
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,800
Madam, I didn't know.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,390
I didn't help with anything whatsoever this time!

77
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,210
I'm saying that I didn't know that the lady had left!

78
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,480
If you knew but didn't tell, you'd deserve to die.

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,470
Even if you didn't know at all, you deserve to be kicked out!

80
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,230
How can you be a personal maid and have no clue at all?

81
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,660
You know how challenging the lady can be.

82
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,330
If she went to the battlefield, how can we bring her back?

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,180
I suppose we have to tell His Excellency, right?

84
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,070
What should we do with this? Ah, what do we do?

85
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,670
Oh, what do I do with this?

86
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,290
Are you leaving the palace?

87
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,850
You have not left yet?  I thought you were leaving after seeing them off.

88
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,760
People with purpose have all gone on their way.

89
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,160
I've been hesitating out of embarrassment over being left behind.

90
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,050
Protecting the capital city is as important. Please do not be too hard on yourself.

91
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,920
Seeing your son off to the battlefield has to have upset you greatly I'm sure.

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,040
I wonder if we can commiserate over tea at your house.

93
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,940
Will you allow me, please?

94
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,870
What are you doing?

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,520
It's nothing.

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,270
Why don't you come here and share the fire?

97
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,630
The fastest way is to cut through inland, this way.

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,540
If we take the road by the sea, it will take a few more days.

99
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,990
Going through the mountains in this cold weather will cause hardship to our troops.

100
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,270
Let's take this road so that we can rest

101
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,250
at a government house rather than in the village.

102
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,770
Wouldn't our citizens in the north continue to suffer during that time?

103
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,760
Even though it's difficult if we travel as quickly as possibleâ€”

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,920
If we travel more than 30 li (15 km) in a day, soldiers will inevitably fall behind.

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,820
We cannot win the battle against vicious Jurchens if our soldiers become exhausted.

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go this way.

107
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,270
Food will be served now.

108
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,930
Do we usually eat this well on a battlefield?

109
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,060
You should eat a little more.

110
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,180
I wonder what the state of the soldiers' food is.

111
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,060
I'm going to walk around a bit.

112
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,590
Temperatures will drop when the sun goes down.  How will they manage the night?

113
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,700
I will guide you.

114
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,740
Here you go.

115
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,160
But now, how come your water isn't frozen?

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,520
I put some salt in mine. Saltwater doesn't freeze, right?

117
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,450
Ah, this guy is quite smart.

118
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,880
Hurry and eat. Even though it's frozen rice,

119
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,960
- you have to force yourself to eat it. 
- Yes.

120
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,290
Damn it.

121
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,150
Do we have injured soldiers already?

122
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,460
Some have injured their backs from carrying the cargo,

123
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,900
others have caught a cold.

124
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,180
Are we having them sleep outside too?

125
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,780
We don't have enough tent quarters to house regular soldiers.

126
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:44,630
Even the sons from noble families have to sleep outside due to the shortage of tent quarters.

127
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,250
Please have the sick and injured soldiers use my tent quarters.

128
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,240
Your Highness, to go as far as that...

129
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,610
Our progress could be delayed due to their illness and injury.

130
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,430
Please do as I ask.  It's an order.

131
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,480
Go find ones with most severe illness or injuries and move them to the grand prince's tent.

132
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,550
Yes, yes, yes.

133
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,170
Thank you.

134
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,060
Everyone be seated.

135
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,030
Why can't he look after me half as much as he looks after the soldiers?

136
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,230
Am I a stranger?  I'll be his brother soon.

137
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,050
What're you doing?  All of you injured and wounded, come forward.

138
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,310
Go.  Go on in!

139
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,750
Ma'am!

140
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,610
Ma'am, ma'am!

141
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,540
His Excellency has come home from the palace.

142
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,430
This is the best tea I've had recently.

143
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,180
Did you not have something to say?

144
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,690
I understand my brother proposed to your daughter.

145
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,820
My wife and daughter have greeted Queen Dowager.

146
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,450
I did not know you had the ambition to become the gukgu (king's father-in-law).

147
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:56,680
While it is an honor to become family with the king, it is not something my family wished.

148
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,930
The fact that Queen Mother wants to install that child (Eun Seong) as saejae

149
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,080
doesn't mean she wants to give him the throne.

150
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,620
We have to wait for the wonja (king's baby son) to grow up,

151
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,730
but we've had to adopt a temporary measure due to the situation in the north.  This I know.

152
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,140
If Grand Prince Eun Seong is installed as the saejae later on,

153
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,310
do you think your future will be secure?

154
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,190
Emperor Jianwen of Ming Dynasty slaughtered his uncles as soon as he ascended to the throne.

155
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,960
It's normal to get rid of dangerous obstacles first when one takes power.

156
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,350
Do not place your one and only precious daughter on the path of perilous future.

157
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,210
If you are behind my brother, Eun Seong's power will grow.

158
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,300
When he becomes an adult, Wonja will be resentful of such an uncle.

159
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,760
Is this a threat?

160
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,990
Of course not.

161
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,880
I'm trying to share the will of the previous king with you.

162
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,690
My wise father gave me an agreeable path.

163
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,110
Why do you think he did?

164
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,210
Don't look at it as though it's someone else's business.

165
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,120
You know how cold Queen Dowager can be at times.

166
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,390
You know that very well already.

167
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,990
Excellency!

168
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,990
We need to go and get our Ja Hyeon.

169
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,690
Without an ounce of fear, she followed the military...

170
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,080
What does that mean? What did our Ja Hyeon do?

171
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,370
What I mean is, she's gone to see his brother off.

172
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,930
What?  Where does she think that is?

173
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,140
I will bring her back.

174
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,180
I was already putting a team together to deliver supplies there.

175
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,370
Since I will be there, I'll bring your daughter back.

176
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,260
We will look after it ourselves.  Please do not concernâ€”

177
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,400
Your child's innocent action can cause a misunderstanding, right?

178
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,270
If Grand Prince would help, our hearts will be relieved.

179
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,270
It's all done.

180
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,180
What's your identity?

181
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,280
Without permission, you left the camp during dinner. Are you a spy from the Jurchens or

182
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,420
an escapee who betrayed his comrades?

183
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,110
Speak, I say!

184
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,940
My lady!

185
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,040
How are you here?

186
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,070
What's with this look of you?

187
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,680
No, I just...

188
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,830
When did you come here?

189
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,870
Is your body okay?

190
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,950
Why did you follow me here, being a woman of the inner house (wife)?

191
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,820
Are you hungry?

192
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,150
What were you thinking that you did this?

193
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,990
You said the north was colder.

194
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,940
Just for this?

195
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,730
You came all the way here for this?  Are you in your right mind?

196
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,740
One more time. One more time, I wanted to see you.

197
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,660
I wanted to have you wear the clothes I made myself

198
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,830
so that you could be a little warmer on the cold, long path.

199
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:05,080
I wanted to finish it last night so that I could give it to you before you left but

200
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,400
I was not quite finished so...

201
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,560
What am I to do with you, lady?

202
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,580
Since I delivered this, it's okay.

203
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,300
Now, I will leave.

204
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,350
Don't you know the days are shorter in the winter? The sun will set soon.

205
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,650
I can just walk all night.

206
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,610
Do you think I could just send you off like that?

207
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,810
Stay at my tent tonight.  I will send you off with an escort first thing in the morning.

208
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,710
If I'd have known, I would have kept the tent empty.

209
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm dressed as a man.  I can sleep outside.

210
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,430
Must you go tonight?

211
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,360
You don't have to go yourself.

212
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,790
My uncle has put his life on the line for me

213
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,280
and has taken my brother to the frontline instead of me.

214
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,300
If I don't support them as much as I can from here, what will I be?

215
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,590
Enter the palace tomorrow.

216
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,370
We have to find out about the king's condition.

217
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,540
Yes, Your Excellency.

218
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,980
Please console my mother's weary heart and look around  (spy on)  the queen's quarters.

219
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
I can just sleep outside.

220
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,330
You could freeze to death.

221
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,880
â™«   My tears are not coming out  â™«

222
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,590
â™«   I cannot even laugh   â™«

223
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,180
â™«   My loneliness has piled up&nbsp;  â™«

224
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,470
â™«   Everything has been broken&nbsp;  â™«

225
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,580
â™«   I try to fix it   â™«

226
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,800
â™«   I can't do anything&nbsp;  â™«

227
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,880
â™«   Because of you, it&nbsp;has rusted&nbsp;  â™«

228
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,530
â™«   What do I do with myself?&nbsp;  â™«

229
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,080
â™«  &nbsp;It's because my chest feels tight   â™«

230
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,880
â™«   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   â™«

231
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,880
â™«   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,&nbsp;  â™«

232
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,840
â™«   &nbsp;You spread across my heart   â™«

233
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,450
â™«   Love is so mean   â™«

234
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:42,270
â™«   &nbsp;Why do you keep shaking up my heart?&nbsp;  â™«

235
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:49,550
â™«   As much as it is sad, this mean love   â™«

236
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:55,780
â™«   You don't know it yet   â™«

237
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,150
Halt!

238
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,190
Drop your swords!

239
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,170
Your Highness, what brings you here?

240
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,740
Where is my uncle?

241
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,870
Please come this way.

242
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,880
My nephew! What are you doing here?

243
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,350
Did something happen in the capital?

244
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,620
I think Eun Seong brought a woman here in secret.

245
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,240
A woman in our campaign?

246
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,770
In order to take care of it before it became a crisis,

247
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,520
I rode on horseback all night to follow you.

248
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,210
A woman in the battlefield. Anyone who makes a mockery

249
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,870
out of the military regulations deserves death on the spot without a recourse.

250
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,820
Even if he is as high as the grand prince.

251
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,230
Find Grand Prince Eun Seong.

252
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,530
I will go.

253
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,640
This way.

254
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,460
Don't move. When everyone leaves, let's get up then.

255
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,990
Now. Let's go.

256
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,160
This is allium which's good for chronic disease.

257
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,170
We had some already prepared so I've brought it for His Majesty.

258
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,110
Thank you for your consideration.

259
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,740
How is His Majesty's illness?

260
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,080
He's gaining strength since he's felt better that the troops were deployed.

261
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,220
Perhaps Grand Prince Jin Yang didn't feel good about being left behind.

262
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,260
He left in a hurry last night as well.

263
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,020
Jin Yang did?

264
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,480
He said he wanted to deliver supplies to his uncle and Grand Prince Eun Seong.

265
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,380
He's gone there to privately deliver military supplies?

266
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,920
He must have beeen disappointed by the quick send-off.

267
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,320
Is that not the love for one's blood relations?

268
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,610
On our way into the battle with the Jurchens,

269
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,310
you've brought a woman?  You've brought shame to the royal household.

270
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,960
Enough to bring down entire military strategy.

271
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,410
I followed him on my own.

272
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,010
I just wanted to give him winter clothes.

273
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,400
Can't you shut it? What good did you do that you're talking back like this?

274
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,630
Brother, that's not it.

275
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,910
Everything is my fault.

276
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,500
I will sincerely accept any punishment.

277
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,290
Please return Lady Ja Hyeon safely to her home.

278
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,260
Do you think a war is some kind of picnic?

279
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,320
You stepped over your older brother to come here in order to protect your young nephew,

280
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,280
not to lose your core responsibility frolicking with a woman.

281
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,200
Do you have the right to be this country's grand prince after this?

282
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,840
How many times must I say it?

283
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,790
His Highness did not know that I was here.

284
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:08,780
What do we do now if a rumor spreads that a royal who should serve as a role model

285
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,110
brought a woman along into the battlefield?

286
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,400
That is too harsh.

287
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,330
The morale of the troops would nosedive.

288
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,870
I'm sure it will be the opposite.

289
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,510
Who, among them, doesn't have families they've left behind?

290
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,990
The younger men have loved ones they've had to tearfully say goodbye to.

291
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,470
So that I could see the face of my loved one once more,

292
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,240
and to keep him warm in this harsh winter,

293
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,790
I sewed all night long to finish it and brought it.

294
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,050
Is that such a terrible crime?

295
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,610
I agree with her.

296
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,230
Lady Ja Hyeon's devotion and loyalty will be a comfort to the troops.

297
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Please forgive my immature sister.

298
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,550
I think it'd be best for everyone if I took her home right away.

299
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,810
Eun Seong is not used to the military life yet.

300
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:16,120
We will send the lady home and resolve this matter here.

301
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,970
Thank you, sir.

302
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,420
But I will only forgive you once.

303
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,150
In future, you have to become a role model befitting of your position as a grand prince.

304
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,170
I will keep that in mind.

305
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,910
I will take her as soon as the supplies have been unloaded.

306
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,180
That will be the safest way.

307
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,660
That would be good.

308
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,160
I'm sorry.

309
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,710
I made it hard for you because of my rashness.

310
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,970
It was not hard at all.

311
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:06,150
I was happy you came.   And I was excited to be with you.

312
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,900
Please take this, Your Highness. I'm going home anyway.

313
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,840
I have another one. Take it with you.

314
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,550
Tying it around makes my wrist warmer.

315
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,830
I'm glad you have a guard with you.  I was worried about your return journey.

316
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,220
My brother will bring you back safely.

317
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,900
It's a healing ointment.  Please use it for frostbite.

318
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:19,240
What you wanted wasn't Jo Hwi Gyeong but that girl, right?

319
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,060
A hero will be richly rewarded, but she is your brother's woman.

320
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,580
You must not create anything that could get in the way of your great cause.

321
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,360
I thought a king is embarrassed about nothing.

322
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,570
You are not a king yet.  That's why I say,

323
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,660
wait until then.

324
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,230
You will own everything under the sun then.

325
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,730
Rumor of Hwi's conduct will spread around the capital city.

326
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,410
A mentally and physically weak grand prince frolicking with a woman.

327
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,660
People will know that he's not suitable to be king.

328
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,080
Wait. Here. It's salt.

329
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,030
Put a little bit in a water bucket, then the water won't freeze.

330
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,110
Salty water makes you more thirsty though.

331
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,950
Just a little bit is okay.

332
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,390
It's even given to soldiers in the summertime

333
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,900
to keep their strength up.

334
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,030
I saw that some of the troops are not able to drink the frozen water out of the bottles.

335
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,770
If there is salt, please give it to them.

336
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:42,610
Otherwise, you should obtain some from the village before crossing the border.

337
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,510
I will remember it.

338
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,670
- I'll leave her in your hands. 
 - Don't worry. I will take care of her preciously.

339
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,390
She's having a hard time waiting already.

340
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,360
Please don't make it even harder for her.

341
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:19,590
Forget about home.  If your memory is too strong, you cannot forge ahead.

342
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,280
Brother. I'm sorry.

343
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,820
Throw it away.

344
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,330
Your Highness, you don't think the Royal Consort would...

345
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,260
You know what the former queen and concubines have gone through.

346
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,640
We have to be wary of anything served from private homes, no matter from whom.

347
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,430
In Grand Prince Yang Ahn's absence, Jin Yang will want to step into the national affairs.

348
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,690
Please do everything to stop him.

349
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:55,370
His brother-in-law, Ja Joon, who's the head of security is spending money like water.

350
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,190
His family is not well off but since becoming a royal brother-in-law,

351
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,210
does he not know what's right or wrong?

352
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,100
From where do you think he gets that money?

353
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,440
Isn't that a plan to create goodwill for future use?

354
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,060
Demote anyone who goes in and out of Myoung Rae palace or does business with Ja Jeon.

355
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,490
They need to know that they have no future being close to Grand Prince Jin Yang with ulterior motives.

356
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,680
Yes, Your Highness.

357
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,560
I thought we were going straight to the capital.

358
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,400
Thanks to someone, I was on the move all last night.

359
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
I have to let my retainers eat and rest.

360
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,860
Then go ahead and get some rest.

361
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,990
I can go by myself if you lend me just one horse.

362
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,000
The horses are also exhausted.

363
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,040
Get the official servants to show this lady to a bath and  get some clothes for her.

364
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,190
Yes, sir!

365
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,120
No, sir. I'm fine like this.

366
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,880
But I think the adults will be even more worried if you return looking like this.

367
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Chief Scholar entreated me to bring you back safely.

368
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,470
I intend to keep my promise.

369
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,610
Please enjoy your dinner alone comfortably. I will eat separately.

370
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,570
Shouldn't we agree on a story to tell?

371
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,590
How you ended up there, and how far you went.

372
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,760
Where you slept, and what you did.

373
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,400
The royal family may have already found out.

374
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,300
I should at least know what happened if I am to come up with excuses.

375
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,180
Not for you. For my brother.

376
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:45,140
I just followed them as one of my brother's servants.

377
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,190
Where did you sleep?

378
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,650
In soldiers' barracks.

379
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,880
Are you fearless or brainless?

380
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,630
Prince Eun Seong was guarding me.

381
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,400
Were you planning to follow him to the battlefield?

382
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,890
No, Sir.

383
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,300
Then?

384
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,370
I was thinking of only one thing.

385
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,140
I just wanted to see the grand prince for a little bit longer.

386
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,530
Let's say that you stayed at the government office after sending him off.

387
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,510
That's the only way to prevent defamation.

388
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,100
Okay.

389
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,670
I have no appetite.

390
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,370
I can't even sleep when I think of my son and daughter.

391
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,560
At this rate, I'm going to die before my time.

392
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,430
Madam, don't be like this. Please eat a little bit more.

393
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,820
You have to be strong if this household is to keep its stability.

394
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,190
You ate everything.

395
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,160
Madam! Madam! Please come out.

396
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,080
Lady is back!

397
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,930
Our Lady Ja Hyeon!

398
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,070
Lady Ja Hyeon.

399
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,770
Lady! Be careful, Madam.

400
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,500
I'm back, Mother.

401
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,040
Go out.  Go back out again.

402
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,830
Madam! Madam! Madam!

403
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,830
Do you think this house is an inn

404
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,720
where you can leave and come back any time you want?

405
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,120
Are you a man? How can you sleep outside (of the home) so recklessly?

406
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,170
I'm sorry, Mother. I won't do it ever, ever again.

407
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,970
Get here right now.

408
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,290
Let's put an end to this, between you and me.

409
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,980
Either you die or I die.

410
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,840
Not even a hair of mine was hurt. I'm back safe.

411
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,630
I saw that my older brother was doing well, too.

412
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,640
Did I say I wanted to know that?

413
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,260
My daughter leaves home to look for my son?

414
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,080
Why don't you punish her officially?

415
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,230
If you do it here like this, it doesn't look so good in front of the servants and all.

416
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,150
Please go inside and give her the straps properly.

417
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,080
How many times will you hit her?

418
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,680
- Twice? Thrice?
 - Kkeut Dan!

419
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,150
You are right. Get me an entire bundle of straps then.

420
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,000
I will break the legs of the two of you today.

421
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,650
Me? Why me?

422
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,040
Because you didn't attend to your lady properly.

423
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,600
Because you didn't even know when your mistress ran away in the middle of the night!

424
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,840
Madam! That doesn't quite add up.

425
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,290
Together in life or death because we are destined.

426
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,260
I've imposed on you and the royal family.

427
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,530
I didn't inform the people at the palace.

428
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,320
I will keep it between just you and me, so rest assured.

429
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,750
I am indebted to you.

430
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,550
Did you give some thought as to matters regarding your daughter's future?

431
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,900
She's my daughter.

432
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,840
As her father, all I want is for her to be happy.

433
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,080
Since my wife and daughter have been officially introduced to the palace,

434
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,310
I see no way that her marriage into the royal family can be stopped.

435
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:13,380
It's a matter of finding a way. And if you can't find it, you just make one anew.

436
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,530
I will drop by more frequently in the future.

437
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:23,470
I wish to listen to your good advice in these turbulent times and share war news.

438
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,030
Where is His Highness? Didn't he come with you?

439
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,890
The thing is...

440
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,480
He went to the giseang house.

441
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,570
Looks like he has an appointment with someone.

442
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,180
She is called Jo Hwi Gyeong, isn't she? The one His Highness visits often?

443
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,520
Don't worry about it.

444
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,540
You can't know all about a man's business sitting in the women's quarters.

445
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,780
Even though a gisaeng, she's useful to us in many different ways.

446
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,120
It's not always about gathering strong men.

447
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,760
You are returning from a long journey. Why didn't you rest at home?

448
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,560
My feet led me here.

449
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,800
I'm pleased, but...

450
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,320
When does a girl get her heart stolen by a man?

451
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,970
Thinking about it, I have never once

452
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,350
tried to win a woman's heart.

453
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,840
Whose heart do you want to have?

454
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,350
Being born as the the king's son, court ladies were always bowing down to me.

455
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:06,130
When I came to the gisaeng house with my friends, gisaengs were all over us.

456
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,310
Out of ambition to join the royal family, even the ladies of noble families

457
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,120
approached me before I could court them.

458
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:21,040
It was a given... that women found me desirable.

459
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,930
That they would approach me first.

460
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,510
Gisaengs follow men with money and power.

461
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:46,020
And there may be women who fall for handsome and smart men.

462
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,430
But, though it's rare, some women fall for a man's vision.

463
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,750
A man's vision?

464
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,950
If a woman falls for a man's vision, she dedicates her entire life to him.

465
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,300
Which aspect of me are you looking at?

466
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,110
I'm looking at your future.

467
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:10,590
If I bet on your future, won't I also gain a future?

468
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:35,890
Sab Seung Pil Mang.

469
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,740
If you win many times a loss will follow.

470
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,170
If one loses a hundred times, one prepares to win, but once he wins a hundred times,

471
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,670
a general will become arrogant.

472
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,550
We have to wait

473
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,430
and then get them in one go.

474
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,940
People will suffer too much if we wait indefinitely.

475
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,520
Jurchens keep coming to the villages and taking their food.

476
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,350
We can't do anything about the small suffering in the name of the bigger battle.

477
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,740
As a military strategy, the best way is to win without a battle.

478
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,540
How about starting a negotiation prior to a battle?

479
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,600
Negotiate with the Jurchens?

480
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,410
I believe it's necessary if we can prevent casualties among our troops.

481
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,060
If so, are you prepared to go yourself?

482
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,670
Can you go in there yourself and engage in a negotiation once and for all?

483
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,560
The grand prince has no prior military experience. What do you mean by once and for all negotiation?

484
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,200
It's a difficult task even for the most experienced generals.

485
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,890
I believe battle is the best way,

486
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,550
but the grand prince wants a negotiation to avoid battle.

487
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,460
Shouldn't he take responsibility for his own words?

488
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,720
No he shouldn't.

489
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,670
We cannot have him go through such a dangerous operation.

490
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,040
I will go.

491
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,620
- Your Highness! 
  - Uncle is right.

492
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:03,270
He who speaks has to take responsibility for his words.

493
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,300
You shouldn't, Sir. How can you go in unilaterally without knowing how they'll respond?

494
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,470
I am going on a personal visit. It would be right to take off the armor.

495
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,260
Your Highness.

496
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,440
I'm going there to pay my respect as a prince of a nation.

497
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,400
Even if they are Jurchens, they wouldn't pull a sword on me, would they?

498
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,060
There is no guarantee.

499
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,170
They've taken a lot of our people.

500
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,660
They could use them as a shield in the event of a battle.

501
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,500
That means we will have to kill them in order to wage a battle against them.

502
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,880
We have to save our people who are now hostages.

503
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,100
We cannot abandon even one person.

504
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,270
I will come with you.

505
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:12,840
That will make me feel strong.

506
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,530
If you came with us, it'd be most helpful.  We wouldn't need interpreters either.

507
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,970
Do you speak their language?

508
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,950
I lived here with my father when I was a child.

509
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,550
I used it along the way and I've not forgotten it all.

510
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,170
How great this is.  I feel like I've gained a thousand horses.

511
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:49,100
Make sure to meet the leader.  The real negotiation will be with us, not with Eun Seong.

512
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,810
We will need to put a weapon in every one of their hands.

513
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:18,780
We are smuggling the weapons.  We are also making some of them.

514
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,880
It will take time.

515
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,190
Since we have to do it in secret.

516
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,400
Meet with the official from Goon Gi Shi.

517
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,310
If we can open their storage supply, we will have our weapons.

518
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:37,920
However, Queen Dowager is demoting everyone who comes near us.

519
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,330
Don't do it yourself.  Send someone else in your stead.

520
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,300
They will know what to do and take care of it.

521
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,750
There is no one who doesn't become friendly given money, nor is there a door that doesn't open.

522
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,280
Those inside should be taken care of by the people in charge.

523
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,060
I will let them.

524
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,810
Please take a break for refreshments.

525
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,730
At rest!

526
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,910

527
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,280
How about if you have these gatherings at our house?

528
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,990
I will look after them to the best of my ability.

529
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:37,010
It can't be as good outside as what you can get in your own home.

530
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,840
Are you planning on dealing with all men from outside to take care of the work?

531
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,440
Are you going to flirt with men in order to bring them to our side?

532
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,070
There is no need for you to act like a gisaeng.

533
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:01,500
I know you are not happy about your husband going in and out of a gisaeng house,

534
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,600
but I can't accomplish a great cause and pay attention to the fragile mind of my wife at the same time.

535
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,640
I was only trying to do the best workâ€”

536
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,270
Please look after the growing members of the team

537
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,040
and the servants as well.

538
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,220
I will take your advice.

539
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,990
- Who are you?
 - He's a prince of Joseon, Grand Prince Eun Seong.

540
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,040
We've come to meet with your leader.

541
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:13,400
Dismount the horses and walk inside.

542
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,220
We have to dismount, sir.

543
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,730
Please go in.

544
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,800
He says you can go inside.

545
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
I'm the interpreter.

546
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,480
I'm an inter... interpre... too.

547
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,880
Inter... inter...interpre...

548
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,470
I know why you've invaded southward.

549
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,570
It's all because you need food, right?

550
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,710
If you disarm and retreat,

551
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:56,520
we will give you 300 som (1 som is app 40 gallons) of grain as compensation (12,000 gallons).

552
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,600
If you wish, we can create opportunities in the future

553
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,840
to exchange food and materials from time to timeâ€”

554
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,610
Something like that

555
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,760
we can obtain without negotiation.

556
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,310
They can obtain as much by stealing.

557
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,580
That is something that is injurious to your own people too.

558
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,400
The soldiers of Jurchen

559
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,960
are not afraid of death.

560
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,540
His soldiers are not scared of death.

561
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,280
Tell me what you are looking for.

562
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,270
If you can supply the grain we need until next harvest,

563
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,580
we will retreat from your territory.

564
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,880
If you supply grains until next harvest, they will retreat.

565
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,860
Do you know who I am?

566
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,660
Didn't you say you were a Joseon prince?

567
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,100
That means Joseon troops have arrived already.

568
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,400
We are also brave soldiers who are unafraid of death.

569
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,440
However, the reason why I've come to talk to you first is

570
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,780
to avoid innocent civilian casualties that will inevitably

571
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,380
come from the battle between us.

572
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,180
In your calculation, is there no room for the

573
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,650
pain and suffering that your people will suffer?

574
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,570
There is no such a thing as innocent people to us.

575
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,040
They are all just soldiers

576
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,520
who want to give their blood.

577
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,680
All of their people are soldiers, no innocent civilians.

578
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,450
His greed is excessive.

579
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,610
We've just begun our negotiation.

580
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:59,450
Look how he gave us overnight accommodation.  He's not looking for a fight.

581
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:03,310
However, our side will not accept the demands of the Jurchens.

582
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,710
Grand Prince Yang Ahn will insist on facing them head on,

583
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:10,690
and you will be responsible for suggesting a hopeless negotiation in the first place.

584
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:13,040
We have to lessen their demands no matter what.

585
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,670
Since we are going to stay here, let's look around and see what plans we can come up with.

586
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,470
How about if we go and come back, Your Highness?

587
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,660
How can we sleep in the tiger's den?

588
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,340
What if they kill us in the middle of the night without a sound?

589
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:31,840
You and I must protect the grand prince

590
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,180
with our lives.

591
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,980
Follow me.

592
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,310
Let's go.

593
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,610
Are you here to pray?

594
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:12,230
For the nation's military victory and the well being of the grand prince.

595
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,590
I am here to give my offering as well.

596
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:18,410
I will take my leave first.

597
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,660
I hear you like paintings.

598
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,860
We have a few drawings from Song Dynasty. Do you want to come and see them?

599
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:32,540
The only paintings I want to see are those drawn by Grand Prince Eun Seong.

600
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,330
You must open your eyes now.

601
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,150
The world is wide and abounding with great works.

602
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,440
The drawing of my loved one is the greatest work of art to me.

603
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,730
The sun will set soon. I shall take you home.

604
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,470
We came just fine on our own.

605
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:51,540
I have Kkeut Dan with me. We will be fine going back.

606
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,930
Are you going to pray to Buddha every day?

607
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,600
This temple is a place with a special meaning to me.

608
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:09,020
If you come here often with your ill intention, I will go somewhere else.

609
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,190
Please don't come here.

610
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,940
What should I do?

611
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,530
This place is special to me as well.

612
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,390
This is where I come for forgiveness each time I do something wrong.

613
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,460
If you don't do anything that needs forgiving, you will be fine.

614
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:32,450
It's not easy living... the way you've intended.

615
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,390
Aren't human beings supposed to live as we're intended?

616
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:38,000
Live as intended.

617
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,630
That's a good phrase.

618
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:48,370
Please visit Myeong Rae Palace. My wife needs company.

619
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:51,280
If you can, come often and be her friend.

620
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,260
If it's for her, I would.

621
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,310
- Where did you get the Joseon dress?  Did you steal it?
 - It's my mom's.

622
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,990
Is your mother a person from Joseon?

623
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,210
A Joseon daughter of a Jurchen father.

624
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,740
You must have some story.

625
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,930
Do you have a name? What should I call you?

626
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,020
- Roo Si Gae. 
- So it's Roo Si Gae.

627
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:09,290
I'm Roo Si Gae. You?

628
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,650
- Hm? 
 - What, you?

629
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,860
I'm Hwi. My name is Hwi.

630
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,630
Hwi?

631
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,870
What's so funny? Is my name funny?

632
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,070
Your name.

633
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,520
  When I say your name, it sounds like when I whistle.

634
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,310
  Hwi. Hwi. Hwi.

635
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,730
The knot on a Joseon dress is not tied that way.

636
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:04,660
The knot.  Over here.

637
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:13,500
I will do it for you, so remember it next time...

638
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,300
I think you misunderstood. I didn't have a different intention.

639
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:25,020
I wanted you to wear your mother's Joseon dress properly.

640
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,500
Here.

641
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,290
Do it like this.  Like so.

642
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:49,520
Through the loop like this.

643
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,650
Turn it around and to the outside.

644
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,670
The other way. The other way.

645
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,210
This.

646
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:09,370
Try it.

647
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,740
Here.

648
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,980
Your Highness, I think we should go back.  They...

649
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,710
They...

650
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,090
I will come back again.

651
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:31,250
No. No, it's not like that. No.

652
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:44,310
Is there improvement with His Majesty?

653
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:48,940
Not enough to attend to national affairs but he is recovering.

654
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,150
He fell ill when he heard of the crisis on the northern border.

655
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:56,670
He will be able to get up once he hears of the victory from the north.

656
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:00,750
Our job as his servants is to defeat the Jurchens as soon as possible

657
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,190
so that we can make His Majesty feel at ease.

658
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:06,300
How is the battle going?

659
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,800
They will look for the right opportunity to wage one major battle.

660
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,940
Grand Prince Yang Ahn is confident that he will give us the news

661
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,780
of victory in due course.

662
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:22,830
Isn't it better to initiate a negotiation first?

663
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,760
It's something they will decide as they see fit at the frontline.

664
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,440
They will do battle if they need to and negotiate if necessary.

665
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,660
It's getting colder each day.

666
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:38,750
If the battle gets too long, the casualties will increase.

667
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,720
Why?  Do you not like the food?

668
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:58,310
I am just impressed how you connect with women as though fated everywhere you go.

669
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,040
Fated?  I told you nothing happened.

670
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,780
If I hadn't barged in right at that very moment.

671
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,680
Ah, how can you talk like that to someone who has a loved one?

672
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:15,370
That's what I mean.  I thought you were a pure man whose heart was for one woman only.

673
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,610
Enough of the nonsense.  Eat your food.

674
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,980
I'm going to meet with the leader and have it out with him again.

675
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,410
Why is he playing hard to get?

676
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:27,360
Is he holding us hostages by chance?

677
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,180
What's that?  Did something happen?

678
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,940
We're in trouble. Our troops started to attack.

679
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,500
What do you mean?

680
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,720
His Highness in the middle of negotiation?  What do you mean attack?

681
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,840
What are we supposed to do?

682
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,960
It's a trap, sir.

683
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,510
Grand Prince Yang Ahn set a trap for you.

684
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,250
No way.  It's a misunderstanding.

685
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,670
You ask for negotiation and then attack us from behind?

686
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,710
What? What did he say?

687
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,470
They think we betrayed them.

688
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:07,100
We will take the grand prince.

689
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,670
Yes.

690
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,020
What are you doing?  Let go of me.

691
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,830
Hurry!

692
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:23,920

693
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,530
â™«  Believing and believing  â™«

694
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,870
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

695
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:39,510
 Did you not hear? My brother, your loved one,

696
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:41,160
 has died at the hands of the Jurchens.

697
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,740
 Grand Prince's heart is not with me.  Go find his real loved one.

698
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,670
 If you want too much, you could lose what you already have.

699
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:55,010
 Even if he comes back, it will be after Jin Yang ascends to the throne.

700
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,810
 Are you going to give me the title of saejae now?

701
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:02,100
 You are the one who got him killed.

702
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,920
  Your Highness! Your Highness!

703
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,810
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
