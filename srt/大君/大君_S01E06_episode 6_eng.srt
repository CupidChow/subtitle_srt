1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,640
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:12,590

3
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,070
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,950
They said this is not an ordinary invasion. 
  Episode 6

5
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,530
They've burned down homes and captured innocent people.

6
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,200
They're in a pitch battle with our soldiers.

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,100
Summon the court ministers and send out the entry passes to the royal family members.

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,390
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,520
Your Majesty!

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,890
Your Majesty!

12
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,460
Your Majesty, why are you being like this?

13
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,300
Call the royal physician! What are you doing? Hurry!

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,710
Hurry up!

15
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,280
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,280
Your Majesty!

17
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,940
Your Highness, we need you to go to the king's palace.

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,100
His Majesty collapsed.

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,910
What?

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,800
 The Queen Dowager has arrived.

21
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,860
- Queen Mother. 
 - What happened?

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,340
The shock he received caused a flare up of his chronic disease.

23
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,050
His disease is already not good during the winter.

24
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,730
When will he regain consciousness?

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,690
He just received acupuncture and overcame the critical phase.

26
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,660
We will prepare a tonic for him to regain his strength.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,050
He needs to recover as soon as possible. The political situation is dire due to the conflict in the northern regions.

28
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,010
The king cannot be laid up like this!

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,000
The king is unconscious?

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,230
Is he critical?

31
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,410
The doctors are working on him from all angles.

32
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,820
The heavens are helping us. The power of the heavens must be with you, my nephew.

33
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,830
The barbarians are attacking from the north,

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,970
and the king is unconscious.

35
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,350
Even if the Queen Dowager steps in his stead, we are at war.

36
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,360
This is not a matter that women or children can issue orders on.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,390
- Then? 
- We desperately need

38
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,740
a strong leader who can face this crisis head on.

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,110
Please move in haste! Gather the lieges for an attack never seen before.

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,290
Don't you worry.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,590
With His Majesty unconscious

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,970
and the Jurchens attacking us from the north,

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,070
we need to restart the plans to appoint a king's brother as crown prince,

44
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,660
so that we can focus the national strength to deal with this national emergency.

45
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,900
We must go and stop the barbarians as first priority!

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,170
This is not the time to be installing a crown prince!

47
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,480
Right now our people are dying,

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,460
but we are holding a cabinet meeting without a king.

49
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,500
How can we get anything done in this situation?

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,620
Who will lead the expeditionary forces?

51
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,050
Once we place the soldiers up in the north, who will defend against the Japanese raiders in the south?

52
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,770
If we lose the timing in deploying the troops, our people will starve and die this winter!

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,600
We must send the troops immediately!

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
Then you can go, Left State Minister.

55
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
Aren't you the one with the most military experience among us?

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,850
You expanded the northern border greatly by campaigning there for many decades.

57
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,160
Why don't you go once more and protect it?

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,700
That cannot be.

59
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,300
He returned with serious illnesses and injuries from the hardships of battle.

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,060
We cannot send the elder back there again.

61
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,270
A full-on war will be hard on the people.

62
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,280
We should release the grain as a goodwill gesture

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,130
and minimize the impact on us.

64
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,350
The barbarians will not be satisfied with just that.

65
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,380
We need to adopt a harder policy.

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,070
His Majesty is down with an illness.

67
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,070
Who among us will volunteer to take the lead?

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,230
This is why we need a crown prince.

69
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,460
This is why in a crisis we cannot decide on a measure!

70
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,570
This is not a matter for us subordinates to decide here.

71
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,610
We must debate this with the queen dowager instead of the kingâ€”

72
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,040
I will go!

73
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,180
Your Excellency.

74
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,400
Since you are all scholars incompetent in the military arts,

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,970
though I am old, I will drag myself out there

76
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,400
and crush the barbarians.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,920
Your Excellency!

78
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,590
Your Excellency!

79
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,710
You can't, Father.

80
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,290
Those rotten sly politicians!

81
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,780
If the people are in a crisis, their first thought should be to save them,

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,390
but they are using it as an opportunity to raise themselves!

83
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,220
You can't even sleep because of your body aches, but a military expedition?

84
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,460
Even if I die on the way,

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,290
this Kim Chu will not back down!

86
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,580
Father!

87
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,610
We have the queen and baby Wonja (status before being appointed as crown prince).

88
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,560
For their sake,

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,100
I have to do what needs to be done.

90
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,690
Father!

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,460
The barbarians are maneuvering in the north,

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,650
and His Majesty's illness is ever deepening.

93
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,500
But the heir to the throne has not been determined, causing the national debate to be divided,

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,650
and the country's important decisions are not being made well.

95
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,070
The people are uneasy and look to the skies day by day.

96
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,480
We scholars can no longer stand by and watch;

97
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,150
therefore, we are gathering our people to petition to the king.

98
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,690
Please select the crown prince as soon as possible

99
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,960
and straighten out our national affairs.

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,110
Please accept our petition.

101
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,830
Please accept our petition.

102
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,510
Your Highness, not my father!

103
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,790
He is no longer the imperator of the past.

104
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,290
With his ill and exhausted body,

105
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,040
how can he go that far distance?

106
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,470
He has lost his sight and hearing, so he can't shoot arrows well.

107
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,950
What kind of contribution would he make on the battlefield?

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,110
There is no other minister with as great an experience in conquest as he.

109
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,670
Is my father the only minister?

110
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,000
Please do not make my father die away from home.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,290
Please think about his previous contributions.

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,470
Your Majesty.

113
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,870
Your Majesty.

114
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,050
 Please select the crown prince.

115
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,820
Please select the crown prince.

116
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,120
Please accept our petition based on

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,910
the will of the scholars and the people.

118
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,570
Please accept our petition.

119
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,340
It appears that Grand Prince is working on a major project with his uncle.

120
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,230
Do you know anything about it, Brother?

121
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,100
A married couple is supposed to think and act in harmony.

122
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,050
How can I support my husband in these uncertain times without knowledge?

123
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,070
There is something I resolved when I married into the royal family.

124
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,920
That I will work with you to help Grand Prince achieve his grand vision.

125
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,650
I am not going to sit at home ignorant of what's going on in the world

126
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,600
and simply being in charge of kitchen duties.

127
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,580
- They are trying to appoint a saejae  (King's brother as crown prince) before the wonja is fully grown.
- Saejae?

128
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,340
The wonja is very young and the king is ill.

129
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,350
If he becomes a saejae as a younger brother, he can follow the king

130
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,540
and become a future king of Joseon!

131
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,030
If that happens, our family will produce the mother of the state (queen).

132
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,450
As they wish, let us select a saejae.

133
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,970
Your Highness!

134
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,120
Call the grand prince.

135
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,580
You mustn't, Your Highness.

136
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,720
The longer we wait, the more the people will suffer.

137
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,890
And it will be harder for the crown prince, too.

138
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,930
How will you handle its consequence?

139
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,040
We will need to select a person who can manage the consequences.

140
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,210
Right now the Sunggyungwan scholars are holding a demonstration,

141
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,970
and the politicians are in the council hall debating.

142
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,080
I know it is utterly unreasonable.

143
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,800
If they were worried about the king and thought about the country, this should not happen.

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,440
This is all because we have not chosen a successor to the throne.

145
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,620
It's something that requires a passage of time.

146
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,630
For the wonja to grow up and become the crown prince.

147
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,320
They are not interested in the wonja. They know that a baby who's not even a year old

148
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,970
cannot take on the responsibility of the nation.

149
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,420
You must become the saejae (the king's younger brother as crown prince).

150
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,580
Have you come to the resolution?

151
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,590
Queen Mother, what do you mean?

152
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,890
Saejae?

153
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,850
Why would I?

154
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,870
- It must be you. 
- Queen Mother!

155
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,350
It cannot be your brother. You have to accept it.

156
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,650
Since I was born and understood the meaning of words,

157
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,540
as soon as I could walk the words that I'd heard over and over

158
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,060
were to never desire the throne,

159
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,850
that the throne belonged to the oldest brother.

160
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,330
But if you are talking about the saejae now,

161
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,940
you're rejecting all that I've done in the past.

162
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,430
I am just entrusting the throne to you until Wonja grows up.

163
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,460
Then what will happen afterward?

164
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,510
What will happen to my life if I'm thought to covet my nephew's throne?

165
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,620
Please do not drag me into the royal family's politics.

166
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,380
I will follow the fate given to me.

167
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,810
I will marry, leave the palace, and live quietly.

168
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,450
What did Queen Dowager have to say?

169
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,870
Will she delay the wedding due to the king's illness?

170
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,790
I will go forward with it no matter what happens.

171
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,600
Please give Grand Prince Eun Seong some time to accept it.

172
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
He is a loyal and filial son, he will soon follow your wish.

173
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,170
We don't have time.

174
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,780
There's something that he really wants. I will have to make a deal with him.

175
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,920
Tell Chief Scholar's daughter to come to the palace.

176
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,190
 Plaque of the God of Heaven and Earth

177
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,670
What are you doing, Wife?

178
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,380
It's a pledge of loyalty that I offer to you.

179
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,850
Weren't you satisfied with brandishing your silver knife before the marriage?

180
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,980
What's this about?

181
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,920
 As the wife of Grand Prince Jin Yang, I, Yoon Na Gyeom, dare to implore the heavens,

182
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,870
 ancestors of the royal shrine, guardians of Joseon, and deities of the mountains&nbsp;and water.

183
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,800
 This&nbsp;humble consort seeks&nbsp;to help her husband accomplish his mammoth&nbsp;pursuit,

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,870
 helping him&nbsp;with loyalty,&nbsp;believing in his love, and loving&nbsp;him like kindred.

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,790
 I will&nbsp;stay&nbsp;steadfast, sincere, and strong.

186
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,200
Yoon Na Gyeom, the wife of Grand Prince Jin Yang,

187
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,380
dares to announce to the God of Heaven, the royal ancestors,

188
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,600
and the divine spirits of the mountains and rivers.

189
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,410
I wish to aid my husband in realizing his great cause.

190
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,190
To trust each other with mutual loyalty and love each other with affection.

191
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,360
I will love with my flesh and blood, and I will show strength as stone and metal.

192
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,400
From today onward, I am not your wife but your vassal.

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,150
Since the Warring States Period, people pledged loyalty to their masters and

194
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,520
they became blood brothers by drinking animal blood together.

195
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,410
Rather than being a beloved wife who knows nothing,

196
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,670
I wish to become a loyal vassal who serves you devotedly.

197
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,050
I will stake my life and the fate of my family

198
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,370
for the sake of your cause.

199
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,460
Today seems to be our true wedding day.

200
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,620
Isn't this good enough, madam?

201
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,310
No, it isn't.  I would like it a bit fancier.

202
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,880
- Try this on.
 - It's already the fifth one.

203
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,390
I'll be tired from dressing up even before I enter the palace.

204
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,900
Is this an ordinary place you are going to?

205
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,960
You'll be showing yourself to the queen dowager.

206
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,160
If you fail this time, you're going to end up a virgin ghost.

207
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,500
That's why these won't do!

208
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,710
If it were you, would you like your daughter-in-law to be extravagant or frugal?

209
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,790
Me? I just want a daughter-in-law who treats me well.

210
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,580
You too, dress simply and elegantly, okay?

211
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,720
Take off these gold rings and jade rings.

212
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,570
That's right. I'm not as great as you, so I am shallow and extravagant.

213
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,360
So you should go alone! Go alone get into her good books.

214
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,650
Mother! That's not what I meant.

215
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,370
How could you not know what I feel?

216
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,050
I was trying to make you look smart so that you wouldn't feel intimidated in such a difficult setting.

217
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,360
Do whatever you want!

218
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,960
What would you like to wear?

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,380
I want...

220
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,890
How's this?

221
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,120
How pretty!

222
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,640
In charge of your security?

223
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,580
If the greatness of the promotion suddenly gets bigger,

224
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,660
it could be difficult to handle.  Let's start with this.

225
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,310
I feel sorry, but I'll promise it for the future.

226
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,850
No, Your Highness.

227
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,020
Having lost my father early, I am humbled by all that I've received already.

228
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,320
Thanks to you two, I have been honored greatly today.

229
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,660
You need to secure a strong position, Hyung-nim.

230
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,820
That's how you can help me greatly.

231
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,290
Whatever it is, you only have to order me.

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,830
When you rise in position, you'll need to spend more money.

233
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,190
Have your allowance money.

234
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,510
Don't be frugal. Every month, I'll give you a great amount of money.

235
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,470
Whether it be the business leaders or the military officers under you, you need to gain their good opinion.

236
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,020
Don't worry, sir.

237
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,990
There are hundreds of men who will run over even after just hearing a word.

238
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,510
Hundreds won't do.

239
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,800
When the time comes, even thousands will not be enough.

240
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,030
Your Highness, I am on my way to the palace.

241
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,080
If you do not need anything else, I plan to leave now.

242
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,270
What business do you have in the palace?

243
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,360
Queen Mother wanted me to see the potential bride of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

244
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,770
Who is the potential bride?

245
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,400
It is my friend, the daughter of Chief Scholar.

246
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,590
Was Queen Mother  the one who chose that household?

247
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,440
I heard that it was proposed by Grand Prince Eun Seong.

248
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,490
I will take you there. I also have some business in the palace.

249
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,970
I heard you're best friends with the princess consort.

250
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,530
Yes, Your Highness. Na Gyeomâ€“

251
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,320
Her Highness is a great role model who is always disciplined.

252
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
She is like an elder sister from whom I can learn.

253
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,800
We attended bride training classes together, Your Highness.

254
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,170
Were you envious when your classmate became part of the royal family?

255
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,150
I was not envious of the status as a princess consort.

256
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,490
Then what were you envious about?

257
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,940
I was envious that she found a husband that she could dedicate her whole heart to.

258
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,990
The princess consort sincerely takes care of her husband and respects him.

259
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,550
I will ask you a simple-minded question.

260
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,720
If your parents and your husband fell in the water, whom would you save first?

261
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,830
Naturally, I should save my aged parents.

262
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,530
What would you do?

263
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,280
I would save my husband first.

264
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,820
I apologize, Queen Dowager.

265
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,610
She lacks proper teaching, so an unreasonable answer slipped out.

266
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,770
- Please forgive herâ€”
 - What would be your reason?

267
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,920
I believe that parents' love is such that they would not want to sacrifice their child to save their lives.

268
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,520
I believe that filial piety is to live up to your parents' wishes.

269
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,440
Will you protect your husband no matter what happens?

270
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,300
We will live protecting each other.

271
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,890
Well done. You didn't make any big mistakes, and it went smoothly enough.

272
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,200
I was nervous, but I felt confident because you were beside me.

273
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,530
You gave me strength.

274
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,580
Even if this scatterbrain gets married, take care of her, Na Gyeom.

275
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,730
I was worried that you would find it difficult to speak to me comfortably

276
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,670
because my rank is now higher than yours since I married into the royal family.

277
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,870
I am relieved that you are comfortable around me as always.

278
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,950
My worries were unnecessary.

279
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,840
Take care. I will put a good word in with Queen Mother for you.

280
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,670
Thank you, Na Gyeom.

281
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,310
Then, take care.

282
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,020
She was taunting me, right?

283
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,340
How so? She wanted us to be comfortable around her like before.

284
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,700
No... She pretended not to, but I felt a thorn in her words.

285
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm a bit sensitive, you know?

286
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,820
Why don't you become a little sensitive when you're with Father?

287
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,630
Stop getting caught while you're gambling.

288
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,660
But would you really save your husband before me if we fell in the water?

289
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,310
Grand Prince can swim well. I don't have to save him.

290
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,020
That... That's not what I wanted to know!

291
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,720
This just won't do.

292
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,600
During the bride-to-be classes, she always fled.

293
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,280
When she was not allowed to go out, she would disguise herself and go out anyway and get into trouble.

294
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,700
I was able to get along as a friend because I'd mentor her but not as the wife of Grand Prince.

295
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,750
Her lack of virtue is too great to be the wife of Grand Prince.

296
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,090
She will bring down the dignity of the royal family.

297
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,960
She didn't seem that terrible.

298
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,760
At least she's not greedy.

299
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,540
Perhaps she gave up on her greed to marry into a prestigious family?

300
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,220
That's why she is not suitable to be a women of the royal household.

301
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,640
Do you not like the idea of Lady Seong becoming your sister-in-law?

302
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,430
To tell you honestly,

303
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,890
this is not for the royal family, but for her as a friend.

304
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,700
Ja Hyeon is not suitable for the royal family.

305
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,970
She will feel suffocated and become depressed if she marries the grand prince.

306
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,610
This marriage must be stopped for her own happiness.

307
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,900
The Grand Prince asked to see you for a moment.

308
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,100
He probably wants to know how your meeting went.

309
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,640
Go and report to him. I will wait out here.

310
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,920
But still.

311
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,100
What? Then do you want your mother to follow you?

312
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,330
Where is he asking me to meet him?

313
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,250
Acting so coy.

314
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,260
I don't know if this is an ideal match or not.

315
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:18,250
My blood will dry worrying about her if she marries into the royal family.

316
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,220
Your Highness.

317
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,130
This marriage cannot happen.

318
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,650
You are utterly dishonorable.

319
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,950
When you know that I am Grand Prince Eun Seong's woman, why are you acting like this every single time?

320
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,330
As a brother, I can't approve of this marriage.

321
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,250
I have already completed my introduction to the queen dowager.

322
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,480
The woman I love is to become my sister-in-law.

323
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,670
Is that even possible?

324
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,900
How can you let your personal greed get in the way of your brother's path?

325
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm warning you as his senior. This marriage cannot happen.

326
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,970
Man cannot stop the work of heaven.

327
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,940
Grand Prince Eun Seong and I are fated.

328
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,690
No matter how much you hate it, you can't end our connection.

329
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,390
You will be able to see

330
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,040
the power of a person who overcomes heaven's will.

331
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,130
If you give up first,

332
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,280
Hwi won't have to get hurt.

333
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,640
I saw Na Gyeom at the queen's quarters.

334
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,850
Do not forget. You are one woman's husband now.

335
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,970
If you want to get married to Chief Scholar's daughter, you have to accept the title of saejae.

336
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,370
How many times do I have to tell you?

337
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,700
I do not want the throne or the title of saejae.

338
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,980
You aren't ascending to the throne for real. Until the king's illness gets better,

339
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,540
or Wonja becomes old enough to ascend to the throne, I'm asking you to block the petitions of the courtiers.

340
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,080
I have no legitimacy to take that on.

341
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,760
Are you going to manipulate the national rule of royal succession for temporary expediency?

342
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,490
You are a grand prince! You have to be able to die for the king's family.

343
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,250
I would rather put my life on the line.

344
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,230
If you don't accept this duty,  you'll have no right to marry as you wish as a Joseon prince.

345
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,330
Queen Mother!

346
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:20,790
Your Highness, the person that the queen dowager is planning on installing as saejae is Grand Prince Eun Seong.

347
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,830
Did you know this?  Mother wants Eun Seong as saejae, not me.

348
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,550
The queen dowager is taking the royal court into a precipice.

349
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:48,350
Don't worry. If Hwi is gone, that can't possibly happen.

350
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,150
Do you have a plan?

351
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,670
Don't interfere with anything, Nephew.

352
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,810
If you get involved now, you can become a casualty of the brother to brother conflict.

353
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,890
Are you telling me to just sit and watch everything done to me?

354
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,260
Blood should only get on my hands.

355
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,370
Now, do you get it? The queen dowager is not your mother.

356
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:17,510
That woman is an unprincipled politician who abandons her own children in order to protect her eldest son and grandchild.

357
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,160
I must ask her at least once

358
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,310
what her true feeling is,

359
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,890
whether she even considers me her son.

360
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,660
Your uncle is the only one there for you.

361
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,140
If it's for you, Grand Prince,

362
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
I can even put my life on the line.

363
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:03,650
Since you are preoccupied with selection of a crown prince when the king is ill and we are in the middle of conflict,

364
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,430
I've decided to accept your advice and select a saejae (the king's brother as crown prince).

365
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,190
That cannot happen, Your Highness.

366
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,830
What do you mean by appointing a saejae when we have a wonja (a minor heir to the throne) in place?

367
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,320
Shouldn't we discuss this when His Majesty is fully recovered?

368
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,070
His Majesty has agreed to this.

369
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,960
I will advise the royal secretary and set the date for the installation of the saejae.

370
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,320
We can resolve the national emergency once Grand Prince Jin Yang is able to represent us.

371
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,900
What do you mean Grand Prince Jin Yang?

372
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,840
Did you not say you will appoint a saejae?

373
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,870
The saejae His Majesty and I have decided on is not Grand Prince Jin Yang but Grand Prince Eun Seong.

374
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,700
This is not following the natural order of things.

375
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,250
Grand Prince Jin Yang is the older brother.

376
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,890
How can the third brother, Grand Prince Eun Seong, take his place?

377
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,540
That is not possible.

378
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,210
All of our people will not accept it, not to mention your ministers.

379
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,700
Please withdraw the order.

380
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,070
Since King Taejo founded Joseon Dynasty,

381
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:19,650
this is not the first time the younger brother became a crown prince over his older brothers.

382
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,490
The rule of primogeniture (the oldest being the heir) has not been strictly adhered to.

383
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,310
On what basis are you making your arguments?

384
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,250
The younger princes of the Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty were appointed as crown prince.

385
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,580
To obtain approval from China, we'll need a crown prince who is learned and accomplished.

386
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,930
Grand Prince Eun Seong is already recognized as such and therefore better suited.

387
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,130
His Majesty has already decided on this matter.  I will hear no more from you.

388
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,000
This is not possible, Your Highness.

389
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,620
We cannot undermine the fundamental rule of royal succession.

390
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,130
Please reconsider your decision.

391
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,370
Do you know that you are speaking nonsense?

392
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,470
You were arguing to break the rule all along and now you want to follow the rules?

393
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,590
It makes sense to go back to the way it was in the first place with the appointment of the saejae.

394
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,150
Please withdraw your order, Your Highness.

395
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,110
This will shake the foundation of our nation.

396
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,440
Please withdraw the order.

397
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,660
Please withdraw the order.

398
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,930
Please call my name.

399
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,700
Your Highness, Grand Prince Yang Ahn is here.

400
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,190
What brings you to the great hall?

401
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:11,130
I am here to speak about the national matter on behalf of all royal family members.

402
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,070
If it's about the selection of a saejae, the king's decision has already been announced.

403
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,920
Actually, I am here to speak in regards to the troop mobilization.

404
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,570
Since it will be difficult for the elderly Left Minister to go to the front line,

405
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,830
I would like to volunteer to go instead.

406
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,670
You are volunteering yourself?

407
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,150
Those who have a lot to protect could be scared of dying.

408
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,270
Grand Prince, you are speaking out of line.

409
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,480
But I am different.

410
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,370
Without a way to be of service, I've been wandering all of my life.

411
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,550
This will be an honor and pleasure.

412
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:03,700
Can the king be at peace, knowing that his family member is at the front line?

413
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,440
Please leave this matter to the subordinates.

414
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,440
If the royal family members don't show by example,

415
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,660
what subordinates will respect the royal family?

416
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,280
Why would people follow?

417
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,510
We've called for militia from all parts of the country, but they've been slow in coming.

418
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,590
If we don't send our troops from the capital, people will continue to suffer.

419
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,740
If we don't have anyone more suitable,

420
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,160
the royal family will have no choice but to serve.

421
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,130
Since Left Minister's son has had a great deal of experience having served with his father,

422
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,920
please have him appointed as my deputy.

423
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,960
The newly appointed saejae will need to demonstrate his ability

424
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,430
and prove that he's able to carry out his new responsibilities.

425
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,970
Isn't Grand Prince Jin Yang more capable in military pursuits?

426
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,930
That's why I thought of taking Grand Prince Jin Yang at first.

427
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:14,800
However, the one who will take on the full responsibilities of the royal family will be Eun Seong.

428
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,590
What should we do with Grand Prince Yang Ahn?

429
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,060
That horrible man is cornering my child to the brink of death.

430
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,720
Actually, it could be a plan that could buy us more time.

431
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,210
He wants the grand prince to serve the nation before becoming crown prince.

432
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,290
In the interim, the debate about the next heir to the throne should cool down

433
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,160
and the war will be suppressed at the same time.

434
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,490
And if the king recovers from his illness,

435
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,120
there will be no more need for a saejae or anything else.

436
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,660
The baby wonja will be growing year by year.

437
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,100
And the succession plan will unfold as you wish.

438
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,750
Their provocation could work out to our benefit.

439
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,170
Eun Seong... Hwi could be put in danger.

440
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,410
You know who Kim Kwan is.

441
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,840
He is the son of Kim Chu, also known as Big Tiger, and the brother of the queen.

442
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,260
Royalty should not be placed on the front line in the first place.

443
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,280
With Kim Kwan, Hwi will be protected to the maximum?

444
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,310
Kim Kwan will risk his life to protect Hwi.

445
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,000
Queen Dowager announced the plan to install you as saejae.

446
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,540
The ministers were in an uproar in opposition to it.

447
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,880
Then, Grand Prince Yang Ahn suddenly appeared and said he'd take you and go to the northern regions.

448
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,440
It was quite a commotion.

449
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,750
What's the matter?

450
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:04,150
Am I... truly your son?

451
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,280
Why are you like this to me?

452
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
What are you so greedy for?

453
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,380
Greed? It's something I obviously must have.

454
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,550
Isn't a child supposed to be raised in his parents' embrace?

455
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:22,710
So that I would not be in the king's way, you sent me, your own blood, out of the palace when I was a baby, as if I were something terrible.

456
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,820
Now, you're ignoring the right and fair way of succession.

457
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,440
You're making the youngest brother the saejae.

458
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,080
Am I not your son, Queen Mother?

459
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,930
I also do not think it is proper to install a saejae.

460
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,550
Since we already have a baby wonja, it is right that we wait.

461
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,200
If you can appreciate what I'm thinking,

462
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,700
can you not help me?

463
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,220
To defeat the appeals of the courtiers who are swarming around like bees

464
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,390
by lessening their annoyance and putting the affairs of the nation back on track.

465
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,480
What do I lack so much?

466
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,000
I am healthier than the king and older than Hwi.

467
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,340
The barbarians from the north and the Japanese raiders from the south!

468
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,530
I am confident that I could make them kneel at my feet.

469
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,550
Am I lacking in studies or not eloquent enough?

470
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,780
Why can it not be me?

471
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,100
Because of your greed. Rather than the country's affairs, the royal family, or your brothers,

472
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,330
you always put yourself first. Your greed is the reason you cannot be.

473
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,490
Do you believe that a king's role is an honor?

474
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,750
It requires endless sacrifices, devotion, and patience.

475
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,950
The king's role is to be the servant of everyone who depends on him.

476
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,520
I had forgotten. You act nice as though you have no greed.

477
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,310
But it's always you who ends up stabbing me in the back.

478
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,280
The one who gets everything in the end.

479
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,830
A greedy, ferocious fellow.

480
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,940
If you hadn't raised this debate about the installation of a saejae,

481
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,550
we wouldn't be where we are.

482
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,990
Your useless greed has caused great trouble to the royal family.

483
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,650
Do you really want to blame another person right now?

484
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,930
You ended up winning the throne because of it.

485
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,460
Aren't you thankful towards me?

486
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,560
I'm different from you. It's not what I wanted!

487
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,640
Then, throw it away.

488
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,260
Stay out of it. This isn't a game for you to be a part of.

489
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,950
If you get greedy, it causes me to get caught up in it.

490
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,160
You are the one who should throw away your greed.

491
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,450
With one wrong move by greed, we could be labeled as traitors in an instant.

492
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,820
Please come to your senses!

493
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,740
Queen Mother, can you retract your order?

494
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,020
If you do this, I'll end up being estranged even more from my brother.

495
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,240
We are a family before we are royalty.

496
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,230
Do you want to see your family members hating each other and being hostile?

497
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,530
Empress LÃ¼ of the Han Dynasty had her son locked up.

498
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,910
Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty killed her sons one by one.

499
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,750
They say that a royal family should raise their children as if they are enemies.

500
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,970
In the face of power, parents, children, and siblings

501
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,060
fight among themselves to death.

502
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,220
I cannot just live as a mother.

503
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,690
So I cry bitter tears every night.

504
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,720
But, when the sun rises, I wipe my pillowcase that is wet from tears

505
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,660
and throw away my own child if necessary since that's my fate.

506
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,830
That is the responsibility of someone who marries into the royal family.

507
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,240
Stop talking about having a carefree love, and accept your fate.

508
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,280
Just as being born as a grand prince was not your choice,

509
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,140
the royal family's orders are not a choice for you to make.

510
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,110
Since I was not a crown prince, but a grand prince,

511
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,830
I wanted to live quietly.

512
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,970
But, now, since I was born as a grand prince,

513
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,970
are you telling me to jump into the middle of all this turmoil?

514
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,350
Your fate is owned by the nation.

515
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,730
Even your life is not yours.

516
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,220
Queen Mother does not want to give the role of the successor

517
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,270
to me or anyone else.

518
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,710
But she is planning on giving that role to Hwi, who is obedient.

519
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,860
I'm going to take Eun Seong to the battlefield.

520
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,100
If he is an existence that endangers your future,

521
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:11,010
I must get rid of him, even if he is your younger brother.

522
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,610
Even fathers and sons cannot share political power.

523
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,250
Would that be any more different between siblings?

524
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,260
Uncle, you will be in danger now, too.

525
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,340
How can you volunteer for such hardship on my behalf?

526
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,770
It's not for your sake.

527
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:32,000
It's for my dream. My dream for you to sit on that red throne

528
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,120
and rule over the sky and the earth of Joseon!

529
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,810
I have promised you the throne already.

530
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,850
Even if I have to give up my life,

531
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,390
I will make that dream come true.

532
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,710
Who are you getting married to? Grand Prince Eun Seong?

533
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:07,690
The king's youngest brother?  The one I like?

534
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,560
It's true.

535
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,260
Are you really my friend?

536
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,800
I said that I'd get married to him because I liked him.

537
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,250
I liked him first.

538
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,240
When? You never said a word all this time about it.

539
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,700
It's because I didn't know he was Grand Prince Eun Seong.

540
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,550
This doesn't make sense. You can't do this!

541
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,850
How dare you take my man from me?

542
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,530
Don't you get married to him.

543
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,020
You can't! I'm not going to let you!

544
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:55,110
Ah, really.

545
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,600
Seol Hwa. Seol Hwa! If you go like this...

546
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,880
Don't cry, Seol Hwa.

547
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,890
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.

548
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,620
I had a reason for that.

549
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,910
It must've been funny to you.

550
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,510
When I was excited and talked about him, not knowing anything,

551
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,350
you must've been sneering at me inside.

552
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,790
- It's not like that. 
 - Choose.

553
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,380
Your friend or a man?

554
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,650
This isn't that sort of situation.

555
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,330
Why not?

556
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,250
If you marry him knowing full well that I like him,

557
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,730
it's the end of our friendship.

558
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,560
Hey. Have you ever seen the grand prince's face?

559
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,810
Have you talked to him before? Have you ever made a promise?

560
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,440
Why are you treating him like your man?

561
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,450
What about you? Have you ever dated the grand prince, or something?

562
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,260
Is he not a stranger to both of us?

563
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:11,030
Honestly, if you and I were standing side by side and asked him to choose,

564
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,760
whom would he choose?

565
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,290
We are both deeply in love.

566
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,050
We met by coincidence when I didn't know he was the grand prince, and our passion grew deeper.

567
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,450
It's not the time for you to get between us.

568
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,950
They say that the quiet cat gets to the top of the wood-burning stove first.

569
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:37,200
No, you weren't even quiet.

570
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,880
You went up there so directly.

571
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,500
Relax. Also, congratulate me as a friend.

572
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,130
You like to be congratulated.

573
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,390
This is the end for you and me.

574
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,210
Seol Hwa left. How do I clear up the misunderstanding?

575
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,910
Leave it.  For preventing her from becoming a young widow,

576
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:19,030
she might be thankful to you.

577
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,350
You should also stop pursuing him right now.

578
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,100
How can you think of marriage with someone who might not live?

579
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,570
What does that mean?

580
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,290
I'm talking about Grand Prince Eun Seong.

581
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,630
He's going to the north to fight the Jurchens.

582
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,090
He can't promise to come back alive, can he?

583
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,580
 I am telling you all of this for your sake.

584
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:45,320
Even if it's a royal marriage, if you're not careful, you could die a virgin.

585
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,400
I would think about it again if I were you.

586
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,000
Are you sure about that?

587
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,820
Grand Prince Eun Seong is going into the battlefield?

588
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:00,190
He didn't tell you anything?

589
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:19,450
Why are you asking me to do something so dangerous?

590
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,650
Because I trust you.

591
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,210
What would you do if I become greedy?

592
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,150
What if I ignore your order,

593
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,220
and covet my nephew's throne?

594
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:41,510
I already know. Your greed is not for political power but for happiness.

595
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:46,140
You don't ignore the pain of a flower at the end of its bloom

596
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:52,430
nor a bug being stepped on carelessly.  That's your heart.

597
00:46:53,830 --> 00:47:02,170
I already know you are someone who could never cause harm to others.

598
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,860
I am not cut out to do this.

599
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:09,510
Even if it is to protect the throne of the royal family,

600
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,710
I cannot accept your order to be saejae.

601
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,870
Hwi.

602
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,950
However, I will go out to the battlefield.

603
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,060
I decline political power, but I will accept the task given to me.

604
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,850
To not ignore the suffering of our people

605
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:38,340
is the responsibility of the royal family and grand prince.

606
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,840
Please welcome me back well and strong,

607
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,950
when I come back to see you.

608
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,450
Are you leaving already?

609
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,360
Is it true

610
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,610
that Grand Prince Eun Seong has been deployed?

611
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,890
Did you not know until now?

612
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,860
He volunteered himself.

613
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,770
As an act of someone who's about to marry,

614
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,340
isn't he very different from others, indeed?

615
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,890
I guess you were nothing to him.

616
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,250
That you're his fated lover,

617
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,360
isn't it the most terrible fate of all?

618
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,940
Lady.

619
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,030
Is there something wrong?

620
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:15,180
You deceived me again, Your Highness.

621
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,030
I heard you are going to the battlefield.

622
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,690
The troops that have to face the Jurchens each time they come

623
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,530
cannot farm or raise animals,

624
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,380
but only engage in a war that kills and captures.

625
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,390
Lady.

626
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,590
I heard that they will scalp your head and take your skull.

627
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:41,400
This whole day, all I've heard is how ruthless and violent those people are.

628
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,200
Who is it? Who has made you tremble with fear like this?

629
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,560
It's you, Grand Prince.

630
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,250
At first, you didn't tell me who you are.

631
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,230
Then, you asked me to become your wife.

632
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,240
And behind my back, were you planning to leave me and go to the battlefield?

633
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,580
- It's not like that. 
 - Then are you not going?

634
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,880
Are you not going out to war?!

635
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,070
I completely understand.

636
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:22,080
I have come to fully understand how insignificant I am to you, Grand Prince.

637
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,230
Lady!

638
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,890
She must have already heard from someone else.

639
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,640
She should have heard it from you first.

640
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,380
My lady!

641
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,750
Am I really nothing to you?

642
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,970
It's not like that!

643
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,950
Will you not go if I tell you not to?

644
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,480
Then, let's get married first before you go.

645
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,730
I will wait for you as your wife.

646
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,710
Let's get married when I return.

647
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,000
I will bring you a gift of victory.

648
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,340
I am saying this because you may not be able to return.

649
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,180
Then just don't go!

650
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,940
I will make sure to come back alive.

651
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,390
My life is yours.

652
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,980
I will not forget that you are waiting for me even for a second.

653
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,600
I can't tell you not to go or ask you to marry me first.

654
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,160
Why aren't you listening to any of my requests?

655
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:02,050
I only wanted to live as your man.

656
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:08,090
But before I am your man, Lee Hwi,

657
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,740
I am this country's grand prince, Eun Seong.

658
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,890
If I were to decline my duties and run to you instead,

659
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,880
I would not be able live my life with pride.

660
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,140
Please wait for me until I finish my duty and come back.

661
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,700
What you have to do is even more important than winning over the Jurchens.

662
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,190
You have to protect Grand Prince Eun Seong.

663
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:06,390
He is the only one who can stop the poison of Grand Prince Jin Yang.

664
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,550
I ask of you, Brother. Grand Prince Eun Seong must be alive

665
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,310
in order for our wonja to live.

666
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,650
Don't worry, Your Highness.

667
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:19,060
Who am I?  I'm the son of the man who had the Jurchens shaking in fear for all those years.

668
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,030
The border region is my play area.

669
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:26,260
I will do everything to make sure Prince Eun Seong returns safely.

670
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,160
Please forgive your sister.

671
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,000
I have to protect my child first.

672
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:37,520
So I make this request and send you to the battlefield.

673
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,430
You want me to go into the battlefield?

674
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,920
Why me?  I'm not a military officer.

675
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,190
I am still a student at Sungyunggwan without a title.

676
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,650
Then, do you want me to go?

677
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,780
Father, you can't go either!

678
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,330
Why are you hitting my son?!

679
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,930
Why are you doing this, seriously?!

680
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,630
Even the royal family members are signing up.

681
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,900
There are two men in this family.

682
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,980
At least one of us must sign up to protect our reputation.

683
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,610
Father, is the family reputation more important than life?

684
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,950
For the chief scholar, it's more important than life.

685
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,650
If it wasn't for the king's illness, I would have gone myself.

686
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,980
I cannot go even if I want to,

687
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,140
just in case something happens at the court in my absence.

688
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,740
No one can go!

689
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,790
To me, the life of my family is more important than the family reputation.

690
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,950
Without my approval, no one in this family can go!

691
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,820
Aigoo.

692
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,690
Is this the place you wanted to visit with me?

693
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:15,300
There's something I need to do with you here.

694
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,760
Tell me everything you want to do and have.

695
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:27,360
I want to ride a horse, like before. Together with Your Highness.

696
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,710
Anything else?

697
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,880
I, Seong Ja Hyeon, with this country's grand prince...

698
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:57,320
I, Seong Ja Hyeon, take my fated love, Lee Hwi, as my husband, till the end of this life.

699
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,010
And the next life given to us, after the end of this life.

700
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,460
I, Lee Hwi, take Seong Ja Hyeon as my wife.

701
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:12,520
I swear to love and treasure her with all of my heart.

702
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,490
I swear before Buddha.

703
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,810
The world doesn't know that we are now married.

704
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:44,690
We are now a married couple.

705
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,910
Even though I am leaving you behind right now,

706
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,130
I will not be separated from you for even a moment after I return.

707
00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:01,310
When the sun rises and sets, when the moon rises or gets hidden behind the clouds,

708
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:09,070
when it rains or it is windy, I will be by your side, always.

709
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,840
We'll eat three meals of a day together.

710
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,450
We'll drink good tea together and learn how to drink alcohol.

711
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:25,810
When the flowers bloom, we'll look at them together. When the water freezes, we'll slide on the ice.

712
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:30,800
Whether it be happy or sad events, we will do it together.

713
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:59,400
Don't forget that I'll be waiting for you.

714
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,950
â™«   My tears are not coming out   â™«

715
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:12,330
â™«   I cannot even laugh   â™«

716
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:19,010
â™«   My loneliness has piled up   â™«

717
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:24,870
â™«   Everything has been broken   â™«

718
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,910
â™«   I try to fix it   â™«

719
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:38,340
â™«   I can't do anything   â™«

720
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:45,290
â™«   Because of you, it has rusted   â™«

721
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:49,540
â™«   What do I do with myself?   â™«.

722
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,120
It is okay. They're dirty.

723
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:59,710
â™«   It's because my chest feels tight   â™«

724
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:07,480
â™«   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   â™«

725
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:14,350
â™«   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,   â™«

726
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:19,400
â™«    You spread across my heart   â™«

727
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:26,020
â™«   Love is so mean    â™«

728
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:33,820
â™«    Why do you keep shaking up my heart?   â™«

729
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:41,160
â™«   As much as it is sad, this mean love   â™«

730
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:46,850
â™«   You don't know it yet   â™«

731
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,200
You startled me!

732
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,690
Kkeut Dan.

733
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,190
What? Are you hungry?

734
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,400
Do you need a late-night snack? Or, water?

735
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,640
Do you know that I'm leaving tomorrow?

736
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,850
Yes, I do. You'll be on the military expedition.

737
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:17,390
Since I might not see you again after leaving like this, I'm going to gather my courage andâ€”

738
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,120
Why wouldn't we see each other again?

739
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,380
It's a military expedition. A battlefield. Do you know how brutal the barbarians are?

740
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,350
I could die over there.

741
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,080
Young Master, you won't die.

742
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,000
Right. Since I am brave and strong, I won't die easily, right?

743
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,120
But still, you never know in a war.

744
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,460
- Young Master. 
- Yes?

745
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,510
You know, you're a scaredy cat and a coward.

746
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,860
Don't go near the front line of the battle.

747
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,380
If you hide in the back very well, you'll be safe.

748
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,230
You really have the wrong idea about me.

749
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,760
I am really brave.

750
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,300
If you go forward recklessly, you could be harmed.

751
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,010
Just make yourself scarce and quiet and then come back.

752
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:16,750
Anyway, since this is my last night, there are things I wanted to tell you.

753
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,930
Oh, you'll have to leave early in the morning. Please hurry and sleep.

754
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:25,460
If you're to travel a long way, you have to get good sleep.

755
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,930
I haven't finished talking!

756
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,710
Here, you can give it to me. I'll help.

757
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,820
No, I'm going to do it with my own hands.

758
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:53,890
Then, you can't finish it today. He's leaving tomorrow.

759
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,600
Are you going to make him wear half of that?

760
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:00,100
Stitch by stitch, I have to add the prayer for Grand Prince's safe return.

761
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,540
I can do that, too.

762
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,380
You will not be as earnest me.

763
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,060
I thought I'd perhaps see you when the soldiers were dispatched.

764
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:40,520
This is Grandfather's sword.

765
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,330
It's a treasure that was handed down to me.

766
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:46,250
I want to give this to you, since you'll be on the battlefield.

767
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,490
This sword will protect you.

768
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,600
I hope you'll take care of the king and our mother.

769
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,630
Also...

770
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,280
our young nephew.

771
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:08,080
I will trust you, Hyung, and come back safely.

772
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,950
It's the path I was supposed to take.

773
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,880
I know.

774
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,020
Do you not harbor any resentment?

775
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,870
It wouldn't be any more difficult than worrying about you if you were to go instead.

776
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:26,130
That's what family is, right?

777
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,350
Had we not been born into a royal family,

778
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:34,570
we would've had a pretty good relationship as brothers.

779
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,490
We can still be on good terms right now...

780
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,200
as long as you don't have useless greed.

781
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:34,890

782
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,810
Which household are you from?

783
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:45,900
I am from the household of Grand Prince Yang Ahn.

784
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,800
I'm from Chief Scholar's household.

785
01:05:52,930 --> 01:06:00,430
â™«   If I just keep walking like this endlessly   â™«

786
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:06,550
â™«   It feels like I'll be able to see you   â™«

787
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,600
â™«   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   â™«

788
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,360
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love 
â™«   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   â™«

789
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,890
  Who are you?

790
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,660
 Are you a spy from the Jurchens or an escapee who betrayed his comrades?

791
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,960
  I think Eun Seong is hiding a girl.

792
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,780
 There is a woman in our expedition?

793
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,370
   Everything is my fault.

794
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,550
 I will take any punishment coming to me.

795
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,600
 When does a woman lose her heart to a man?

796
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,830
 Don't push your one and only daughter to a place where she cannot foretell one day to the next.

797
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,680
 You want to negotiate with the Jurchens?

798
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,210
  Then, will you go?

799
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,670
â™«   No matter what I blame   â™«

800
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,970
â™«   But wherever I look, itâ€™s only painful roads for me   â™«

801
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,880
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
