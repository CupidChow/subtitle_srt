1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,690
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:13,500

3
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:50,010
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,290
  Episode 8

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,660
What was that? Did something happen?

6
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,450
We're in trouble. Our troops started to attack.

7
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,140
What do you mean?

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,350
His Highness is in the middle of negotiation here. What do you mean attack?

9
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,980
It's a trap. Grand Prince Yang Ahn set a trap for you.

10
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,710
No way. It's a misunderstanding.

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,780
You ask for negotiation and then attack us from behind?

12
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,540
What is he saying?

13
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,190
They think we've betrayed them.

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,820
We will take the grand prince.

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,420
Yes.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,530
What are you doing? Let me go!

17
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,980
- Your Highness! 
 - No!

18
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,510
Your Highness!

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,980
That way!

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,090
Your Highness, this way, this way.

21
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,560
Roo Si Gae?

22
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,180
Follow me.

23
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,890
She said to follow her.

24
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,110
Hurry!  Hurry up!

25
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,110
Wear this.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,640
It's better that way.  In a place with no traffic,

27
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,690
it'll be hard to escape safely.

28
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,790
- I left my clothing behind. 
 - The one Lady Ja Hyeon gave you?

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,820
There is no time to go back.

30
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,840
Your Highness!

31
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,740
You can't, Your Highness.

32
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,050
Stay where you are!

33
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,540
Where are you going?

34
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,290
We've received an order to report to our camp.

35
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,430
Your camp is not

36
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,980
in this direction.

37
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,590
They're the enemies!

38
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,870
We separate here.  I'll meet you at the Joseon military camp.

39
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,590
No we can't! Let's go together!

40
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,990
Take him away. Hurry! Hurry up!

41
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,300
- Lieutenant! No!  
- We must go!

42
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,400
- We can't just go by ourselves! 
 - To him, we are a baggage!

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,660
He can fly when he travels alone!

44
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,020
Please believe in him! Please!  Please!

45
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,730
Let go!

46
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,310
Hurry up! Hurry up!

47
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,550
Gi Teuk!

48
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,330
Hurry!

49
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,010
You're only praying for the grand prince, right? You're not even thinking about your brother?

50
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,000
You're already praying hard for my brother.

51
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,110
How heartless.

52
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,210
We've done as you asked.  Vacate the village.

53
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,880
We've let you have a big win.  Now keep your promise.

54
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,350
Since you've won, keep your promise.

55
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,510
 Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe, Chieftain Li Man Zhu:
Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon

56
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,870
 and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.

57
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,120
Don't forget.

58
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,230
The throne the grand prince will get

59
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,590
is a gift from us.

60
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,460
What happened to Grand Prince Eun Seong?

61
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,570
What happened to Grand Prince Eun Seong?

62
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,670
How are you feeling?

63
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,870
He's getting stronger every day, thanks to your well wishes.

64
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,790
What a great relief.

65
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,030
We are bringing good medicine from all eight provinces.

66
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,010
Please do not decline anything that's brought here from the royal infirmary.

67
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,090
Thank you. More than myself,

68
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,030
I am worried for Eun Seong, who is out on the battlefield.

69
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,020
Given his gentle temperament,

70
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,510
I wonder how he's handling the life and death situations out there.

71
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,090
You should've sent me.

72
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,400
Wasn't it Uncle's decision?

73
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,990
Because you wanted to appoint Hwi  as saejae.

74
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,600
You won't say that it was Queen Mother's will, right?

75
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,690
His Majesty needs rest.  Please discuss governing matters next time.

76
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,790
I am your younger brother, too.

77
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm not a stranger. I am your family!

78
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,990
So... do you love me?

79
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,470
Since you're my younger brother, do you love me and consider your nephew precious?

80
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,250
Are you asking for my loyalty?

81
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,420
How far do I have to go to show it? What do I have to do?

82
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,290
It's not loyalty but the love of a younger brother that I want.

83
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,680
Aren't we family?

84
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,340
Queen Mother, Your Majesty,

85
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,940
and Eun Seong

86
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
are family, it appears.

87
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,210
Kang.

88
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,800
You are our family, too.

89
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,870
Don't forget that.

90
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,020
- Cheers!
 - Yes, cheers!

91
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,580
When our advance troopers arrived there,

92
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,080
the Orangkae (derogatory term for the Jurchens) bastards were coming at us like a hive of bees.

93
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Right then,  I yelled like a lion, just like this.

94
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,260
I don't know if they were scared out their wits, but they started to slowly, slowly back away.

95
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,880
That's strange.

96
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,030
When our soldiers went into the village, the whole village was empty.

97
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,310
There weren't even rats to be seen, from what I heard.

98
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,920
Who said that, huh?

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,030
Everyone did.

100
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,860
That's because the ones who came late didn't see us fight.

101
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,040
I thought Grand Prince Eun Seong had, once and for all,

102
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,820
settled everything, and taken care of it.

103
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,490
Grand Prince Eun Seong returned safely from the enemy camp, right?

104
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,960
Looks like they escaped in a hurry.  They left all of their belongings behind.

105
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,200
Send a confidential message to the court.  Tell them that we've chased away the Jurchens.

106
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,780
Do not notify them about what happened to Eun Seong.

107
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,460
Even if he comes back alive,

108
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,330
it will have to be after Jin Yang has ascended to the throne.

109
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,600
Bring me the spoils of the hunt. I need animal blood.

110
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,810
Where is this place, anyway?

111
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know either.

112
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,880
Let's rest for a bit.

113
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,940
Can we trust that girl?

114
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,740
Her mother is from Joseon.

115
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,440
The lieutenant has probably made it back to our camp.

116
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,090
We were deceived by that Orangkae girl.

117
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,260
Ugh!

118
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,690
What?

119
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm cold, hungry, and lost.

120
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,700
This is a big crisis in every way.

121
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,870
- Sir! 
 - Lieutenant!

122
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,590
How'd you find us? We didn't even know where we were going.

123
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,930
Footprints and broken twigs. You left a clear trail behind.

124
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,150
- Were you not hurt anywhere? 
 - I'm alright.

125
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,700
The Huligai tribe have completely vacated the village.

126
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,160
This is not like them. I don't know why they left the village without even trying to fight.

127
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,660
They must have been afraid of Joseon soldiers.

128
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,700
The sun will set soon. Shouldn't we find a place to stay?

129
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,260
We can't start a fire, we need to move fast if we don't want to freeze.

130
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,310
- Why aren't you moving? 
 - No, don't come!

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,980
Gi Teuk!

132
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,410
- What do we do? 
- What do we do?

133
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,870
They are the most brutal and vicious tribe of all Jurchens.

134
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,750
They live on the hunt and what they steal.

135
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,500
Which of you is the Joseon prince?

136
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,560
It's me.

137
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,690
This person! This person is the Joseon prince!

138
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,760
The princess of the Huligai tribe is the guide?

139
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,660
Princess my butt.

140
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,020
Plenty of orphans in wars.

141
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,970
I've

142
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,320
been dragged here against my will by these people.

143
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,300
- I didn't know you had called me. 
 - I understand that

144
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,160
you are helping our grand prince in many different ways.

145
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,720
I'm not in a position to be close to a gisaeng,

146
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,270
but I could not ignore someone who was helping my husband with his work.

147
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,760
I'm giving this to you so that you'll serve the grand prince with great devotion.

148
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,310
Please serve him only the best food and drinks,

149
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,290
and look after all of his guests with utmost care so that his work gets done well.

150
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,360
You're very greedy. Are you asking for more without even checking?

151
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,720
There's no need for you to look after me.

152
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,640
It contains silver nuggets. Please take them.

153
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,110
My master is the grand prince, not you, Madam.

154
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't you know you have to serve his inside owner (wife) just the same?

155
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,110
Are you saying I should share the bed with you as well?

156
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,220
How dare you say such a thing!

157
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,910
Why don't you just let out your jealousy?

158
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,660
If you are sincere, you will at least gain sympathy.

159
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,450
A lowly prostitute like you dares teach me—

160
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,650
Perhaps you wanted to put me in my place in an elegant way,

161
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,300
but this wench doesn't misunderstand my lowly position.

162
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,390
But you are mistaken.

163
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,610
The grand prince's feelings are not towards me.

164
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,520
Don't waste your wealth on the wrong person.

165
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,020
At a time like this, try finding the real rival.

166
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,360
Unless you're going to drink and ask me to play a flute, I will excuse myself.

167
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,880
Call the girls here. And get me a wooden rod.

168
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,150
We'll have to tie her up too.

169
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,700
You're making a mistake.

170
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,100
What will you do if the grand prince finds out?

171
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,700
I know my own husband.  He won't care about me disciplining a lowly gisaeng.

172
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,400
And you said you're not even his lover.

173
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,800
Because you mix your body with high ranking men, do you think you can act carelessly with me?

174
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,060
You live on your face. If you get a scar on your face,

175
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,560
how are you going to sell your smile, I wonder.

176
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,260
How dare you touch a noble woman!

177
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,750
Why are you doing this, Madam?

178
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,350
Think of your social standing.

179
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,780
You know my social standing, and yet you scorn me?

180
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,620
Do you know who I am? I'm Grand Prince Jin Yang's wife!

181
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,240
I'm the daughter-in-law of the queen dowager and a first-rank royal consort.

182
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,540
If you've come to your senses, tell me now.

183
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,770
Who is the true rival that you were talking about?

184
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,720
Is there another gisaeng (female entertainer) besides you?

185
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,430
Tell me who the wench is!

186
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
We've received the news of victory.

187
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,420
The official message has not arrived yet, but his separate message to us

188
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,980
says that Grand Prince Eun Seong has gone missing.

189
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,940
- Missing? 
 - He disappeared from the enemy camp, and his whereabouts are still unknown.

190
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,850
He hasn't lived, but he hasn't died.

191
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,480
She's surely an untrustworthy Orangkae.

192
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,060
She escaped by herself because she was desperate. I knew she would do that from the first.

193
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,220
She's helped us until now. Be thankful.

194
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,170
What if that wench lured us here on purpose?

195
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,350
She could have planned all this with them from the beginning.

196
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,020
She's our only hope here.  It's better she's outside than being here with us.

197
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,030
Her father was a chieftain of the Huligai tribe but her mother was from Joseon.

198
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,890
Would she have been treated properly as a young girl?

199
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,830
She would have been pushed here and there as a mixed-blood child.

200
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,040
Like a wildflower or stray dog, that's how she would have grown up.

201
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,240
A stray dog. She just smells like one.

202
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,620
Please let us meet with the leader.

203
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,080
Your Highness, please eat this at least.

204
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,100
If this was going to happen, then maybe we should've told them that you are the prince.

205
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,140
The Huligai tribe wouldn't let the grand prince do hard labor.

206
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,320
How long will we be captive like this?

207
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,230
I heard the Joseon troops have pulled out already.

208
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,310
Uncle will negotiate with the Huligai tribe leader.

209
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,930
Your Highness.

210
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,630
You're suffering a great deal.

211
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,240
This is the only thing I can offer you.

212
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,360
I am alright. You must be hungry, so please eat.

213
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,480
See? What'd I say? He doesn't eat things like this.

214
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,170
Then, what about these?

215
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,370
Please eat them.   You have to get through this.

216
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,030
Thank you.

217
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,070
You need to get through this, too.

218
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,830
Please send a private message to Joseon.

219
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,740
It's enough to keep me as a hostage, is it not?

220
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,560
If you send my subordinates to let them know that I'm alive,

221
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,930
you will be rewarded appropriately.

222
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,590
Your brother has promised

223
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,980
to give land to Huligai tribe.

224
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,030
What can you give to us?

225
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,590
What can you give to us?

226
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,130
Grand Prince Jin Yang has no such authority.

227
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,580
I heard that Grand Prince Jin Yang is fighting with his young nephew for the throne.

228
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,600
You will gain nothing by keeping us captive.

229
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,410
But if you enter into negotiations, you will certainly gain something.

230
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,830
  A month later

231
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:51,260
Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray!

232
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,530
Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray!

233
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,710
Hooray, hooray, hooray!

234
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,020
I've received your message.

235
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,760
To our pride, you've obtained a huge victory.

236
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,130
The Jurchens lost their strength and retreated to the north.

237
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,680
We've destroyed their operation to the extent that

238
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,650
they will not be tempted to attack us again.

239
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,080
What a great relief.

240
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,280
Our ancestors' blessings on His Majesty are reaching the sky.

241
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,980
How bad were our casualties?

242
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,800
Are the generals safe?

243
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Where is Eun Seong?

244
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,730
Why didn't you come with him?

245
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,790
Your Majesty, about that...

246
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,210
Hurry and inform us.

247
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,940
Everyone is curious.

248
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,930
During the battle,

249
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,500
Grand Prince Eun Seong lost his life,

250
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,640
but we couldn't find his body.

251
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,580
What did you say? Eun Seong?

252
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,120
Is that the truth?

253
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,820
What is this?

254
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,880
This was left by Grand Prince Eun Seong.

255
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,680
Are these really Eun Seong's clothes?

256
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,310
It is what Chief Scholar's daughter made for him.

257
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,400
He always wore it on the battlefield.

258
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,550
As we speak, our officers are looking

259
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,800
everywhere in the north for his body.

260
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,070
However, since the days are getting warmer,

261
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,870
it won't be easy to recognize him even if we do find the body.

262
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,360
What happened to Grand Prince Eun Seong?

263
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,830
He went into the enemy territory to negotiate on our behalf,

264
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,830
but couldn't get out in time and lost communication with us.

265
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,160
They couldn't even find his body?

266
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,190
My child is at a great deal of fault.

267
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,530
He couldn't protect the grand prince.

268
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,360
He was keeping the company of a woman in battle,

269
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,460
rejected the leader's plans, insisted on negotiating with the enemy,

270
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,040
and went into enemy territory by himself.

271
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,480
The rebellious actions by Grand Prince Eun Seong

272
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,110
were as though he was asking for death himself.

273
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,240
Watch what you say.

274
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,530
He's a grand prince who sacrificed his life for the country.

275
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,410
This is not the time to discuss the good and bad actions of the grand prince

276
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,810
but to honor the victorious soldiers who've returned

277
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:44,330
and to discuss the funeral arrangements of those who gave their lives.

278
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,860
Is it right to hold a funeral without a dead body?

279
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,900
Your Excellency, the sorrow of losing your son,

280
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,440
how can I console you?

281
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,880
He was a lieutenant who could not protect the grand prince.

282
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,830
If he returned alive by himself,

283
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,940
that would've been more shameful.

284
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,710
Father.

285
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,260
If I hadn't become the queen,

286
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,500
if I hadn't given birth to the wonja (to-be crown prince)...

287
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,490
It is all my fault. My brother.

288
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,490
Are you going to waste your brother's sacrifice?

289
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,000
Think about the king. Protect the wonja!

290
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,730
We need to find a new way to manage the political situation.

291
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,320
The turmoil in the north has settled down

292
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,060
but without Grand Prince Eun Seong, we have no way of countering Grand Prince Jin Yang.

293
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,440
What should I do?

294
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,160
Like-minded courtiers will have to get together and confront Grand Prince Jin Yang head on.

295
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,900
Through the rule by won sang jae, 
 (Won sang jae: when ministers govern on behalf of a minor or a king of ill health.)

296
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,850
we will protect the king and the baby wonja.

297
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,800
Father.

298
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,840
The national military have returned.

299
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,420
The entire country is celebrating the war victory.

300
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,630
There is one piece of sad news, though.

301
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,630
Did the grand prince get hurt?

302
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,200
Where did he get hurt? How badly?

303
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:13,070
Or, did he get sick?

304
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,950
He died.

305
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,480
He went into the enemy camp to negotiate,

306
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,990
but he was unable to come back out and met a tragic end.

307
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,770
Did you not hear me? Hwi has... Eun Seong has died.

308
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,330
No. You're just lying, Your Highness.

309
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,100
My lady.

310
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,000
You just want to see how I will react, right? You can't fool me.

311
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,370
I am not going to be played by you a second time.

312
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,050
I came to inform you personally because I was worried about you.

313
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,140
You want me to repeat it?

314
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,800
My brother Hwi, who is your lover, has died at the hands of the Orangkae.

315
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,840
My lady, please don't be like this!

316
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,830
He wouldn't die!

317
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,880
He promised me that he'd return alive, no matter what.

318
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,450
You were just misinformed. It wasn't the grand prince.

319
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,210
You can believe that for now,

320
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,890
if it means you'll be able to get through it.

321
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,050
My lady.

322
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,640
Oh, my son!

323
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,450
My precious son came back safe and sound.

324
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,510
- Mother. 
 - Are you not hurt anywhere?

325
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,020
Your arms, legs, fingers, and toes are all okay?

326
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,430
I am okay.  I avoided the arrows flying all around me.

327
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,240
Good job. Good job, my son!

328
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,000
- Brother! 
 - Young Master!

329
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,900
Ja Hyeon. Kkeut Dan.

330
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,150
What about the grand prince? He didn't die, right? You don't know yet, right?

331
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,870
About that...

332
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,620
- Ja Hyeon! 
 - Ja Hyeon!

333
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,280
- My lady! 
 - Ja Hyeon!

334
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,360
Your Highness, please drink the tonic and gain strength.

335
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,630
I am a mother who is not qualified to take medicine.

336
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,900
Your Highness.

337
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,600
With my own hands...

338
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,170
I pushed my son to his death.

339
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,300
It couldn't have been helped. It wasn't your fault.

340
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:06,470
Protecting one's child... is the duty of a mother.

341
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,070
Please don't blame yourself.

342
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,970
The heavens will understand your heart.

343
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,770
I resent my husband

344
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,790
who left before me.

345
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,810
How could he leave me behind

346
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,930
and let me carry such a heavy burden?

347
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,400
Your Highness.

348
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,050
To protect the throne,

349
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,690
I have caused another child to die.

350
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,270
I am the most horrible mother under the sun.

351
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,800
How painful would it have been?

352
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,170
How cold would he have been?

353
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:06,080
How badly would he have resented me?

354
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,360
Why are you leaving the grand prince's wife alone?

355
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,460
You almost died.

356
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,290
Are you just going to suffer like that?

357
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,780
Grand Prince Jin Yang is here.

358
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,640
You can tell him now.  Or report it to the police.

359
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,930
If the grand prince knows, will anything change?

360
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,260
If his woman gets beaten into a pulp and he still doesn't do anything,

361
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,330
is he a man?

362
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,060
It was his wife who beat me.

363
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,210
You think he'll throw out his wife and take in a gisaeng as a concubine?

364
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,000
Report it to the police?

365
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,710
If I do it, will this country

366
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,020
punish the royal consort on the account of the gisaeng?

367
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,260
The grand prince will scold his wife once, I suppose.

368
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,490
Will that satisfy my anger?

369
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,090
Unni.

370
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,590
She said to be thankful that she didn't hurt my face.

371
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,290
Even though she'd poisoned my face to the extent that

372
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,670
I needed to rest for a month.

373
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:32,090
That's what I am saying. This is so mortifying to go on like this.

374
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,330
I'm going to take revenge my own way.

375
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,810
I'm going to give back all the pain that I suffered, except (I'll give) a hundred, no a thousand times more.

376
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,390
If I can help, please tell me.

377
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,360
I don't want to leave that woman alone.

378
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,210
It's going to take a long time. A very long time.

379
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,820
When that woman forgets

380
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,180
about what she even did.

381
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,940
You've gone through a huge ordeal.

382
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,310
I only pretended to fight and then came back.

383
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,560
No ordeal to speak of.  It was a battle that was like a vacation.

384
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,690
Why aren't you asking anything?

385
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,290
Aren't you curious about what happened to Hwi?

386
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,420
We will go through with the funeral,

387
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,110
whether he is alive or dead.

388
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,670
Now that Eun Seong's death has been accepted as reality,

389
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,740
no one can use him as an obstacle to get in your way anymore.

390
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,900
Aren't you happy?

391
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,610
My brother has died.  A younger brother from the same womb.

392
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,940
Do I have to be happy?

393
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,420
You can't be sad, so you're getting angry.

394
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,300
You've only gone over one mountain.

395
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,860
You have to fight the queen dowager instead of your younger brother.

396
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,100
Time is your biggest enemy.

397
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,880
Once Wonja grows up to a certain age, even without the king,

398
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,580
Queen Dowager can take the reign and that will be the end.

399
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,890
Don't get carried away with emotion.

400
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,830
In actuality, the difficult fight has not even started.

401
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,440
This.

402
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,640
I'll give this to you.

403
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,430
It's what Eun Seong left behind. If no one believes the news, show this to them.

404
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,270
When they see it with their own eyes, they can't help but believe.

405
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,420
You want me to help you meet the queen dowager?

406
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,260
We need to find Grand Prince Eun Seong. He didn't die. He just disappeared.

407
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,870
If the disappearance persists, there is no hope.

408
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,930
They said they didn't find a body.

409
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,090
No one saw him die.

410
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,510
If he's alive, why isn't he returning?

411
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,890
You need to find your own way to live now.

412
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,480
If you hold on to a dead person, it will only ruin your life.

413
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:33,970

414
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,450
Were you visiting your friend?

415
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,230
Wait outside.

416
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,570
Madam, His Highness has arrived.

417
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,170
Please don't let go of your brother.

418
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,930
Please find Grand Prince Eun Seong.

419
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,910
My parents won't even let me speak of him.

420
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,640
There is no one to ask and complain to.

421
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,770
You can do that.

422
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,960
There will be a funeral.

423
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,890
A funeral?

424
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:32,340
The royal family has given up on Grand Prince Eun Seong?

425
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,800
No, you can't! That can't happen!

426
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,930
Please find the grand prince.

427
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,320
He's your younger brother, Your Highness.

428
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,440
Please do not certify his death.

429
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,730
Do you have to see for yourself to believe?

430
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,930
See for yourself.

431
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,320
These... These are just...

432
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,810
These are just his clothes.

433
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,090
Do you still want to insist that he's alive even after seeing this blood?

434
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
Throw your hope away.

435
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,800
The king, the queen dowager,

436
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,810
and the entire royal household are in deep despair.

437
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:52,130
How long will they keep trying to find him?

438
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,580
You are just trying to find ways to justify giving up.

439
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,960
Please find him. You have to.

440
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,610
Are you even whining to the grand prince?

441
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,660
It's late. Please go inside.

442
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,430
Take care.

443
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,770
This isn't how it should be.

444
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,010
If they said no, that should be it.

445
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,090
You're hanging onto someone else's husband. What is this?

446
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,740
He's Grand Prince Eun Seong's older brother.

447
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,790
He's my husband.

448
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,270
Sorry. I was acting thoughtlessly.

449
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,820
Since it's late, go back home.

450
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,710
Let's talk during the day.

451
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,970
  The grand prince's feelings are not towards me.

452
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,010
  Try to find your true rival.

453
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,530
What happened?

454
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,530
Have you finished your conversation?

455
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,170
What is this? Give it to me.

456
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,460
A gisaeng (female entertainer) I can deal with,

457
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,710
since I've been told it's something a great man needs.

458
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,560
But please do not look at another woman.

459
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,600
Have you seen anyone who yearns for her loved one more?

460
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,270
Are you speaking of Ja Hyeon?

461
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:45,490
Like how Lady Ja Hyeon wants Hwi, do you want me too?

462
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:49,700
Have you forgotten?  I pulled the silver knife in front of you.

463
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,820
That was out of your pride, not because you wanted me.

464
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,250
You can leave. I'm going to rest.

465
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,810
No matter how deep her yearning, it won't bring back a dead person.

466
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,960
We will have to find her a suitable marriage partner as soon as it's appropriate.

467
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,890
That's the etiquette of a friend who married before her,

468
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:15,680
and a consideration based on the royal family's principles.

469
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,580
It's not the time yet.  The mourning period has to end first.

470
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,010
Please get permission from Queen Mother.

471
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,880
They were not formally married.  They just saw each other once or twice.

472
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,600
Ask that Ja Hyeon's relationship with the grand prince be annulled for the sake of her future.

473
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,580
What I promised you is a position next to me.

474
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,110
Refrain from burning jealousy.

475
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:51,180
If you get greedy for more, you could lose what you already have.

476
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,620
♫   My tears are not coming out   ♫

477
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,340
♫   I cannot even laugh   ♫

478
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:35,010
♫   My loneliness has piled up   ♫

479
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:41,410
♫   Everything has been broken   ♫

480
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:48,280
♫   I try to fix it   ♫

481
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,250
♫   I can't do anything   ♫

482
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:02,430
♫   Because of you, it has rusted   ♫

483
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:08,070
♫   What do I do with myself?   ♫

484
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:15,660
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

485
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:23,810
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

486
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:30,880
♫    As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

487
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,920
♫   You don't know it yet    ♫

488
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,950
Are you alright?

489
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,950
Your Highness!

490
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,400
Your Highness!

491
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:22,150
We can't do this any longer. Even if alone, you must leave this place.

492
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,130
Don't say things like that. We are all one now.

493
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,680
You must leave.

494
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,960
It appears that your brother Grand Prince Jin Yang

495
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,810
made a deal with the Orangkae.

496
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,910
Wh-What are you saying?

497
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:44,810
If Grand Prince Jin Yang rose to the throne, it was promised that the Orangkae would get the northern territory.

498
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,950
Starting the war in the dead of winter,

499
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:53,660
leaving you behind. All of it might have been a part of Grand Prince Jin Yang's scheme.

500
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,030
Your Highness.

501
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,480
Your Highness, are you alright?

502
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,250
Your Highness.

503
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,680
Eun Seong is not here.

504
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,480
Will you give me the position of saejae now?

505
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,230
With the conflict in the north being settled,

506
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,720
His Majesty is on his way to recovery.

507
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,930
The wonja is growing up well.

508
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,470
We're going to forget about the saejae selection decision.

509
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,830
Don't you think we must wait for the wonja to grow up?

510
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,080
Is His Majesty able to rise and govern the affairs of the state?

511
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,220
He's not up to it yet, so we will establish won sang jae (when ministers govern on behalf of a minor or a king of ill health).

512
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,430
Right and Left Ministers, Prime Minister, Chief Scholar,

513
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,090
and the other ministers will cooperate

514
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:57,720
and govern the royal court.

515
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,930
Why don't you take over as the regent?

516
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,020
If the wonja must rise to the throne at an early age,

517
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,200
then that may become necessary.

518
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,960
Are you not even feeling sorry to me?

519
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,960
The one I'm sorry toward... is  Hwi.

520
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:20,140
Hwi's sacrifice fought off the Organgkae

521
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,930
and brought stability to the royal court.

522
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,240
When His Majesty becomes strong, we will take revenge

523
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,710
against those who killed my son.

524
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,330
The person who made Hwi die

525
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,660
was you, Your Highness.

526
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,250
Do you still not know?

527
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,330
It was you.

528
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:04,450
Queen Dowager brought up won sang jae.

529
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,680
She will delay as long as possible

530
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,230
until the wonja can become the crown prince.

531
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,680
Queen Dowager is giving us a grand list

532
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,390
of those who will exercise power in the king's place and eventually threaten the royal family.

533
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,950
Whose side will the people choose, in this country led by the Lee family?

534
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,340
That sounds like a plan. We'll fight.

535
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:33,300
We've already gotten rid of my brother. Would we be afraid of strangers (non-family)?

536
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,920
Is the lady here?

537
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,240
Yes, Madam.

538
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,640
I thought you'd wear mourning clothes.

539
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,700
Even if you didn't have a formal marriage,

540
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,300
you were acting like you were going to follow him into death.

541
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,470
I don't believe the grand prince has died.

542
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,270
He will return for sure.

543
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,390
Then, you should be waiting quietly.

544
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,110
Why are you shaking up someone else's husband?

545
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,570
It's a misunderstanding.

546
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,040
Do you think I'm blind?

547
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:42,290
- Since you failed at being a royal bride, are you trying to be a grand prince's concubine? 
 - Na Gyeom.

548
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,050
I know what kind of person you are.

549
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:47,870
You were spoiled rotten from being raised as a precious child,

550
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,680
but you were always treated well because you're from a powerful family.

551
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,540
You can do anything you want and get away with everything with a simple smile even when you've done wrong.

552
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:01,280
I know I'm lacking in many ways but you will not defame my parents.

553
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,690
When I was trying my utmost so that I wouldn't be pointed at for being a badly-behaved fatherless child,

554
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:11,590
no matter how you lived, everyone forgave and accepted you.

555
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,070
I thought we were friends.

556
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,800
I thought we were real friends who wished for each other's happiness and well-being.

557
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,360
Then! Then, why do you covet my husband?

558
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,220
It wasn't me! Grand Prince Jin Yang was just being greedy.

559
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,990
Then, why didn't you tell me?

560
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,700
When did it start? Tell me.

561
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:47,920
Was it after my wedding? Or before?

562
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,360
When did you two start being in that kind of relationship?

563
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,640
If you were my friend, you should've told me.

564
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,880
The one I love is your husband's younger brother.

565
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,490
Grand Prince Jin Yang didn't know, so he momentarily took interest in me.

566
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:07,840
Then, why didn't you tell me?!

567
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,870
You liked him so much.

568
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:16,400
It was your dream to get married to royalty.

569
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,310
Na Gyeom, I didn't want you to be abandoned.

570
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:23,120
And you were okay with me being turned into a fool?

571
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,340
If you don't say anything, does the fact that my husband likes you disappear?

572
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,630
Na Gyeom.

573
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,200
It was for me? Don't make me laugh. You only thought about yourself.

574
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,480
No, Na Gyeom. Grand Prince Jin Yang wasn't sincere with me.

575
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,870
The wife of Grand Prince Jin Yang is you.

576
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,390
You only covered it up because you were afraid it'd ruin your marriage potential,

577
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,200
when it's found out that the younger brother is taking in a woman who was played with by his older brother.

578
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,450
No, it wasn't that! If I'm being honest,

579
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:01,100
I was afraid you'd hate me.

580
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,580
You can't leave Grand Prince Jin Yang.

581
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,290
You'd eventually leave me.

582
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,190
I thought it'd turn out like this, so I was afraid.

583
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,490
It's true that it was for me.

584
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:35,050
I didn't want to be hated by you. I didn't want you to leave me.

585
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,320
Should I tell you the truth?

586
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,420
There was never a time when we were friends.

587
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,590
I never liked you.

588
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,310
I hated that you had a father when I didn't.

589
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,640
I hated that your father was such a distinguished chief scholar.

590
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,870
My mother doesn't even care whether she has a daughter like me or not.

591
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:02,630
I hated your mother who treasured her daughter more than her son.

592
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,180
Na Gyeom, don't be like this. You'll be hurt, too.

593
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,310
So, do you get it now?

594
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,960
We have no need to end our relationship.

595
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,600
We were never even friends.

596
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,410
Going forward, you will have to treat me as a royal consort and only that.

597
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,190
After the queen dowager and the queen, I'm the highest-ranking woman.

598
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:32,530
Out of the affection from our bygone days, I will give you one piece of advice.

599
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:38,780
If you shake up my husband again, then I'll destroy you without warning.

600
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:10,460
Madam, I know it myself. My lady has done nothing wrong.

601
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,890
Whenever he had a chance, he would come up with all manners of deception to summon my lady,

602
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,090
and against her will, he'd forcefully...

603
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:20,550
- Kkeut Dan. 
 - A lowly being like you knew about it, too?

604
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,190
No, Your Highness!

605
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,010
Just serve your mistress right.

606
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,970
Give it to me, my lady. I'll do it.

607
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,470
She can't even hold back her husband.

608
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,130
That's why she's making a big deal with a nice person like you.

609
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,270
Don't stress about it.

610
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,810
But, my lady,

611
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,890
will the grand prince really return?

612
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,070
He will.

613
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,060
If...

614
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,820
If, my lady,

615
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,950
the grand prince never returns...

616
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,100
I can live with the memories.

617
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,140
Even though our time was short,

618
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,790
we shared many things as if we had been a longtime married couple.

619
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:41,570
As long as we don't forget about each other, we have not said goodbye.

620
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,000
My lady.

621
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,010
I'm going to wait.

622
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,530
If he doesn't come even after waiting,

623
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,790
I'll just live by myself.

624
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:57,910
I'll think of the memories we made, again and again.

625
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,930
But, I miss him.

626
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,580
When there was hope, I could endure it.

627
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:18,150
He will come back.  With the news of victory, he will return.

628
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,080
My lady.

629
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,870
I can't keep it in anymore.

630
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,900
It hurts so much.

631
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,500
I feel like my insides are burning into ash.

632
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:37,100
Where do I have to go?  Where can I see him?

633
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,370
How long do I have to wait?

634
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:44,390
How do I live now?

635
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:02,270
My lady, what do we do?

636
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,230
Make sure to return. If you don't return within the time period,

637
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,150
Make sure to return. If you don't return within the time period,

638
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,670
your grand prince will not live.

639
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:16,210
your grand prince will not live.

640
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:25,220
How can you be left alone? You should've told them we had to leave together.

641
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,160
If there is no hostage, they will send away no one.

642
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,990
Please stay safe.

643
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,580
I will, for certain, come back to fetch you.

644
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:43,350
Do not forget about our people who are captured here.

645
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:10,140
Where are you going?  Where are you going leaving us behind, Your Highness!

646
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,920
Don't be like this. He'll be back.  He'll come back to save you.

647
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,400
Your Highness!

648
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,120
Get them!

649
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,990
Please go!

650
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,080
Catch him!

651
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,840
Your Highness!

652
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,600

Baby wonja, please...

 Episode 9 Preview

667
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:20,610
 We have three days.  Within three days, we need to overturn the last will and testament

668
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,090
 and obtain a new edict from Queen Dowager.

669
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:26,590
  I will not get married. I will not become anyone's bride.

670
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:31,770
  Observe Ja Hyeon well so that she doesn't die or run away.

671
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,450
 I'm afraid that this might be a dream.

672
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:36,290
  This isn't a dream.

673
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:40,740
  We are now together again.

674
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,500
  Did you believe I'd return, Brother?

675
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,500
  Then, why? Why would you leave me in the enemy camp?

676
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:58,250
