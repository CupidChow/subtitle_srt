1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,730
  Grand Prince

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,090
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

3
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:04,270

4
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,210
Rabbit! Rabbit! Rabbit!

5
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,040
  Episode 1

6
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,110
Father.

7
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,560
News of the king's illness cannot be spread.

8
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,360
We are taking extra measures to makes sure it does not.

9
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,350
Should a word of it get out, all those responsible will be beheaded.

10
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,260
Father.

11
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,160
But, he's bravely endured this for many years.

12
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,650
The king will rise again.

13
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,340
The crown prince is so young.

14
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,890
He will rise for sure.

15
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,000
This is for the Myung Rae palace.

16
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,660
Make way. Back from the north, this is His Highness, Prince Eun Seong.

17
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,740
The day's cold, and these crazy bastards are going around like this?

18
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,110
How rude of you. Have manners towards His Highness.

19
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,590
If you want to keep talking, show me an identification or an entry pass to the palace.

20
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,800
How dare you speak of Grand Prince Eun Seong who died long ago on an expedition and buried ever since?

21
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,290
He survived death. Go and report to the Great Hall.

22
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,580
Your Highness.

23
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,780
We just need to notify the chief eunuch or your attendant lady.

24
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,290
Once they come out and see you...

25
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,630
I can't simply let you leave like this. How dare you tell me to step aside while you're holding weapons?

26
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,490
To find out what faction you treason-planning beggar bastards are,

27
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,220
I'll have to take you away and punish you through the leg-screw torture!

28
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,840
Take them away!

29
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,720
  Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang

30
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,670
 The king is in a coma and nearing death. The queen is searching everywhere in vain. His whereabouts are unknown.

31
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,380
   Yoon Na Gyeom

32
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,450
Good work. Be safe on your way back.

33
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,170
We're at the same level.

34
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,830
Half of the people are on the king and his mother's side,

35
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,050
and the other half are on our side.

36
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,560
What will you do? The king's illness is severe.

37
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,600
The king's mother is not meeting you or the ministers.

38
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,740
If you lose this timing before he diesâ€”

39
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,590
Before the extreme event occurs,

40
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,040
we need to get the gomyeong (king's will including succession).

41
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,320
While Grand Prince Eun Seong is not here,

42
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,940
if you receive the gomyeong,

43
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,920
the throne will be yours, Your Highness.

44
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm going to the palace.

45
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,990
Brother, ask the Chief Minister and all other ministers to enter the palace.

46
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,570
Yes, I will.

47
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,720
- I will bring you your palace uniform. 
  - Madam, a guest is here.

48
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,050
Royal family member Weol Yeong sent an offer of marriage to my house.

49
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,790
Please ask him to withdraw the offer.  He's one of your loyalists.

50
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,460
So, please resolve this issue.

51
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,830
Did you not want another groom to consider?

52
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,730
What are you saying?

53
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,170
You refused to be my woman for three years.

54
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,300
I gave you a different choice with great generosity.

55
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,680
Are you asking me to be a gold digger?

56
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,570
Hwi... is not coming back.

57
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,550
He is dead.

58
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,180
You should accept it.

59
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,900
The one who cruelly pushed away his brother

60
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,530
was you, Grand Prince.

61
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,580
He went of his own will. He had a sense of duty as this nation's prince.

62
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,270
Do you... intend to ruin my life in the end?

63
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,000
Weol Yeong is my cousin.

64
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,410
Being married to someone from a royal family means your life gets ruined?

65
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,520
Other girls would be shocked to hear that.

66
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,820
I am not looking for a marriage.

67
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,980
I don't want to be anyone's bride.

68
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,310
Do you dislike Weol Yeong that much?

69
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,210
If you really feel that way, just come to me.

70
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,520
I'll accept you even now.

71
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,240
I've said these words in vain.

72
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,080
In believing that there was a small slice of a decent man left in you,

73
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,050
I was foolish.

74
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,820
Be careful out there in the night. You will soon become a bride.

75
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,310
What are you doing, madame?

76
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,590
Is it not enough to ruin one grand prince?

77
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:16,320
Are you fearless or are you ignorant of the law?

78
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,410
How dare you carelessly meet a man from another person's household?

79
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,410
Are you that worried?

80
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,630
Do you still not have confidence?

81
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,030
Is that why you wanted to get rid of me this way?

82
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,580
Be thankful. If it wasn't for our effort, you would have died as a virgin ghost.

83
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,510
Have you forgotten all about the time when we were friends?

84
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,110
Don't you know that you're the one who ended our friendship?

85
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,900
When you started seducing the grand princes,

86
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,000
we stopped being friends or anything else.

87
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,410
My life and my fate

88
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,310
will not be determined by you and your husband.

89
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,150
If you hate getting married that much, why don't you commit suicide?

90
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,280
Let's go, Lady. Pretend you didn't hear it. Let's just go!

91
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,870
If you were going to die, why didn't you die three years ago?

92
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,280
That amazing love you had, if you'd died, you would've been praised for your devotion toward one person.

93
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,800
Let's go. Hurry, let's go.

94
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,450
I wish you happiness!

95
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,060
Do please get married, have sons and daughters, and live well!

96
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,800
The fact that you're like any other girl out there,

97
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,660
who's as materialistic as them, show it to the whole world!

98
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,170
Ah, really.

99
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,370
It's cold!

100
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,210
Ah really. Let me see, let me see. Come here.

101
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,580
It won't wash off.

102
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,290
Do you want to die?

103
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,960
Let's wash one more time.

104
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
My face is going to freeze!

105
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,520
Look at all that dead skin!

106
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,490
Blow, blow.

107
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,660
One more time. Wash one more time.

108
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,020
Will she be able to do it right?

109
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,490
She can't speak Korean very well.

110
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,110
The queen. It's fine once I find the queen.

111
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,110
Dowager. It's Queen Dowager.

112
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,810
That's right.

113
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,410
Dowager, Queen Dowager.

114
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,980
  Entry Pass

115
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,920
You can go in.

116
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,060
No matter what, go forward.

117
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,520
Queen Dowager.

118
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,100
That's right.

119
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:14,030

120
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,100
  Queen Dowager Shim

121
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,960
Your Highness! Your Highness!

122
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,490
This won't do.

123
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,690
Tonight, please rest in your chamber.

124
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,920
No, it's okay. I'll get changed and get back to the king.

125
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,020
If you continue this way, you will collapse first.

126
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,830
The queen will have a tough time if she's by herself.

127
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,120
How rude of you. How dare you block the path of the queen dowager?

128
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,190
Queen?

129
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,780
Ah, Dowager. Queen Dowager.

130
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,050
Did you not hear? Drag her away now!

131
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,500
Is there anyone there?

132
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,420
Call for the Royal Guards. Royal Guards!

133
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,130
  Hwi

134
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,480
Your Highness.

135
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,490
  Hwi

136
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,290
Hwi.

137
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,510
This...

138
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,060
This is...

139
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,790
Hwi's blood.

140
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,690
My son, Hwi!

141
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,070
Yes.

142
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,280
 Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi.

143
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,480
Your unworthy son

144
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,330
has returned now and

145
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,890
greets Your Highness.

146
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,760
You were alive.

147
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,040
Where did your jade-like face go?

148
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,720
How hard. How hard it must have been for you.

149
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,490
The king is...

150
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,380
on the brink of death.

151
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,330
The heavens must pity this mother

152
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,820
because they've returned you to me.

153
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,980
You cannot go in today.

154
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,010
Since His Majesty is ill, I've brought calming medicine.

155
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,130
I want to bring it to His Majesty, please let them know I'm here.

156
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,860
The queen dowager issued a strict order not to let anyone in tonight.

157
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,760
Are you treating His Majesty's younger brother as a simple visitor?

158
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,410
Please return in the morning.

159
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,530
I said I'd give His Majesty the calming medicine.

160
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,750
If something bad were to happen to His Majesty tonight

161
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,000
would you be able to handle the consequences in the future?

162
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,890
Move aside!

163
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,030
Your Majesty!

164
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,890
Your Majesty.

165
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,200
Your Majesty!

166
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,680
Mother.

167
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,770
What is the matter?

168
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,620
What about His Majesty?

169
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,270
He passed away.

170
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,730
Chief Eunuch.

171
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,730
How could you let things happen this way?

172
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,660
How can you let His Majesty go alone without me, his closest family, by his side?

173
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,980
Who in the world will receive his last will and testament?

174
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,370
Don't worry.

175
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,170
Grand Prince Eun Seong?

176
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,080
I received the will and the succession edict.

177
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,500
Until the crown prince comes of age,

178
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,810
Queen Mother will act as regent

179
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:00,650
and the grand princes will pledge their loyalty to the crown prince.

180
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,950
This is...

181
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,460
the dead king's last wish.

182
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,730
You received

183
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,440
the last will?

184
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,770
I came back, Hyung-nim.

185
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,420
I didn't die.

186
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,020
I lived.

187
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,040
Please return to us, King!

188
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,350
Please return to us, King!

189
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,350
Please return to us, King!

190
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:41,070

191
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,090
- You have a lot of scars. 
 - Because I was on the battlefield.

192
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,310
It's a relief you've survived and come back.

193
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,600
I couldn't die because there was someone waiting for me.

194
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,870
Since you have returned at the unfortunate time of a royal death,

195
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,480
I cannot reveal my happiness for your return in the midst of the sadness of  king's death.

196
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,420
It must be hard for you since you can't run to the woman you've longed for.

197
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,440
But it'd be best not to see a woman who will marry another man.

198
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm talking about Lady Ja Hyeon.

199
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,320
But, since you two have an old affection as friends,

200
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
how delighted she'd be to see your safe return.

201
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,100
Are you saying Ja Hyeon's getting married?

202
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,520
She's getting married to royal family member Weol Yeong.

203
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,650
Your Highness! Your Highness!

204
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,280
Who are you?

205
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,540
Hey, what are you doing? Where are you going?

206
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,440
Where is His Excellency? Where is the lady?

207
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,390
May I ask who you are?

208
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,740
What's all this noise?

209
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,570
What are you doing in someone else's house this early in the morning?

210
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,900
Your Excellency, it's me, Eun Seong.

211
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,120
Are you alive, or are you a ghost?

212
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,250
The king has passed away.

213
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,270
Your Majesty!

214
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,610
Your Majesty!

215
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,250
I must see your daughter.

216
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,720
Please tell her that I'm alive and that I've returned.

217
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,230
I cannot.

218
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,520
You, what in the world are you doing?

219
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,490
I will go into the mountains. I will become a Buddhist nun.

220
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,390
Silly girl.

221
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,510
The grand prince has come.

222
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,550
He is alive.

223
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,540
He came to see you.

224
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,460
My daughter is already

225
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,940
set to wed another man.

226
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,390
Your Highness, you cannot!

227
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,700
Lady, Lady Ja Hyeon!

228
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,250
Your Highness.

229
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,670
Your Highness.

230
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,940
Please go back to the palace, quickly.

231
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,480
You must observe the royal mourning.

232
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,600
Lady!

233
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,400
â™«   I cannot even laugh   â™«

234
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,540
â™«   My loneliness has piled up   â™«

235
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,810
â™«   Everything has been broken   â™«

236
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,510
- Your Highness. 
 â™«   I try to fix it   â™«

237
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,890
â™«   I can't do anything   â™«

238
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:29,440
â™«   Because of you, it has rusted.   â™«

239
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:36,270
â™«   What do I do with myself?   â™«

240
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:42,840
â™«   It's because my chest feels tight   â™«

241
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,690
â™«   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   â™«

242
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:58,010
â™«    As much as it is sad, this mean love   â™«

243
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:04,000
â™«   You don't know it yet    â™«

244
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,920
 Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi

245
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,000
It's finished.

246
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:36,120
- How irreverent! How dare you do that in front of His Highness? 
  One moon shines on two places, two persons are thousands of miles apart,

247
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,410
 willing to follow the shadow of this moon, night after night, I want to shine it on your side.

248
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,990
Hurry and go.

249
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,920
Are you telling me I can't go again?

250
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,240
This time, too? Are they saying I cannot go?

251
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,410
They said that due to palace troubles, they would summon you, not today but on another day.

252
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,840
Another day, it's always "another day!" When will that ever be?

253
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,980
I'm sorry, Your Highness. 
   Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang

254
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,280
I'm going in today.

255
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,960
Your Highness!

256
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,930
My father's face and my mother's touch,

257
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,890
I cannot even remember them.

258
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,180
I will no longer live here alone.

259
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,260
They aren't telling you to not go because they dislike you.

260
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,840
Recently there have been troubling worries in the palace.

261
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,200
I said I'm going.

262
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,020
If there are such troubles present, shouldn't I be more informed?

263
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,670
I can't wait any longer.

264
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm a prince of Joseon!

265
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,190
The prince is at the eastern entrance and is asking for permission to come in.

266
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,580
Tell him to go.

267
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,960
We've already stalled for many days.

268
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,010
If you have him come in and stay at the Grand Prince's Hallâ€”

269
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,680
Can you say that while looking at the crown prince in this state?

270
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,290
It's not time yet. Not yet.

271
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,990
Move! Won't you move?

272
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,190
I'm the second prince of this country, Lee Kang!

273
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,840
We didn't hear that you would be entering the palace today.

274
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,970
Your Highness, you should go back.

275
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,400
After asking the Queen Mother, I'll come back with permission for palace entry.

276
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,390
I told you I'm not waiting anymore!

277
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,550
I have to go into the palace right now, today!

278
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,960
Your Highness, it's Gi Teuk.

279
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,780
Come in.

280
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,920
Is my brother here?

281
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,840
About that, uh...

282
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,920
Even if I dry up and die in front of the palace, I will not turn back!

283
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,190
I'm going to meet my father and my mother!

284
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,000
Your Highness, you can't do that today.

285
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,710
If you go back, then tomorrow you could get approvalâ€”

286
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,760
Hyungnim!

287
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,690
It was good of you to come.

288
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,330
You don't know how long I've waited for you.

289
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,170
You should go in. Mother has been waiting for you.

290
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,160
Your Highness, the prince cannot enter the palace today.

291
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,220
He can come another time.

292
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,140
How rude of you.

293
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,340
He is my brother. If he wants to enter the palace,

294
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,730
on whose order do you dare block his entrance?

295
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,500
Your Highness, it's not that.

296
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,580
It was an order from the higher-ups.

297
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,940
I'll take responsibility for this.

298
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,120
Move aside!

299
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,020
Let's go.

300
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:07,100

301
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,070
Did you not hear about the command issuing a postponement of your palace entry?

302
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,200
I heard about it.

303
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,890
Due to the unsettling atmosphere in the palace, I've ordered you to wait,

304
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,180
but a young one like you is acting stubborn.

305
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,560
Mother, I was the one who went out and brought him here.

306
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,390
He has not done anything wrong.

307
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,210
You relied on your childish brother here and disobeyed your parents.

308
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,350
I have met you, Mother, after countless years of waiting.

309
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,780
Because I longed to see you more than anything, my young heart had no choice but to defy orders.

310
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,640
Can't you understand?

311
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,160
Have you cleaned your older brother's room?

312
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,450
I'll use this opportunity to redo the door and wall of his room.

313
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,760
I've decorated his desk and table with only the best products.

314
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,230
But, Mother.

315
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,270
Does the law of the palace place a younger brother above the older brother?

316
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,910
Pardon?

317
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,510
Why are you, my younger brother, sitting in such a high seat and receiving my bows?

318
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,910
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

319
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,670
Don't be upset, Hwi only wanted to see your face.

320
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,080
No, I was the one who didn't think it through.

321
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,870
You're not upset at your younger brother. You're upset at me, your mother.

322
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,880
Before you are my son, you are this nation's prince.

323
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,570
The reason I couldn't keep you next to me to this day and you were raised outside of the palace

324
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,140
was for the future of this country.

325
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,220
Withdraw your contempt and be prideful of yourself.

326
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,250
Imagining your return, I wrote this, Hyungnim.

327
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:30,510
One moon shines on two places.

328
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:36,640
Two persons are thousands of miles apart,

329
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,010
willing to follow the shadow of this moon.

330
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:49,800
Night after night, I want to shine it on your side.

331
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,660
Is it you and your brother written into the poem?

332
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,240
Yes.

333
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,000
Like the moonlight shining down, the reach of a parent's love extends far.

334
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,520
It reaches any and all places.

335
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,640
But the distance between Hyungnim and I has been a considerable.

336
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,510
Therefore, I expressed my feelings of wanting to follow the moonlight to where Hyungnim was, every night.

337
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,690
That feeling of yearning can be thoroughly found.

338
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,330
Your younger brother has a way with poetry.

339
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,600
When envoys from China arrive, they make a big deal out of wanting to bring his writing.

340
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,680
Hwi's poetry is the same as your mother's heart.

341
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,090
While waiting

342
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,340
and waiting, I longed for you.

343
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,300
Hyungnim.

344
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,190
If you had entered the palace on a good day, we would have been able to throw you a welcoming celebration.

345
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,960
Because of the crown prince's illness, the palace atmosphere is like this.

346
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,460
I've returned to the palace. I haven't "entered it," I have returned.

347
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,700
I've only returned to the place where I should be.

348
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,030
You don't know how long I've waited for you.

349
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,750
A boy like you, getting so close.

350
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,960
Yeon Hee, what are you doing?

351
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,660
I wanted to clean your shoes.

352
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,610
Haven't I told you to take care of yourself? Why are you causing these problems with an injured arm?

353
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,800
My other hand is just fine.

354
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,970
Doing this is not a show of your loyalty.

355
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,140
If you want to make me happy,

356
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,590
don't get hurt and don't get sick.

357
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,400
Didn't I tell you to take care of your body first?

358
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,580
Don't move and make the injury worse.

359
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,910
You can go and rest.

360
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,080
When you feel better, we can play hide and seek, which you like.

361
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,570
With my brother.

362
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,600
Really?

363
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,400
I apologize, Your Highness.

364
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
I could not stop His Highness.

365
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,460
Kang shouldn't have been brought here this early.

366
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,590
Hasn't Crown Prince's fever been getting worse?

367
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,160
With Kang, it could've been worse.

368
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,180
Hasn't he already grown up by himself for too long?

369
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,400
Although the other princes should grow up well, the crown prince must be healthy.

370
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,220
Then, everything in the court goes well.

371
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,790
Ever since Joseon was formed, the first-born son has never been the king.

372
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,250
You're really distracted.

373
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,180
Uncle!

374
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,190
Oh, the palace food must be good. You've gotten heavier.

375
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,580
Have you gotten used to the faces of the people in the palace?

376
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,640
Yes. Everyone is treating me well.

377
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,000
That's how it should be. 
   Grand Prince Yang Ahn

378
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,360
Due to their own greed, since you are the son who was thrown aside,

379
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,520
they should at least be good to you, even if it's because they feel sorry.

380
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,460
Do you know why you were thrown aside like that?

381
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,670
I heard that since I was too weak, it was for me to take care of my body.

382
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:16,130
Generation after generation, it wasn't the first-born son, but the second-born son who gained succession in the royal family of Joseon.

383
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,570
If you're here, the throne becomes more unstable for the crown prince.

384
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,540
The crown prince is unhealthy.

385
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:30,620
They blamed that on you and threw aside a newborn like that.

386
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,810
Isn't that ridiculous?

387
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,280
I was the oldest son, but the current king who rose to the throne

388
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,980
is trying to make the first-born son the crown prince and is threatening you.

389
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,650
What about Hwi? He is a younger brother just like me.

390
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,200
Why did they only chase me out and raise him in the palace?

391
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,260
Because you are the most dangerous.

392
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,280
Hwi's appearance is beautiful.

393
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,030
He's called a genius because of his poetry and writing.

394
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,730
If you, just like the other prince,

395
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,860
had received proper education in the palace, you'd definitely be better than him at poetry.

396
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:14,090
The person who has the qualifications to be the king, who poses a danger to the crown prince, is you.

397
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:18,590
So don't worry, you have this uncle by your side.

398
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:26,220
Although I shared the throne with the current king, I am still the oldest person here.

399
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,590
Practice with all that you have. With you, my nephew,

400
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:37,030
I want to go hunting as soon as possible.

401
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,020
I'll count to ten!

402
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:55,270
One. Two. Three. Four.

403
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:59,410
Five. Six.

404
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,500
Brother!

405
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,430
- Seven. 
- This way.

406
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,610
Eight. Nine. Ten.

407
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,020
Found you.

408
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,170
Now it's your turn to seek.

409
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,380
I apologize. I couldn't recognize you quickly, Your Highness. Please hide again.

410
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,600
I will find someone else.

411
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,590
You think I can't play hide and seek?

412
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,670
That's not it.

413
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,510
You don't know the rules well, and I thought I should go easy on you for the first time.

414
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,390
You just want to find Hwi instead of me.

415
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,650
He hides well, so it isn't easy to find him.

416
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,740
That boy's good at this and that. He's good at hide and seek, too?

417
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,880
You're Yeon Hee, right? Starting today, come to my palace.

418
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,240
- But... 
 - Why,  is it something you can't do?

419
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,510
I already have someone I'm serving.

420
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,130
Don't you know that I am higher up than Hwi? Hwi's things, no matter what they are, I can own them.

421
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,330
I'm not some kind of object that can be given and taken.

422
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,150
No matter if it's a thing or a person, as long as I want it, it will be mine.

423
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,770
I'll tell the Chief Eunuch to bring good, young maids to you.

424
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,450
- Do you dislike me?
 - That's not it, Your Highness.

425
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,530
I've been serving Prince Hwi ever since I was very young.

426
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,680
When you choose a master, you stay with that master. It's a palace rule.

427
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,060
Do you like Hwi that much?

428
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:25,030
Your Highness! Your Highness! Where are you? Please come out.

429
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,920
Have you lost it?

430
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,690
I was hiding. Why'd you make it so noticeable? Do you want me to be a seeker that bad?

431
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,710
- That's not the issue, Yeon Hee is getting attacked! 
- What?

432
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,950
When a higher-up says so, you should go and come as they wish.

433
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,190
You're lower than me, and you're being stubborn about going and not going?

434
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,890
Your Highness, please calm down. I cannot leave my master.

435
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,670
Are you looking down on me for growing up in a normal house outside of the palace? I'm next in line after the crown prince.

436
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,130
I'm higher in rank than Hwi is.

437
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,970
Your Highness, what is wrong?

438
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,060
Don't disrespect me. I said to come to me.

439
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,160
No, the master I must obey is not you, Your Highness.

440
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm not going to another palace. I can't!

441
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,670
What did you say?

442
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,300
Your Highness!

443
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,440
- Please save me.
 - You hate me, don't you?

444
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,760
Please save me, Your Highness. Your Highness.

445
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,770
Then just die.

446
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,860
Hyung, where's Yeon Hee? Have you seen Yeon Hee?

447
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,590
Your Highness!

448
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,920
Yeon!

449
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,380
Go to the palace's pharmacy and get the doctors!

450
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,200
Yes, Your Highness.

451
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,230
Yeon! Yeon!

452
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,960
Why did this happen?

453
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,150
- How did she fall? Why didn't you go in and help her?! 
 - I don't know how to swim.

454
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:16,320
You should have called for someone! You should have tried to help!

455
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,220
How could you just watch her die?!

456
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,580
She was jumping all around because she was happy she found me. What was I supposed to do about her falling backward on her own?

457
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,110
Gi Teuk saw it.

458
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,340
I heard a different story.

459
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,010
What did Gi Teuk say?

460
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,850
What did he say that he saw?

461
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,870
I don't think we can help her.

462
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,110
Yeon.

463
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,330
Yeon, Yeon.

464
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,260
Welcome.

465
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,710
This was made by the person with the greatest skill in Joseon,

466
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,630
specially made for my nephew.

467
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,700
Uncle.

468
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,280
What is going on? Who made my nephew this upset?

469
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,750
Wh-What should I do?

470
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,250
Will I be removed from here?

471
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:31,450
Or will I go to prison?

472
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:35,370
Who will do that to a country's prince?

473
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,840
Don't worry.

474
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,280
Tell me what you saw.

475
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,860
The last person Yeon saw. Was there no one else other than my brother?

476
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,780
I was far away, so I couldn't hear what they were saying very well.

477
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,060
He seemed to be telling Yeon Hee to change to his palace.

478
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,690
But, he got angry when Yeon Hee said she didn't want to.

479
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,600
He got angry and led her to the water.

480
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,650
I thought I couldn't leave them to be so I went to find Your Highness.

481
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,670
He was angry.

482
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,500
  She was jumping all around because she was happy she found me.

483
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,280
 What was I supposed to do about her falling backward on her own?

484
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,230
Get me dry clothes from the laundry room.

485
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,240
I need to talk to my brother.

486
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,940
Yes.

487
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,480
Gi Teuk, are the clothes ready?

488
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,650
Uncle.

489
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,610
Are you trying to meet Kang?

490
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,610
Yes. I have something to ask my brother.

491
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,790
Go back.

492
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:59,450
Bury it. And forget it.

493
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,760
A person died.

494
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,170
Do you think that Kang's going to get punished?

495
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,020
A dead young maid and a living prince.

496
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,330
You know who the royal family would protect between the two of them.

497
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:24,040
The queen will get rid of the witnesses.

498
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,930
You are protected by your blood but everyone else will probably be taken care of, right?

499
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,050
Do you want to lose one more servant?

500
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:36,230
We shouldn't kill a living person because of someone who's already dead.

501
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,760
You need to bury this incident and your pride.

502
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,740
That way, this incident will pass and there will be no need to sacrifice any more innocent people.

503
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,360
Where is Gi Teuk?

504
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,210
That child has done nothing wrong.

505
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,880
Do you want to save him?

506
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,300
Do not threaten me.

507
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:04,280
Threaten? I'm the uncle who even gave up the throne for the sake of the country.

508
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,600
I only wish for the royal family's peace.

509
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,790
Your Highness.

510
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,790
Save me. Save me, please.

511
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,900
Your Highness. Save me.

512
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,850
Please save me.

513
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,990
Who... Who are you?!

514
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,940
Who are you!

515
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:58,110
  The queen will get rid of the witnesses.

516
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,090
 Do you want to lose one more servant?

517
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,630
Every day and every night,

518
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:19,220
you're saying you missed me?

519
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,850
Brother, I was like that too.

520
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,140
I missed the palace that I don't even remember.

521
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,050
I would dampen my pillow every night and fight back my tears.

522
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,550
How is it? Is it alright?

523
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,260
It's much better than what I've been using.

524
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,980
It's lightweight but shoots far.

525
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,990
This isn't just for use in training but for real.

526
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,060
It's an item used for war.

527
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:26,030
If Father and Mother find out about the maid, what should I do?

528
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:30,940
They won't find out. Hwi won't be able to tell them.

529
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,720
You weren't caught by your weakness.

530
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,820
Instead you beat your brother by his weakness.

531
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:45,230
Isn't it fun? Your secret became Hwi's shackles.

532
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:49,160
Don't feel bad about it. Don't let your conscience be bothered by it.

533
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,080
Firmly. Go further even stronger.

534
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,980
Power can cover up any wrongdoing.

535
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,620
For no one to question your wrongdoing,

536
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:04,810
you must have the power.

537
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,560
Do you remember when Yeon Hee hurt her arm?

538
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,920
Of course.

539
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,070
Just to get the dates from the tree for Your Highness, she climbed up butâ€”

540
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,500
That young child who had nothing,

541
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,870
she always said she wanted to give me things.

542
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,590
She put herself in danger and watched over me.

543
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,690
Yeon Hee's gaze always followed me around.

544
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,790
No matter where I went, I felt her presence.

545
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,950
She was a sunflower that only looked at you.

546
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:07,890
I was worried that she depended on me too much, so I acted coldly toward her.

547
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:11,120
I shouldn't have.

548
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,860
Do you regret it?

549
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,480
I should have smiled more warmly.

550
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,550
I should have told her in a friendly way.

551
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:26,460
If I had known her life would be so short, I would have done everything for her.

552
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,920
Your Highness, because of me...

553
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:39,070
Listen well. From now on, you are to stay by my side.

554
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,630
Yes.

555
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,950
And this matter,

556
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,690
forget it ever happened.

557
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:55,200
Nothing can happen with my brother's name involved.

558
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,830
I can't lose any more of my people.

559
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,870
Your Highness.

560
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,110
I am weak because I am still young.

561
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,890
We can't even uncover Yeon Hee's unjust death.

562
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,560
All I can do is to protect you.

563
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:23,480
You and I need to become stronger. Only then can we protect one another.

564
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,930
Your Highness.

565
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,580
Yeon, have you been well?

566
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:02,450
I still am curious whether you are a child or have grown up.

567
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:17,340
Now I can't picture your face as well anymore.

568
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:54,610

569
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,530
â™«   The places I want to go to  â™«

570
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,350
â™«   The places I need to go to  â™«

571
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,260
 Grand Prince Preview

572
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,130
â™«   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   â™«

573
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:19,410
  Today at the palace, they are playing the game of installing the crown prince.

574
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,450
  He is the first successor to the throne.

575
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,220
  He is a child full of greed, unlike Prince Eun Seong.

576
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,150
  You were cut from the classes to be a bride.

577
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,620
 I heard you ditched. Because of that, going out is prohibited.

578
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,900
  You're not only rude but also shameless.

579
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,270
 Who are you to be speaking informally?

580
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:37,290
  Don't ever forget it.

581
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,910
  My face. And my name.

582
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:46,330
â™«   I'm wandering   â™«

583
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:59,560
 Grand Prince
