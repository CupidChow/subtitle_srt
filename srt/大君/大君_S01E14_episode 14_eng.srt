1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,620
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:13,660

3
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,970
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,550
  Episode 14  
 So Hwi had to die and disappear

5
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,680
for you to come to me?

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,990
Even after his death,

7
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,830
even though he's not in this world anymore,

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,160
I couldn't go to anyone else.

9
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,540
Then, why?

10
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,100
Is it because I've become the king now?

11
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,110
Do you want to hear my answer?

12
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,110
It was so that I could get back at my enemy.

13
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,330
I came in here to kill you with my own hands.

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,300
- Open the doors. 
 - You cannot go in.

15
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,490
Kill me.

16
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,100
Pierce me.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,030
Do you think I killed Eun Seong myself?

18
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,390
I did not.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,050
He brought upon himself by his foolish attempt to escape.

20
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,680
At the beginning, who's the one who falsely accused him?

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,070
Who's the one who sent an innocent person into exile?

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,650
Is Court Lady Hong outside?

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

24
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,560
I already told her that she could not come in.

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,850
- Your Majesty. 
 - Escort the lady.

26
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,410
Take her to the Secret Pavilion and allow no one to visit her.

27
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,900
Do not let her go outside either.

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,430
Please come with me.

30
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,940
You've come all the way to the palace.

31
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,970
Will I die, too, Your Excellency?

32
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,780
"Your Excellency?"

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,980
Looks like it's not the time for us yet.

34
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,500
What a difficult journey it's been for us to get here.

35
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,700
I cannot let go of the lady that easily.

36
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,390
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,100
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

38
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,510
Your Majesty! Is no one there?

39
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,310
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

40
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,400
Go and find out which palace they're from.

41
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,340
Yes, Madame.

42
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,690
He might have drunk too much.

43
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,190
- Or he could  have taken medicine that was wrong for him.
 - Medicine?

44
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,090
Will he have any future complications?

45
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,420
He has a high fever and has been vomiting.

46
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,480
We will give him ginseng juice and detoxing tonic made of barberry roots.

47
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,160
His fever should come down during the night.

48
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,100
Is he really not harmed?

49
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,880
The doctors will keep an eye out all night.

50
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,250
Who is it?

51
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,810
Roo Si Gae?

52
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,490
Gi Teuk?

53
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,480
Move aside. Do you not know who I am?

54
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,520
His Majesty's orders stand above everyone else's.

55
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,540
He ordered us to let no one come in.

56
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,270
I have a message from the king.  Open the doors.

57
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,630
What did you do to the king?

58
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,830
Since you couldn't lure him in, did you use a love potion?

59
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,180
Not a love potion, but poison potion.

60
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,610
Refer to me as "Your Highness!"

61
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,870
Since you've confessed, you won't live now.

62
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,040
It's what I wanted. Kill me. I'm not afraid of death.

63
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,610
Death is a way for me to unite with my lover.

64
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,550
It's the one and only way for me to be with him.

65
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,130
I will kill you.

66
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,980
I don't know with whose help you came into the palace to harm His Majesty,

67
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,370
but I will look into every detail and find the culprit.

68
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:12,220
You will find nothing but the heart of one woman who tried to protect her fidelity with a dagger.

69
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,540
Who's out there?

70
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,900
- Yes, Your Highness? 
 - Wake up the inspection palace maids.

71
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,080
Tell them that there is a criminal that needs to be interrogated.

72
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,930
That girl, how crude.

74
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,180
Hey, hey!  What are you doing?

75
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,280
Hwi, is that you?

76
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,370
Come here.

77
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,400
- Hwi. 
- That Organgkae (derogatory term for Juchens) wench.

78
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,150
I am sorry. I couldn't inform you earlier.

79
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,200
Were you greatly shocked?

80
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,290
It was a dangerous mission.

81
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,850
It could've easily gone wrong.

82
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,970
There wasn't any other way at the time.

83
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,920
What happened?

84
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,210
The corpse and the burial.

85
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,570
What was all of that?

86
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,760
  I'm angry for being accused of a crime I didn't commit.

87
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,530
  If the loyal servant's sword in the hands of his filial son kills me,

88
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,850
 I will take that as an honorable death.

89
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,120
  Your Highness, are you alright?

90
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,960
  Have you come to your senses?

91
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,790
  General, you've got it wrong.

92
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,790
  Our grand prince is not a traitor.

93
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,930
  When he was taken as a prisoner in the north, when he could've negotiated his way out of there,

94
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,440
  when he had multiple chances to get away on his own,

95
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,290
  he insisted on leaving with his people, and endured the life as a prisoner.

96
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,590
  He risked his life and fought to rescue all the prisoners of war.

97
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,620
  If you wait, time will prove it.

98
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,080
  The true traitors will be planning other things again.

99
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,610
  Why did you save me? I will not let my enemy live.

100
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,630
  Open your eyes and see who the real enemy is!

101
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,620
  Since the grand prince has saved you, I hope that you can understand his real intentions.

102
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,510
  Your Highness!

103
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,560
  What is this? Why are you doing things you never did?

104
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,870
  Hyung-nims!

105
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,980
  Gi Teuk! Gi Teuk!

106
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,510
Hyyung-nim!

107
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,910
  How'd you get here?

108
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,590
  After hearing that His Highness was suffering, how could we stay put?

109
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,700
  Guests have arrived.

110
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,280
  Your words were true, Your Highness.

111
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,350
  Those people have no intention of letting you live.

112
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,840
  Your Highness.

113
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,890
  Then, do you believe me now, General?

114
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,420
 I remember the opinion my deceased father

115
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,950
 had of you when he was alive.

116
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,830
  What?

117
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,230
 That he felt sorry for you

118
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,630
 because you had to reluctantly follow the wishes of the royal family and the ministers

119
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,080
 in order to break Grand Prince Jin Yang's ambition.

120
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,200
 Your late father wanted to see the ruler of this country

121
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,120
 follow the proper path.

122
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,410
  We must return to the capital so that we can comfort the spirits

123
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,430
of the loyal servants who died tragically during the revolt and reveal the truth to the world.

124
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,570
  If you die, the truth will be buried with you.

125
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,140
  I won't let that happen.

126
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,260
  I need a corpse.

127
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,240
  It needs to be the corpse of a man who has a similar body figure as His Highness.

128
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,130
 I will wreak revenge for the death of my father.

129
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,330
  I do not see anything. I'll have to check the corpse.

130
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,730
Aigoo.

131
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,120
Ouch!

132
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,250
  We cannot recognize the grand prince's face.

133
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,890
  When the body was being pushed in by the tides, the face must've been damaged.

134
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,340

135
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,730
But why did you not follow the lady? Why are you here?

136
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,350
I didn't believe it.

137
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,520
- What? 
 - That Hwi died.

138
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,880
There was a corpse, though.

139
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,910
The face was smashed up.

140
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
You catch on quickly.

141
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,470
Even though Hwi had died, you weren't there.

142
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,140
Would Park Gi Teuk have put his own life first? No way.

143
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,250
I thought that if you were alive,

144
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,980
Hwi would've been, too.

145
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,470
I'm pretty loyal, right?

146
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,840
If it were a fight you'd survive, Hwi couldn't have died either.

147
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,950
At any rate, I worry about Lady Ja Hyeon.

148
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,170
She must believe that His Highness helplessly died.

149
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,980
We need to go back quickly

150
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,160
and tell her.

151
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,380
It will be two days until the boat that went back to the capital city returns.

152
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,990
Are there no other boats? I'm in a hurry.

153
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,900
I don't know what that brokenhearted woman might do.

154
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,840
There is a warship.

155
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,350
But, it's impossible for your entourage to get on without being found out.

156
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,220
If I had known that she was your loved one,

157
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,070
I would've given hints.

158
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,670
You have not done anything wrong, General.

159
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,100
I didn't know she'd come, either.

160
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,260
The more I think about it, the more I realize she's amazing.

161
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,300
She took such a rough path in order to try and warn you of danger.

162
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,400
During the three years that you disappeared, she is a woman who firmly endured it.

163
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,740
She'll be okay.

164
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,730
This is different from then.

165
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,370
She saw the corpse and burial with her own eyes.

166
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,940
She is bound to be in great despair.

167
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm worried that she'll act recklessly.

168
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,940
It's fine. I don't need any more medicine.

169
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,310
You are not feeling well, Your Majesty.

170
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,970
The alcohol was just strong, is all.

171
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,250
That's not the case.

172
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,360
While trying to pick flowers that you shouldn't have,

173
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,930
isn't that how you turned out this way?

174
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,710
Ja Hyeon must be punished as a person who committed treason.

175
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,110
You could've died, Your Majesty.

176
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,770
Do not interfere.

177
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,310
I will take care of it myself.

178
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,260
Your Majesty, I am your wife.

179
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,730
If I don't interfere, who will?

180
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,490
Don't you know jealousy is one of seven grounds on which you can be dethroned?

181
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,960
Does it look like I'm being jealous right now?

182
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,580
It is not jealousy, but it is to protect you.

183
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,260
How could you bring disgrace upon yourself on the first day of ascending to the throne?

184
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,380
Even if you have all the women in the world to yourself, you can't have Ja Hyeon.

185
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,570
Are you trying to be referred to as an immoral king, right from the beginning of your reign?

186
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,560
Shut your mouth.

187
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,370
She was always mine.

188
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,090
She's a flower Eun Seong stole from me.

189
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm saying that she was always mine.

190
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,030
She was my friend.

191
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,300
My father and my grandfather

192
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,700
fell for the sibis around the palace,
(Sibi: low-level girl servants in the palace)

193
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,590
but they kept the protocol of the inner court in dealing with court ladies.

194
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,090
Don't get in my way with the excuse of a childhood friendship.

195
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,980
Is this why you rose to the throne?

196
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,810
Is this why you became a king?

197
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:57,570
You must know that had it not been for Chief Scholar, it would've been hard to remove Eun Seong.

198
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,870
Thanks to the fact that his daughter is no different than a virgin widow,

199
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,560
I was going to save her to get Chief Scholar on our side.

200
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,420
But, why did you not discuss it with me?

201
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,520
The matter regarding a court lady is under my control.

202
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,620
If I had powerful in-laws,

203
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,720
I wouldn't need a concubine to strengthen my position.

204
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,410
Previous kings made sure they filled all nine concubine positions

205
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,410
in order to strengthen their throne and ensure a brighter future for the nation.

206
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,130
Have you forgotten about my pledge and loyalty?

207
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,590
I am not your woman, but your liege.

208
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,640
Since my loyalty wouldn't change, I said for our fate to be together as well.

209
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,050
Do not lower the dignity of the queen's office with a useless sense of jealousy.

210
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,990
I will not forget about our vows.

211
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,720
Take no notice of what occurred last night.

212
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,970
I will ask Seong Ja Hyeon about her wrongdoing myself.

213
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,930
My wife, do not interfere.

214
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,030
The palace felt uneasy last night, so I looked into it.

215
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,360
It appears as though there is someone locked up in the Secret Pavilion.

216
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,900
Secret Pavilion?

217
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,440
There was a place like that in the palace?

218
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,860
It is used to punish court ladies instead of putting them in jail.

219
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,750
Who in the world is locked in there?

220
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:37,310
That... I'm hearing horrible rumors among the court ladies.

221
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,240
Stop!

222
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,230
Tell me what kind of evil medicine you fed the king.

223
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,310
Is the wound on the king's body your doing?

224
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,170
Who ordered you?

225
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,800
The queen?  Did they want to restore the previous king?

226
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,380
Just tell me. Then you won't hurt anymore.

227
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,950
By torturing me in this way

228
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,810
instead of killing me right away,

229
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,070
are you trying to embroil innocent people again?

230
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,900
I'm trying to find out the truth.

231
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,550
There is none of that. Just kill me.

232
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,000
This won't be enough. To have a spiteful woman confess, there should be another special method prepared.

233
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,840
Bring it over.

234
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,830
Your Majesty, you must appoint Secretary of the Cabinet first,

235
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,580
so that you can set the path for your rule along with the ministers.

236
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,220
Since we do not have a full court,

237
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,740
I will not open the Gyeongyeon for a while.
(King's meetings with scholars and ministers to discuss national affairs).

238
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,810
Saying you are not opening the Gyeongyeon is

239
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,960
like saying you will not hear the voice of the people.

240
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,800
The former king did not seek out the Gyeongyeon either.

241
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,080
Are you saying that he didn't do his job as a king?

242
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,780
Your Majesty, he avoided Gyeongyeon because of ill health,

243
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,950
but he held Gyeongyeon and bent his ears to the opinions

244
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,620
at the beginning.

245
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,700
The important thing now is not the Gyeongyeon but

246
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,250
obtaining consent from Ming China

247
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,140
for His Majesty's ascension to the throne.

248
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,690
Please order the chief scholar to prepare the declaration.

249
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,390
But, I cannot see Chief Scholar.

250
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,070
There are troubles going on in the household, so he could not attend.

251
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,810
I will go see him.

252
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,250
The former king was in ill health for a long time,

253
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,250
and the power of the throne was further weakened in care of the baby king,

254
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,550
The people have fallen into a sense of despair.

255
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,430
I plan to go back to the time when our nation was founded

256
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,460
and make this country strong by upholding the principles of the founding fathers.

257
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,700
We are thankful for your grace, Your Majesty.

258
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,200
Your Majesty.

259
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,110
- What's going on? 
- The queen took the lady from the Seong family from the Secret Pavilion and

260
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,700
is torturing her.

261
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,570
Thoughtlessly torturing a noblewoman is not allowed.

262
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,010
You can't breathe, right? With every layer that is placed upon your face,

263
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,590
as we lay more and more layers of the cloth,

264
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,140
you cannot breathe and eventually,

265
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,580
do you know that you'll suffocate and die?

266
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,990
So, tell me. Hm?

267
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,030
What are you doing?!

268
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,770
Bring the lady inside and call the royal doctor right away!

269
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,370
Everyone who went against my order and opened the Secret Pavilion will be expelled.

270
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,450
Anyone who goes against my order again will be beheaded.

271
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,100
You said you wanted to be the queen, but you didn't know the laws?

272
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,080
If it's in her hands, are you prepared to give your life?

273
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,170
When I think about what she did to you,  tearing her apart wouldn't satisfy me.

274
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,570
If she dies, didn't I say that I'd be the one to kill her?

275
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,640
How could you do this to me?

276
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,550
To me, who put her life on the line for you, Your Majesty.

277
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,590
Then, do you want to share the royal authority too?

278
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,360
Did you not say yourself that political power can't be shared even between father and son?

279
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,190
Any gratitude has to come from within my heart,

280
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,240
not from your demands for expression.

281
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,900
Why do you not refer to me as a queen?

282
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,800
This is not our private home.

283
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,330
I still haven't decided whether I'll make you the queen or not.

284
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,460
Whether you are capable of fulfilling the role of a queen,

285
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,580
I cannot make the judgment yet.

286
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,680
You'll have to remain here a day longer.

287
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,840
When the boat arrives, we will take you back right away.

288
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,540
I've been appointed to the court, so I can help you in the city now.

289
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,440
As for me, I am thankful.

290
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,050
But the royal court is a different world from here.

291
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,870
The days ahead of you may be rough.

292
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,470
Have you forgotten the work of my late father?

293
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,470
That path is my duty.

294
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,310
Where will you stay in the capital city?

295
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,580
There's a temple in the mountain where I can lie low.

296
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,930
If I can get the approval from the chief monk, I will hide there as a bulmokhani (a laborer at a temple).

297
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,760
While you are meeting with your lady, I will go see the chief monk.

298
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,130
I heard that you were feeling unwell.

299
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,130
They say Chief Scholar's daughter is in the palace.

300
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,380
That cunning wench entered the palace to harm the king.

301
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,590
The queen has misunderstood.

302
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,250
Queen Mother, you already have many worries.

303
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,250
Do not mess with her feelings by saying unnecessary things.

304
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,040
She made the decision to do that and came in.

305
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,000
She harbored hatred based on what happened to Grand Prince Eun Seong.

306
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,830
Why would the lady harbor hatred over what happened to Eun Seong?

307
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,950
Did Eun Seong die while being innocent?

308
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,590
- I am asking if the two of you killed Eun Seong! 
 - Queen Mother.

309
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,350
If that's not the case, what is there for Lady Ja Hyeon to resent?

310
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,980
Thanks to her father, they were able to get themselves off of the criminal charge,

311
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,440
and save their lives.

312
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,090
Send her back as soon as possible

313
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,480
before the rumors turn into a scandal.

314
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,940
All of this is because

315
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,730
I have not been appointed formally as the queen, in my opinion.

316
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,680
If I can be in my place quickly, I can serve those above me in earnest

317
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,610
and get a firm handle on the business of the inner court.

318
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,540
Speed up the process.

319
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,920
I won't allow any more of this noisy matter.

320
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,120
  I came to kill you with my own hands!

321
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,630
What will you do with Lady Ja Hyeon?

322
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,400
I can't let her live after what she did,

323
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,420
but even though she held a knife to my throat and poisoned me,

324
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,630
even as I was bleeding because of it,

325
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,730
what are these feelings

326
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,530
that make me want to keep her in my hands?

327
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:25,210
You may lose many things as a result of trying to get one thing.

328
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,550
If Eun Seong disappeared,

329
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,070
I thought everything in the world would be the way I wanted.

330
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:37,050
Now I have to battle against a spirit without a body.

331
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,880
Let's go.

332
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,190
 Notice of Abdication: In great honor of my ancestors who had accepted heaven's mandate and

333
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,990
 had established this great dynasty in the east. In this time of calamity, for the greater good of the nation,

334
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,660
 royals and officials are to yield to this ascension which will again not be by the first in line, the eldest grand prince.

335
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,340
 The abdication of  Honorary Sangwang will be on June 11, 1453, in Geunjeongjeon.

336
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:41,160
Can you read that from looking at it? You're illiterate.

337
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,000
People don't know it.

338
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,630
You think you can read just because you are standing here?

339
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,760
It's saying that the thief has become the king.

340
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,440
The queen couldn't endure it.

341
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,640
She was afraid that her young son might die of poison.

342
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,680
I will bring these people to the mountains first.

343
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,790
You have to go somewhere, right?

344
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,790
I'll trust you.

345
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,990
She killed her husband and went right into the palace, they say.

346
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,470
The dead person's the pitiful one.

347
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,360
A household that has a disloyal subject, a daughter who isn't faithful.

348
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,320
Oh, the world has become rotten!

349
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,430
Those dirty beings!

350
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,410
Honestly...

351
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
In her situation, really.

352
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,480
These people. Where do you think this is for you to be stoning the house?

353
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,290
When did you come?

354
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,150
I thought you went back to your hometown.

355
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,610
Is the lady inside? She didn't go anywhere, right?

356
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,250
You're talking down to me.

357
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,480
You are, too.

358
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,830
I'm a nobleman, though.

359
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,570
- I'm a princess. 
 - What?

360
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,050
I'm a Jurchen princess.

361
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,170
You are tricking people like someone I know.

362
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,620
I need to see the lady. I have to talk to her.

363
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,850
Our Ja Hyeon can't see people like you now.

364
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,210
- After there was a new king, she went to the palace right away. 
 - Why?

365
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,930
She became a royal concubine of this country's king.

366
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,310
Does that make sense?

367
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,880
Even though Our Ja Hyeon can be reckless,

368
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,280
she's pretty smart in important moments like this.

369
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,290
It was suffocating for her, too.

370
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,700
To be a married woman without being a married woman.

371
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,590
No noble family would take her in now.

372
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,770
She made the bold decision. She volunteered herself!

373
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,680
Are you in the right mind? You don't even know anything.

374
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,950
Don't act like you know everything.

375
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,170
- You fool. 
 - You just swore at me, right?

376
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,680
I felt that! I have a good sense of things, you know!

377
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,830
How dare you just leave while a nobleman is talking to you?

378
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,430
Your Highness.

379
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,230
My wife, stay home. I'll go and bring her.

380
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,960
I wasn't thinking clearly and let her go when she said she'd go herself.

381
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,400
We haven't heard from her and we don't know if she's alive or dead.

382
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,060
How could I, her mother, wait in a room?

383
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,440
That's why I said I'm going.

384
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,800
The world is cursing our household.

385
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,030
They are spitting and throwing rocks at our house, but I'm okay with that.

386
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,840
Since you are alive, I am grateful.

387
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,930
As long as my daughter returns to my embrace, it's okay.

388
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,150
If he were to appoint her as a concubine, we would have received the notice by now.

389
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,470
I'll enter the palace and try to understand the situation.

390
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,440
Please bring Ja Hyeon in front of me.

391
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,080
Please calm yourself, Your Highness. There has to be a reason.

392
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,270
You don't know the situation well yet.

393
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,530
What reason?

394
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,730
After seeing that he had died with her eyes, she gave up.

395
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,500
She could have given up in despair thinking you'd died.

396
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,390
She might have been dragged there under unavoidable circumstances.

397
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,600
- Your Highness. 
 - I thought if I died,

398
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,810
she might follow me to death.

399
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,520
That was my greatest worry.

400
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,240
♫   I try to fix it   ♫

401
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,950
Forget her! She's a traitor.

402
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,750
She went to the palace to become the king's woman in order to live and eat well.

403
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,060
Do not speak thoughtlessly.

404
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,350
♫   It has rusted   ♫

405
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,290
There is an explanation.

406
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,890
There will be something.

407
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:27,400
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

408
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,190
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

409
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:42,580
♫   As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

410
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,120
♫   You don't know it yet   ♫

411
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,050
I can accept the humiliation of my family but this incident has brought the dignity of the royal family to the ground,

412
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:11,150
and the newly anointed king is being spoken badly of.

413
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:15,650
Before unpleasant rumors spread any further, please allow me to take my daughter home.

414
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,510
Your daughter will be sent out of the palace.

415
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:25,360
But, from this moment on, she must reside in Jeongubwon (a temple for female monks).

416
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,640
That is too much.

417
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,970
She has suffered nothing but hardships because of the grand prince.

418
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,400
Must you make a Buddhist nun out of her?

419
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,890
Will you be able to marry her to anyone now?

420
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,450
Will she obediently become a royal concubine based on the king's greed?

421
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,820
To settle all of this turmoil,

422
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,610
the only way is to commit suicide or to be married.

423
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,500
Don't you think her life should be saved?

424
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,010
Go back. Your daughter will be sent to the Jeongubwon.

425
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:01,330
Queen Mother will send Ja Hyeon to Jeongubwon.

426
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,510
She'll need to stay in the palace for a little while.

427
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,940
Her body must be treated since she cannot even move.

428
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,220
Do you really want to hold onto her even a day longer?

429
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,220
Nothing will change even if you do that.

430
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,250
You misrepresented me, went against my royal order,

431
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,250
and tortured the daughter of Chief Scholar.

432
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,970
Don't you know that this is enough for you to be sent out of the palace, too?

433
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,410
If the daughter who came here healthy goes out half dead,

434
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,340
I'm sure Chief Scholar would be so grateful.

435
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,890
If this becomes an issue at the Samsa (an agency in charge of public opinion)

436
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,570
will you take responsibility for that?

437
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:45,200
Lady Ja Hyeon must leave the palace with an unharmed body.

438
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,470
Then, you will also be unscathed, Queen.

439
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,440
Thank you for receiving the offering from the king's envoy.

440
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,010
I'm not helping because of the offering.

441
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:23,080
It is due to my long-cherished wish that our country will become a country

442
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,500
that lives by the teachings of the Buddha more closely.

443
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,100
Where the king is reborn

444
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,820
into someone who's merciful in the greatest ways.

445
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,280
I'm praying for those days to come.

446
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,960
Na mu gan sal bo sal (Korean monk's prayer).

447
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,160
She's not someone who'd walk into the palace with her own two feet.

448
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,100
Undoubtedly, there was some peculiar reason.

449
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,870
What happened inside and how she is doing now,

450
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,320
can you please find out?

451
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,570
He's about to break into the palace himself.

452
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,000
I need your help to stop him from doing that.

453
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,220
There is no one who knows anything about the lady in the court.

454
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,140
I will have to connect with the court ladies at the queen's and king's quarters.

455
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,710
I will find out the story.

456
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,010
The militia from the rebellion

457
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,770
and the wench who laid the false charge against you, have you found out anything?

458
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,590
I don't think his wife would have done it herself.

459
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:30,610
I am suspecting the gisaeng near Grand Prince Jin Yang, Jo Hwi Gyeong.

460
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,540
Jo Hwi Gyeong?

461
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,670
A woman who's bold enough to deal with assassins

462
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,010
and not even blink while laying false charges against you.

463
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,800
She can't be a woman from an ordinary neighborhood.

464
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,240
He called Jo Hwi Gyeong to every banquet.

465
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,060
He sent her every time he tried to find out things from me.

466
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,590
She is for sure Grand Prince Jin Yang's person.

467
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,100
I will meet with her.

468
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:13,000
How do you feel, Lady?  Are you able to move a little now?

469
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,280
I can exit the palace any time.

470
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,480
I will prepare the palanquin on the day it's approved.

471
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,640
Before I leave the palace,

472
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,060
I have one wish.

473
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,870
The pavilion Grand Prince Eun Seong used to reside in.

474
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,780
Is it possible to see it before I go?

475
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,660
That would be difficult.

476
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,600
You are not allowed to leave this room at all.

477
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,800
On the day I am to leave the palace.  Before I get into the palanquin...

478
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,430
just once, can I stop by there?

479
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:04,360
Congratulations on your appointment to the important post.

480
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,420
Please come by here often.

481
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,920
You'll need to make connections and find out what's going on.

482
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,880
Speaking of which, I've come to ask you something.

483
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,390
There is someone we have not caught from the last rebellion.

484
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,470
Did you not catch everyone from the leader to the bottom soldier?

485
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,180
The woman who bought the rebel army.

486
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,350
We haven't caught her yet.

487
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,470
Some of the rebel armies are still in prison,

488
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,770
so I'm sure we could find out.

489
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:39,390
Is there someone who saw her?

490
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,900
But why are you telling me about it here?

491
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,310
It couldn't be a woman from an ordinary neighborhood, could it?

492
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:51,050
Investigators were onto her but she was never caught.

493
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,050
The woman who made sure every dying rebel army member

494
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,360
confessed that he was acting on the order of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

495
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,320
Who could possibly

496
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,110
be that woman?

497
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:08,190
Gisaengs (female entertainer) deal with people from all walks of life.

498
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,950
We don't tell on a criminal, nor do we throw out a beggar.

499
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,330
But still, you are speaking of something very dangerous.

500
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,900
Are you suggesting the criminal is hiding in the gisaeng house?

501
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,800
A gisaeng house is a place where all manners of information are exchanged,

502
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,670
I'm asking you to tell me if you hear anything.

503
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,030
I will remember.

504
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,700
Shouldn't we tell His Majesty?  Why is he asking about things that are all finished?

505
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,380
I can't tell whose side he's on yet.

506
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,120
He's the one who killed Grand Prince Eun Seong, so he must be on the side of His Majesty.

507
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,100
He's not one who was with the great cause from the beginning.

508
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,940
Is he acting overly loyal to get on the good side of the king?

509
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,130
Let's keep an eye on him a little longer

510
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,540
to see whether he's an ambitious guy looking for a promotion

511
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,180
or a son looking to avenge his father's death.

512
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,750
If not,

513
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,780
is he someone who wants to start a whole new game?

514
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,950
I think it's Jo Hwi Gyeong.  She was shaken when I said there was a witness, but she denied it decisively.

515
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,960
It's the response of someone who knows what happened.

516
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,320
That horrible wench.

517
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,630
The one who laid a false charge can also be the one who can remove it.

518
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,620
No matter what, we have to get her.

519
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,190
And the lady is coming out of the palace.

520
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:06,650
Does that mean everything is okay?  Is she going back home?

521
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,560
It is true that Grand Prince Jin Yang tried to make her his concubine.

522
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,230
But the queen's jealousy was severe and the queen dowager would not give approval,

523
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,330
so she's been sent to Jeongubwon (a temple for female monks).

524
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,650
Are they turning our lady into a female monk?

525
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,220
Are you going to let her be turned into a female monk?

526
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,430
It's good that you are going to Jeongubwon.

527
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,260
For the rest of your life, pray for the rebirth of Grand Prince Eun Seong.

528
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,940
Isn't that the kind of life you desire the most?

529
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,990
In Gwa Eung Bo.

530
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,260
I will pray for a world where a criminal is rightly punished.

531
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,680
Show your manners. She is the queen.

532
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,940
You cannot treat her like a childhood friend.

533
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,130
Let her be.

534
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,510
This is her last protest.

535
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,760
Gaining a title that was not rightfully won,

536
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,280
your whole life will feel uneasy.

537
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,470
There will never be a day where you won't feel uneasy.

538
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,910
At night, you won't sleep well.

539
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,990
You will be suspicious of every mouthful of rice and every drop of soy sauce.

540
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,400
Silk fabrics will sting you and even gold threaded bedding will feel like a bed of nails.

541
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,350
You don't need to worry about me.

542
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,090
You are the one who was defeated.

543
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,920
Are you happy? After holding all that you wanted,

544
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,950
are you happy now?

545
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,640
Can it be as much as your unhappiness?

546
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,320
Escort the lady.

547
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:30,150
♫  Believing and believing  ♫

548
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:37,150
♫  In a life together  ♫

549
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:43,960
♫  Living and living  ♫

550
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:51,760
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

551
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:04,250
You have to take her away before she sets foot into Jeongubwon (a temple of female monks).

552
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,670
Let's go.

553
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,490
Let's go.

554
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,870
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

555
00:57:52,870 --> 00:58:01,050
Your Highness, she might be better off being at Jeongubwon (a temple of female monks).

556
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,410
If she's there, no one can touch her.

557
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,020
If we bring her back, we can't even care for her properly.

558
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,470
Her current circumstances make her unable to return home.

559
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:15,790
Let's tell her that you're alive and until your false accusations are lifted,

560
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,230
I think that it'd be safer for her to remain there.

561
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,070
I need to see her.

562
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,840
I need to see

563
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:31,010
Ja Hyeon with my own eyes.

564
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,120
Every month, the same amount of money will be offered.

565
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,030
We will take Chief Scholar's daughter.

566
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,510
But, the public is to think that she is here

567
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,010
and that she will not be meeting anyone.

568
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,000
Then, we will be off.

569
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,530
Take care.

570
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,340
What are you doing?

571
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,220
Lady Monk!  Lady Monk!

572
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,370
Let go of me!

573
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,600
Do not touch the lady!

574
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,260
Let's go!

575
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,340
Let's go!

576
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,400
Stop them!

577
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,010
Am I

578
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,180
dead?

579
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,360
Now, in another world,

580
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,250
have I met you?

581
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:26,230
♫   So I keep walking till shadows disappear, one, two, three,   ♫

582

  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
