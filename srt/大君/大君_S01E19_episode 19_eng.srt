1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,630
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:13,160

3
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,980
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,580
  Episode 19

5
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,230
Will he... really come?

6
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,940
Eun Seong has promised me.

7
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,010
He promised me that he'll return Myeong to our embrace today.

8
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,180
If his uncle's plan fails—

9
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,450
Even if the worst were to happen, the king right now

10
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,720
cannot lay his hands on his nephew.

11
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,380
There were conditions for being approved by China. They want to see  the abdicated king.

12
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,130
Once the Chinese envoys come and go again, won't his life be in danger again?

13
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,110
At the very least, we can buy time.

14
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,530
Within that time, we need to find out what we can do.

15
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Would any boat stop here?

16
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,830
To go to grandfather's tomb we have to cross the river.

17
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,990
According to the information from the capital, this is where we can get across.

18
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,710
Soon, the daughter from the Seong household will enter the palace.

19
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,060
Go and wait for them at the gate, so as to avoid palace talk.

20
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,130
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,210
Queen Dowager, could I go with her?

22
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,350
If you do, people will be more suspicious.

23
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,620
I will carefully bring him.

24
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,190
I'll trust you with it, Court Lady Jang.

25
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,650
This is carp stew that you mentioned from the kitchen.

26
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,180
Carp helps with getting pregnant and then protects the mother during pregnancy.

27
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,780
I prayed to the moon yesterday

28
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,930
and I prayed for the baby.

29
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,960
To the moon?  Don't you know that the moon's energy brings a daughter?

30
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,860
Oh, I didn't know that.

31
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,110
We slept together on the day that the Office of Divination chose for us.

32
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,140
Since the doctor hasn't confirmed it, it doesn't mean that there's no possibility.

33
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,130
Yes, Your Highness.

34
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,870
Boo Deul, there is something you must do for me.

35
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,310
Please tell me, Your Highness.

36
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,690
Find the woman who gave birth to the most sons in this capital.

37
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,240
- Bring a kitchen knife from that place. 
 - A knife?

38
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,990
They say it's a superstition, but we must do whatever we can.

39
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,380
Yes, Your Highness. I'll bring whatever they say is good.

40
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,910
You should enjoy your royal meal first.

41
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,970
Hasn't this gone bad?

42
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,060
Of course not.  This is the best quality.

43
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,040
Your Majesty, today you will return to the palace again.

44
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,480
Will I be able to meet my mother?

45
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,840
She will be very happy and say that you have grown so much.

46
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,900
You know, if everything goes well today,

47
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,580
let's go hunting.

48
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,980
Do you want to?

49
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,160
Just us. Like the past.

50
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,890
In the past, it was because we had nothing to eat. It wasn't for fun.

51
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,160
Anyway, let's go.

52
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,040
You can do that for me.

53
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,610
You can go on a hunt with me.

54
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,610
Yeah. Let's go hunting.

55
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,840
You, Gi Teuk, and me. The three of us.

56
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,220
I'm sorry

57
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,450
for taking you from your hometown and making you suffer like this.

58
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,240
It's fine. I followed you because I wanted to.

59
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,290
Looking at it now, I never asked you

60
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:19,320
why would you have left your hometown and followed me. Followed us.

61
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,100
I didn't want to be alone.

62
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,130
People from Joseon thought I was dirty and would spit at me.

63
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,340
The Hulli people called me a mutt and didn't include me.

64
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,670
My father was the chief, but he wouldn't look my way.

65
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,160
I don't know if it's true, either.

66
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,890
Among all the people I met after being born, you have been the warmest, Hwi.

67
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,380
Being alone again was scary to me.

68
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,040
I will not let you be alone.

69
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,290
For the rest of my life, I'll have you as my younger sister

70
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,940
and after this all ends, I'll take responsibility and send you off to marry someone.

71
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,430
Please, get in.

72
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,110
Please stay safe.

73
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,170
When our people return, please hide them well.

74
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,930
After I see that His Majesty is safe, I will come back and help.

75
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,860
Thank you, for all this time.

76
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,880
This isn't the end.

77
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,100
You're acting like we'll never see each other again.

78
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,850
Okay.

79
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,470
We'll be going.

80
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,540
Let's go.

81
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,460
What are you doing?

82
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,090
Ae Rang, you should pack your things, too.

83
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,540
Prepare a swift and strong horse, too.

84
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,570
Go to the Seo River port and secure a boat on standby

85
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,310
so that we can leave the capital whenever.

86
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,820
Are you already fleeing?

87
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,210
If, by the smallest chance, the revolt fails, do you think we'll survive?

88
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,570
It'll be hard to survive in the capital. We will have to flee.

89
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,930
Your Majesty!  Please escape!

90
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,200
It's the gang of traitors! Protect the king!

91
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,300
We must protect the king!

92
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,270
Your Excellency!  Your Excellency!

93
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,150
Your Excellency!

94
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,630
Minister!

95
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,710
Your Excellency!

96
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,440
Take care of the royal carriage.  Take the king to a safe place!

97
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,930
When I leave to follow the royal carriage, you will all have to fight your way out of here.

98
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,650
Go! Leave this place to me.

99
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,740
- Let's all leave. 
 - Okay.

100
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,190
What is that?

101
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,670
What army is that?

102
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,330
Who are those people?

103
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,470
Are they on our side?

104
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,860
They're that way.

105
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,830
This wasn't a part of our plan.

106
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,690
Everyone, scatter! Run away!

107
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,420
What about you?

108
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,980
- Hwi is in danger. 
 - Then, you should go with us.

109
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,660
If we go, we will die.

110
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,680
Gosh, I can't just go.

111
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,210
Leader, what Roo Si Gae is saying is right.

112
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,670
You're asking to die if you run into an elite troop!

113
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,670
I don't have any regrets now.

114
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,420
To whom do I owe my precious life?

115
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,450
If we die for His Highness, I'll have no regrets.

116
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,140
Are you two trying to act cool right now?

117
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,820
You're making me look bad! Leader!

118
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,000
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

119
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,320
Stop.

120
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,890
Brother, please come out.

121
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,390
It's a trap!

122
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,560
Grand Prince Jin Yang has caught on.

123
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,730
His Majesty! The palace is in danger!

124
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,500
Nice to see you, Grand Prince.

125
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,530
I was doubting it, but you really were alive.

126
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,240
Today, we will really send you to the other world, Your Highness.

127
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,430
These are all traitors.

128
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,090
Catch them!

129
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,090
Did you already know such a situation would occur today?

130
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,770
How could the Minister of Defense know and bring an army?

131
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,510
Do not worry about it. The king will be safe.

132
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,740
Since the Minister of Defense and the Captain of Royal Guards already prepared for this,

133
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,130
wouldn't that be on king's orders?

134
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,130
He's probably somewhere safe.

135
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,640
Then, we should all return to the palace.

136
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,930
Even if something happens outside, we should be figuring it out inside.

137
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,060
Your Excellency, get up!

138
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,280
Right, right, right.

139
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,410
Go! Go and protect His Majesty.

140
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,050
Hurry!  Hurry!

141
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,300
Go to the palace, quickly! Quickly!

142
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,910
You go first.

143
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,160
I'll be right behind you.

144
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,670
Roo Si Gae!

145
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,860
Roo Si Gae!

146
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,280
♫  Believing and believing  ♫

147
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,300
Deok Man.

148
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,320
Ho Chi!

149
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,120
♫  Living and living  ♫

150
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,240
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

151
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,700
No!

152
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,150
Let's go.

153
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,280
How come you did not join the royal ancestral rites procession?

154
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,740
Because I was informed that there was a conspiracy to kill me.

155
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,630
If so, you should have canceled the royal procession and arrested the traitors.

156
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,310
Why did you just send an empty royal carriage?

157
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,410
Who's most likely to be made the next king after they've killed me?

158
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,070
Wouldn't they bring our dear nephew back to the palace?

159
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,090
Are you trying to catch Prince Seung Pyeong?

160
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,960
I plan to round up all the rebels red-handed,

161
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,350
and at the same time catch Prince Seung Pyeong when he comes back here.

162
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,140
You really are wise, Your Majesty.

163
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,400
We can't greet the Chinese envoy empty-handed.

164
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,360
When that young thing comes here, you take care of him because I can't trust Queen Mother.

165
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,150
Nor can I let him go to his mother.

166
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,850
Leave it to me, Your Majesty.

167
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,760
I will not let anyone take him away.

168
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,850
What's going on? Why is the king in the palace?

169
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,790
Looks like they sent a fake king in the royal procession.

170
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,490
Looks like the first stage has failed.

171
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,180
So we have no choice but to make the next move like we were instructed.

172
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,470
Why are you all so surprised?

173
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,150
Why wouldn't we be, when the king who should be in the royal ancestral rites procession is in the palace?

174
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,540
What's wrong? Did you come back halfway because you were ill?

175
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,330
Because I was informed that there would be treason.

176
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,850
In order to catch the rebels on site,

177
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,990
I sent out the royal procession and stayed behind to protect the palace.

178
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,650
Why didn't you inform me of such an important matter?

179
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,680
The counterattack should be done as secretively as the mutiny.

180
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
If the report of treason is true,

181
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,130
the rebels are going to die today.

182
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,480
Did you know of this?

183
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,490
That the traitors are plotting to kill me?

184
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,530
I'm sure you would've told me if you knew, right?

185
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,240
Since no parent in the world would ever want to kill their own child.

186
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm someone who put her life on the line for her child.

187
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,850
Are you speaking the truth?

188
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:37,210
Therefore, you too should strive to save your bloodline.

189
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,510
Since there's treason, it's dangerous both inside and outside the palace.

190
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,240
Guard Queen Dowager's Palace with your life

191
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,850
and keep the two ladies safe.

192
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,040
I wish to see Queen Dowager.

193
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,130
 An insignia for permission to pay respect to royalty.

194
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,220
Who's inside the palanquin?

195
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,900
He's a child from Queen' Dowager's private house.

196
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,710
Because Queen Dowager is feeling lonely,

197
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,340
she wants to spend time with the children from her private home.

198
00:25:52,090 --> 00:26:01,090

199
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,290
I didn't expect to see you here today.

200
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,870
It seems you didn't expect to see me here either.

201
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,560
Move.

202
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,330
My lady.

203
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,720
Welcome, my dear nephew.

204
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,840
I was waiting for you.

205
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,010
Don't startle His Majesty.

206
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,880
Can't you see he's trembling in fear?

207
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,540
Thank you for bringing Prince Seung Pyeong to me.

208
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,980
I never expected you to give me such a big present.

209
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,080
Do you think I brought him here for you?

210
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,550
I know you've been deceiving me for the sake of today.

211
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,130
But look what happened in the end.

212
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,880
Thanks to you, I was able to find Prince Seung Pyeong, whom I wanted desperately.

213
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,560
Ultimately, this uprising was to my benefit.

214
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,340
Just wait.

215
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,020
I will catch all the rebels

216
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,340
and show you their wretched end.

217
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,750
It's not over yet.

218
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,730
Today will be a very, very long day.

219
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Escort Prince Seung Pyeong to the queen's quarters.

220
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,190
My queen will be waiting for him.

221
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,830
Take the lady from the Seong family and Eunuch Park to the Secret Pavilion.

222
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,570
There are still more things I need to hear from them.

223
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,230
Yes, Your Majesty!

224
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,200
Let go of me! I will go to my mother!

225
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,720
Where is my mother? Let go!

226
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,380
Welcome, my nephew. We have been very much waiting for you.

227
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,910
What was your plan?

228
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,550
Were you trying to kill me while I was in the royal procession

229
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,370
and restore Prince Seung Pyeong?

230
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,060
Or, is Eun Seong still alive as the rumors suggest,

231
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,460
and you are wishing to install him as the new king?

232
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,850
Who in the palace knew about this?

233
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,520
Even in Queen Dowager's palace,

234
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,300
did they know?

235
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,900
It has been a long time since Grand Prince Eun Seong died.

236
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
We were just

237
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,380
trying to get back at the late Grand Prince Eun Seong's enemy.

238
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,050
We wanted to follow through with Grand Prince Eun Seong's will.

239
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,660
We were trying to return the throne back to the abdicated king, who had been treated unjustly.

240
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,840
You want the queen to be dethroned and take her place,

241
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,810
and deceive me like this?

242
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,020
Do you feel like you were wrongfully treated?

243
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,640
Are you angry?

244
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,970
You have deceived the people and betrayed the royal family,

245
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,940
not to mention numerous court officials under you.

246
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,480
And yet, you are angry about me deceiving you once?

247
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,020
Now, tell me the truth.

248
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,210
Is Eun Seong alive?

249
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,460
Lady, I am okay.

250
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,650
Do not worry about me!

251
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,430
Eunuch Park!

252
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,800
Is this okay?

253
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,980
Lady, do not give in.

254
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,160
He threatens people by bringing pain to those who are close to them.

255
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,340
Do not let his cruelty bring you down.

256
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,930
I will die happily!

257
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,350
Eunuch Park!

258
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,590
Okay, if dying is your wish, I'll grant it to you.

259
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,140
Isn't it me whom you want to kill?

260
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,650
Lady!

261
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,860
What is it that you want to know?

262
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,400
Alright, I'll tell you everything.

263
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,010
Do you wish to know the truth?

264
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,690
I will have to tell you the truth myself.

265
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,020
Whether Eun Seong is alive or not,

266
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,760
the traitors who caused an incident during the royal procession would have died.

267
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,800
The Minister of Defense took an army with him to get rid of all the traitors.

268
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,120
The people will rise up again.

269
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,110
Even if they all die,

270
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:32,560
the wishes of those who lost their lives today are not going to die.

271
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,060
You are a king who sold our land to barbarians and killed your relatives.

272
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,520
The people will not serve a king who kills his own nephew.

273
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,620
Everyone will kneel in front of me.

274
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,800
I will see them begging for me to spare their lives!

275
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,260
Everything between the sky and the earth is mine.

276
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:04,430
You are just insisting stubbornly while keeping your eyes and ears closed.

277
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,660
Your Majesty! A messenger from today's rebellion  has arrived.

278
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,770
Your Majesty, we were attacked by the rebels just before the river crossing,

279
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,260
but with the help of Minister of Defense and Chief of Palace Guards, we were able to overcome them.

280
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,270
Chief of Palace Guards is on the hunt for everyone who got away.

281
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,670
Increase the security in and out of the palace and bring me the head of the rebel leader.

282
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,150
Yes, Your Majesty!

283
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,550
You will become fearful,

284
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,400
since there are survivors.

285
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,880
There's been a rebellion.  When the Commander of the Five Guards comes with his troops, please open the gate for him.

286
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,510
My job is to secure the gates.  Tell him to look after the security outside of the palace.

287
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,470
He needs to add extra strength inside the palace.

288
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:29,150
When he arrives, I will send the message inside and wait for a royal order.

289
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,390
The king sent Prince Seung Pyeong to the queen's quarters

290
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,930
and took the lady of the Seong family to the Secret Pavilion.

291
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:41,890
Your Highness, what about my Myeong? What happens to him?

292
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,810
I have to meet with the king. The lady from the Seong family,

293
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,220
who was protecting Prince Seung Pyeong, cannot get hurt.

294
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,480
Your Highness, I will also go with you.

295
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,170
Please wait. I will bring Myeong.

296
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,970
Your Highness, you cannot leave your quarters today.

297
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,200
I need to meet the king.

298
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,750
I will send a message saying you are looking for him.

299
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,820
- I will go myself. 
 - No, Your Highness.

300
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,810
Move aside. Do you dare try to harm the mother of the king?

301
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,930
I am in a hurry, so do not block my path.

302
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,910
The king is still inside the palace. What happened?

303
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,920
- Our plan was leaked.
 - Our plan to get the king away from the palace

304
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,660
and restore the former king to the throne has failed.

305
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,390
It's time for all-out war.

306
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,780
We tried to get the king away from here to reduce military casualty.

307
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,330
I understand your desire not to kill your own blood relatives,

308
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:57,550
but we have to put our lives on the line if you want to clear a path for the future.

309
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,290
Let's go. There will not be a  failure for us.

310
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,900
What is your choice now?

311
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,080
The conspiracy has failed and all the traitors are dead.

312
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,120
Our choice was already made last night.

313
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,630
We did not have the certainty of success when we entered the palace.

314
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,990
Even if we were to fail, it was a path we had to take.

315
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,040
Did you really have to get involved in this?

316
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,350
If only you had waited quietly, even if you were caught up in the conspiracy,

317
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,730
there could've been a way for you to escape.

318
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,610
A person like you will never understand

319
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:53,400
people who would rather die with others than survive by themselves,

320
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,280
or the desire of one heart willing to die in order to keep her love alive.

321
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,760
I am the one who has succeeded!

322
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,240
History will record victories.

323
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,220
The winner in history is not determined by one generation!

324
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,500
In a day long after our days, the people will find out

325
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,480
that you were the one who killed his brother and pushed your nephew from the throne

326
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,520
and that there were those who did not give up until the end, and made no compromises!

327
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,190
Those who tried to correct the dynasty.

328
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,230
Is the path Eun Seong walks on the only right path?

329
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,570
What exactly is the love between you two anyway!

330
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,140
Walking together on the right path.

331
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,980
We don't love so that only we can eat and live well.

332
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,080
Did you think your protest to be loved by others is love?

333
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,780
When I thought Eun Seong had died

334
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,360
I thought that leaving you alone was my punishment.

335
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,730
Now I understand.

336
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,020
Killing you first and giving you as a present to Eun Seong

337
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,990
would have been the greatest pain for him!

338
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,900
Lady.

339
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,210
I wanted to kill Eun Seong

340
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,780
and keep you alive.

341
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,250
Killing you and leaving Eun Seong alive

342
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:30,320
will be the greatest punishment for both of you.

343
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,690
Stop it right now!

344
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,900
The lady is blameless. I asked her to bring Prince Seung Pyeong.

345
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,800
Did you know about it?

346
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,940
Did you know about all of it?

347
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,910
Eun Seong didn't plan your assassination.

348
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,770
So what you are saying is you knew Eun Seong was still alive?

349
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,960
While you were out with the royal procession,

350
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,570
he wanted to come to the palace and restore the former king.

351
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,320
That's a way to kill me, is it not?

352
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,370
Without the throne, is there only death for you?

353
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,790
I will take all of the blame.

354
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,290
Do not expand the deaths of the innocent

355
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,060
by brandishing your sword about.

356
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,170
I even killed my uncle with my own hands.

357
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,410
How can you be so cruel

358
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,940
to push your son into a corner?

359
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,820
Are you asking me to kill my own mother with my own hands?

360
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,200
This is Chief of Royal Investigation Agency, Do Jeong Gook.  Open the gates!

361
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,190
Please protect the palace from outside.

362
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,530
Because of the attack of the royal procession by the rebels,

363
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,790
we've been placed on the highest security order.  We must keep the gates closed.

364
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,440
Chief of Palace Guards would have issued an order.  Open the gates!

365
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,140
Unless you get an order from me, do not open the palace gates.

366
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,320
I will send someone to the king's quarters to receive a royal order.

367
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,810
Open the gates! I said it's the king's order!

368
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,040
It's the standard procedure to keep the gates closed in a state of alert. I will not move without a royal order.

369
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,150
Heaven's order is the royal order!

370
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,390
Do not open the gates.  They are traitors!

371
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,090
Open the gates!  Real traitors are inside the palace.

372
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,420
You take half of the troops.

373
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,700
You take the rest and protect the gates.

374
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,290
Chief of Palace Guards and the Minister of Defense will be coming with their men.

375
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,690
Yes, Your Highness.

376
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,770
- What happened to the former king?
 - He's been moved to the queen's quarters.

377
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,100
Chief Scholar's daughter would have brought him into the palace.

378
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,130
Grand Prince Jin Yang took the lady to the Secret Pavillion along with Eunuch Park.

379
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,800
Please go ahead.  We will take Grand Prince Jin Yang and recover the former king from the queen's pavilion.

380
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,670
I am leaving it to you.

381
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,070
Even if you are a mother, if your son is a king,

382
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,350
you cannot do things as you wish.

383
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,030
The crime of attempting to dethrone a king

384
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,650
is something I cannot forgive even if you're my mother.

385
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,950
- Please understand. 
 - Your Majesty.

386
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,840
- Take her away! 
 - Yes, Your Majesty!

387
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,340
I will take Lady from the Seong familiy with me.

388
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,660
Do you still not grasp the situation?

389
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,210
You are no longer in a position to give me orders.

390
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:53,310
She holds contempt for me and sided with the traitors in order to get rid of me.

391
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,070
Even if this woman gets sliced by this sword,

392
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,270
she cannot say anything.

393
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,400
- Your Majesty.
 - Slay me first.

394
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,560
Your Highness!

395
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,280
He even killed his own brothers. What couldn't he do to his mother?

396
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,670
First, kill your mother.

397
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,860
Say that you're sorry.

398
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,900
Say that you did wrong!

399
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,610
Why aren't you giving me the chance to become a good king?

400
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,090
It isn't your position  to take!

401
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,010
Ever since you started being greedy for that place, your life got messed up.

402
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,030
You have messed our whole royal family up!

403
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,330
Mother!

404
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:50,210
I know of your talents that could've made you a king.

405
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,520
Had you been born as the first son, everyone would've looked up to you

406
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,060
and you would've become a strong, healthy king.

407
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,360
But! The lieges and the people

408
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,200
do not treat you as a king even on the throne.

409
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,990
It's because you rose to the throne in an improper way.

410
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,600
So you were alive?

411
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,710
Since I have people to protect, I couldn't die.

412
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,160
So this is how it is going to turn out.

413
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:22,310
If I don't kill you myself, this fight will never end.

414
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:49,260
♫  Believing and believing  ♫

415
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:56,210
♫  In a life together  ♫

416
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,410
Give up, young brother.

417
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,460
You have never once won against me.

418
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,480
This time will be different

419
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,570
since you have made me stronger!

420
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,370
- Give up?
 - Give up what?

421
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,120
The throne? Or your woman?

422
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,860
You can't have either of them!

423
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:37,500
You can't slay me. You will just hesitate until the end!

424
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,160
You cannot win over me by practicing at a shooting range or learning in a hunt.

425
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,080
That is not good enough.

426
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,500
I have cut down countless enemy troops in actual battles.

427
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,010
You cannot stop my bloody sword!

428
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,110
Stop!

429
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:29,510
♫   Believing and believing  ♫

430
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:36,580
♫  In a life together  ♫

431
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,550
Take him to the Secret Pavilion.

432
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,370
♫  Living and living  ♫

433
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:51,830
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

434
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,570
Your Highness, you must escape. It's a rebellion.

435
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,470
What about the king?

436
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,860
Grand Prince Eun Seong is alive.

437
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,450
He is fighting with the king as we speak!

438
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,040
Come here. You need to be with your aunt.

439
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,340
Come here!

440
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,820
Just kill me.

441
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,100
I never wanted to hurt you

442
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,080
not even for a moment.

443
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,290
Repay your sins by living. That is your punishment.

444
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,870
Aren't you trying to be the king now?

445
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,460
Do you believe everyone's living like you?

446
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,780
To wriggle when being stepped on.

447
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,730
To have a desire to rise up when being looked down on.

448
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,150
To have greed towards what you want.  These are what make someone a person!

449
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,530
I have tried to understand you.

450
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,020
I thought about it again and again.

451
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:40,590
It's normal to have a grudge when hurt and become ambitious when humiliated, but still.

452
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,490
A person makes their own choices in the end.

453
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,680
When Yeon Hee died at a young age—!

454
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,950
That was an accident!

455
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,990
You should have acknowledged your wrongdoing and begged for forgiveness!

456
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,360
When Uncle was encouraging improper behavior by your side,

457
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,230
you should have stayed away from him and protected your family!

458
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,920
When our dying older brother trusted you with the young crown prince,

459
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,960
you should've paid great, genuine attention to his will!

460
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,040
Even if you coveted your brother's lover, you should've restrained yourself and suppressed it!

461
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,630
That's what it means to be a human.

462
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,990
Do you not have desires inside of you?

463
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,680
Is there nothing dirty inside of you?

464
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,960
I can see everything clearly.

465
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,310
I can see your true self underneath all of your hypocrisy and your act.

466
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,340
You are right.

467
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,760
I have envy and jealousy inside me.

468
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,770
I am fearful of people finding out about the many ugly sides of me.

469
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,010
But I am trying hard to suppress it.

470
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,120
I hide it because I am human.

471
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,680
Does it disappear just because you suppress it?

472
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,620
Does it disappear just because you try to cover it up?

473
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,900
If you got everything you wanted

474
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,810
do you think you'd have become a different person?

475
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,390
There was a time when I was tricked by your sophistry.

476
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:55,610
I also wrongly had sympathy for you.

477
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,080
Your life! Your place!

478
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,110
You alone made it come to this.

479
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,550
Arrest all servants and officers who worked under my brother

480
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,420
and replace them all with our own people.

481
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,940
The Minister of Defense will be here shortly.

482
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,900
Yes, Grand Prince.

483
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,390
Have you prepared the declaration you will announce to the ministers?

484
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,060
Please go to the queen's quarters and protect the former king.

485
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,860
I will give you military escort.

486
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,930
I understand.

487
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,830
Please send the Commander of the Five Guards at the queen's quarters to the palace gate.

488
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:56,960
What about the others?  Where is Roo Si Gae?

489
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,360
Please stay with Queen Mother.

490
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,460
As soon as things are under control I will come there.

491
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,990
You are to go to the palace gates.

492
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,170
I will take the former king to Queen's Mother's quarters.

493
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,170
I understand.

494
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,050
I'm Chief of Palace Guards, open the gates.

495
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,540
We're under the royal order to keep the gates closed due to a rebellion.

496
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,170
We are here after suppressing the rebellion.

497
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,240
We have to go inside and protect the king.  Open the gates.

498
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,430
Once the gates have been ordered closed, no one can go inside.

499
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,690
Go and get another royal order.

500
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,270
I am the Minister of Defence and the brother-in-law of the king.

501
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,210
I want to go inside with the Chief of Palace Guards.

502
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,710
What is the reason for you not opening the gate?

503
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:26,920
What happened to the palace guards? Why are the gates being guarded by the military officers?

504
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,500
Are you not the rebels?

505
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,560
Open the military storage room and bring out the equipment.

506
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,210
What do you mean military equipment?

507
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,130
Are you going to attack the palace or something?

508
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,710
The rebels got into the palace.

509
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:09,930
Even if we have to demolish the gate, we have to protect the king.

510
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,540
Hurry and go!

511
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,130
Yes, sir!

512
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,170
With what authority would you open the military storage?

513
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,850
You move one step and we will slay you all.

514
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,450
Grandmama!

515
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:43,310
Your Majesty!

516
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,870
Please give back my grandson.

517
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,910
The king gave me the responsibility of protecting Prince Seung Pyeong.

518
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,750
The era of Grand Prince Jin Yang is over.

519
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,940
You think this is your time now that Grand Prince Eun Seong has come back alive?

520
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,720
The world has changed.

521
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,690
The throne has been restored to the former king. You will have to vacate the queen's quarters.

522
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:10,150
Where is the king? My king?

523
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,930
Are you finally ruining the path of the king?

524
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:22,540
Your and Grand Prince Jin Yang's greed has brought about your ruin.

525
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,580
Until we decide on the punishment for the king,

526
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,700
you are under house arrest in the queen's quarters.

527
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,590
Queen Mother, you cannot do this to the king and me.

528
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,160
Do you get it now?

529
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,170
The queen's quarters you've loved so much for so long is now your jail.

530
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,190
Grand Prince Eun Seong.

531
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,270
How in the world.

532
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,740
I've come back to the palace with the former king.

533
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:45,720
All of you listen to the declaration  from the queen dowager.

534
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,260
I hearby declare

535
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,860
Grand Prince Jin Yang, Lee Kang, has been revealed to have risen to the throne by entering into a traitorous agreement with the Orangkae (derogatory term for the Jurchens) tribe,

536
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,450
the former king, Lee Myung will be restored to the throne.

537
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:08,250
All ministers should attend the court and restate your loyalty to the restored king.

538
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:13,050
Anyone who sides with Grand Prince Jin Yang will be labeled a traitor and will be ruined for three generations

539
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,510
and punished in the harshest manner possible.

540
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,090
Who are you calling traitors?

541
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,220
That Grand Prince Eun Seong is

542
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,350
the traitor!

543
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,620
Y-Your Excellency.

544
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,860
This is something that has come about with reason at the queen dowager's quarters.

545
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,790
We will be receiving an envoy from China.

546
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,190
We have to stabilize the throne as soon as possible

547
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,760
and show the power of unity to them.

548
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:08,930
That Chief Royal Secretary...

549
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:22,300
You sly bastards, who lived a high life under the shadow of our king.

550
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,620
Will you side with traitors overnight?

551
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,790
Who's the traitor?

552
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,000
As someone who wrote the traitorous declaration, caused a rebellion and destabilized the country,

553
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,460
and entrapped innocent people,

554
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:39,010
are you still so shameless?

555
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,130
Roo Si Gae!

556
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,260
Don't touch her. She is my person!

557
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,590
I understand your obedience but this is not loyalty.

558
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:19,500
The king has already been adjudged by history and dethroned.

559
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,990
He's been confined and is awaiting punishment.

560
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:27,320
Bring the king here, if you don't want to see her die.

561
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,000
Put away the sword now!

562
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,580
Let go of Roo Si Gae.

563
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,800
Bring the king here!

564
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:02,030
- Get them!  
- Slay them!

565
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:17,150
Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae!

566
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,890
Roo Si Gae.

567
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,110
Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae!

568
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:30,420
♫  In a life together  ♫

569
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:37,340
♫  Living and living  ♫

570
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:43,500
Roo Si Gae. Roo Si Gae! 
♫  In eternal darkness  ♫

571
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:52,700

572
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:05,120
 Grand Prince

573
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,450
 Your Majesty, right now, you have to protect your life.

574
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,130
 Even if I die, win or lose, I have to finish it in the palace.

575
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,170
 We got the Minister of Defense but lost the queen.

576
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,090
 You must have been upset with me about a lot of things.

577
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,480
 I will pay you back one by one.

578
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,140
 Did something happen to Hyungnim?

579
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,750
 He is waiting for you at the main hall.

580
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,780
 He escaped from the Secret Pavilion?

581
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,880
 He's looking for blood in the end.

582
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,290
 Step down from the throne.

583
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,600
 It is no longer your place to be.

584
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,260
 But you know that already.  A brother like me...

585
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,060
 Grand Prince
