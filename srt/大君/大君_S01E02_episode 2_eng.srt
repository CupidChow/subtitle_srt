1
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,970
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,210

Hwi is not coming back.

3
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,420
  He is dead.

4
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
  You should accept it.

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,920
 I don't want to be anyone's bride.

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,480
  Do you dislike Weol Yeong that much?

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,270
 If you really feel that way, just come to me.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,090
 I'll accept you even now.

9
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,890
  Queen Dowager?

10
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,700
  Your Highness!

11
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,200
  Hwi

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,100
  Before an extreme event occurs,

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,200
  we need to get the king's will.

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,330
  If something bad were to happen to His Majesty tonight,

15
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,110
  will you be able to handle the consequences in the future?

16
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,510
  Move aside!

17
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,010
  Your Majesty!

18
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,590
 Who in the world will receive his last will and testament?

19
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,190
  I received the will.

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,690
 Until the crown prince comes of age,

21
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,940
  Queen Mother will act as regent

22
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,130
 and the grand princes will pledge their loyalty to the crown prince.

23
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,160
  Please return to us, King!

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,690
 Since you have returned at the unfortunate time of a royal death,

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,320
 I cannot reveal my happiness for your return in the midst of the sadness of  king's death.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,380
 But it'd be best not to see a woman who will marry another man.

27
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,890
  I'm talking about Lady Ja Hyeon.

28
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,830
  Where are you going?

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,540
  Where is His Excellency? What about the lady?

30
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,390
  May I ask who you are?

31
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,540
 The grand prince has come.

32
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,670
  He's alive.

33
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,830
  He's come to see you.

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,360
  Lady! Lady Ja Hyeon!

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,650
  Lady Ja Hyeon!

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,460
Yeon, have you been well?

37
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,340
I still am curious whether you are a child or have grown up.

38
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,850
I can no longer picture your face very well.

39
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,340
I think one day, you will definitely hit your target.

40
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,930
My brother, what were you thinking that hard about?

41
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,560
You didn't even notice when someone came.

42
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,750
Were you floating a flower on the pond like a girl?

43
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,510
Why? Is there something to see?

44
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,950
Be frugal with your arrows. It's hard enough for the people who make them.

45
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,310
- Let's go out together today. 
 - I don't like hunting.

46
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,600
There will be an uproar if I miss the morning meeting.

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,480
You can just say Uncle called you.

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,470
Neither Queen Mother nor His Majesty

49
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,850
can say anything to Uncle.

50
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,510
Gosh.

51
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,370
 Episode 2

52
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,020
Lady.

53
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,510
Lady?

54
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,920
Lady, please wake up. We're here now!

55
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,200
Lady!

56
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,050
Oh, we're here?

57
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,970
Ow, that hurt!

58
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,140
Lower your shoulders and straighten your back.

59
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,940
Walk as if you have eggs beneath your feet.  Softly, softly.

60
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,620
Don't drag your feet.

61
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,090
You shouldn't walk too fast either.

62
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,340
Perfect. You pass.

63
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,280
Lower your chin.

64
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,030
Are you really Lady Ja Hyeon?

65
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,610
Not a careless servant sent in your stead?

66
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,640
That's why you should have left me out from the start.

67
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,090
A queen, a noblewoman, or whatever,

68
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,340
you can just teach people who want to become one of those.

69
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,350
Why don't you follow Lady Na Gyeom?

70
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,290
She is already engaged but working hard still.

71
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,400
You have to work much harder since you haven't even made the list yet.

72
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,160
It matters not since I have no intention of getting married.

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,420
Don't be coy.

74
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,950
Then why do you keep showing up to these bride-to-be classes?

75
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,440
If you really don't plan on getting married, you shouldn't come at all.

76
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,460
I'm doing it because my family would beat me to death if I didn't.

77
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,240
That's just an excuse. Be honest.

78
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,850
You're just not confident, right?

79
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,890
Now what? Since you, who want it badly, and I, who don't care,

80
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,110
both didn't pass.

81
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,100
Ma'am, what about the next lesson?

82
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,590
Everyone, get to your seats.

83
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,140
Next, I'll be observing sitting postures and bows.

84
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,560
Lady Ja Hyeon, where are you going?

85
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,140
Please come back, Lady!

86
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,260
I need to use the restroom. Please continue. I'll be right back!

87
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,220
Kkeut Dan! Kkeut Dan!

88
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,200
Hurry, hurry!

89
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,480
No! You're going to skip today?

90
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,110
If your parents find out, I'm dead!

91
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,580
It's fine. I already stamped for attendance.

92
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,690
Lady!

93
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,530
It should be in today, right?

94
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,100
Of course.

95
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,630
Welcome!

96
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,460
It came in today, right?

97
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,060
My Lady, how many times must I tell you?

98
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,680
Everything blue has been sent to the palace.

99
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,110
Therefore, it is impossible to get any of it here.

100
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,690
Are you color blind?

101
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,050
There! Is this not blue but red?

102
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,000
This one already has an owner.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,340
What about me who's waited months for it?

104
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,100
I must take this one.

105
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,230
But this is not yours to have!

106
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,910
Even if you pay me more, you still can't take it!

107
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,140
Why are you doing this?

108
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,300
- Why are you like this?
 - Let go!

109
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,290
- Let go. 
 - Ah, what's with you?

110
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,630
What's wrong with you?

111
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,940
Oh no, what do we do now?!

112
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,180
This is the deep blue powder pigment that costs over 100 yang!

113
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,790
A hundred yang?

114
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,930
This is that precious?

115
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,620
It's used with special care even in  the palace!

116
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,540
Repay me for this right now!

117
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,330
Are you saying I have to pay you 100 yang?

118
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,210
Are you going to take your hands off after ruining my business?

119
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,830
What do we do, Lady? Your mother doesn't even know we're here.

120
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,590
If you don't have the money, then you can pay with your maidservant.

121
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,720
No!

122
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,490
- What are you doing? 
 - Are you crazy?

123
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,500
You look just fine butâ€”

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,860
Oh, Young Master, you've come at just the right time!

125
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,120
Now, this is the person who ordered it!

126
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,540
This came from abroad.

127
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,560
You know it well. Joseon doesn't trade this deep blue powder pigment.

128
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,730
It's all from overseas.

129
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,690
That's why it's the price of gold.

130
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,680
Come.

131
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,250
What color is it?

132
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,040
What color is my tongue?

133
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,140
It's black.

134
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,040
Is this what you will deliver to the arts office?

135
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,750
Yes! As you know, it's not sold on the market.

136
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,960
I saved one especially for you, Young Master.

137
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,450
But this customer just went and spilled it all over!

138
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,340
One yang.

139
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,670
Just one yang is enough as compensation for it.

140
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,320
It's not one yang but a hundred yang.

141
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,650
If this was really the deep blue powder pigment, giving 100 yang would be right.

142
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,770
This is just blue that was mixed with burned soot from a pine tree. It's fake.

143
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,850
Even one yang is a waste.

144
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,590
Fake? What do you mean fake?

145
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,060
How dare you sell fake pigments in this country?

146
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,540
No matter how ignorant the customers are, how dare you try to swindle them?

147
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,910
I-Ignorant?

148
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,050
Do you need to be dragged into the police bureau before you get a hold of yourself?

149
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,640
Save me, Young Master! I didn't do it on purpose.

150
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,230
Getting deep blue powder pigment is near impossible these days.

151
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,170
All along, I've been selling with conscience

152
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,550
and only dealing with genuine items.

153
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,470
- Terminate our deal.
 - Yes, Young Master.

154
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,650
Inform the arts office and ask them to change the supplier.

155
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,990
Understood.

156
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,420
Ha! You...

157
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,010
There you go.

158
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,430
Aigoo!

159
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,420
Excuse me.

160
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,350
Thank you. If it weren't for you, we would have blindly paid 100 yang.

161
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,050
For someone who paints, how can you not be sharp about colors?

162
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,410
I only got upset because he did something mischievous with colors, which you cannot and should not play tricks with.

163
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,690
You don't have to be thankful to me.

164
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,820
But, how did you know I painted?

165
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,550
Your hand, which holds a brush.

166
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,420
How can I not know when the scent of plum blossoms pigment is this strong?

167
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,050
But, you should apologize.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,160
How dare you touch a woman's skirt?

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,050
This is inexcusable disrespect.

170
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,110
You should be relieved and thank me for not giving you a slap.

171
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,030
Since I declined the thanks from you,

172
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,490
why don't you let go of the apology you feel I owe you?

173
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,460
Between you and me, let's forget what happened today.

174
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,060
You're not only rude but also shameless.

175
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,880
What makes you think you can speak informally to me? How old are you?

176
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,620
Who told you to speak informally to a lady from a noble family, just because she's a woman?

177
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,190
Miss, I don't know who you are, but you shouldn't do this. This person isâ€”

178
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,200
I see that you look like a lady from a noble family,

179
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,140
but you don't seem like a well behaved young lady.

180
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,310
You don't seem like a respectable gentleman, either.

181
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,280
Then why don't you speak informally, too?

182
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,820
You already are. I'll give you permission to.

183
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,260
I don't know who you are or where you're from,

184
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,160
but you will have to pay for your rude behavior today.

185
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,750
- You're curious about who I am? 
 - Young Master.

186
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,480
I am...

187
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,870
Lee who lives in  Gwanggwang District.

188
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,930
If you have anything to say, come find me anytime.

189
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,920
Please don't forget.

190
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,320
My face, my name.

191
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,810
He has a gentle face but his temper is not at all appealing.

192
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,210
This is why I don't want to get married.

193
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,520
All eight provinces of Joseon are filled with men just like him!

194
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,610
You're not so different, Lady.

195
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,090
What?

196
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,350
But, do you smell color pigments from me?

197
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm not really sure.

198
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,460
But, this, agh!

199
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,470
Are the girls from middle-class families all like that?

200
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,670
I don't know.

201
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,010
I've never met a girl from a middle-class family.

202
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,180
I was being kind and helpful, but I was taken as some pervert.

203
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,000
Wasn't that an insult?

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,560
Given what happened earlier, I might understand her reaction.

205
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,490
Na Gyeom, you rushed for no reason.

206
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,980
If you'd waited a bit, not just a wife of the second prince,

207
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,550
but you could've been a queen.

208
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,390
When you got that position stepping over your own older sister,

209
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,420
wouldn't it have been better if you were to become a queen?

210
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,600
The order to select the queen will come down right away.

211
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,090
If you want that position, you should go for it yourself.

212
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,850
I don't want to be the second wife.

213
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,280
Even if you'd become the king's wife?

214
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,920
There are rumors that the king is weak, you know.

215
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,990
Isn't it true that everybody has known about this since he was a prince?

216
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,150
But, you're saying I should covet such a position?

217
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,300
I just feel that your situation and mine are different.

218
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,260
I just want a cool man, but you...

219
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,010
It's not the same for you, right?

220
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,370
I'm also not interested in the king.

221
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,550
You're satisfied with the grand prince?

222
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,730
For men, their future is more important than their current standing.

223
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,330
So you want to rely on the grand prince's potential.

224
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,720
Are you able to ascertain the grand prince's health and physical well-being?

225
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,260
According to the rumor, he can catch tigers with his bare hands.

226
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,430
But who knows? Rumors are often exaggerated.

227
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,180
You've already looked into his background?

228
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,910
Yes!

229
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh! There it is!

230
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,460
You've improved greatly, my nephew.

231
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,640
I guess no one can beat you in archery.

232
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,790
You want to appoint the king's younger brother, who's not a crown prince, as the heir?

233
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,610
What do you mean by such nonsense?

234
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,540
His Majesty is still very young.

235
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,090
The state funeral has ended so it's now proper to bring in a queen forthwith! 
   Left State Minister Kim Chu

236
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,200
She can produce an heir and then all will be taken care of!

237
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,980
Although the king has only been on the throne for three years,

238
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,630
he's had the position of the crown prince for 20 years.

239
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,690
It's been many years since he got married, and yet he doesn't have an offspring.

240
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,600
And now, even the queen's seat is vacant. We need to at least appoint a younger brother as the heir

241
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,930
to strengthen the throne, which is our job.
   Right State Minister Park Bu Gyeong

242
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,900
Don't you know that your words could be considered treason, Right State Minister?
   Chief Royal Secretary Sim Jeong

243
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,140
How can you not know the important difference?

244
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,010
It's not loyalty to say only the easy things.

245
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,260
To the north, there have been ceaseless invasions from Mongolians.   
 Minister of Finance, Jeong Yeon

246
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,620
To the south, the Japanese are pirating endlessly.

247
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,220
In this unstable political state, it is right that we secure the strong foundation for the throne first.

248
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,430
What impudence are you spouting?! 
  Minister of General Affairs Do Yeon Soo

249
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,860
All events have their processes.

250
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,350
Deciding the next heir is important,

251
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,980
but right now it is important to fill the empty seat of the queen.

252
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,220
Do not quarrel.

253
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,990
Left and Right State Ministers are suggesting different paths to follow,

254
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,720
but I see that they are both loyal servants of the state.

255
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,860
However, it hasn't been long since the state funeral.

256
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,500
I will decide what comes first after I discuss it with my mother.

257
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
Please be advised accordingly.

258
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,850
Your Majesty,

259
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,370
your filial duty to His Late Majesty is most admirable,

260
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,120
but the royal wedding is not a personal affair.

261
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,740
It is something that will determine the national foundation.

262
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,530
Time is of the essence.   You must find the mother of the nation in hasteâ€”

263
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,830
I know what you mean very well, Left State Minister.

264
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,360
I will discuss this with my mother.

265
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,650
Left State Minister is doing a yeoman's work to make his daughter the next queen.

266
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,450
It will not go as he wishes.

267
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,530
Do you think the sick concubine who had to leave the palace will be able to do anything?

268
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,250
In any case, the queen dowager

269
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,710
is trembling at the thought of her daughter-in-law being ill.

270
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,490
Whether we order the selection of the queen or let one of the royal consorts serve him,

271
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,700
we must conclude the installation of the younger brother as the heir beforehand.

272
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,870
Is Royal Consort Hyo Bin feeling better?

273
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,660
Yes. She is almost fully recovered.

274
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,500
That's a relief.

275
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,340
Royal Concubine Hyo Bin should return as soon as possible and take care of His Majesty.

276
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,000
That's what I'm saying.

277
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,290
Even if she is recovering, we need to take utmost caution.

278
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,650
Please tell Queen Dowager not to worry too much.

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,810
  Queen Dowager Shim

281
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,410
How did it go at the residence?

282
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,530
We are doing our best to protect the royal line.

283
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,330
The future of our nation is in your hands.

284
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,830
Bring her in secrecy before she shows any signs of pregnancy.

285
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,260
The State Funeral has barely ended.

286
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,390
You couldn't restrain yourself from leaving the palace?

287
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,150
  Grand Prince Eun Seong: Lee Hwi

288
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,220
I had something I needed to acquire.

289
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,830
You are not a palace painter but this country's grand prince!

290
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,800
It's something that could have been handled by your subordinates.

291
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,630
What are you doing missing lectures at Jonghak? 
  (Jonghak - agency responsible for educating royalty)

292
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,990
Looks delicious!

293
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,960
Ah.

294
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,280
Eat lots.

295
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm sure you didn't even get to see any meat since you were in mourning.
  Grand Prince Yang Ahn

296
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,500
At the palace today, I'm sure they fervently discussed the installation of the king's younger brother as the heir.

297
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,720
The state funeral has ended, so they need to slowly start pressuring them.

298
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,400
In the Yoon family, there is no father. How can that help us?

299
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,260
My would-be in-law's family is poor and inferior.

300
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,250
It was a marriage arranged by the late king. What can you do about it?

301
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,260
Accept it and you can pave a way to strengthen your in-law's family.

302
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,370
Jajun, their son, is my house guest.

303
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,480
To you, he'll be your older brother-in-law.

304
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,430
Without any royal offspring, the next one in line for the crown is you.

305
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,660
There's no need for you to be anxious.

306
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,670
For now, take a break from using your bow and arrow,

307
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,770
and start practicing riding your horse more. A polo competition will start soon.

308
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,820
The late king died, and even the queen died.

309
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,610
With continual funerals, the entire country is in mourning.

310
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,790
I've petitioned the king to have a polo tournament in order to boost the public's mood.

311
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,460
Here.

312
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,380
You should build a team made of your friends.

313
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,290
What are you doing?

314
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,280
How dare you kill at a holy place where the Buddha resides?

315
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,110
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

316
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,370
One is the king's uncle, and the other is the king's brother.

317
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,980
What would we be afraid of?

318
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,140
That, that, that! Even though you are related to the king,

319
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,260
how can you commit such an evil act in the presence of Buddha?

320
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,840
Get out right now!

321
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,320
Mr. Monk. You should have some of this meat.

322
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,980
You Yaksha-like creatures,

323
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,070
I'll get rid of you all!

324
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,220
Calm down.

325
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,520
Hey, the people to kick out is over there! Not me, you guys!

326
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,490
I'm not the one!

327
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,760
You! Let me go!

328
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,820
Hit harder!

329
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,680
You still don't know how poorly you served the grand prince?

330
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,040
Your Highness, Your Highness!

331
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,540
What are you doing? Move away!

332
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,480
Gi Teuk did nothing wrong.

333
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,460
Don't you know that a royalty's subordinates pay for the misdeeds of their masters?

334
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,890
That is not right.  I'm the one who's done wrong.

335
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,000
Why are you punishing Gi Teuk for my wrongdoing?

336
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,740
Why do you keep missing your lectures?

337
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,790
You know that His Majesty personally keeps track of attendance in accordance with the late king's will.

338
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:27,020
If I study hard, they suspect me of having sneaky plans on my mind.

339
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,580
If I don't read, they laugh at me for being a disgrace to the royal family.

340
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,770
Exactly to what beat must grand princes dance?

341
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,740
When His Majesty was the crown prince, I got beat for wanting to try on the gonryongpo (king's attire) for its beautiful red tint.

342
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,350
What would a little child have known for doing so?

343
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,050
What other desires must he have had?

344
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,150
The adults... The world distorts and twists things around.

345
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,210
Because of His Majesty's ill health,

346
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,410
you are pretending not to know all the pressures laid upon us grand princes.

347
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,460
We've made a mess out of this place and we can't just go without giving a donation.

348
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,790
If it helps to reduce Chief Monk's anger towards me,

349
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,610
I could build a place where monks reside.

350
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,340
We can't stop rumors from spreading.

351
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,190
That's what Uncle wants.

352
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,740
You have a tiger ready?

353
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,270
The military men waited about 15 days and got one.

354
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,430
After the wedding ends, you have to live outside of the palace even if you don't want to.

355
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:13,730
Since the royal family has a lot going on, you should stay quietly with your older brother.

356
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,070
Do you understand?

357
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,770
To fill the vacant queen's place, will there be a selection process announced?

358
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:31,930
Actually, among the King's consorts, there is someone who's pregnant with his heir.

359
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,430
Who is it? Why don't you let it be known?

360
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,930
It is Royal Consort Hyo Bin but since it happened during the royal mourning,

361
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,690
His Majesty was embarrassed, so he did not let others know.

362
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,980
After the tragedy of the queen dying while giving birth to a child,

363
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,540
he was afraid of repeating the past,

364
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,500
so he's moved her to a separate residence to rest.

365
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,490
Congratulations, Mother.

366
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,630
All of this must be kept a secret.

367
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,380
Not yet... I can't put my heart at ease yet.

368
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,610
So, I intend to delay the King's marriage.

369
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,620
Instead I'm planning a wedding for your older brother Jin Yang first.

370
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:20,050
Then... Please let me choose my own wife.

371
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,080
We can't make personal decisions on the royal marriages.

372
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,720
It is the grand prince's fate to not participate in political affairs or go out into the world and do things.

373
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,850
So, please let me at least choose the person I love.

374
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,510
- Y-You came?
 - What are you doing in my room?

375
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,720
- Your daughter has arrived. 
 - We had a good time.

376
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,140
What in the world are you doing?

377
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,490
What do you mean what are we doing? We were just talking and visiting.

378
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,540
Why are you doing it here when there's a main building?

379
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,090
What do you mean why? I'm doing this behind the men in his house!

380
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,260
Don't do that. Just sit down. Sit down.

381
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,050
We're not done yet!

382
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,210
My daughter is okay. Don't worry, don't worry.

383
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,520
It's time for Father to come back from the palace.

384
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,880
Let's meet next time.  Next time.

385
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,050
You should finish this round and leave! Are you leaving like this when I'm winning?

386
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,670
Please wear some clothes!

387
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,590
Is today your mom's club meeting day?

388
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,490
I'm not sure.

389
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,420
Why did you come home so early? Did you finish the bride-to-be class?

390
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,910
Why are your clothes like that?

391
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,230
I don't think you should be scolding me about my clothes.

392
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,310
Oh my gosh!

393
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,560
Get out, Your Excellency! Don't you see I am undressed?

394
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,100
  (Card from the gambling game, tujeon.)

395
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,420
Let me see!

396
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,250
Move!

397
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,670
Aish!

398
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,380
Again!

399
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,440
No, I wasn't going to play myself.

400
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,120
But Lady Song said we should play just one round.

401
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,270
Tsk, wow.

402
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,040
I said not to play the gambling game in the main room and now you hide in your daughter's room to play?

403
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,020
It's better than drinking!

404
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,540
Have I lost our house or had our land confiscated?

405
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,960
Betting with Yakgwa (sweet snacks) and pancakes.

406
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm just playing around with food. Is it something that I need to be ashamed about?

407
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
Mother!

408
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Ha, really.  I mean...

409
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,730
When our daughter looks like this, you think you are done with just sending her to the bride-to-be class?

410
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,340
Do you even have a mind to get your daughter wed?

411
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,720
Well. If it's her fate, then she'll go.

412
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,710
This! Seriously...

413
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,190
Even a tiger?

414
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,430
Even professional hunters will be jealous.

415
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,280
It's just that I was lucky.

416
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,010
You mean you caught all these today?

417
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,350
Youâ€™ve grown feeble during the mourning period.

418
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,330
I roamed across the mountains all day, looking for things that could nurse you back to health.

419
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,960
This is too much.

420
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,290
Divide them up and offer some to Queen Mother.

421
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,960
Why doesn't Your Majesty personally offer it to her?

422
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,100
She would be happy.

423
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,040
What is this?

424
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,410
So you gave him everything and thereâ€™s nothing left for me?

425
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,170
Then come late like I do, or don't come at all.

426
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:45,210
Your unfortunate sense of timing is what always gets you in trouble.

427
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,020
I got it from the pharmacy. I heard you took the lash for defending a subordinate.

428
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,460
I was just hit once. It's not to the point where I need medicine.

429
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,220
But still, I'll accept it.

430
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,290
- Aren't you scared? 
 - About what?

431
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,300
Being wed to a lady whom you have not seen?

432
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,330
What does it matter, with whom I marry?

433
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,990
Our father arranged for my lackluster in-laws,

434
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,370
so that the grand prince may have little basis for power.

435
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,710
I will just accept it as his deep affection for me.

436
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,660
Who will my brother marry?

437
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,730
I told Queen Mother

438
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,000
I want to be able to choose my own bride.

439
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,490
I see you have someone you like.

440
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,400
Tell me. From whose household?

441
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,380
Or is she a lady inside the palace?

442
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,680
No, there's no one yet.

443
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,480
If I can't find anyone I'd rather live alone.

444
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,140
Even if I go outside, the women are...

445
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,780
So you did meet someone for sure.

446
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,720
That's not it.

447
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,700
You can't lie to me.

448
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,730
Tell me everything.

449
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,250
I'm telling you it's nothing.

450
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,850
Isn't it better for her to return to the palace after she gives birth?

451
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,400
This is a royal heir.

452
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,500
There was an order from Queen Dowager to deliver the baby in the palace.

453
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,950
Can you take responsibility for her safety?

454
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,980
We'll be returning to the palace in secret.

455
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,650
I've also prepared a delivery room secretly.

456
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,830
Until her safe delivery,

457
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,900
with the exception of His Majesty and the queen dowager,

458
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,250
I will make sure that no one knows of it.

459
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,190
Please do not worry.

460
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,010
Let's go.

461
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,250
Your brother as the crown prince? How dare they?

462
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,640
I have been long without an heir.

463
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,940
It is possible from their viewpoint that they'd be worried.

464
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,150
Royal Consort Hyo Bin must produce a prince and

465
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,040
silence those who dared to scorn the Royal Family.

466
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,400
If she safely gives birth,

467
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,550
do you plan to make her the queen?

468
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,770
If it is a prince, then of course, we shall.

469
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:29,010
If we are to stop the installation of the king's brother as crown prince,

470
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,540
you need to keep Jin Yang from associating with your uncle.

471
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,810
Uncle has taken care of that child ever since he lived in the separate residence.

472
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,810
It's not something that will be taken care of easily.

473
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,570
You have to be aware.

474
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,360
Iâ€™m suspicious of your uncle who only has eye for Jin Yang among all grand princes.

475
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,750
He must be behind the request to appoint

476
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,810
your brother as the crown prince.

477
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,170
Obviously, he wants to enjoy the glory he wasnâ€™t allowed during your fatherâ€™s reign behind his nephewâ€™s back.

478
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,820
Even if Uncle has ill intentions,

479
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,670
it will be fine if my brother isnâ€™t swayed.

480
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,120
He is a greedy child.

481
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,510
He's different from Eun Seong.

482
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,830
Is it empty?

483
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,890
The servants are tired from carrying it, so I thought Iâ€™d just walk from here.

484
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,540
Go ahead.

485
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,630
 Hyo Bin (of the family) Kim 
(royal consort)

486
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,740
Don't ask me to put it on.

487
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,720
What was she going to paint that she needed Sim Jung Cheon (deep blue pigment)?

488
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,230
  What about me who waited months for this?

489
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,160
 But how did you know that I painted?

490
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,110
Useless.

491
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,070
â™«   If I just keep walking like this   â™«

492
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,860
â™«   endlessly,   â™«

493
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:27,530
â™«   It feels like I'll be able to see you   â™«

494
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,040
â™«   So I keep walking   â™«

495
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,150
â™«    till shadows disappear, one, two, three,    â™«

496
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:42,480
â™«   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   â™«

497
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,980
â™«   The weaning   â™«

498
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,650
â™«   and filling up,    â™«

499
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,460
â™«   how much more do I have to watch it to know?   â™«

500
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,600
â™«   I donâ€™t think I can do it anymore  â™«

501
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,090
â™«    No matter what I blame   â™«

502
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:13,420
â™«   But wherever I look, itâ€™s only painful roads for me   â™«

503
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,190
â™«   The places I want to go to â™«

504
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,920
â™«   The places I need to go to   â™«

505
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:28,340
â™«   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   â™«

506
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,120
â™«   I just wanna follow this path   â™«

507
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,190
â™«   to a place nobody knows   â™«

508
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:43,340
â™«   When I get there, will I call out only then?   â™«

509
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,550
â™«   That it's you   â™«

510
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:53,520
Do you really have to let everyone know that you paint with your whole body?

511
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,470
Both His Excellency and Young Master

512
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,800
would finish quietly without a single drop of ink when they write or draw.

513
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,890
That is all showing off.

514
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,630
Caring how they would look while drawing more than the art itself. That's showing off, you know.

515
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,380
I don't think so.

516
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,070
Then, you try to draw and see if you can do it without splashing any paint on yourself.

517
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,070
After concentrating,

518
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,160
you just forget about your own existence.

519
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,900
That seems more like a showing off.

520
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,690
Everything is good about you, Kkeut Dan, but you really don't know art.

521
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,100
If I know it, then what? Will I get food or rice?

522
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,700
In that time, it's better to dig out

523
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,490
another root of greens and one more mushroom.

524
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,150
You always do this. How many times

525
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,840
do I have to tell you just give any failed work to me?

526
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,900
I want to draw it alive.

527
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,760
It is alive, not dead.

528
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,300
Not that.

529
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,290
Something that's moving. Something vibrant.

530
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,760
Chick, butterfly, puppy. You drew them a lot.

531
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,170
This big and aggressive.

532
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:04,690
Animals like a tiger, ox, and horse.

533
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,140
You have a really big dream.

534
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,200
Do you know what the flower garden exam was in the Song Dynasty?

535
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,140
I don't even want to know.

536
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,570
The scent of horseshoes that ran over flowers.

537
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,040
My ass...

538
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,520
Everyone who drew flowers and horses failed.

539
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,210
Why is that? Didn't they want the artwork with horses?

540
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,300
Those who won the award

541
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,720
drew a group of butterflies flying along

542
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,090
the dusty wind.

543
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,580
They didn't know how to draw a horse, right?

544
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,900
That's not it.

545
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,960
Anyway, if I need to activate that kind of high dimensional creativity,

546
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,940
I need to know how to draw realistic things.

547
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,520
Let's go. Let's go to the stable.

548
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,490
Is that a horse? It's a mule...

549
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,350
Horses are not the same, you say?

550
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,190
There is a chance.

551
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,800
Your brother is going to enter the polo competition.

552
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,840
You should just say you are going there to support him and instead, look at the horses as much as you want.

553
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,000
There are no better horses than the ones that play polo, right?

554
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,900
I told you not to do that!

555
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,600
I like to do it with a man.

556
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,170
If you weren't here, what would I do?

557
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,690
I met you thanks to the heaven's fate.

558
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,110
Yes, yes. I don't even have luck with an owner.

559
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,700
Should I do it again? Again?

560
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,390
Go!

561
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,070
I thought he was only good at literature,

562
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,320
but he's pretty good at horseback riding.

563
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,890
But still, we have you. You are the best at martial arts.

564
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,920
Still, we'd need an alternative plan.

565
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,430
Sorry?

566
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,840
Here you go.

567
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,240
Enjoy.

568
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,290
Here's yeot (Korean hard taffy)! Get some yeot!

569
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:30,070
Here's yeot! Get some yeot!

570
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,220
- What are you doing? 
- What do you mean? I'm going to go watch too.

571
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,210
Ja Hyeon, you stay home.

572
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,680
That's right. It's not a place for an unmarried woman to go.

573
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,350
What are you saying?

574
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,660
It's the new nation that doesn't allow it. In Mother's time, women would play it, too.

575
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,140
Just watching can be...

576
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,730
You got cut from the classes on how to be a bride.

577
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,550
I heard that you were ditching? Because of that, you're prohibited from leaving.

578
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,890
Watch polo? No way.

579
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,630
Mother, it's a misunderstanding. It's not that I ditchedâ€”

580
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,550
What did you do right that you're talking so much?

581
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,930
Brother!

582
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,020
Let's go.

583
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,270
Father, take me along as well.

584
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:40,700
I promised my friends. I must go.

585
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,290
Mother...

586
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,040
Today I'm not your mother.

587
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,480
Madam...

588
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,430
Have a safe trip.

589
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,570
Miss. You should just draw more of the flowers in your room.

590
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,660
- Take it off.
 - Excuse me?

591
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,560
Take off your clothes.

592
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,150
Miss, do you have to go that far?

593
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,070
Let's go.

594
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,310
You promised.

595
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,860
If I pick someone from here, you have to introduce him to me.

596
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,600
How do you know who's who?

597
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,280
The captain of the red team is your husband and the captain of the blue team is Prince Eun Seong, I hear.

598
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,880
Other players must be sons of noble families.

599
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,020
You just need to open your eyes wide and confirm it.

600
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,770
Alright. Then pick whomever you'd like.

601
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:10,010
That's right. Let me have some advantages of having a friend who weds a royal family man.

602
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,150
Excuse me, sorry.

603
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,070
Gosh, that scared me.

604
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,130
 1 Red : 0 Blue

605
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,170
Oh, geez.

606
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,550
 1 Red : 1 Blue

607
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,590
Huh?

608
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:36,060
 Oh, what'll he do?

609
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,230
Oh?

610
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,700
I thought something terrible happened.

611
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,470
Why? Does he already seem like he's your person and that he shouldn't get hurt?

612
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:38,260
I've known he was talented in poetry and art.

613
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,590
But I didn't know he was that good-looking.

614
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,490
The word "perfect" is for that man, don't you think so?

615
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,090
You don't even know anything about his personality, though.

616
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:50,370
When someone is that handsome, he can't have a poor personality.

617
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,050
Look at me. I was born pretty and got both of my parents' love

618
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,700
so I have a good personality.

619
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,920
You do?

620
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,750
Don't go in too deep.

621
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,670
Watch the match. They're doing it again.

622
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,470
The blue-clothed team will have a player replacement!

623
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,370
Where did Seong Deuk Sik go?

624
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,240
Oh my. Oh my.

625
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,910
Oh!

626
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,630
Seong Ja Hyeon, I know you're here.

627
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,380
Come out.

628
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,760
You're not coming out?

629
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,490
Why is this?

630
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,240
Get him treated first.

631
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,190
I didn't know he had a spike nail in him and made him run so much. It must have hurt a lot.

632
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:17,170
It's hard for this to have occurred coincidentally.

633
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,340
Someone might have done it on purposeâ€”

634
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,300
It's just an accident that occurred during the match.

635
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,050
I ask of you.

636
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,480
Understood.

637
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:48,050
You can't just act as if nothing happened. You could have been hurt!

638
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,290
- Go and watch the match. 
- What?

639
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:54,630
You should see how the match that I'm missing is going at least.

640
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,230
Who cares how the match is going at this point?

641
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,490
If you were to have fallen off the horse and been stepped on,

642
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,670
you could have died.

643
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,010
Are you disobeying my orders?

644
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,360
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

645
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,190
How dare she come all the way here?

646
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,600
If my Prince Eun Seong kept playing, the red team would have lost.

647
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,300
It's a shame that you can't prove that he would've won.

648
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,560
Are you taking his side just because he's your fiancÃ©?

649
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,690
When you are that hyped up when you are not even engaged or anything,

650
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,870
why can't I?

651
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,430
By the way, I don't see Ja Hyeon. When her brother is playing, too.

652
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,690
She must be behaving herself. She got kicked out of the bride-to-be class.

653
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:55,190
Now the atmosphere of the class will get better.

654
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,680
What does she mean by a royal family? It will be hard for her to get married to someone from a normal family.

655
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,060
For Chief Scholar's family prestige,

656
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,530
she'll get married to someone.

657
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,600
It doesn't work that way these days.

658
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,780
Your family has nothing but you are going to marry the royal man.

659
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,350
They only looked at you. Ja Hyeon has no chance.

660
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,060
Go ahead and curse your friend.

661
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,720
I'm saying this out of worry for her.

662
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,650
Sim Jung Cheon (Deep Blue Pigment)?

663
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,810
Lee who lives in Gwangwang District?

664
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:39,120

665
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:46,560
â™«   Again today, Iâ€™m getting closer to you   â™«

666
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,400
â™«   I'm getting closer  â™«

667
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,650
  Grand Prince Preview 
 â™«   Some day, I hope youâ€™ll smile at me  â™«

668
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:58,730
 Chief Scholar's daughter was in the waiting room?

669
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:02,030
  Are you alright? Have you been hurt?

670
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,260
 It's fate when you pass one another once.

671
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,240
 If you keep meeting like this, isn't it fate?

672
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,960
  That child who is hurt from being defeated, how will you console those feelings?

673
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,870
  Before I get married, I want to meet the grand prince once.

674
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,920
 Rather than knowing how he sees you, you should see what kind of a person he is.

675
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,220
  Who knows?

676
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,010
  You could be a bright butterfly.

677
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,340
  Who are you? I need to know.
