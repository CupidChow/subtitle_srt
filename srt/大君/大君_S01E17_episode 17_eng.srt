1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,560
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,130

3
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,100
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,040
Ja Hyeon. 
  Episode 17

5
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,280
Mother.

6
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,660
Who is it?

7
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,760
Look over here.

8
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Are you the people who have aided Ja Hyeon?

9
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,440
I'm her older brother, Seong Deuk Sik.

10
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,030
How should I repay this debt?

11
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,220
G-G-G-Grand Prince!

12
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,000
It might be better for the two of you to move far away and live together.

13
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,700
It's dangerous in the capital. Run away.

14
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Mother. I want to make your daughter an honorable bride.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,360
I cannot make her live her whole life being pursued.

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,310
But you cannot live off the kindness of the temple forever.

17
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,760
If we have love in our hearts, even if we're apart, we are not truly apart.

18
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,700
I learned through your daughter, that not even death could pull us apart.

19
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,610
Because I've made her go through so many difficulties, I thought that maybe we shouldn't have met.

20
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,110
I thought that I should let her go, and regretted it once,

21
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,830
but bidding her farewell was even more difficult.

22
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,180
You were born into privilege. The hardships you've endured are unseen and unheard of.

23
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,880
Because I've gone through hardship, I've come to realize what's really precious.

24
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,620
Adversities have made me a deeper person.

25
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,930
And every difficult moment has been ingrained in me.

26
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,690
If I had lived a smooth life, I wouldn't have known these things.

27
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,030
How precious life is.

28
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,960
How much I love this person.

29
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,870
In my eyes, it's okay not to realize these things.

30
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,700
I wanted you to live a happy life with my daughter.

31
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,210
I wanted you to live a life full of laughter.

32
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:55,030
Mother, I'm happy even now.

33
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,580
This makes no sense.

34
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,550
If he's going to die, why doesn't he die alone? Why does he keep bringing Ja Hyeon into this?!

35
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,010
Then, if she keeps living here and dies old and alone,

36
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,120
is that a good fate?

37
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,700
That Ja Hyeon is nothing but trouble!

38
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,480
It would've been great if she had just quietly become a concubine last time when she went to the palace!

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,500
Ah, just be quiet!

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,370
If they hear you, it'll be bad news!

41
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,500
Ah really. How can you not know your sister? You live with her!

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,480
Without the grand prince, Ja Hyeon will die!

43
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,820
She can't live with anyone else! Ah, really.

44
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,720
Well, people give up on things as they live.

45
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,790
Are there people who don't have a heart? Are there people who don't love others?

46
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,220
Because of this and that reason, they realize that it wasn't meant to be and they give up.

47
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,170
Young Master, how would you understand a love worth dying for,

48
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,870
a love like fire?

49
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,900
Hey, I've been hurt more than you know.

50
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,080
Yeah, you're hurt.

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,330
Because you're hurt, you can't summon up the courage.

52
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,910
If I summon the courage, could you accept me?

53
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,070
Am I not like my family members?

54
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,840
I could be like Mother and Father. I could be a great lover like Ja Hyeon and the grand prince too.

55
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,610
Ah, it's scorched rice! It looks so delicious. So delicious!

56
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,060
Because we're at the temple, there's nothing else I can give you.

57
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,700
Open up.

58
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,320
It's really delicious.

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,350
Delicious.

60
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,500
Our Roo Si Gae has really improved her speaking skills

61
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,430
but still has zero sense. Right? Roo Si Gae.

62
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,120
- Didn't the envoys from your homeland come here and cause trouble?
 - My homeland?

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,230
Envoys were sent here from Jurchen, but our king cut off their heads.

64
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,420
Even if they're Jurchens,

65
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,790
is it okay to just kill envoys from other countries?

66
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,880
It's not okay. That's why it's a big mess.

67
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,870
Oh my.

68
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,050
 Northern Pyunggwan (Jurchen envoys' stay)

69
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,230
We're here from Byeongbu.

70
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,260
Open the door!

71
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,280
Was it not enough to kill the senior envoy?!

72
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,720
How dare you enter the envoys' rooms and go through our possessions?!

73
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,240
Would you like to lay down your life as well?

74
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,020
Make sure to collect everything that appears to be a document!

75
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,720
Yes!

76
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,810
Are you in your right mind? Even if they're Jurchens,

77
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,350
they're envoys we have officially recognized. This has never happened before!

78
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,220
There was an instance when Chae Bin, an envoy from Ming Dynasty during the Goryeo Dynasty, was assassinated.

79
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,170
But that was ordered by those beneath the king, not by the king himself!

80
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,950
I granted your wish, Mother.

81
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,990
When you thought the missing Eun Seong was thought to be dead,

82
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,190
didn't you say you would most definitely get revenge?

83
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,810
Since I have killed the envoy, they will now be aware of Joseon's fiery anger.

84
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,130
If necessary, we can conquer them as well.

85
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,470
Why are you doing this now? What is the reason for your revenge after Eun Seong has been declared dead?

86
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,670
They think that superior Joseon is merely the land of the brothers.

87
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,980
They laugh at me, the sovereign of Joseon.

88
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,780
Is that also the reason why you overthrew your uncle?

89
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:45,270
My uncle. Weren't you anxious to remove him from my side since I was young?

90
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:52,170
I asked him to be the prime minister because we were in a state of emergency but members of the royal family shouldn't interfere.

91
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,720
I told him to restrain himself for now.

92
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,280
Before you give commands, deliberate and think before you act!

93
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,090
State affairs must be taken care of by cooperating with the royal court.

94
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,810
There has never been a time where the nation's affairs ran smoothly when vassals gained power.

95
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,150
Rather than the people's nation, I intend to make it a king's nation.

96
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,680
With strong authoritarian responsibility placed on the king as a foundation, I want to strengthen the monarchy of this nation.

97
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,900
Do you understand how one person's tyranny can ruin the people

98
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,480
and overturn history?

99
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,740
Please open your ears and control your heart!

100
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,490
The Huligai people don't seem to have brought the document.

101
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,220
We searched everywhere, but couldn't find anything.

102
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,910
We never made a deal with them.

103
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,280
Rumors cannot spread to the public.

104
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,020
If the Jurchens revenge for the murdered envoy...

105
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,580
That's what I want.

106
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,250
Because if they provoke me, I can crush them all the more clearly.

107
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,170
Send word to the north. Start moving the soldiers to Pajeo River

108
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,990
and tell them to thoroughly prepare for the possibility of an attack.

109
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,140
As you wish, Your Highness.

110
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,710
We found the lady.

111
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,690
She was in the mountain temple that she used to attend.

112
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,140
She was meeting her family, so I could only confirm it today.

113
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,730
Should we move her to a safe house? The conditions aren't right for her to be moved to the palace.

114
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,470
Who took her?

115
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,140
We left spies around, but we don't know who the enemy is yet.

116
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,070
I quietly withdrew lest she should run away again.

117
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,600
Since we can't bring her here...

118
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,640
I will go.

119
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,930
I'm the investigator from the military government, Do Jeong Gook.

120
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,290
Let us investigate the envoys.

121
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,910
The Ministry of Defense has already obtained information and left.

122
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,280
We have a few more things to investigate, so please open the gate.

123
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,470
Open the gate.

124
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,310
 We won't be fooled by people of Joseon anymore.

125
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,630
 War is the only way.

126
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,460
He says, "Get lost."

127
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,780
What do you gain by waging war?

128
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,660
When you plunder and run out of rations,

129
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,770
you will probably come to exchange the lives of soldiers for crops, no?

130
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,380
Are you mocking us?

131
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,770
I am giving you a chance.

132
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,100
You sided with Grand Prince Jin Yang and created a war on purpose

133
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,290
and tried to kill me, a prince of this country.

134
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,030
I escaped death, yet I am willing to forgive you.

135
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,970
And I'm offering a chance for us to become allies.

136
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,880
I won't make false promises like Grand Prince Jin Yang when he didn't stick to what he said when he promised you territory.

137
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,810
Instead, I will send Joseon's engineers

138
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,840
and have them teach you agricultural techniques to cultivate your infertile land.

139
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,550
We will resume previously blocked trade and through marriage,

140
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,760
I will find a way for both nations to live together.

141
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,840
Make a choice. Will you return and be investigated by your chief,

142
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,730
or will you choose these new negotiations and have the opportunity to revive your homeland?

143
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,630
You can trust Grand Prince Eun Seong.

144
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,520
He's someone who guarded me with his life even though I am from an enemy clan.

145
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,470
If you allow me to follow the envoy, I will meet my father and get the documents.

146
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,030
A present for you.

147
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,860
He says it's a present for you.

148
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,290
I wish to give you a present before I leave.

149
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,150
When we fight, we play the flute.

150
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,440
Father told him to play the flute,

151
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,600
if Grand Prince Jin Yang didn't keep his promise.

152
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,780
 Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe, Chieftain Li Man Zhu:
Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon

153
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,190
 and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.

154
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,500
With this, we can uncover Grand Prince Jin Yang's crimes.

155
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,310
Your Majesty, you have to eat a lot

156
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,980
and grow up quickly.

157
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:25,800

158
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,400
Did we get caught?

159
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,220
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

160
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,440
What's the matter?

161
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,420
My brother is coming. We must leave!

162
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,080
Get up! Jin Yang is coming! Jin Yang's coming!

163
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,690
- Who is it? 
 - Hurry, get up! Hurry!

164
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,150
- Hurry! 
 - Is there fire?

165
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,640
- How did he...? 
 - Hurry, hurry!

166
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,630
Your Highness, how did Grand Prince Jin Yang find out?

167
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,360
Take His Highness and the lady and leave.

168
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,800
We will try to buy some time.

169
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,180
We need to all leave. Since His Majesty is here, we can't fight here!

170
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,880
He probably knows that, so we'll be pursued.

171
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,100
I will meet Grand Prince Jin Yang. Escape this place.

172
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,180
I will not leave you to be in front of my brother again.

173
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,110
If there is a fight here, His Majesty will be in danger.

174
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,840
Does that mean it's okay if you're in danger?

175
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,660
The person who tortured me is Na Gyeom, not Grand Prince Jin Yang.

176
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,340
I'm sure that we were caught because of my family coming in and out of here.

177
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,900
If I take the lead, he won't be suspicious.

178
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,700
He doesn't know you're alive, Your Highness.

179
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,850
I can't leave you here.

180
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,080
- Think about His Majesty. 
 - I'll stay behind.

181
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,830
Grand Prince Jin Yang won't do anything to me.

182
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,290
The queen dowager is the one who sent me to the Jeongubwon (temple for female monks). Also, the monks are here.

183
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,250
Hurry and go! We have no time.

184
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,240
After I take the His Majesty somewhere safe, I'll come back.

185
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,130
Did you know I would be coming?

186
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,190
The monks told me that they thought a guest had arrived.

187
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,000
Your Majesty, that woman is the barbarian wench that used to follow Grand Prince Eun Seong around.

188
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,700
She had nowhere to go, so I am taking care of her.

189
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,310
Leave her be.

190
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,270
Isn't she a woman?

191
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,800
How are you feeling?

192
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,960
Wounds of the body get better with time.

193
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,430
Will you give me a cup of tea?

194
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,180
Come this way.

195
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,120
Search around to see if any others left.

196
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,750
Yes, sir!

197
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,540
Why didn't you kill me?

198
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,990
From your point of view, I committed high treason.

199
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,830
You are being punished enough, aren't you?

200
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,870
Living in a world without Hwi is like living in hell, isn't it?

201
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,840
Killing you is the same as granting your wish.

202
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,290
If you die,

203
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:10,080
the two of you will unite again, and I'll be alone.

204
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,370
I wish to keep you in this world, even if you hate me.

205
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
How did you escape Jeongubwon (temple for female monks)?

206
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,000
He may be gone, but his people remain.

207
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
They brought me here and left.

208
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,090
Are you aware that they are the real traitors?

209
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,750
To me, they are my life savers.

210
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,260
We can't relax yet. We have to go farther.

211
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,500
Your Highness!

212
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,390
- Don't look back. Go to the gisaeng house right away. Let's meet there. 
 - Your Highness.

213
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,600
Take care of His Majesty. I'm trusting you.

214
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,460
Uncle!

215
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,170
Let's go.

216
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,400
Living in hiding like this,

217
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,160
I realized that whether it's the Jeongubwon or here, both are like a prison.

218
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,190
Let me go back home.

219
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,000
I want to be with my family.

220
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,350
Sending you to the Jeongubwon was the queen dowager's order.

221
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,900
Aren't you strong enough now?

222
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,040
You don't need to worry about the people above or inside of the court.

223
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,650
Have you forgotten Eun Seong now?

224
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,160
It would be a lie if I said I have.

225
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,080
But what is definite is that I am alive

226
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,250
while he is dead.

227
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,290
What do you want?

228
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,810
I don't want to be your concubine.

229
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,280
- Then?
 - I want to become your queen.

230
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:10,820
If my father returns safely from China, dethrone the current queen

231
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,060
and make me queen.

232
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,240
So that is what all women want ultimately.

233
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,890
You are starting to resemble my queen.

234
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,950
I don't want to be trampled on again.

235
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,090
If you can't do that for me, then forget me.

236
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,240
She may be a king's woman, but a royal concubine still lives the life of a mistress.

237
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,140
Na Gyeom will not leave me alive.

238
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,980
I won't enter the palace just to be whipped and tortured again.

239
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,250
If it's not everything, I'd rather not have anything.

240
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,650
I am the King of Joseon now.

241
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,330
You should be groveling at my feet. What makes you so confident?

242
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:09,790
Grand Prince Eun Seong staked his everything for me.

243
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,300
You, too, stake your everything. Otherwise, you'll never move my heart.

244
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,810
Didn't you hate me to death?

245
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:32,200
Did your vengeance towards the queen outstrip that hatred?

246
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,590
Didn't you come here in the dead of the night to see me?

247
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,200
If you were going to subdue the remnants of the rebellion that you are suspicious of, you could have just sent soldiers.

248
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,650
But you came here personally. Isn't it because you wanted to see me even like this?

249
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,020
That heart of yours might move me.

250
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,510
Whether it's love or obsession, you said that

251
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,500
your heart hurts in the same way. Show that heart to me.

252
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,940
Then, even my frozen heart may melt like a spring day.

253
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,260
If that day comes, I will call you "My King" instead of "Grand Prince."

254
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:32,380
You committed a deadly crime just by calling me Grand Prince right now.

255
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:38,990
Did you ever see me frightened of death?

256
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,030
Mind your step.

257
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,360
Stay here for the time being.

258
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,560
Will outsiders see us?

259
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,250
I stopped accepting other customers after I lost my eye.

260
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,930
I also sent out all the servants, so you only have to be careful when you go outside.

261
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,520
Since it turned out like this, let's pretend to be servants of this place.

262
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,200
- That's a good idea.
 - We can eat meat here, right?

263
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Your life is hanging by a thread, and you can still think of meat?

264
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,420
If you die with a full stomach, even your ghost will look good, they say.

265
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,940
Please wait for a while. I will bring food to appease your hunger.

266
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,710
Thank you!

267
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm so grateful that I don't know what to say.

268
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,500
You're amazing.

269
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,510
For now, let's say that you are not well.

270
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,390
Since that was your only excuse for leaving the Jeongubwon.

271
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,350
Thank you.

272
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,630
However, I will leave a guard behind.

273
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,420
I can't have you run away from me

274
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,250
a second time.

275
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,220
Since I have decided on something, I won't live as an outlaw.

276
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,340
I don't need a guard. But if that's what you want, go ahead.

277
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,960
Go inside.

278
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,560
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

279
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,310
 Dragon Tiger Gate

280
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,560
Are you okay?

281
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,550
Do you think the grand prince is safe?

282
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,030
Do you think she was being sincere?

283
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,420
How could I possibly know the lady's heart?

284
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,340
But what is certain is that Grand Prince Eun Seong is dead

285
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,580
and you have become the king.

286
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,770
Perhaps it's because the shock has died down after time has passed,

287
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,780
but it seemed like she has returned with a sharp mind once more.

288
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,730
I thought she resembled Hwi, but she has started to resemble me.

289
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,080
Do you not like that?

290
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,360
I like it... and I don't like it.

291
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,740
For now, sleep.

292
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,250
Get some good sleep now and think about it tomorrow.

293
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,220
Since you're home, that's enough.

294
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,790
Since I'll be able to feed you and clothe you with my own hands, that's still something.

295
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,910
Mother.

296
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,880
It's good that you came.

297
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:27,910
I would hope that you don't have hardships anymore,

298
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,090
but life doesn't go the way we intend it to.

299
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,620
So, I got stronger too.

300
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,240
There is no more of the flower Ja Hyeon who grew

301
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,800
under the protection and shade of you and Father.

302
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,370
I'm not afraid now.

303
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,300
As long as we live, there is hope.

304
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,790
His Highness said this.

305
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,210
Your Highness.

306
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,020
Your Majesty.

307
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,100
Where did you go?

308
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,080
Being in the palace got stuffy, so I went out to get some air.

309
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,200
The palace is so large, but it feels stuffy?

310
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,560
There are so many places within the palace that I still have not visited.

311
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,320
- What is the matter? 
 - I must tell you something.

312
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,830
You're pregnant?

313
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:19,060
Yes, Your Majesty. The court physician felt my pulse.

314
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,070
There was no sign of pregnancy though I've been married for more than three years,

315
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,640
so I was very worried.

316
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,480
It seems the baby was waiting to be born in the palace.

317
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:37,180
I will give birth to a wonja (to-be crown prince).

318
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,680
A son who will be like you.

319
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,470
Your Highness. How could you make such a lie?

320
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,310
How will you deal with it in the future?

321
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,260
I just have to make it come true.

322
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,450
For now, I must have the king not think about anything else.

323
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,980
I need to solidify my spot as the queen.

324
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,360
- I'm sorry.  
 - Wait a moment. Close your eyes.

325
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,690
You can open your eyes now.

326
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,720
Please sit over h-here.

327
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,200
What about His Majesty? Is he okay?

328
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,080
- He should be. 
 - He should be?

329
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,340
Didn't you take His Majesty all the way?

330
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,640
I couldn't go because I was worried about you.

331
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,720
I was following you, and when the person keeping an eye on you fell asleep,

332
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,990
I came over the wall.

333
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,260
The safety of the His Majesty is more important!

334
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,330
To me, you are as precious as His Majesty.

335
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,270
Next time, you can trust me.

336
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,240
If I wasn't confident,

337
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,140
I wouldn't have been stubborn about staying behind by myself.

338
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,940
What were you so confident about?

339
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,170
Did you believe that since my brother wants you, he wouldn't be dangerous?

340
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,990
Did you think that you could manipulate him?

341
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,800
As I was secretly following you and my brother walking along the path—

342
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,510
Were you miserable?

343
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,820
Were you jealous?

344
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,340
I realized

345
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,820
that I am just one man amongst many others.

346
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,350
I realized that I am not as good of a person as I thought I was.

347
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,850
I, too, was jealous of Roo Si Gae.

348
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,700
No, Roo Si Gae is not a woman

349
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,200
but someone like a younger sister.

350
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,660
I was also envious of Eunuch Park who's been with you since you were children.

351
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,210
I was envious of the prisoner ahjussies who had gone through such difficult times with you.

352
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,330
I was also envious at even the thought of your first love,

353
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,490
the palace maid for whom you had a deep and sure affection.

354
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:54,620
Yeon Hee? Who did you hear that from?

355
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,840
She wasn't my first love. She wasn't.

356
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,950
After meeting you, I realized this.

357
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,610
To carry someone within your heart can be like hell all day,

358
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,860
but it can also feel like heaven in just a moment.

359
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,340
That temporary happiness

360
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,880
helps you to get through the remaining hellish times.

361
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,460
Now, I lie too.

362
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,020
I act and say things that are disingenuous and pretend to be brave.

363
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,040
I don't think I'm the Ja Hyeon I was in the past.

364
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,500
Everything has changed and become different.

365
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,730
Only my feelings for you are certain, Your Highness.

366
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,760
It's like that for me too.

367
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,220
Those exhausting days when I didn't know the future,

368
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,930
you were the only thing clear to me.

369
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,680
♫   If I just keep walking   ♫

370
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,920
♫   like this endlessly   ♫

371
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,910
Is it okay for you to return to home?

372
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,560
I agreed to pretend to be sick.

373
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,930
I told them that I left the Jeongubwon as a result of an illness.

374
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:27,240
What a relief that you can be at home now.

375
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,950
I liked being with you more, Your Highness.

376
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,670
Me, too. I was happy.

377
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,650
If I had known that the happiness would end this quickly,

378
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,390
I would have stuck by you more.

379
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,110
We could've played with flowers and drawn the scenery.

380
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:57,200
Next time, when we are together

381
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,590
we will be husband and wife.

382
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,310
Don't you think so?

383
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,650
♫   The places I want to go to   ♫

384
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,410
♫   The places I need to go to   ♫

385
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:19,500
♫   Perhaps I don't want to know forever   ♫

386
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,530
I will bring you my brother's clothes.

387
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,730
Rather than going out in these everyday clothes,

388
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,730
leaving here as if you're a person from this household would probably be best.

389
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:35,810
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

390
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,830
♫   That it's you   ♫

391
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,050
In the future, if you need to send a message, I ask you to tell my brother and not Kkeut Dan.

392
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,980
To make going in and out of the streets not look suspicious,

393
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,100
I think having a man do that would be better.

394
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,340
Since Roo Si Gae is also here, let's convey how we are doing to each other.

395
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,110
Please be careful.

396
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,290
You, too.

397
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,460
Is it true that you are pregnant?

398
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,190
Yes, Your Highness. I planned on informing you later on, but—

399
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,980
Let's call for the pharmacy to start making a tonic.

400
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,680
The royal family is precious, so you should be especially careful.

401
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,520
I am so happy that I will have a child, especially right after coming into the palace.

402
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,870
I feel like I have given great news to a royal family that has mourned a lot,

403
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,390
so that makes me very proud.

404
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,120
Congratulations, Your Highness.

405
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,770
It is a happy event for the royal family in such a long time.

406
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,510
You have worked hard, Your Highness.

407
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,800
But, Your Highness, how much longer do I have to show my manners

408
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,880
to this dethroned woman?

409
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,680
Your Highness!

410
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,870
It is fine, Your Highness.

411
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,330
I didn't think it through.

412
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:54,800
Even after being dethroned, I am grateful that I can still remain in the palace.

413
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,720
The queen has shown her manners enough.

414
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,450
Whatever the case may be,

415
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,910
the queen was the queen to the former king and your older sister-in-law.

416
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,490
No matter what the situation may be, she is not someone to be spoken to thoughtlessly.

417
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,380
I didn't have any other meaning behind it, Your Highness.

418
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:18,070
I just was curious about the customs of the royal family, which I must protect.

419
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,800
 Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe, Chieftain Li Man Zhu:
Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon

420
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,790
 and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.

421
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,400
Is this saying that Grand Prince Jin Yang is handing over territory to the Juchens?

422
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,080
What will you do about this now?

423
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,120
Let's post it somewhere with a lot of people.

424
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,170
Are you stupid?  It'd be immediately taken down by the government.

425
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,350
Roo Shi Gae has a good point.

426
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,660
We can let the people know and shift their opinions and those of the ministers as well.

427
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,090
Even if Uncle lost his official position,

428
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,550
many of the ministers are his followers.

429
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:11,150
When my brother's anger subsides,

430
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,640
they must believe that Uncle will return to the court ministers.

431
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,730
Chief Scholar is not in the country to help us convince the ministers, so the time is not good.

432
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:27,010
Then, do we have to wait until Chief Scholar returns?

433
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,970
We do not wait for an opportunity. We make it.

434
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,850
The reason why my brother was able to cast the former king aside

435
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,920
was because he cut off his guardians,

436
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,130
Minister of Left and myself.

437
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,920
We will use this as a weapon, and

438
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,050
we must cut off my brother's rotten arm first.

439
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,450
Why would His Highness talk all about the important stuff with us?

440
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,250
They should secretly talk about it amongst themselves.

441
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,530
It's because we're important people, too.

442
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,890
This is the first time I've been treated like this in all of my life.

443
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,560
I couldn't understand a word of what was said.

444
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,610
It's just best for me to do what is ordered of me.

445
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,450
Oh, look at this!

446
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,970
Is Eunuch Park inside?

447
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,250
Why would a gisaeng ask such a thing?

448
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,260
He's handsome.

449
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,750
Will you live like that basing everything off looks?

450
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,040
Also, Gi Teuk...

451
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,620
Eunuchs get married, too. They can do everything.

452
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,230
How do you know such a thing?

453
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,200
There are many gisaengs who have gotten married to eunuchs.

454
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,330
Those who have nothing are better off than I am.

455
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,360
Your Highness, I've brought some snacks.

456
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,220
So.

457
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,430
Being s eunuch or whatever, do you need to be handsome first?

458
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,790
These dim-wits.

459
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,860
I am not hanging around with you.

460
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,660
Me too.

461
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,980
Isn't that the case?

462
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,120
We are trying to track Prince Seungp Pyeong after receiving the king's order.

463
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,810
But, maybe Grand Prince Yang Ahn is keeping ahold of him.

464
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,150
I am suspicious.

465
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,660
If he has Prince Seung Pyeong, then he has a cause to lead a restoration of the king whenever he wants.

466
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,230
Right now, he doesn't have a good relationship with the king, either.

467
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,590
Be careful with your words.

468
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,130
You seem to be slandering me in order to escape my suspicions.

469
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:53,920
Doesn't everyone know Grand Prince Yang Ahn's true intentions?

470
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,950
Right now, he is restricted to his own home.

471
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,830
The king considers him to be a father-like figure.

472
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:10,880
Grand Prince Yang Ahn truly is doing things for His Majesty, and not for his own greed?

473
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,350
Is that what you're trying to say?

474
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:18,630
An ally within the lieges who truly is loyal to His Majesty,

475
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,790
there is no one else besides you, Captain of Royal Guards.

476
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,260
If you just look at the movements of Grand Prince Yang Ahn,

477
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,660
doesn't he have more of a traitorous mind than a loyal one?

478
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,090
So, have you thought about it?

479
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,540
What is there to think about?

480
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,280
A powerless, lowly person like me does what is ordered of her.

481
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,760
Good thinking.

482
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,110
If you wait, then there will be a time when you are called again in the future.

483
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,560
I have given up the gisaeng house and I'm also settling things right now.

484
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,720
But, I thought I'd need to give you a farewell drink, Your Excellency.

485
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,170
You must. Here, have a drink.

486
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:17,000
By the way, it appears that Grand Prince Yang Ahn had a child late in his life.

487
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,810
What are you saying?

488
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:24,790
Even though he is in a position where he cannot do anything as a grand prince, thanks to his young son,

489
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,920
they say that the laughing never stops within those walls.

490
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,210
Based on the words of the soldiers who keep an eye on the grand prince's palace,

491
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,840
they say there is a young boy who is around the age of Prince Seung Pyeong.

492
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:48,600
I tried to talk to the captain of royal guards, but he was so defensive we couldn't pass it on to the king.

493
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,930
That is the problem with the captain of the royal guards!

494
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,490
He is unaware of the importance of this matter. I'll report this to His Majesty.

495
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,390
How about if you do the honor?

496
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,930
The position of the prime minister is still empty.

497
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:16,250
When the Chief Scholar returns from Ming, wouldn't he be demoted?

498
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,420
What did Chief Scholar do?

499
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,600
To be frank, who contributed the most in getting the king to the throne?

500
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,840
That was you, Your Excellency.

501
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,460
Rather than the household that almost became the in-laws of a traitor,

502
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,680
we have to have a powerful minister from the queen's family.

503
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,220
With this timing, if you find Prince Seung Pyeong,

504
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,390
you will have done a huge deed and will relieve His Majesty's worry.

505
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,550
I do not know what Prince Seung Pyeong looks like.

506
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,890
For now, you should go and see if the child in that house is really Prince Seung Pyeong.

507
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,000
Confirm that first.

508
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,480
That's probably the best first step.

509
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,560
When that is confirmed, you should inform the king after.

510
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:20,720
The queen's older brother has fallen into our trap.

511
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,420
He seems to have jumped forward due to his greed to become the prime minister.

512
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,190
Did you get the children?

513
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:31,710
Yes, I found a few children who are around the same age.

514
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,720
The children cannot be hurt.

515
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,240
Things will be managed as if they are one of our own. They will be safe.

516
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,830
We will take out my brother's dogs, one by one.

517
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:06,120

518
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,990
Check things thoroughly. If there's a young boy, capture him.

519
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,730
Yes, sir!

520
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,810
Your Excellency.

521
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,530
What's the matter?

522
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,720
We will be searching your house.

523
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,480
Even if I was dismissed

524
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,640
and put under house arrest,

525
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,080
I'm still the king's elder and an elder in the royal family!  What do you think you are doing?

526
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,730
We have information that you have a suspicious young boy staying at your house.

527
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,420
A young boy?

528
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,730
Catch him!  Catch him!  Catch him!

529
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,040
Where is he?

530
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,960
Over there, sir.

531
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,690
- Where?
 - Over there!

532
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,020
- Over here.
 - Get out of my way.

533
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,360
Move out of the way!

534
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,490
There is nothing over there.

535
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,610
Go.

536
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,690
Over there, there.

537
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,770
You go that way and you go this way!

538
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,320
Why is he so fast?

539
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,140
One moment.

540
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,230
Why are you doing this?

541
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,260
Minister, Minister, I got him.

542
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,290
I got him here.

543
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,580
How dare you put a wedge between myself and the king.

544
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,340
What are you conspiring?

545
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,960
Conspire?  Isn't this something you started yourself?

546
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,540
In whose name are you doing this?  For what reason?

547
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,470
Your Excellency, I'm simply doing the work of the Investigation Bureau

548
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:12,510
as a servant of this country, Joseon.

549
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,480
This bastard.

550
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,150
Minister!

551
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,490
How can you do this?

552
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,790
To Prince Seung Pyeong?

553
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,050
Your Excellency!

554
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,580
We found a strange document in your room.

555
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,060
Do you know what this is?

556
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,410
 Letter of response from Grand Prince Jin Yang to Jurchen's Huligai Tribe, Chieftain Li Man Zhu:
Immediately, from the battlefield we will retreat to Joseon

557
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,860
 and Gen. Choe Yun Deok will return the four sovereign counties to you in return for your support pertaining to my ascension to the throne.

558
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,400
 Letter stamped with royal seal of Grand Prince Jin Yang.

559
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,510
How dare you!

560
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,450
You bastards.

561
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,720
You... You...

562
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,180
You—

563
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,480
The one who kidnapped Prince Seung Pyeong was

564
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,320
Grand Prince Yang Ahn.

565
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,060
He worked with the Jurchens and

566
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,450
obtained the secret document you told us to guard

567
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,480
and made it into a weapon to threaten you.

568
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,500
Then he took Prince Seung Pyeong to raise him separately

569
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,540
with a goal to make him the next heir.

570
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,550
So, did you find the young boy?

571
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,280
We searched the premises but we were one step too late.

572
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,000
But it is certain that he has been taken care of there.

573
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,790
I saw it myself.

574
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,690
Go find him right now.

575
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,920
Right now!

576
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,300
What do you want to do with Grand Prince Yang Ahn?

577
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,650
I will have to give him

578
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,560
a last goodbye.

579
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:19,520
Your Majesty, all of this is

580
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,250
an entrapment by our enemies to cause a misunderstanding.

581
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,910
I will reveal their plans.

582
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,690
What were you going to do that young boy?

583
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,870
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

584
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,120
I have never even seen Prince Seung Pyeong.

585
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,470
When and how did you get hold of the document from the Jurchens?

586
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:44,490
That also, I have never seen, Your Majesty.

587
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,330
This is all a trap set by them.

588
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,370
Who are they exactly?

589
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,520
Is dead Eun Seong sharpening his knife from heaven?

590
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,200
Did my late older brother become a ghost,

591
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,480
and is he looking after the little boy?

592
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,370
At least give me some excuses.

593
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:13,390
The monster nephew you raised became the king and is not following your orders,

594
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,420
so you needed a new puppet!

595
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,090
Get yourself together (speaking informally).

596
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,380
I gave my whole life to you and bled the former king dry.

597
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,470
I killed Eun Seong and got rid of a competitor.

598
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:32,290
And at last, I wanted to get rid of the young one

599
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,190
so that your path would be solid going forward.

600
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:39,740
How can you attack your own relative this way?

601
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,180
If it wasn't for me, you would never have made it to where you are.

602
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,050
You are a king I made.

603
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,260
You're right.

604
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,380
I am king.

605
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,290
Do you know what that means?

606
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,940
I no longer

607
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,730
need you, Uncle.

608
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,990
Your Majesty.

609
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,280
Are you out there, Eo Eul Woon?

610
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,450
Escort my uncle.

611
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,930
He's done so much for me so far,

612
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,030
I can't let him die in prison.

613
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,880
Your Majesty.

614
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,950
Your Majesty, please don't do this.

615
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,410
You can't do this to me.

616
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:43,180
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

617
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,290
Take it away.

618
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,620
You bastards.  Do you not know who I am?

619
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,820
I am the uncle of the king.

620
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,550
One who made the king into a king.

621
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:35,580
That's why a day like this has come.

622
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,820
To the grand prince who couldn't be king,

623
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,780
you planted misdirected ambition into him.

624
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,970
You misguided loyal subjects, killed a brother and a nephew,

625
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:01,680
and made him be known as an evil king in history.

626
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,670
The time has come for you to pay the price, Uncle.

627
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,490
Eun Seong.

628
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:14,400
Are you my grim reaper?

629
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:24,070
My brother is the one who ordered the poison.

630
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:28,820
Remember this clearly until your last breath.

631
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,740
You are...

632
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:36,380
dying at the hands of a nephew you raised.

633
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,930
Eun Seong. You were alive.

634
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,270
I had to die twice,

635
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,930
all because of you.

636
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:50,090
But, I did not die.

637
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:55,100
I am alive and have returned to punish the criminals.

638
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,900
I had to die without knowing why,

639
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,500
but I am letting you know of your crimes.

640
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,210
Eun Seong.

641
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,280
Eun Seong!

642
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,620
Will you take the poison Grand Prince bestowed upon you?

643
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:30,630
Or will you take the sword wielded by Do Yeon Soo's son?

644
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,720
You bastards!

645
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:59,090

646
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,400
 Grand Prince

647
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,220
 The remaining rebels are using the name of Prince Seung Pyeong

648
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,620
 and stirring up the people's feelings.  Find that little boy!

649
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:23,800
 We cannot succeed in our rebellion without the help of the elders.

650
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,810
 It's time to let them know that the former king and I are alive.

651
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,010
 Looks like we will have at least another bloody battle.

652
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,780
 When my brother's palanquin arrives and the door opens,

653
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,760
 before they come out, we cover them with the arrows.

654
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,090
 If this fails,

655
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:40,630
 I'm not afraid.

656
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,520
 Today, I am going to be your bride.

657
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,290
 Grand Prince
