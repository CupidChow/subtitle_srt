1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,650
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:13,590

3
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,940
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,640
  Episode 5

5
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,210
Do you dislike me that much?

6
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,980
Are you going to keep defying my order until the end?

7
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,580
Lady!

8
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,390
Young Master.

9
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,140
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,080
Please come down.

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,330
I'll bring you back.

12
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,460
I don't plan on sending her away.

13
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,720
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,550
Your Highness! Your Highness! 
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

15
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:06,290
♫   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,   ♫

16
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,420
Your Highness! Your Highness! 
♫    You spread across my heart   ♫

17
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,960
♫   Love is so mean    ♫

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,270
♫    Why do you keep shaking up my heart?   ♫

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,170
Your Highness! Your Highness!

20
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:33,100
♫   As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,330
♫   You don't know it yet   ♫

22
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,750
Are you alright? Can you breathe?

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,170
Why would you thoughtlessly jump in like that? You don't even know how to swim.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,890
You told me to come down.

25
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,410
I meant for you to switch boats, not to jump into the water.

26
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,710
What if you'd drowned and died?

27
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,960
I believed in you.

28
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,040
I knew you'd save me.

29
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:26,080
This has to be the last time. Please don't risk your life like that again.

30
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,680
What are you doing?

31
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,330
I can walk.  Please put me down.

32
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,820
I said I can walk!

33
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,090
Your Highness, please bring her in.

34
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,560
Why would you bring me here? I have to get home quickly.

35
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,720
Where would you go, drenched like that?

36
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,230
I'll find things to light a fire with.

37
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,100
Do you want me to find some firewood?

38
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,950
I'll do that. Please go and find the lady's maid and bring dry clothes.

39
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,800
Move quietly, so that the elders don't find out.

40
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,380
Yes, I'll hurry.

41
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,210
Did my feelings mean nothing to you?

42
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,050
How could you accept another man's invitation so easily?

43
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,370
I went to the river because I thought you'd be there.

44
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,740
Just the same, were you not at all suspicious that he asked you to come alone?

45
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,460
How can you be so thoughtless with everything?

46
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,990
It's because I wanted to see you.

47
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,260
There was something I wanted to ask you.

48
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,270
I wanted to ask why you taught me to draw,

49
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,900
why you sent me the pigment, why you brought me to the pasturage,

50
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,880
and why you went to the gibang (gisaeng house) with me.

51
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,300
You did everything that I wanted to do.

52
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,640
What was the reason for that?

53
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,950
I knew you could be very careless but are you a bit dim-witted too?

54
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,670
What did you say?

55
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,400
I wanted to see you happy, Lady.

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,220
Didn't you want the deep blue pigment?

57
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,070
Wasn't there something you wanted to draw in blue?

58
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,170
Wasn't it your wish to draw a war horse well?

59
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,700
Besides the deep blue pigment, there were many things I wanted to send to you.

60
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,360
I wanted to show you the chrysanthemum in full bloom under the stone wall.

61
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,930
When the fruits of the jujube tree were red and ripe, I wanted to pick them for you.

62
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,350
When the rainbow came out after the rain,

63
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,740
I worried that you might not be able to see it before it disappeared.

64
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,610
If even a rock on the path was different and unique,

65
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,100
I wanted to bring it to you.

66
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,990
But, that's what I'm saying.  Why?

67
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,140
Is that enough of an answer?

68
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,150
My Lady, I'm here!

69
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,260
- What? 
 - It's nothing.

70
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,450
- Nothing happened. 
 - Did I say anything?

71
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,070
Gosh, you.

72
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,450
What is this? What happened?

73
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,890
I fell into the water.

74
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,010
How did that happen? Gosh, I can't believe this.

75
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,400
The young master saved me.

76
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,830
You two must really be fated.

77
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,660
If it weren't for him saving you, it would've ended very badly.

78
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,460
But, is that all?

79
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,250
Was there nothing else that happened?

80
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,480
Did you not bring a brush? I need to brush my hair.

81
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,810
What is the matter, Your Highness? You've come without notice.

82
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,910
Your Highness.

83
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,070
I'll take my clothes off first.

84
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,260
- Like this? 
 - No, not like that.

85
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,210
I told you earlier to put it in here and twist it around.

86
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,280
See? I told you to buy the ones already made, but you wanted to make them yourself and now we're suffering.

87
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,960
I have to do it for them to be meaningful.

88
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,370
But it's me who's making them instead of you.

89
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm not just playing around, doing nothing!

90
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,430
I can't even sleep.

91
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,010
What is this?

92
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,830
Miss, are you hiding something from me?

93
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,880
What? What would I hide? What?

94
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Very suspicious.

95
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,670
It's already late. Why not sleep here and go in the morning?

96
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,500
You are now mine.

97
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,050
Live only for me and die only on my command.

98
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,880
If I do so, what do I gain?

99
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,050
What are you hoping for?

100
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,170
I'll think about it.

101
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,530
Let's go.

102
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,240
Grand Prince.

103
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,130
I am not anyone's possession.

104
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,960
But I will gladly take what you will give me.

105
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,070
Is this because of the girl?

106
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,250
Don't touch her.

107
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:25,070
Don't touch my woman ever again.

108
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,280
I think you're misunderstanding,  so I'll let you go this once.

109
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,050
I've asked you if there's a lady that you liked multiple times.

110
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,480
You never answered me properly.

111
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,900
Isn't it reasonable for me to feel disappointed?

112
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,020
You've always wanted what was mine.

113
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,950
The things you thought were yours...

114
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,660
Have you ever thought that they could actually be mine?

115
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,220
I'll give you all of it.

116
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,420
Take whatever you want, Brother. Just don't mess around with that person.

117
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,500
Are you still misunderstanding what happened?  That I killed the young palace maid?

118
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,030
Have you never forgotten it?

119
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,870
And just pretended to have forgotten it?

120
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,530
Because you were young,

121
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,700
you wouldn't have known what you were doing.

122
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,870
With enormous effort, I buried it by thinking that way.

123
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,370
Live your whole life atoning for that.

124
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,190
We are princes. We are protected because of our precious blood line.

125
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,360
Do you think a royal family is here solely to enjoy those privileges? Protecting the people is our duty as well!

126
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
Kings are to be shameless.

127
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,030
You are not a king!

128
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,430
You can   never   be a king, either. You know that?

129
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,000
 Ja Hyeon's house

130
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,940
My lady.

131
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,010
Go.

132
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,060
 The moon is full and bright. The garden is filled with flowers.

133
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,040
 The shadows of the flowers add on to the shadow of the moon.

134
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,010
 Beautiful people are sitting together.

135
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,050
 To whom in this world will my devotion and honor belong?

136
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,110
The baby is beautiful. He resembles you a lot, Your Highness.

137
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,880
Queen Dowager has said that the baby looks just like the king when he was a baby.

138
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,760
Why does it matter who he resembles?

139
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,020
He is handsome with a royal aura about him, right?

140
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,840
After hearing that you had suffered during labor,

141
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,890
our mother at home is worrying about you a lot.

142
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,170
This is chicken and carp soup. Please have it during the morning and evening.

143
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,790
Since I had breech birth, I thought for sure I would die.

144
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,210
Queen Dowager said to save the baby first. I was not even sad.

145
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,600
I felt the same way too.

146
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,000
If the baby had died, I'd have been as good as dead.

147
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,010
I want to raise the baby well. Please protect him.

148
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,100
I am afraid of the baby's powerful uncles.

149
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,480
Grand Prince Jin Yang is the one who sought the Saejae Order (king's younger brother ascending to the throne),

150
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,140
so he poses a great danger to this baby.

151
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,140
But, Grand Prince Eun Seong is different.

152
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,870
Yee Yee Jae Yee (An enemy's enemy is our friend).  We will use

153
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,770
Grand Prince Eun Seong to keep his older brother in check,

154
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,630
and protect his nephew at the same time.

155
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,210
You're here.

156
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,570
Please go inside. You're here.

157
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,260
Your Excellency, you have gone through a lot coming this long way.

158
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,250
Please go inside.

159
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,090
It's all done.

160
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,020
You look so pretty.

161
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,460
Are you not nervous?

162
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,350
It hasn't hit me yet.

163
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,500
I feel weird. It feels like Na Gyeom is becoming a different person compared to us now.

164
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
They say you have to get married to become an adult.

165
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,220
You guys will get married one by one soon.

166
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,910
We're going to stay this close even after getting married, okay?

167
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,420
I want that too, but I don't think I'll be able to come and go as I please.

168
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,460
Once you get married, you'll be the madam of the household.

169
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,720
Since your mother-in-law is in the palace, won't you be like the king of the household?

170
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,600
Instead of being watched by your parents right now, won't it be easier to meet us after marriage?

171
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,160
The palace always finds out. My house will be filled with palace spies scarier than a mother-in-law.

172
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,720
You can just make them be on your side. With them, all you need is money.

173
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
Money is the master.

174
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,300
Here.

175
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,970
If each of us had one, I thought we'd feel better.

176
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,500
It's pretty.

177
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,150
Is it a friendship   norigae   (knotted ornament)?

178
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,360
Thank you. I'll treasure it.

179
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,480
You have to live well.

180
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,560
He's here! Your husband is here.

181
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,610
The grand princes have arrived!

182
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,370
There's someone I like.

183
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,390
- Really? 
 - You'll see him today.

184
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,800
You have to tell me who it is.

185
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,350
I've told my parents that I want to get married to him.

186
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,230
What's this? Am I the only one left now?

187
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:16,310

188
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,660
- It's him over there. 
 - Where?

189
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,520
Over there, behind the groom.

190
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,070
The most handsome royal member in Joseon.

191
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,310
Grand Prince Eun Seong. What do you think?

192
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,610
Isn't he more handsome than the groom? Right?

193
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,280
- Brilliant to look at, right? 
 - He's a grand prince?

194
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,970
No, he's not.  He's Lee Hwi.  Young master Lee Hwi, no?

195
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,990
He's Grand Prince Eun Seong, Lee Hwi.

196
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,100
He's the youngest brother of the king. What do you think?

197
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,290
He suits me well, right?

198
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,220
The bride shall bow.

199
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,070
  You have your eyes on royalty.

200
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,400
  Are you just like all the other women?

201
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
  Hurry and leave this place.

202
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,840
  I'm Lee from Gwanggwang District.

203
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,380
The groom shall bow in return.

204
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,430
The bride shall bow again.

205
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,750
Lady Ja Hyeon!

206
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,400
"The sky is full of the moon, the garden is full of the flowers."

207
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,700
"The shadow of the moon overlaps the shadow of the flowers."

208
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,030
"Since we, who are like the moon and the flower, are sitting down looking at each other.

209
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,150
"I don't need to know anything like shame or disgrace."

210
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,450
Was everything a lie?

211
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,060
- My lady. 
 - Throughout the day and night, many love letters that were delivered.

212
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,440
Were they mere mockery filled with lies?

213
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,400
No, please don't misunderstand!

214
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,620
I was foolish.

215
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,610
Lee who lives in  Gwanggwang District. The Gyeongbok Palace is in Gwanggwang District. So Young Master,

216
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,480
I mean, Your Highness, you didn't exactly lie.

217
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,030
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you all this time because—

218
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,710
Is it your hobby to disguise yourself and make a mockery out of an innocent lady?

219
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,460
- My lady! 
 - There's even a lady who wants to get married to you.

220
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,540
That's something I know nothing about.

221
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,730
My sincerity is towards you only.

222
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,630
Sincerity? Your confession was covered in deceit and stained by arrogance.

223
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,060
Is that your sincerity, Your Highness?

224
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,740
Please listen to what I have to say.

225
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,000
We are strangers now.

226
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Please don't act like you know me from now on.

227
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,830
What are you doing? The groom has to get changed right now. Let's go.

228
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,460
How do you feel, Nephew?

229
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,780
I want something else.

230
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,060
I feel greedy.

231
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,050
I feel greedy towards everything.

232
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,940
What should I do?

233
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,940
If you are talking about Jo Hwi Gyeong, who's rather nameless (lowly),

234
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,310
it's no big deal managing someone like that, given your status.

235
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,310
You can just give an order.

236
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,430
I'm not talking about a No Ryu Jang Hwa (a weed or a wild flower on the side of the road anyone can pick up - meaning a gisaeng).

237
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,160
Even if I embrace them dozens of times,

238
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,060
I have a thirst that cannot be quenched by them.

239
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,900
I shall help you. What do you want so badly?

240
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,210
Ah, well, if the noble family's child turned out to be the grand prince, isn't that a good thing?

241
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,230
Why are you so angry?

242
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,670
- He deceived me. 
 - I can see how that might make you feel, but...

243
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,680
I didn't even know that and my heart fluttered with anxiety and I couldn't even fall asleep.

244
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,310
Did you like him that much?

245
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,330
All of that was the sleezy royal prince's joke.

246
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,410
He could have been sincere.

247
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,310
He wasn't just fooling around with me.

248
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,110
Ultimately, both brothers are the same.

249
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,250
Aish.

250
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,320
Husband, it is late at night.

251
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,290
Isn't there something you have to give me?

252
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,350
You said you'd give me my silver knife on our first night.

253
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,650
How do you feel?

254
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,540
How do you feel after getting the spot of the prince's wife that you had wished for?

255
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,850
Traditionally, a woman cannot choose her husband.

256
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,170
I got here after snatching my sister's husband-to-be from her.

257
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,060
It was an adventure that was like gambling.

258
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,310
But I've seen the strong and confident grand prince in you,

259
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,010
and I trembled in excitement with the premonition that I will have no regret.

260
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,870
You will have no regret?

261
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,820
You can't turn back now.

262
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,210
What is the point of a regret?

263
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,560
My husband, you must take off the hair accessory.

264
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,390
Good events are continuously occurring to the once lonely royal family.

265
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,580
A wonja (someone who will be a crown prince eventually) has been born.

266
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,970
New family members have been brought in. I have no wish  now.

267
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,090
You still have to see more grandsons and see your youngest son get married.

268
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,490
You have much to look forward to and be happy about, Mother.

269
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,460
Be loyal to the king

270
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,600
and be devoted to the queen.

271
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,790
That is your duty as a wedded couple.

272
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,400
Please visit the palace a lot. I'm happy that I have a sister-in-law now.

273
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,090
Is the baby healthy?

274
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,570
He is growing and growing every single day.

275
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,890
As expected she won't accept it.

276
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,960
Should I go one more time?

277
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,730
Never mind. You already went five times to no avail.

278
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,610
Six times.

279
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,190
Then, is this the end for you and her?

280
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,740
What are you going to do now?

281
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,030
I'll take the bull by the horns.

282
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,100
Your Highness. You need to have a plan at the least!

283
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,410
Is this place Myeong Rae Palace?

284
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,140
This is the place where I lived alone when I was a child.

285
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,380
With a promise to never come back to this house, I left this place.

286
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,570
Now, I am by your side.

287
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,960
You are no longer alone, Grand Prince.

288
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:30,320
I don't know what a marriage is or what a family is.

289
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,590
Because my parents were the king and the queen, I am a grand prince.

290
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,480
I have never seen an affectionate couple before,

291
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,260
so I don't know how to act towards my wife.

292
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,650
Just live as the grand prince.

293
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,570
I'll take care of the rest.

294
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,030
It is Grand Prince Eun Seong.

295
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,900
We have come to visit the eldest son and Confucian scholar, Seong Deuk Sik.

296
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,960
What should I do about this? The young master is out right now.

297
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,850
Then, are you saying that Your Highness will have to walk here a second time?

298
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,710
If we wait, he will come, at some point?

299
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,940
Yeah.

300
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,570
I'll wait in the guesthouse.

301
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,740
Ah, yes. Please go inside.

302
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,510
You said you'd be dealing with it straight on.

303
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:39,450
There's a military strategy called Wi-Wi-Ku-Jo.  If your opponent is strong, you might need a detour. Don't you know?

304
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,970
Yes, yes.

305
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,800
In which direction is Lady Ja Hyeon's quarters?

306
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,170
You want to sneak into the place? You can't do that!

307
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,990
What do you take me for?

308
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,550
Go and tell her that I'll be waiting in the back garden.

309
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,250
Ah, yes.

310
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,730
Your Highness, why have you come to our house without a warning?

311
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,050
I rushed over from Sungkyunkwan once I received the news.

312
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,950
I just came while I was passing by.

313
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,250
Like that time we played polo and my brother's wedding,

314
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,000
whenever something big happens in the palace,

315
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,750
your contribution is ever so immense, I wanted to give you recognition.

316
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,890
Your Highness, until now I haven't told you, but

317
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,240
you know Grand Prince Jin Yang's harsh personality, don't you?

318
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,170
It's no easy business trying to please him.

319
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:49,210
Of course, I know. I'm his younger brother and I get it worse.

320
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:56,470
But after knowing that someone understands my heart, my sorrow is melting away.

321
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,840
Since you made a difficult journey, please go inside.

322
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,250
I have a lot to tell you.

323
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,430
Let's go.

324
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,220
Yes, come in.

325
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,120
He came looking for you at your house. You should at least show him your face.

326
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,340
He still hasn't left. He is drinking with the young master.

327
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,990
Is it really because he wants to keep drinking? He's probably still waiting for you, Miss.

328
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,700
Still, a high-ranking royal person is hanging onto you as if he has no pride.

329
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,350
Miss, don't be like this.

330
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,290
Do I have to go if the royal family wants me to? Do I have to see them even if I don't like it?

331
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,190
You should at least hear his excuse. You're being heartless.

332
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:51,060
He's had his way all his life so he thinks everyone else has to follow his wish.

333
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,720
He makes a mockery out of others and manipulates them.

334
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,860
If we stay close with those kinds of people, we're the only ones who get hurt. We shouldn't associate with them.

335
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,950
It seemed like he really liked you.

336
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,060
He probably likes other girls besides me.

337
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,250
Your Highness also thinks that too, right?

338
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,350
When we had the banquet last time,

339
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,820
I told him it's too cold to hold it in a venue outside, but he wouldn't listen.

340
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,480
Grand Prince Jin Yang sits alone like this and pretends to be cool and all.

341
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Right?

342
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,640
What?

343
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,300
You have no alcohol, do you? Take some alcohol.

344
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,380
I suppose you don't really like drinking?

345
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,190
Oh, and these appetizers...

346
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,230
These. Here.

347
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,870
Open your mouth.

348
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,010
Me, too.

349
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,000
A person should share drinks like this after a while.

350
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,590
It's been a while.

351
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,300
I shouldn't have sent him alone.

352
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,940
I wonder if Eo Eul Woon is okay on his way there.

353
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,750
It would be a more dangerous trip if we sent a group.

354
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,110
Even if he comes back safely, we cannot succeed by political means alone.

355
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,780
We need to bring in a mercenary.

356
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,050
If a royal family member gathers people he will attract suspicion.

357
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,900
You need people who will act on your behalf.

358
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,250
Has the grand prince still not returned yet?

359
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,850
Today, he is sleeping outside.

360
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,900
Is he at his uncle's house?

361
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,020
Well, about that... He's having a meeting at a gisaeng house.

362
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,400
Alright. Leave the entrance unlocked just in case.

363
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,280
Yes, Madam.

364
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,780
Just tell me.

365
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,590
What kind of book are you looking for?

366
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,650
I don't know either.

367
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,930
Then, what are you doing now?

368
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,050
Don't they say there's a path within a book?

369
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,580
 History of the Three Kingdoms

370
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,550
Quickly come.

371
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,550
Honestly, is His Lordship Tiger really hosting an event for us?

372
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,910
This is how I'm living with my husband instead of throwing him away.

373
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,100
He seems rough outside but he's subtly generous inside.

374
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,840
This is not subtle but rather straightforward.

375
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,090
You can come in.

376
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,350
- You have refreshments prepared, right? 
 - Yes.

377
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,340
Bring them out and tell Ja Hyeon to come too

378
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,010
so that we can watch the storytelling together.

379
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,070
No, I'm not going!

380
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,190
Aren't you sick of being shut inside the corner of your room?

381
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,410
Your mother called for you!

382
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,230
If you want to see it, you can go by yourself!

383
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,460
You're not going, so how can I go?

384
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,430
We can go and come back quickly.

385
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,860
Your mother is worried about you!

386
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,180
I have to read this entire book!

387
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,070
I know that this has been the same page of the book for days!

388
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,600
You think I don't know since I'm illiterate?

389
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,210
Gosh, this won't do.

390
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,430
Okay! I'll just go!

391
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,100
My lady!

392
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,740
We're enjoying luxuries today thanks to you.

393
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,870
- Isn't that so? 
 - Yes.

394
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,850
You came, my daughter?

395
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,230
Oh! It's starting. Hush now!

396
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,030
A long time ago in the era of the three kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla).

397
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,140
Goguryeo's prince Heungan snuck into Beakje.

398
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,910
Despite being the prince, he falls in love with

399
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,840
Hanju, the woman from the enemy nation.

400
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Oh, they fell in love!

401
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,050
Man and woman getting together.  That's great.

402
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,370
My love, Lady Hanju.

403
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,430
She does not know I'm not from this country

404
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,460
or that I'm a prince.

405
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,050
Before I leave, I must tell her the truth.

406
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,200
I want to tell her to come with me,

407
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,370
but what do I do if she dislikes me?

408
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,790
What do I do if she turns her back to me?

409
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,240
Young Master.

410
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,600
Young Master.

411
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,690
What are you worrying about?

412
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,190
Young lady, no matter what I am

413
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:38,520
or who I am, will your feelings not change?

414
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,110
The heart I gave is no longer mine,

415
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,600
but yours.

416
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,080
Even if I am not a man of this land?

417
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,260
If my lord is not a man of our land, what land would he be from?

418
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,190
I am not a man of Baekje, but of Goguryeo.

419
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:01,540
How does a man from Goguryeo come to our land?

420
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,830
I am not an ordinary citizen of Goguryeo, but its prince.

421
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,460
I came to dig up Baekje's secret.

422
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,400
How could you deceive me? Approaching me with a lie

423
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,210
and toying with me!

424
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,950
No, that is not it, my lady. I was just scared.

425
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,460
I came to love you before I could tell you the truth.

426
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,230
I was just terribly afraid and fearful.

427
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,810
- Oh dear.
 - Oh no.

428
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,490
My lady.

429
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,400
Don't just believe what you see.

430
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,250
Please believe in the time we have spent together.

431
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:26,840
From the moment we first met, my heart was trembling.

432
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,830
Even though I was rude, you responded with sympathy and a warm heart.

433
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,730
The passion that you had when you wore the male disguise to come out and learn.

434
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,540
Your curiosity that made you want to go to forbidden places.

435
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,980
You believed in me and courageously risked your life.

436
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,050
♫   The filling up,   ♫

437
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:59,050
All of that was you. No matter if it was night or day,

438
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,660
I became a fool who could only think of you.

439
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,200
♫   No matter what I blame   ♫

440
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,390
♫   But wherever I look   ♫

441
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,760
Before I knew it, I became someone

442
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,420
who could not live without you.

443
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,500
♫   The places I need to go to   ♫

444
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,100
Will you come with me?

445
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:30,190
Go! Say you will! I will go!

446
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,470
I will follow you!

447
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:40,420
Young master, no, if my prince is sincere, I will go to heaven

448
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,920
or even to hell.

449
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,690
Can you trust me?

450
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:49,820
I will trust not you, but the love that you've shown me.

451
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:57,950
Your name and position are ever-changing.

452
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:03,640
I shall only ever follow your one and only heart.

453
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:11,380
Even if you have to abandon your family, your hometown, and receive the brunt of people's hatred,

454
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,980
will you trust in me and follow me?

455
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,550
Follow him! Go! Go!

456
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,380
Say you will go!

457
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,490
Prince!

458
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,780
Lady!

459
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,600
  Applause

460
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,350
Stop...

461
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,740
Let's go.

462
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,870
The courageous Baekje lady, Hanju, followed her love and left her hometown.

463
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:48,900
But later became a Goguryeo queen and lived happily ever after.

464
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:56,110
This has been the story of Heungan, King Anja of Goguryeo who loved a Baekje woman.

465
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,890
- That was great. 
- Great job.

466
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,560
- Wasn't it good?
 - Really.

467
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,040
It really was fun.

468
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,900
Did she watch it well?

469
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,620
Is there still no news?

470
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:28,440
She was definitely affected by it, but why is there no contact?

471
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,900
I have to leave now though.

472
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,430
If I don't receive her forgiveness today, there won't be another chance.

473
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,620
Should I go and ask?

474
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,550
Look here, where are you two from?

475
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,630
Next week is my mother-in-law's birthday. Come and let us hear this story.

476
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,860
How dare you! I was first!

477
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,600
How much is it? Take this advance payment.

478
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,060
My grandson's first birthday is coming up.

479
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,800
Once at daytime and once at night. I think both times would suffice.

480
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,350
I have a condition.

481
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,020
Could you not use a mask? You two are so good looking.

482
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,170
Why hide it with such a ghastly mask?

483
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:18,230
Madame Jeong doesn't know art at all.

484
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:24,170
They want to act like females, that's why they do it.

485
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,480
I don't need any female role.

486
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,720
Isn't there a story with only lots of males?

487
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,670
Your Highness, don't be too disappointed.

488
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:54,990
Her heart has probably softened somewhat, so if you just write her a letter tomorrow...

489
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,780
Why did you become so thin?

490
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:33,000
My lord... no, Your Highness has also become poorly.

491
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,830
I am sorry.

492
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,870
At first, there was no reason to reveal my identity.

493
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:50,710
Later, you kept saying you hated the royal family.

494
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,400
It was hard for me to say it.

495
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,440
I knew I needed to tell you, I did.

496
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,300
But I kept delaying until you found out by yourself.

497
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,200
When did you start doing Jeongisu? 
  (A traditional form of storytelling)

498
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:14,350
You should have played the role of Hanju. You would have looked good as a female.

499
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,630
Are you forgiving me?

500
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,170
- I cannot forgive you. 
 - My lady.

501
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:24,820
But I think I can understand you.

502
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:30,310
It's alright if you can't forgive me. But for the rest of my life, please let me stay by your side in atonement.

503
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,370
We even held hands and kissed.

504
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,900
Did you plan on marrying another man as if nothing ever happened?

505
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,730
Your Highness!

506
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,970
You are already my woman.

507
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:06,610
People praise me as the grand prince, but I cannot be anything and I am nothing.

508
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,590
As someone's husband and lover,

509
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:15,410
that's the only life I'm allowed.

510
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,290
So, rather than a marriage arranged by the elders,

511
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,910
I wanted a fated union that was of my own making.

512
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,430
♫   My longing has piled up   ♫

513
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,190
Ja Hyeon.

514
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,110
Yes?

515
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:38,860
Calling each other's name, being equals, let us live like that.

516
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,690
♫  Even if I try to fix it   ♫

517
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:44,230
Lovers who are friends.

518
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,640
Like that.

519
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,640
Yes.

520
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,070
♫   Because of you   ♫

521
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:56,420
Please call my name. 
 ♫   it has rusted   ♫

522
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,480
Don't you know my name?

523
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,200
♫   What do I do with myself?   ♫

524
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,410
Hwi. Hwi.

525
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,020
Hwi.

526
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:15,090
When I call your name, it's like the sound of a whistle.

527
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,230
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

528
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,600
I vow to you

529
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,340
that I will protect you for the rest of my life.

530
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,980
♫    You spread across my heart   ♫

531
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,650
That I will only love you.

532
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:38,010
♫   Love is so mean    ♫

533
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:45,750
♫    Why do you keep shaking up my heart?   ♫

534
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:53,040
♫   As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

535
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:59,310
♫   You don't know it yet   ♫

536
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,780
Your Excellency, it's me.

537
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,890
Yes. Please come in.

538
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,150
What is all of that?

539
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:32,190
You seem tired tonight so I prepared a hot bath for you.

540
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,200
You could have the servants do it. Why would you, my wife?

541
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,860
There need to be things that I do for you, though.

542
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,290
I am only receiving from you, every day.

543
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:56,730
It was very nice today.

544
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,550
I've been disappointed with our weakening marital connection,

545
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,540
but I know your sincerity now.

546
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:14,620
Earlier, I got so excited when I heard the love stories that the storytellers told.

547
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:21,210
Since you enjoyed it so much,

548
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,670
you can call them from time to time as a pastime.

549
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:30,390
Rather than gambling... No, it is very thrilling as much as gambling.

550
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,270
I'm just saying.

551
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,680
Why are you doing this?

552
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,830
Well, you have to be bare skinned for a bath to be effective.

553
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:51,550
Dear, you must preserve your dignity!

554
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:56,440
You can preserve your dignity during the day.  This is time for marital connection.

555
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,340
Wait.

556
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:03,640
Dear, there is something I must read tonight.

557
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,370
Instead of your book, read the feelings of your wife.

558
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,920
Dear!

559
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,070
 Pajeo River, on the border.

560
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,220
Light the signal fire!

561
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,360
Yes!

562
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,930
Attack the intruders and send a message to the palace.

563
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,300
Yes, sir.

564
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,910
Were you not hurt anywhere?

565
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,480
That is not important.

566
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,900
What happened to the task given to you?

567
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,350
While I was coming back, things would've started already.

568
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:27,450
Soon, the news of the battlefield will arrive.

569
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:31,370
They would have asked for something.

570
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:47,040
 From: Chieftain Li Man Zhu, Huligai Tribe, Jurchen 
 To: Joseon Royal Second Prince Jin Yang

571
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,120
 Four cities are within the geographical extension of the Jurchen territory that Gen. Choe Yun Deok is invading.

572
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,090
 If you can seize the homeland, Huligai Tribe will be able to return to you.

573
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:58,030
 It's an achievable task.

574
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,990
Their greed is excessive.

575
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:08,690
Give more of whatever they want.

576
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:14,700
We can't have them be even a little disappointed or hold grudges.

577
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,560
They have to completely be on our side.

578
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,640
Whether it's grains or wealth, we can give them.

579
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,060
But the territory is not a problem we can easily respond to.

580
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,800
For now, we'll say we'll give it to them.

581
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,540
Shilla's Kim Yu Shin negotiated with friends to unite the three kingdoms,

582
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,530
but once his objective was achieved, he turned the friends into foes.

583
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,390
For the barbarians,

584
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,690
we can crush them later.

585
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:48,320
As you say, we'll think of future problems in the future.

586
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,860
Once we achieve our dream, other paths will open up.

587
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,110
Did something good happen?

588
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:06,110
I was worried about you losing weight, but today, your complexion is bright.

589
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,350
I have a request to make of you, Mother.

590
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:15,240
I once asked you to let me choose my own spouse.

591
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,910
- To be honest, there is a maiden I have come to like. 
 - What?

592
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,180
There is a new owner at Gyotaejeon (where the queen resides), and my brother has married.

593
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,290
I want to make a family, as well.

594
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:34,160
I have been looking for a bride for you. Who is it that you have in mind?

595
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,970
It's the daughter of Seong Eok, the Chief Scholar from the Office of Literature and Special Advisors.

596
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,720
- He has a daughter? 
 - Yes.

597
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,360
- How did you come to know her? 
 - Well.

598
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,540
I play polo with his son.

599
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,450
While visiting his house with my brother, I've seen her before.

600
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:57,260
You saw her one or two times, and you wanted to marry her?

601
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:02,760
She has a warm heart, she is courageous, and she is also very determined.

602
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,390
We both love drawing.  We will be happy drawing beautiful scenery together.

603
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,560
I'll have to meet her as your possible marriage partner.

604
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:17,590
I want to avoid the formal bride selection process that causes inconvenience to the people.

605
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:23,060
I will invite her and her mother to the palace and get to know them better.

606
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,480
You're going to like her.

607
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,330
I haven't approved of her yet.

608
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,550
It's very fascinating.

609
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,730
He's so small, but he has everything.

610
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,670
Eyes, nose, lips, face,

611
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,890
hands, feet, arms, and legs.

612
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:57,720
How is he so small? It's fascinating.

613
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,240
Don't say such things, Your Majesty.

614
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,450
Even if he's small, what if something was missing? What would happen?

615
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,820
He needs to have everything.

616
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,170
You have to grow up quickly.

617
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:13,710
Grow up and become the wonja (status just below crown prince), then the crown prince.

618
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:18,120
You have to become more of an excellent king than me.

619
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,690
You must be strong and healthy, Your Majesty.

620
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,520
Of course.

621
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,380
I have to be next to my son for a long time

622
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,170
in order for the royal family to be peaceful.

623
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:41,530
Your Majesty, the Chief Royal Secretary Shim Jeong has arrived.

624
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,810
What is it?

625
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:50,020
Your Majesty! The Jurchens from the Pajeo river valley have crossed the border!

626
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:55,040
- Are those barbarians plundering again? 
 - Yes.

627
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,860
Your Highness!

628
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,990
What is it?

629
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,530
There has been a disaster in the northern regions.

630
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,540
The Chief Royal Secretary has presented the report to the king.

631
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,540
A disaster? Have the barbarians caused a stir again?

632
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,130
I will find out more information.

633
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,560
They said it's not basic-level plunder.

634
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,100
They have burned the houses and taken the people.

635
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,800
They are currently facing our soldiers.

636
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,580
Summon the court ministers.

637
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,790
And send out the entry passes to the royal family members.

638
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

639
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,580
Your Majesty!

640
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,590
Your Majesty!

641
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,610
Your Majesty!

01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,960
Your Majesty!

643
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,020
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

644
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,660
Your Majesty!

645
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,770

♫  Believing and believing  ♫

  Grand Prince: Drawing Love - Episode 6 Preview

649
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,220
  As his older brother, I cannot approve of this marriage.

650
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,860
  Grand Prince Eun Seong and I are fated. You cannot cut our connection.

651
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,970
  We need someone strong who can respond to the national emergency.

652
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:55,240
  We need to put in someone who can handle it. You'll have to become the crown prince.

653
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,880
  Am I nothing to you?

654
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,050
  If I tell you not to go, will you not go?

655
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:03,820
  Since you'll be on the battlefield, I want to give this to you. This sword will protect you.

656
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,970
  I'll stain my own hands with blood.

657
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:12,010
  I'll return to you alive. My life is yours.
