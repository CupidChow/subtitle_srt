1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,490
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:37,100

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,960
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,240
  Episode 9

5
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,040
Your Highness, where are you going?

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,500
Where are you going leaving us behind, Your Highness?

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,950
Please don't be like this. He'll be back. He will come back to save you.

8
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,090
- Your Highness!
 - Your Highness!

9
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,730
Get them!

10
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,490
Please go!

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,090
Catch them!

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,220
Your Highness! Your Highness!

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,510
Your Highness! Your Highness!

14
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,550
Your Excellency.

15
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,430
Lieutenant. Lieutenant!

16
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,090
Your Excellency.

17
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,830
Lieutenant.

18
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,890
Lieutenant.

19
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,790
Your Highness.

20
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,880
His Majesty, please...

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,740
Baby Wonja, please...

22
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,990
Lieutenant.

23
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,720
Lieutenant.

24
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,340
Lieutenant!

25
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,230
 3 years later

26
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,930
Father.

27
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,250
News of the king's illness cannot be spread.

28
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,030
We are taking extra measures to makes sure it does not.

29
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,220
Should a word of it get out, all those responsible will be beheaded.

30
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,030
Father.

31
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,890
But, he's bravely endured this for many years.

32
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,320
The king will rise again.

33
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,980
The crown prince is so young.

34
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,630
The king will rise for sure.

35
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,830
Tell me to die instead.

36
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,620
I have already told you that I'm not getting married to another man.

37
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,790
Okay, just die then.

38
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,670
After three years of prayer, even Mangbuseok would have turned around.
 (Mangbuseok:  A faithful wife, in Korean folklore, who died praying for her husband's return and then turned into stone).

39
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,170
If you get older, don't you know that the only chance you'll have is to marry a widower?

40
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,070
Only three years have passed.

41
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,790
Do you not think about your parents?

42
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,980
You're heartbroken over a lover who left you behind,

43
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,020
but don't you feel pity for your own mother, who is so worried about you?

44
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,250
I will not get married.

45
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,060
If it isn't His Highness, I will not be anyone's bride.

46
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,020
Alright. Do whatever you want!

47
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,970
Madam! Why are you doing this?

48
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,730
We'll do what we want to do.

49
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,670
Lady, let's leave. Hurry.

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,720
You will marry even if we have to forcefully bundle you and carry you out.

51
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,360
Lady.

52
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,750
So upsetting.

53
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,840
Lady.

54
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,930
Are you really not getting married?

55
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,060
Are you really like this, too? Why are you treating His Highness as if he doesn't exist in this world?

56
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,650
He's not here.

57
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,710
People have forgotten about him.

58
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,360
He's not of this world anymore.

59
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,690
Even if the world forgets about him, I can't do that.

60
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,630
You didn't even have a wedding. Why are you being faithful to him?

61
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,380
No, the two of us had a promise ceremony.

62
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,480
It was between the two of us, but we made our vows and exchanged gifts to signify our love in front of Buddha.

63
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,940
No one knows about it, though.

64
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,260
I know! His Highness knows, and the heavens know.

65
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,890
Lady!

66
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,900
If we continue on down the path, we'll be in the capital city in a bit.

67
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,250
You should see the lady first.

68
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,180
Is this Joseon's palace?

69
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,210
No, it isn't.  You fool.

70
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,870
Your Highness, should I inform them?

71
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,610
No. If I appear like this, they'll be in shock.

72
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,570
But she'll be happy.

73
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,030
In the past three years, she probably never stopped waiting for you.

74
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,330
If it's possible, you should see her and leave.

75
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,100
Who?

76
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,760
Let's go to the palace. I must see Queen Mother and greet His Majesty.

77
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:17,450
I'll meet the lady when I'm looking more like a human.

78
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,440
 Dragon Turtle

79
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,700
Myeong Rae Palace.

80
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,730
Move aside. This is Grand Prince Eun Seong, who has returned from the north.

81
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,440
Geez.

82
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,900
The day's this cold and these crazy bastards are going around like this?

83
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,250
How rude of you! Show your manners towards His Highness.

84
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,750
If you want to keep talking, show me identification or an entry pass to the palace.

85
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
He died long ago on an expedition and was buried ever since.

86
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,880
How dare you speak of Grand Prince Eun Seong now?

87
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,440
He survived death. Go and report to the Great Hall.

88
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,750
Your Highness.

89
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,910
We just need to notify the chief eunuch or the chief court lady.

90
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,500
Once they come out and see you...

91
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,820
I can't simply let you leave like this. How dare you tell me to step aside while you're holding weapons?

92
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,620
To find out what faction you treason-planning beggar bastards are,

93
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,310
I'll have to take you away and punish you through the leg-screw torture!

94
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,020
Take them away!

95
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,910
 The king is in a coma and nearing death.

96
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,070
 The queen is searching everywhere in vain. His whereabouts are unknown.

97
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,200
Good work. Be careful on your way back.

98
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,520
We're at the same level. Half of the people are on the king and his mother's side,

99
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,810
and the other half are on our side.

100
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,330
What will you do? The king's illness is severe.

101
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,380
The king's mother is avoiding you and the ministers.

102
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,470
If you lose this timing before he dies—

103
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,720
Before the extreme event occurs, we need to get the gomyeong  (king's will including succession plan) .

104
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,590
While Grand Prince Eun Seong is not here, if you receive the gomyeong,

105
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,580
the throne will be yours, Your Highness.

106
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,880
I'm going to the palace.

107
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,720
Brother, ask the chief minister and all other ministers to enter the palace.

108
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
Yes, I will.

109
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,020
I will bring you your palace uniform.

110
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,640
  Madam, a guest is here.

111
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,720
I came to see the grand prince.

112
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,000
The grand prince will enter the palace soon.

113
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
He doesn't have the time to freely talk to you.

114
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,920
What should we do?

115
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,130
Go back.

116
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,930
Your Excellency, it's Ja Hyeon.

117
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,350
I have something I must talk to you about.

118
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,530
Come inside.

119
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,550
Royal family member Prince Weol Yeong sent an offer of marriage to my house.

120
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,520
Please ask him to withdraw the offer.  He's one of your loyalists.

121
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,680
So, please resolve this issue.

122
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,980
Did you not want another groom to consider?

123
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,440
What are you saying?

124
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,520
You refused to be my woman for three years.

125
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,900
I gave you a different choice with great generosity.

126
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,320
Are you asking me to be a gold digger?

127
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,020
Hwi is... not coming back.

128
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,340
He is dead.

129
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,720
You should acknowledge that.

130
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,220
The one who cruelly drove his brother to death was you, Grand Prince.

131
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,590
He went of his own will.

132
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,170
He had a sense of duty as this nation's prince.

133
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,880
Do you... intend to ruin my life in the end?

134
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,530
Prince Weol Yeong is my cousin.

135
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,000
Being married to someone from a royal family means your life gets ruined?

136
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,950
Other ladies would be shocked to hear that.

137
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,430
I do not want to get married.

138
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,520
I do not want to be anyone's bride.

139
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,870
Do you dislike Prince Weol Yeong that much?

140
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,850
If you really feel that way, just come to me.

141
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,030
I'll accept you even now.

142
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,830
I've said these words in vain.

143
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,640
In believing that there was a small slice of a decent man left in you,

144
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,610
I was foolish.

145
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,990
Be careful out there in the night.

146
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,350
You will soon become a bride.

147
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,930
What are you doing, Madam?

148
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,220
Is it not enough to ruin one grand prince?

149
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,880
Are you fearless or are you ignorant from the lack of knowledge of the law?

150
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,990
How dare you carelessly meet a man from another person's household?

151
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,080
Are you that worried?

152
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,110
Do you still not have confidence?

153
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,560
Is that why you wanted to get rid of me this way?

154
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,300
Be thankful.

155
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,450
If it wasn't for our effort, you would die as a virgin ghost.

156
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,050
Have you forgotten all about the time when we were friends?

157
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,690
Don't you know that you're the one who ended our friendship?

158
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,490
When you started seducing the grand princes, we stopped being friends or anything else.

159
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,930
My life and my fate will not be determined by you and your husband.

160
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,710
If you hate getting married that much, why don't you commit suicide?

161
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,970
Let's go, Lady.

162
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,820
Pretend you didn't hear it. Let's just go!

163
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,370
If you were going to die, you should've died three years ago.

164
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,880
That amazing love you had, if you'd died then, you would've been praised for your devotion toward one person.

165
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,180
Let's go. Hurry, let's go.

166
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,030
I wish you happiness!

167
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,600
Please, do get married, have sons and daughters, and live well!

168
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,430
Pass the message on to Ja Hyeon's household.

169
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,230
What should it be about?

170
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,010
To observe Ja Hyeon well until her wedding day.

171
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,850
So that she doesn't die or run away.

172
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,760
She's someone who went on the battlefield to follow Grand Prince Eun Seong, who had gone on a conquest.

173
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,470
You don't know what she'll do if you leave her by herself.

174
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,340
Yes, Madam.

175
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,250
 Entry Pass: Main Gate

176
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,670
Will she be able to do it well?

177
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,200
She can't even speak Joseon's language well.

178
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,790
As long as I find the queen, it's okay.

179
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,800
Dowager! Queen Dowager!

180
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, right!

181
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,960
Dowager! Queen Dowager!

182
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,630
  Hwi

183
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,900
 Entry Pass: Main Gate

184
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,580
You may enter.

185
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,040
I just have to walk forward.

186
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,490
Forward. Queen?

187
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,230
Dowager. Queen Dowager.

188
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,770
Forward. Forward.

189
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,780
As a court lady of the palace,

190
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,830
how could you enter the grand prince's home on personal matters?

191
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,010
I was just doing what was told by the higher-ups.

192
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,290
Who are those higher-ups?

193
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,490
If you want to live, tell us all about it.

194
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,990
I was just delivering a letter.

195
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,560
Who sent that letter?

196
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,820
Your Highness! Your Highness!

197
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,220
Your Highness, this will not do.

198
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,380
Tonight, please rest in your chamber.

199
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,660
No, it's okay. I'll get changed and get back to the king.

200
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,820
If you continue this way, you will collapse first.

201
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,530
The queen will have a tough time if she's by herself.

202
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,820
How rude of you. How dare you block the path of the queen dowager?

203
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,970
Queen?

204
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,430
Ah, Dowager. Queen Dowager.

205
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,960
What are you doing? Take her away!

206
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,660
Is nobody there?

207
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,570
Call for the royal guards. Royal guards!

208
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,350
  Hwi

209
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,740
Your Highness.

210
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,680
  Hwi

211
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,500
Hwi.

212
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,730
This...

213
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,300
This is...

214
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,810
Hwi's blood. My son, Hwi!

215
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,280
Yes.

216
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,810
Your unworthy son

217
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,410
has returned now and

218
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,910
greets Your Highness.

219
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,150
You were alive?

220
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,360
Where did your jade-like face go?

221
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,490
How hard. How hard it must have been for you.

222
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,000
The king is on the brink of death.

223
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,340
The heavens must pity this mother

224
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,550
because they've returned you to me.

225
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,040
How severe is His Majesty's illness?

226
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:21,200
In a time like this, we can't know what's around the corner from us.

227
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,910
Due to Jin Yang's scary greed,

228
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,430
the court ministers and royal family members have not been notified.

229
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,640
My older brother probably knows all about it.

230
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,160
I found a court lady who was traveling to the Myeong Rae Palace.

231
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,020
Closer.

232
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,770
Come closer.

233
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,580
Now, I

234
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,980
can pass on with an easy mind.

235
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,670
What are you saying?

236
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,060
I have returned. Your youngest brother, Hwi, has returned.

237
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,440
You must become healthier so that we can make up for the time that we lost as brothers.

238
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,590
I thought about it, again and again.

239
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,820
Whether it would be right to give the throne to Jin Yang.

240
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,460
Whether it would be the right path for this country.

241
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,490
Your Majesty.

242
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,830
But, Jin Yang

243
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,390
wouldn't let the crown prince live.

244
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,420
He wouldn't let you live, either.

245
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,060
You should protect the crown prince.

246
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,930
- Your Majesty. 
 - You must

247
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,760
protect our family.

248
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:44,000
If this new country experiences a fight between princes again,

249
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,540
we cannot win the trust of the people.

250
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,830
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

251
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,420
Your Majesty!

252
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,630
Do not let anyone die.

253
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,660
You must save our family.

254
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,490
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

255
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,920
Your Majesty!

256
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,310
Your Majesty!

257
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,880
Your Majesty!

258
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,540
You cannot today.

259
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,150
Since His Majesty is ill, I've brought calming medicine.

260
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,320
I want to bring it to His Majesty. Please let them know I'm here.

261
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,890
The Queen Dowager issued a strict order not to let anyone in tonight.

262
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,890
Are you treating His Majesty's younger brother as a simple visitor?

263
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,270
Please return in the morning.

264
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,660
I said I'd give His Majesty the calming medicine.

265
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,640
If something bad were to happen to His Majesty tonight,

266
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,500
would you be able to handle the consequences in the future?

267
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,520
Move aside!

268
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,900
Your Majesty!

269
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,610
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

270
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,730
Your Majesty!

271
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,890
Mother.

272
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,890
What is the matter?

273
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,760
What about the king?

274
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,300
He has passed away.

275
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,810
Chief Eunuch.

276
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,870
How could you let things happen this way?

277
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,730
How can you let His Majesty go alone without me, his closest family, by his side?

278
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,130
Who in the world would receive his last will

279
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,040
and testament?

280
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,470
Do not worry about that.

281
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,220
Grand Prince Eun Seong!

282
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,030
I received his last will and succession edict.

283
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,480
Until the crown prince comes of age,

284
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,440
Queen Mother will act as regent,

285
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,660
and the grand princes will pledge their loyalty to the crown prince.

286
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:53,110
This is the dead king's last wish.

287
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,390
You're the one who received the last will and succession edict?

288
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,900
I've come back, Hyung-nim (older brother).

289
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,710
I did not die.

290
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,930
I came back alive.

291
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,540
Give up.

292
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,530
Oraboni (older brother), please.

293
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,890
Had it not been for the grand prince's wife, you would've been put through shame again.

294
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,090
You're lucky she sent a message to protect you well.

295
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,090
Na Gyeom did that?

296
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,340
Starting today, every night, you will guard the lady's quarters.

297
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,800
If you lose the lady, you guys will be dead. Okay?

298
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes, Young Master!

299
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,710
You have a lot of scars.

300
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,200
Since I was on the battlefield.

301
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,440
It's a relief you've survived and come back.

302
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,750
I couldn't die because there was someone waiting for me.

303
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,000
Since you have returned at the unfortunate time of a royal death,

304
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,590
I cannot reveal my happiness for your return in the midst of the sadness of the king's death.

305
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,510
It must be hard for you too since you can't run to the woman you've longed for.

306
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,660
But it'd be best not to see a woman who will marry another man.

307
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,820
I'm talking about Lady Ja Hyeon.

308
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:40,420
But, since you two have an old affection as friends, how delighted she'll be to see your safe return.

309
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,190
Ja Hyeon is getting married?

310
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,480
She's getting married to royal family member Prince Weol Yeong.

311
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,480
Your Highness! Your Highness!

312
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,750
Your Highness!

313
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,060
Everyone, leave.

314
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:28,940
What do you wish to do now? Since Grand Prince Eun Seong received the last will...

315
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,650
Every day for three years,

316
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,830
I listened to what I was told and held my breath.

317
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,730
Only three days remain.

318
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,070
Within three days, before the baby saeja (crown prince) becomes king with Eun Seong's protection,

319
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,470
we need to overturn the will and obtain a new edict from Queen Dowager.

320
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,640
Will things work out that way?

321
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,160
I must go to the queen dowager's palace.

322
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,130
Since Eun Seong is not in the palace,

323
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,830
everything that happens will be up to me.

324
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,530
Who are you?

325
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,890
Excuse me! Where are you going?

326
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,790
Is His Excellency here? Where is the lady?

327
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,700
Who are you to be doing this?

328
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,020
What is all of this noise?

329
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,000
What are you doing in someone else's house this early in the morning?

330
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,070
Your Excellency, it is me, Eun Seong.

331
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,870
Are you alive, or are you a ghost?

332
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,900
The king has passed away.

333
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,830
Your Majesty!

334
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,230
Your Majesty!

335
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,060
I need to meet your daughter.

336
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,260
Please tell her that I have arrived alive.

337
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,920
No, I cannot.

338
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,250
What are you doing?

339
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,730
I will go into the mountains and become a Buddhist nun.

340
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,470
The grand prince has arrived.

341
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,450
He's alive. He's looking for you.

342
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,940
My daughter is already set to marry another man.

343
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,620
Your Highness, you can't!

344
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,250
Lady! Lady Ja Hyeon!

345
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,430
Your Highness! You should return to the palace.

346
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,280
You must observe the royal mourning.

347
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,310
Lady!

348
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,690
♫   I cannot even laugh   ♫

349
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,680
♫   My loneliness has piled up   ♫

350
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:52,200
♫   Everything has been broken   ♫

351
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,600
♫   I try to fix it   ♫

352
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,710
♫   I can't do anything   ♫

353
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,710
Your Highness!

354
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:12,720
♫   Because of you, it has rusted   ♫

355
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,730
♫   What do I do with myself?   ♫

356
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:26,650
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

357
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:34,510
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

358
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:41,350
♫   No matter how much I hit until I get bruised,   ♫

359
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,290
♫    You spread across my heart   ♫

360
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:52,930
♫   Love is so mean    ♫

361
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,100
♫    Why do you keep    ♫

362
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,770
Does the last will reflect your intention?

363
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,730
It was the dying wish of the late king, who was worried about the country.

364
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,610
You can imagine how much he reflected on it before making the decision.

365
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,930
I didn't know you wanted to be the queen, Mother.

366
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,020
How rude of you!

367
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,640
It was a dying wish meant to protect the young saeja (crown prince), and you twisted it like that.

368
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,250
Your eldest son has passed away.

369
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,890
It's now time for Your Highness to rely on me.

370
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,910
Please rescind the royal edict.

371
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,220
The late king's dying wish has already been released. I cannot change it as I please.

372
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,950
I am your son too, Queen Mother.

373
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,660
Why can't it be me?

374
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,120
Do you think the throne is something where everyone can wait for their turn and try it out?

375
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:57,570
If Joseon does not establish the line of succession rule, the roots of this country will be shaken.

376
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,390
It must be established that a competent person can rise to the throne,

377
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,140
like how Father pushed away Uncle to rise to the throne.

378
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,690
Joseon has established that it is governed by the rule of primogeniture (first-born son as heir).

379
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,480
Your uncle dragged a gisaeng (female entertainer) into the palace.

380
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,710
He was immoral as he laid his hands on other people's wives. That's how he got sent out of the palace!

381
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,960
The   saeja (crown prince)  is young. He cannot be the king!

382
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,570
I, your mother, am alive!

383
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,350
Stop with your useless greed.

384
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,960
Are you not the greedy one, Queen Mother?

385
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,270
Your greed to become the queen turned your son into a useless scarecrow.

386
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,050
This is the last time.

387
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,900
If you shake up the royal family again with your irreverent statements,

388
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,330
even though you are my son, I will not forgive you!

389
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,560
Has my uncle entered the palace? Where is he?

390
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,900
He's probably heading to the queen's pavilion.

391
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,530
Jin Yang doesn't plan on obeying the late king's dying wish.

392
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,630
You're not saying...

393
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,010
However, once Saeja ascends to the throne he will have no choice but to accept it.

394
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,240
It's three days. As long as those days safely pass by...

395
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,620
Please find Eun Seong.

396
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,280
Eun Seong has to block Jin Yang.

397
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,350
Yes, Your Highness.

398
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,120
What happened to your hair?

399
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,470
The woman I've been missing every minute of the day and night

400
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,310
did not have an appearance like this.

401
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,010
You don't seem like how you were in the past, either.

402
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,990
You've become very thin and aged somewhat too.

403
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,140
You're like a baby.

404
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,430
But you are still beautiful.

405
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,680
I endured and endured,

406
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,560
but I could not do it anymore, so I cut my hair.

407
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,750
Even if I had to become a Buddhist nun, I would have avoided being someone else's wife.

408
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,140
Thank you.

409
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,960
I hoped that you would wait for me,

410
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,740
but you could've already gotten married to someone else.

411
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,080
Even so I didn't have the right to resent you.

412
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,120
That's how I controlled my mind.

413
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,760
You promised that you'd come back and you wouldn't die.

414
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,450
You didn't even trust me?

415
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,290
Every day for three years, everyone said you'd died.

416
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,760
I put my hands over my ears and didn't listen. I waited and waited.

417
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,980
You thought I had gotten married to someone else already?

418
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,060
♫   As I keep walking, I meet the moon   ♫

419
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,150
♫   How much   ♫

420
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,170
I am afraid

421
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,820
that this might be a dream.

422
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,150
♫   All of the engraved longing   ♫

423
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,100
On countless nights, I dreamed of you, Lady.

424
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,320
But when I would awake, I'd learn that it was only a dream.

425
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:42,800
So futile were those were days when I didn't want to open my eyes again.

426
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:49,150
♫   The places I want to go to   ♫

427
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,390
It's not a dream.

428
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,050
The person in front of you is me.

429
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,380
It's Ja Hyeon.

430
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,840
We are together again.

431
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,880
♫   To a place no one knows  ♫

432
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:15,040
♫   When I get there, will I call out only then?   ♫

433
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:24,350
♫    Following this path, following you   ♫

434
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:32,160
♫    I'm wandering   ♫

435
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:44,880

436
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,540
Are you not injured anywhere? Or feeling poorly anywhere?

437
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,370
Everything is fine.

438
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,360
Where were you?

439
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,730
What suffering have you gone through during that time?

440
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,870
The important thing is that I'm back.

441
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,140
Please promise me

442
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,230
that you will never leave my side again.

443
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:46,530
You've lost His Majesty as soon as you returned.

444
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,680
I don't know how to console you.

445
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,530
Since I returned, he could close his eyes at last.

446
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,340
As much as you have,

447
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,220
he's had the reason to endure all this time.

448
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,550
We have to suffer like this and make her bathe?

449
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,020
How could we present someone like her to our masters?

450
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,590
Why do we have to look after an Orangkae (derogatory term for Jurchens) wench?

451
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:30,530
Not even an obedient one but one that bites us like a crazy dog at that?

452
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,750
Hey, you.  You smell, you know.

453
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,770
If you are going to serve the grand prince,

454
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:39,640
you need to clean and change your dress.

455
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,480
She bit me!

456
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,490
Have you not finished dressing her?

457
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,800
Court Lady, she is not human.

458
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,330
She's an animal.

459
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,670
Everyone, leave.

460
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,700
No, she is a dangerous child.

461
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,820
We will...

462
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,470
Take it off yourself.

463
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,960
 Dragon Tiger

464
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,390
Do not worry about anything.

465
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:19,460
I won't. My wish has already come true.

466
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,260
I didn't even dare to expect to be together with you again.

467
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,060
My wish was just to know whether you were alive or not.

468
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,830
If you had really died, I could've followed you there.

469
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:35,620
But, I thought that maybe, you could still be living.

470
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:41,800
I didn't want to go there (die) on my own first, so I endured it.

471
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,010
Go inside.

472
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:50,230
I will figure everything out.

473
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,360
I will watch you leave.

474
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,160
Your hair will grow back soon.

475
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,610
When things in the palace settle down, I'll return.

476
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,960
This isn't a dream, right?

477
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,330
It's really you who are here, right?  It's not a mirage, right?

478
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,330
If it hadn't been for you, if you hadn't been there,

479
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,700
I would've already given up.

480
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,660
So I could return to see your face again,

481
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,590
I was able to go through it all.

482
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,660
It's not a dream.

483
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,450
If you keep being like this, I can't leave you.

484
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,040
I know you have a lot to do.

485
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,660
Wait here. This time, without any fear.

486
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,680
Eun Seong has come back alive?

487
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,750
The effort we've put in for three years is about to evaporate.

488
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,740
Is Queen Dowager showing any willingness to rescind the will?

489
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,000
She was not on my side, of course.

490
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,750
But the public opinion is with you.

491
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,710
All of the ministers and the royal family members will be of one voice

492
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,700
in petitioning against the baby king.

493
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,380
If we object to the saeja (crown prince) succeeding the throne,

494
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,450
Queen Mother will install Eun Seong instead.

495
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,030
The dead king wanted him as saejae (King's brother as crown prince).

496
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,840
Make up your mind then. If you can't change Queen Mother's mind,

497
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,850
we have no other way but to do it by force!

498
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,430
Before he ascends to the throne, take over the security of the Eastern Pavilion (Crown Prince's quarters).

499
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,000
Use our court lady at the king's chambers to find out the exact situation of the saeja (crown prince),

500
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,220
and we will go there with our ministers.

501
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,460
We must have them hand over the king's seal to us.

502
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,910
How are you going to overcome the Left Minister and Grand Prince Eun Seong?

503
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:46,840
If the saeja is in our hands, they won't dare to act recklessly.

504
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,270
If they still insist on blocking us at that time,

505
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,340
we will have to slay them.

506
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:00,290
Tell the ministers to gather at my place when their meetings are over.

507
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:05,700
Before we go to see Queen Dowager I want to confirm our solidarity.

508
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,050
I will make sure to contact every one of them.

509
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,450
Where in the world have you been?

510
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:40,090
Queen Dowager is looking for you ardently.

511
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,600
I will go to the queen's quarters soon.

512
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,380
Grand Prince Jin Yang is opposed to the dead king's will.

513
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,660
He's had a big row with the queen dowager.

514
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,350
Who's looking after the security of the Eastern Pavilion (Crown Prince's quarters)?

515
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,770
It's Eeg Wee Sa, of course.
 (Eeg Wee Sa:  government agency responsible for the security of the crown prince).

516
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:57,160
Once he ascends to the throne, it will fall to the jurisdiction of palace security.

517
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,290
Isn't the Grand Prince Jin Yang's brother-in-law, the chief of palace security?

518
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,650
The head of the queen dowager's security is Hyung-nim's person also.

519
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:06,310
We cannot have them be in charge of the crown prince's security.

520
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,130
Please be courageous.

521
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,890
You've had to send your husband off,

522
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,120
but you are now the mother of the crown prince who will ascend to the throne.

523
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,300
You have to show strength

524
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,320
in the days ahead for the sake of His Highness.

525
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,820
Please don't cry, Mother.

526
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,000
Promise me, Saeja.

527
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,780
Become a great king who will love his people.

528
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,790
What is the matter?

529
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,310
The palace security will now be in charge of the crown prince who will soon ascend to the throne,

530
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,680
in accordance with the order from above.

531
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,230
Who from above issued such an order?

532
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,950
As it's always been done, the security of the crown prince

533
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:48,370
is the responsibility of the Eeg Wee Sa.

534
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:52,720
Once he ascends to the throne, the palace security can take over the responsibility.

535
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,190
Our master is concerned about the  well being of the crown prince.

536
00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:00,780
If it's not the order of Queen Dowager, dismiss the security personnel at once.

537
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,990
I am the chief of palace security.

538
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,720
It's proper for the palace security to take over the security of the crown prince who's about to ascend to the throne.

539
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,180
Why are you asking me to go against the rule, without authority?

540
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,290
You've been told to dismiss the security from here!

541
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,440
The superior you are talking about,

542
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,390
is it Grand Prince Jin Yang?

543
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,160
Where is he?

544
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:43,930
Have you made up your mind?

545
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,040
I will be meeting with the ministers from the court tonight.

546
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,620
I need your help.

547
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,930
Even if I've to risk  my life for you, I will not hesitate.

548
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:00,370
Grand Prince and Madam, Grand Prince Eun Seong is here.

549
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,350
Grand Prince, what has happened?

550
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:24,130
I'm happy that you're back, but the king has died.

551
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,090
I have nothing to say, Sister-in-law.

552
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:29,630
You must have suffered a great deal.

553
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,130
Please go in. Your brother is waiting for you.

554
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,270
Were you able to work it out with your loved one?

555
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:06,830
One day late, she would have become a Buddhist nun.

556
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,170
She'd already cut her hair.

557
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,320
Hyung-nim,

558
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,970
did you believe that I would return?

559
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,360
Were you ...

560
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,990
waiting for me at all?

561
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,210
I wouldn't have wished for you to die, surely.

562
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,180
If so, why

563
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,180
then did you abandon me and leave me in the enemies' hands?

564
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

565
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,160
The Orangkae kept me hostage for three years.

566
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,310
I heard everything.

567
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,680
I know everything.

568
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,650
The people will abandon you if they find out that you've sold the country

569
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,310
in order to ascend to the throne.

570
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,830
Is that not so, Hyung-nim?

571
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:04,170
Did you think that no one would know about it forever?

572
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:07,530
How can you speak so casually without any evidence?

573
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:11,800
The safety of your precious life that survived the battlefield cannot be guaranteed.

574
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,120
That secret letter given to the chieftain of Huligai Tribe.

575
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,460
If that dirty negotiation is revealed to the world,

576
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,420
never mind the throne you coveted all this time.

577
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,310
It will be difficult to keep your position as grand prince.

578
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:26,130
No minister at court will stand with you.

579
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,670
Neither will any of our people

580
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,930
be able to submit to you.

581
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,740
As a servant of the royal house who serves the saeja (crown prince),

582
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,130
be loyal to the saeja and Queen Mother.

583
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:42,870
If you do, I will bury it so that no one will know.

584
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,190
You think you will be safe making up such a scheme?

585
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,210
Is it not so?  What's the reason for changing the security of the saeja in a hurry?

586
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:54,750
What about the reason for pressuring Queen Dowager who's just lost her son?

587
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,190
Show me the proof.

588
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,860
The proof that I was involved in a dirty negotiation!

589
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:08,460
I have that secret document.

590
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:21,860

  Grand Prince: Drawing Love 
 Episode 10 Preview

594
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,290
 Success will become revolution.  Failure will become treason.

595
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,630
 I'm asking if you are prepared to go that far.

596
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,620
 Until you give it all up,

597
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,790
 I will not stop for one moment.

598
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,190

599
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,670
 Isn't this Eun Seong's wedding date?

600
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,520
 It's a day all of our enemies will gather in one place.

601
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,730
 It's a singular chance to get rid of Grand Prince Eun Seong and all our enemies at once.

602
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,290
 It's a war. A war!

603
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,990
 - Hyungnim
 - Call security!

604
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,230
 What's happening?  Who's behind this?

605
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:07,920
 I'm sure something must have happened in the palace.
