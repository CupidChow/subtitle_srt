  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,960

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,940
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

4
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,460
 Episode 15

5
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,490
♫   It's because my chest feels tight   ♫

6
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,490
♫   I feel frustrated because my chest feels tight   ♫

7
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,110
Have I died?

8
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,210
Now, in another world, have I met you, Your Highness?

9
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,750
♫   Love is so mean    ♫

10
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,910
♫    Why do you keep shaking up my heart?   ♫

11
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,920
♫   As much as it is sad, this mean love   ♫

12
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,150
♫   You don't know it yet   ♫

13
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,860
I saw a corpse wearing your clothes.

14
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,380
There was even a funeral on the island.

15
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,770
I saw you being buried with my own eyes, Your Highness.

16
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,760
With the general's help, we put up an act to gain freedom.

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,910
I switched with the body of a mariner who had died.

18
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,250
If I became someone who had supposedly died, then I could escape the island.

19
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,840
Do you know what I did while thinking you had died?

20
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,730
You should have sent me a message.  You should have told me.

21
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,250
Assassins came from the capital.

22
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,550
There was no time to inform anyone.

23
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,780
To survive and to gain freedom, we had to act in extreme haste.

24
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:18,590
Did my brother do something?

25
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,010
Thinking that I'd died,

26
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,010
did my brother really bring you in as a concubine?

27
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,440
No, do not say anything.

28
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,890
It's fine even if you don't explain.

29
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,130
No matter what happened, I know that it couldn't be helped.

30
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,420
In the end, it's all my fault regardless.

31
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,910
Yes. That's true.

32
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,230
You promised that you wouldn't leave and that you'd protect me forever.

33
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,900
After letting go of you, who died, I walked into the palace with my own two feet.

34
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,680
I did it to become someone else's woman. A concubine.

35
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,630
Even before the earth where  your body was buried had dried,

36
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,520
I went to see someone else.

37
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,710
Is that good enough? Does your heart feel clear now?

38
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,690
If you were thinking like that, why would you come to get me?

39
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,910
I couldn't send you to Jeongubwon (a temple for female monks).

40
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,760
I had to meet you in some way.

41
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,630
What did you want to confirm?

42
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,870
After ripping my heart out to the bottom, what is your reason for finally coming to see me?

43
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,510
I had to see you.

44
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,570
If I didn't, I thought I'd die.

45
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,940
You didn't even believe in me.

46
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,850
I will return to the Jeongubwon (a temple for female monks).

47
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,880
You cannot.

48
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,030
I will leave and let you be alone. You can calm down and rest.

49
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,960
You've lost the lady, you say?

50
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,080
After the security forces left the Jeongubwon,

51
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,580
we tried to take the lady, but because of the men that appeared out of nowhere...

52
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,530
Do not let him appear before my eyes again!

53
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,800
Do you think Chief Scholar used someone for that?

54
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,020
What happened to the people who used to follow Eun Seong?

55
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,560
The general at Gyedong Island was to take care of them.

56
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,630
Look into what happened to them.

57
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,620
It seems those who were loyal to Eun Seong don't have their minds straight.

58
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,350
Then, what about the lady?

59
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,330
Wouldn't she contact her family wherever she might be?

60
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,230
Keep an eye out at Chief Scholar's house.

61
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,980
To the public, the lady of the Seong family is at the Jeongubwon.

62
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,260
Make sure the queen and Queen Mother don't pay attention to her anymore.

64
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,730
Is the lady okay? Did you talk to her?

65
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,630
What will you do in the future?

66
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,650
Sending her off would be a good idea, right?

67
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,030
It's dangerous here.

68
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,670
We have many things to do.

69
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,420
At first, I just wanted to let her know I was alive.

70
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,180
And I wanted to hear what kind of hardship she had gone through.

71
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,950
But, after seeing her...

72
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,200
You don't want to send her off, right?

73
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,130
She is angry with me,

74
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,330
and I think she suffered through great hardships in the palace that she cannot even speak about.

75
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,470
Even if I send her off sometime,

76
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,230
I want to make her feel better first.

77
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,400
It's unspeakably hard for both of you.

78
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,160
I had confidence, Gi Teuk.

79
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,730
I had the confidence to make her happy.

80
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,300
But in the end, I ended up making her the unhappiest

81
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,040
bride in the world.

82
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,800
This is all because of Grand Prince Jin Yang.

83
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Had it not been for him,

84
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,250
you two would have had a wedding and lived happily like flowers.

85
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,140
I shouldn't have been so greedy about her.

86
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,440
Your Highness.

87
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,380
When I went off to war, I should've said goodbye.

88
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,550
If she had not met me,

89
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,330
if we hadn't been engaged,

90
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,910
she would have married into a good noble family.

91
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,210
She could've drawn what she liked

92
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:20,150
and lived a comfortable, happy life.

93
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,610
This is not the end.

94
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,540
It's hard for you now,

95
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,130
but you will recover for sure.

96
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,420
When that day comes, the lady will smile like sunshine.

97
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,560
 Letter to (her mother): After entering the palace, I'm anxiously missing (you)...

98
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,720
Why are you here?

99
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,250
This is my room.

100
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,370
This is the only room for women here.

101
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,910
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm writing this for my family, so I can tell them the news.

102
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,320
Just in case they worry.

103
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,440
Are you not going home?

104
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,380
I can't.

105
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,830
Why?

106
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,310
If I go home, my family will go through a hard time because of me.

107
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,460
If I go to the Jeongubwon as the palace instructed, I'd have to shave my head, become a monk and not be able to go home.

108
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,390
There's nowhere to go.

109
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,220
Then, will you be with Hwi as husband and wife

110
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,010
and live here?

111
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,660
No.

112
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,620
Why not?

113
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,450
Back then, you were to marry him.

114
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,330
That day, as the wedding fell apart,

115
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,430
our fate also changed.

116
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,440
Then, what are you going to do?

117
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,580
What will you do if you're not Hwi's wife?

118
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,320
Get revenge.

119
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,020
To the people who destroyed my life

120
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,780
and messed up my love, I'll teach

121
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,040
that there are things in this world that you shouldn't do.

122
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,090
That their position is not something you rise to by maximizing greed.

123
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,850
Ambition without mercy is not love.

124
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,160
You've changed.

125
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,650
Did something happen in the palace?

126
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,790
The reason why I am hurting is not that.

127
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,070
His Highness doesn't believe in me.

128
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,170
He can't.

129
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,760
If you're going to live here, you need to take care of yourself.

130
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,340
I'll work. I'll cook and wash clothes. I won't just play around.

131
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,910
You don't know how to do those though.

132
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,080
No one can be good at it from the start.

133
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,780
You have to practice and learn to get better.

134
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,090
I'm good at sewing.

135
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,930
What if you're attacked.

136
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,970
You're just baggage.

137
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,770
You should learn defensive skills from me.

138
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,640
Oh, that'd be great for me.

139
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,360
- Instead... 
 - Instead, what?

140
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,040
Teach me letters.

141
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,370
You want to learn the letters?

142
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,140
I don't want to see Gi Teuk showing off.

143
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,800
He makes fun of me for being illiterate.

144
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,230
If you learn the letters, you can convey your longing feelings.

145
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,030
You can convey things that you can't convey with spoken words.

146
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,420
So cold.

147
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,800
Why do you do stuff like this yourself?

148
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,350
I don't have a maid here.

149
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,800
Give it to me. I'll do it.

150
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,630
Do you know how to do wash clothes?

151
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,480
Since I lived as a prisoner, not a grand prince, for three years,

152
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,920
I can cook, clean, and split firewood.

153
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,140
Gi Teuk and I can build a house without a problem.

154
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,200
- Thank you. 
 - You said you'd live here.

155
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,080
No. If you don't want to be in the Jeongubwon, I'll find you a secret place

156
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,110
and get you a maid who can look after you.

157
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,890
This place is dangerous.

158
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,900
Do not misunderstand.

159
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,030
I'm not staying here because I want to  be with you.

160
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,710
I have things to do, so I stayed. The things that you and the others are doing...

161
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,510
I also want to do them.

162
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,420
You want things back in order in this world.

163
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,450
For that great cause, you had to pretend to be dead, disregarding your loved one.

164
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,110
Because of that, I had to endure unspeakable hardship.

165
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,010
I am not a spectator.

166
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,720
I was sacrificed at the rebellion and victimized by the king's violent rule.

167
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,850
I will give my enemy what they deserve with my own hands.

168
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,850
If you get hurt, I cannot take that.

169
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,820
When I wasn't with you, I was always in danger

170
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,270
and treated badly.

171
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,720
During those three years that you weren't here, during that time you were in exile,

172
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,260
after burying you, do you think I lived at ease?

173
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,010
There was only a brief time when I was happy in this love.

174
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,490
Afterward, it was a long-lasting pain.

175
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,650
I'm not staying here so that I can be with you.

176
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm taking my own path.

177
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,430
What are you doing?

178
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,310
I feel weird.

179
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,770
Are you being jealous again?

180
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,860
I used to hate that woman.

181
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,510
When she was smiling in front of Hwi, my heart used to hurt.

182
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,580
But?

183
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,030
Now that they're fighting, I also hate it.

184
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,000
It hurts here.

185
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,690
You're becoming an adult.

186
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,380
Real love is not when you have that person to yourself.

187
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,550
It's when you wish for them to be happy.

188
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,820
What nonsense is that?

189
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,480
People in love need to be happy together.

190
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,920
Even though it was hard on my body for three years, I liked it

191
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,860
since we were all together.

192
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,500
Was His Highness happy, too?

193
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,810
His Highness, who had left the lady behind, was in pain every day he breathed.

194
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,760
So what? Look at them now.

195
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,180
After meeting her again, he should be happy.

196
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,500
I know.

197
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,090
I cannot do that.

198
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,550
You're now the servant of a new king.

199
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,230
Are you saying you want to deny the rule of the new king?

200
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,240
My daughter who went into the palace was kicked out to the Jeongubwon (a temple of female monks)

201
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,970
and was not able to return to her family.

202
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,200
I do not know if she is alive or dead.

203
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,030
I pushed Grand Prince Eun Seong to his death with my own actions

204
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,990
and ruined my daughter's life.

205
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,590
And now you want me to write a song praising it?

206
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,620
We have to get the consent of the Chinese emperor

207
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,900
in order to establish the stable rule of our kingdom.

208
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,880
If bloodshed were to occur again,

209
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,960
you who denied the king's wish for a Jubon (a formal letter to the Chinese Emperor on the affairs of the state).

210
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,900
Are you threatening me again?

211
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,380
I'm only letting you know of reality.

212
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,820
Since we've put our heads together, we should agree on the general direction.

213
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Woon.

214
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,380
Yes, Your Majesty?

215
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,690
Even though I have become the king, people do not like me.

216
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,740
Your spot allows you to give out orders.

217
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,020
Tell me what you'd like. Everyone will follow.

218
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,180
It feels as if everyone is smirking at me.

219
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,180
I am a king who cannot be acknowledged by Queen Mother.

220
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,050
I am an uncle who stole the throne from his nephew.

221
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,570
I am a brother who killed his own younger brother.

222
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,340
You are the owner of the kingdom.

223
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,470
You are the king who rules over every part of Joseon's eight provinces.

224
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,610
If so, I can't just stay still, can I?

225
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,260
In the name of the servants who declined to write a letter to China, I will have to call the ministers' meeting.

226
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,430
Call for Jo Hwi Gyeong.

227
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,280
I will step on every liege who acts haughtily.

228
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,490
Even if they refuse to play out their part as lieges,

229
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,910
I will play my own role as king.

230
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,970
Have you gotten used to life in the palace?

231
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,870
I am as comfortable here as if this is my house and I was born in the palace.

232
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:54,160
I feel protected having you and Queen Mother above me also.

233
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,150
I started off as a concubine.

234
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,380
I was the daughter of a high-ranking minister, but when the king

235
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,100
asked for a concubine to replace the childless queen, I became a formal royal consort.

236
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,170
A king's path cannot be without women.

237
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,320
The role of a queen is not just to be the wife of a man.

238
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,780
A multi-tasking queen has to be patient and competent.

239
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,380
Are you reprimanding me over what happened with Ja Hyeon?

240
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,580
I too feel what happened to her should not have happened.

241
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,360
However, when you go through the same situation again in the future,

242
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,460
I hope you will be more generous then.

243
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,090
Then, you will be less hurt.

244
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,080
Once I give birth to an heir,

245
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,130
I will be able to be as generous as anyone.

246
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:52,900
What if concubines start showing up here and one of them has a son?

247
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,010
You can't even be certain of your position as the queen.

248
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,150
If you become too anxious about your position,

249
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,210
I worry that you will lose the affection of the king.

250
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,520
Please be careful in your actions.

251
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,350
A drinking event at the Protocol and Cultural Office.

252
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,100
No king has ever humiliated the scholars in this way before.

253
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,320
You're being stubborn,

254
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,020
so the king has to express his displeasure this way.

255
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,260
Why don't you just close your eyes and have a few drinks?

256
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,890
The king prepared this event to console his servants.

257
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,010
Are you going to continue to deny him?

258
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,640
Among all ministers in the court,

259
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,780
someone else will write the letter to China.

260
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,550
You should write it.

261
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,970
Are you threatening me too?

262
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,740
I was close to your deceased father. How dare you!

263
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,890
You must be curious about your daughter's whereabouts, right?

264
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,230
Please burn it after you read it.

265
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,080
 Ja Hyeon's letter to her mother: After entering the palace, I'm anxiously missing you. I'm fine...

266
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,160
Is she okay?

267
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,620
Ja Hyeon's alive?

268
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,540
Please obey Grand Prince Jin Yang.

269
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,560
Become his person.

270
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,020
Be the king's closest confidant,

271
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,680
so that we can prepare for the time when the previous king reclaims the throne.

272
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,160
Is that something that the man who killed Grand Prince Eun Seong while he was in exile should say?

273
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,700
What kind of a trap are you working on?

274
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,390
Just write it as we tell you to.

275
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,550
Become a Joomoonsa (an envoy who delivers the letter) to China.

276
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,420
If he obtains the consent of China, it will be difficult for the former king to reclaim the throne.

277
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,740
It must be you who blocks it, and no one else, Your Excellency.

278
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,950
Why are you doing this?

279
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,690
What are you doing? What is this?

280
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,420
Must you treat a lowly person like me this way?

281
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,990
How dare you be coming in and out of the palace?

282
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,090
His Majesty ordered us to enter the palace because

283
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,680
he was hosting a banquet on behalf of loyal servants.

284
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,790
Do you not know that this is not a private house?

285
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,180
This is not a place for you to freely come and leave when you are called.

286
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,110
Because you've sullied the honorable place of learning,

287
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,300
the ministers' resentment is sky high.

288
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,700
It was the king's order.

289
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,680
What would happen if someone lowly like me refused the king's order?

290
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,350
I would die.

291
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,980
Your existence is lowering the honor of His Majesty.

292
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,760
As a queen, I cannot let this simply happen anymore.

293
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,210
The king still needs me.

294
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,650
Are you the only gisaeng?

295
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,220
In order to relieve yourself of the lowly station and become noble,

296
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,240
I know that you're eyeing the position of a concubine.

297
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,730
The king gave me a promise, that's all.

298
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,050
What do we do?

299
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,680
You can't be a concubine if you have a scar on your body.

300
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,950
I have a clean body.

301
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,070
There is no nick or scar on it.

302
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,370
Proceed.

303
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,520
You know what this is?  It's mercury.

304
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,430
Do you know what happens when this poison enters your eye?

305
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,220
Your Highness! Please spare me.

306
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,230
If you don't approve, I will not receive it.

307
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,960
It won't get in the way of selling your body going forward.

308
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,300
But you can't become a concubine!

309
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,680
Your Highness! Your Highness!

310
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,780
Your Highness! Please spare me!

311
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,610
She's pretending to be strong, but how hard it must be for her.

312
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,830
This won't do.

313
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,470
I will have to send Kkeut Dan to look after her.

314
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,350
Please tell her to be careful on her way there and back.

315
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,580
We can't be found to be suspicious.

316
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,510
Your Excellency, I know enough to know that much.

317
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,430
I think Ja Hyeon will be the way she is.

318
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,310
What will happen to our son who hasn't passed the entry level?

319
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,980
No matter what I decide, will you believe in me?

320
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:52,170
I know that we've been doing everything for the sake of the family.

321
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,950
Do as you would like.

322
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,420
 A memorial to the Emperor of Ming. Lee Kang seeks the imperial consent of the Emperor of Ming for his ascension.

323
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,300
Looks like the chief scholar has come around.

324
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,190
Isn't he the best writer in all of our nation?

325
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,610
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

326
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,080
Appoint the envoy who will deliver this letter.

327
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:25,270
Before that, you have to take care of the former king.

328
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,390
How many times must I tell you?

329
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,950
If we bother that young child, the people will not leave us alone.

330
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,900
People are still noisy about Grand Prince Eun Seong who died in exile.

331
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,540
If we touch the former king, it could be difficult to handle.

332
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,310
When he grows up, he will have to marry.

333
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,900
And if he has children,

334
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,900
people could believe he is the right path under the principle.

335
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,150
If you don't nip it in the bud,

336
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,800
you could suffer for the rest of your life.

337
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,070
But we don't have the justification at the moment,

338
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,320
an excuse to harass a young child who gave up his throne peacefully.

339
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,990
I have something to tell you.

340
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,220
Jo Hwi Gyeong keeps putting in messages,

341
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,180
asking to meet with the king.

342
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,500
Cut her off.

343
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,070
I will meet her myself and take care of it,

344
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,700
so do not let him be distracted by a lowly gisaeng.

345
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,940
If you want to make yourself beyond anyone's reach,

346
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,200
you have to stay two steps away.

347
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,340
Try to touch me.

348
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,620
If you have a weapon, then two more steps.

349
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,260
- Attack me.
 - Me?

350
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,850
I'll show you how to block the attack.

351
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,830
Roo Si Gae, Wait! Wait!

352
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,090
Roo Si Gae, one moment!

353
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,280
Roo Si Gae!

354
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,070
- Kkeut Dan! 
- Have you gone nuts?!

355
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,070
- Let me go!
-  Kkeut Dan!

356
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,520
Let me go!

357
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,040
It's not what you think. I was learning self-defense from her.

358
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,900
How dare you! Go die!

359
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,460
- Let go! 
 - Stop!

360
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,250
- Stop it! 
 - Let go!

361
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,680
Ow, gosh!

362
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,640
Lady.

363
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,080
I thought you were a warrior.

364
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,800
-  You're not that impressive.
- That little...

365
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,550
You. Don't act high and mighty with me.

366
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,790
You can't even do anything when someone yanks your hair.

367
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,300
- Bring it on!
 - Yeah, why not?

368
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,020
Come here. Come here! Let go.

369
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,090
Stop it. Stop it.

370
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,130
Let me go.

371
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,460
Are you okay?

372
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,310
Let's go.

373
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,190
Then, are you punishing him right now?

374
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,520
What punishment?

375
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,040
It's just that my heart won't let go.

376
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,840
He went to war, then went missing in a foreign land,

377
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,490
then he was in exile and then he pretended to be dead in front of me.

378
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,780
He made me go through hell countless times.

379
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,140
But he couldn't bear it for just once... and he doubted me.

380
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:14,260
Well, that was because of the situation he was in. That's what the whole world had thought.

381
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,390
Even if the whole world misunderstands me and is deceived,

382
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,380
he shouldn't be doing that to me.

383
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,300
No matter what happened

384
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,160
I always trusted him.

385
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,450
That's why I was able to stake everything.

386
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,870
Lady.

387
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,590
What is this?

388
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,370
It's a piece of land with a house in the Gimpo Prefecture.

389
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,870
Leave the capital for the time being and take some time for recuperation.

390
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,220
Is this the price of my eye?

391
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,910
Grant me an audience with His Majesty.

392
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,000
He's busy and falling behind in the affairs of state.

393
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,170
It will be difficult to meet him any time soon.

394
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,370
He used me as a spy when he was in need,

395
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:09,170
and he summoned me for the slightest matter even after his enthronement.

396
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,080
Are you saying you have no use for a person blind in one eye?

397
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,610
Watch what you say.

398
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,670
His Majesty has not forgotten you.

399
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,260
It's just not the right time.

400
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,460
I don't need anything else.

401
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,400
I'm asking you to let me meet with His Majesty.

402
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,910
I've been patient, but your ill manners know no bounds.

403
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,980
This is why even the queen couldn't help but

404
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,580
go so far as to punish you.

405
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,340
You will get to see him one day if you wait patiently.

406
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,610
Leave the capital and live quietly!

407
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,320
What did I do wrong that I have to "wait patiently"?

408
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,330
You are biting the hand that fed you.

409
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,300
The payoff for staking my life to raise him to the throne

410
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,210
is to dig my eye out?

411
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,580
You could've died without a trace.

412
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,880
Given your contribution to the great cause,

413
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,470
that is why we left you alive.

414
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,600
So be grateful,

415
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,190
and wait quietly.

416
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,870
I just took care of a headache for you.

417
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,940
Did I ever ask you to?

418
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,480
Then were you planning on letting a gisaeng enter the palace?

419
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,660
I was going to listen to all of the resentment

420
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,520
and keep you from being soiled with muddy water.  That was my sincere desire.

421
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,910
Given the numerous unpleasant rumors about your involvement with women,

422
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,700
do you want to have a scandal involving a gisaeng as well?

423
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,450
I used the means to ensure there would be no more noise.

424
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,540
Why do you always kick up a ruckus without even asking me?

425
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,350
Why do you do things you weren't even asked to do?

426
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,880
Don't get ahead of yourself.

427
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,420
Ignoring the basic orders turns into treason.

428
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,790
Please give me some sense of security.

429
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,560
We still do not have an heir.

430
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,530
I will bear you a son.

431
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,040
A son as healthy as you.

432
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,350
Thus, I will stabilize this nation.

433
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,140
Many queens, once they give birth to a prince,

434
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,000
are known to choose their sons over their husbands.

435
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,500
- What do you mean? 
 - History tells us.

436
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,810
The husband is the setting sun,

437
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,750
and the son is the rising sun, after all.

438
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,650
A woman's heart is not like that.

439
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,510
Wanting to bear a child that resembles her beloved husband

440
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,150
is a wish that every woman has.

441
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,310
What you want is to bear a son who will be king, isn't it?

442
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:32,170
A new king to take on the next reign.

443
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:54,290
You weren't able to wash properly because there was no one to prepare the water, right?

444
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,900
I'm here, so you can have a bath today,

445
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,520
and have a refreshing sleep, okay?

446
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,990
You don't have to do this.

447
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:07,180
What's wrong? You were such a clean freak at home.

448
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,820
Then, wait outside. I can take care of it myself.

449
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,570
You've grown distant during my absence!

450
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,730
Lady, if you do this, I'll feel hurt.

451
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,700
Stop it.

452
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,900
Lady.

453
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,700
Let me see.

454
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,880
Kkeut Dan, that is—

455
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,810
Who did this to you?

456
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,950
Were you tortured when you were in the palace?

457
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,040
No.

458
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,990
Let me see.

459
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,300
I told you to stop!

460
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,180
We received news from Jo Hwi Gyeong.

461
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,870
Have they caught on?

462
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,650
She has lost an eye.

463
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,590
How so?

464
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,900
The jealous queen was worried that Jo Hwi Gyeong could  become a concubine,

465
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,670
so she made her go blind in one eye, they say,

466
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,350
because one cannot become a concubine if one has a disability.

467
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,590
How impressive,  really.

468
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,450
The rule from the inner court is something too.

469
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,100
If she treated a gisaeng in such a manner...

470
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,180
That's why she even tried to turn our lady into a female monk.

471
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,370
How dare you interrupt an adults' conversation. Are you taking after Roo Si Gae?

472
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,580
I have something to say about our lady.

473
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,240
She entrusted that to me

474
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,510
before she went to meet Grand Prince Jin Yang.

475
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,490
I was told to send it to you if something happened to her.

476
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,430
But I thought you were dead,

477
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,530
so how was I supposed to deliver it to you?

478
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,300
I was holding onto it all this while.

479
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,450
 My dearest love, my Hwi.

480
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,250
 You were the one who woke me up when I was slumbering.

481
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,090
 You were my teacher, my lover,

482
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,920
 and yet another me.

483
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,740
 Through you, I will keep living the life I couldn't complete.

484
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,860
 Therefore, don't be too sad.

485
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,340
 One day, as you were leaving for war,

486
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,200
 you said that your life was mine.

487
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,250
 Your life indeed is mine too.

488
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,910
 I will leave first and wait for you.

489
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,670
 Please come to me

490
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,630
 after having lived a long life.

491
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,990
 I will become a flower and wait for you.

492
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,460
This is...

493
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,010
something she wrote waiting for her death.

494
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,590
I was helping her wash,

495
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,620
and I saw signs of torture on her body.

496
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:41,180
Do you understand it now?

497
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,610
My lady is someone who couldn't go to anyone else,

498
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,930
even if she died.

499
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,060
Go outside.

500
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,030
It is late at night. If you have something to say, say it in daylight.

501
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:16,490
Go outside, I said!

502
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,820
Why are you being like that to someone who has no one else but you?

503
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,170
Ow, wait.

504
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,130
No, no, why are you doing this?

505
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:00,510
How painful was it?

506
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,170
What kind of hell was it for you?

507
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,500
I'll kill them.

508
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,080
I'll get rid of them all.

509
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,600
The scars remain,

510
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,270
but I was able to protect myself.

511
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,160
The scars will remain.

512
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,110
I did not doubt you.

513
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,100
I did not waver.

514
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:49,280
I just hated myself

515
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,830
for not being able to protect you.

516
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,910
I know.

517
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,070
You should just throw me away.

518
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,150
Until your fragile body was broken,

519
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,500
what hardship did you endure?

520
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,550
Would you have done that, if it were you, Your Highness?

521
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,350
You couldn't.

522
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,040
Did you try to die?

523
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,650
I did at first,

524
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,700
but after burying you, I wanted to give my enemy what they deserved.

525
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:46,030
I tried to kill your brother with my own hands.

526
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,350
I was punished for the crime of treason.

527
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,140
Grand Prince Jin Yang is not without blame,

528
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,980
so the queen brought down the penalty of

529
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,760
sending me to Jeongubwon and buried the incident.

530
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,780
I am now a different person.

531
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,410
From one who wanted to learn to paint and ride horses,

532
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,960
to one who thought of killing someone and actually attempting to.

533
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,620
I've become someone like that.

534
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,870
I am

535
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:35,690
not the Ja Hyeon whom

536
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,550
you loved in the past.

537
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,600
♫   To a place no one knows  ♫

538
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,580
♫   When I get there,   ♫

539
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,760
It is my wrongdoing.

540
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,050
Do not forgive me.

541
00:49:53,050 --> 00:50:05,680
♫    Following this path, following you, I'm wandering   ♫

542
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,340
Are they fighting again?

543
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,930
His Highness is probably apologizing profusely to her.

544
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,330
What did he do wrong?

545
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,750
Someone as simple as you

546
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,430
couldn't possibly know what goes on between a man and woman.

547
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:31,210
You don't know, either. You don't have a man, either.

548
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:36,650
It's not that I don't have one, but I reject them.

549
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,040
On top, there's the young master back at the noble household.

550
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,240
And the servants all down below.

551
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,310
There's a line full of men who want to be with me.

552
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,000
But, why haven't you gotten married?

553
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,250
That's because I'm serving my lady.

554
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,720
Then, you'll never get married.

555
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,080
I will get married!

556
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,330
What is the reason for you wanting to see me?

557
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,800
I need to know who you are working for

558
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,120
and what you want to know.

559
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,090
I am someone who lost his father at the hands of the rebels.

560
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,230
I want to know who my real enemy is.

561
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,180
 Cashier Record Books

562
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:34,580
If I give you the information, do you have power behind you to use it?

563
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,430
I'm asking if you could fight the king.

564
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:45,530
If you don't, you'll end up losing your life and the truth will be buried.

565
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,660
Come in, please.

566
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,800
This is my truth.

567
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,960
I long for it from time to time.

568
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,990
The time when I was a grand prince and went hunting with you.

569
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,550
Why are you reliving the memory?

570
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,070
You can order it now and go hunting.

571
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,980
All of the eight regions in Joseon are yours, Your Majesty.

572
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,210
But if I did, the people would get tired of it.

573
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:44,120
I will satisfy myself by practicing shooting.

574
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,860
- Your Majesty!
 - Your Majesty!

575
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,040
Your Majesty!

576
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,520
Your Majesty!

577
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:30,150
It's poison.  Someone has tried to harm you.

578
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,830
Your Majesty!

579
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:49,960
 Cashier Record Book

580
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,220
They paid off not only the assassins but also the palace staff.

581
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,970
Look here.  The palace guards and the military,

582
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:01,910
even the court ladies are being paid monthly.

583
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,950
They've spent this kind of money and prepared it for so long.

584
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:12,470
He brought together all these people.

585
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,870
I was foolish.

586
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,170
I didn't even know how wide his network of cooperators was.

587
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:22,110
I just went against him out of anger.

588
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,900
I was a  naive fool.  I have no right to say anything about what was done to me.

589
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,920
These people are the bad ones. You did nothing wrong.

590
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,500
- Why? 
 - I feel like you've become my true peer.

591
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:55,000
Even though I cannot fight well like Roo Si Gae, I will still go with you, Your Highness.

592
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,630
Even if I say you can't, you won't listen, right?

593
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,560
I don't even have anywhere to go.

594
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:23,190
The poison that was on the arrow is made from the root of bridal head flower (aconite).

595
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,720
That's poisonous, too?

596
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,930
It's used in the (poison) tonic for criminals on death row.

597
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,730
It was mixed in with the grounded stone coating the arrow.

598
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,140
You were injured when you drew back the arrow because of the poisoned grounded stone.

599
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,120
and the poison penetrated through the injury.

600
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,900
I was worried that a day like this would come.

601
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,230
The former king who's alive and keeps growing...

602
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,090
- Uncle. 
 - Study the situation.

603
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,440
If you're going to sleep at ease, that's the only way.

604
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,650
Your position is logical, Uncle.

605
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:20,600
It is a negative action for the benefit of the king.

606
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,420
It hasn't been too long since Eun Seong died. To bother my young nephew again

607
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,130
will cause huge consequences for the government.

608
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,800
There's no way that Queen Mother would stay still.

609
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,710
You shouldn't tell her but have it forced upon her.

610
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:42,950
If that's hard, you have the option of exiling him first.

611
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,700
Get them all out of here.

612
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,160
Yes.

613
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,060
Who ordered you to do it?

614
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,890
Are you not going to answer?

615
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,910
Let go!  Let go of me!

616
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,860
We've done nothing wrong.

617
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,200
Why are you doing this?

618
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,720
We really haven't...

619
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,430
Your Highness, they will demote the former king as Prince Seung Pyung and kick him out of the palace altogether.

620
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,480
Where are they sending that child?

621
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,680
They feel those who want to reinstate the former king

622
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,710
are a threat to the king,

623
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:37,250
so they arrested the servants from the queen's quarters.

624
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,160
- Escort him.
 - Yes.

625
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,980
How dare you?  What are you doing?

626
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,850
Where are you taking His Majesty?

627
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,890
Mother! Mother!

628
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,930
You can't! You can't!

629
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,530
Where are you taking His Majesty?

630
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,640
Mother!

631
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,880
I'll go. I'll go, I said!

632
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,230
Your Highness. Your Highness.

633
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,250
- No, you can't! You can't.
 - Your Highness!

634
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,200
Your Highness.

635
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,430
Grandmother! Grandmother!

636
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,710
Queen Dowager, please save him!

637
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,030
Who dares to treat my grandson—

638
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:27,520
How dare you try to kick out the former king!

639
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:33,170
It's been decided unanimously by the ministers of the court.

640
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,550
He has two queens who are alive,

641
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:39,220
but with no discussion with us, how dare you act this way?

642
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,130
You can never take him!

643
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,890
We are only following the royal order.

644
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,570
Bring the king!

645
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,850
I've been given a promise by the king.

646
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:51,520
That promise has already been broken.

647
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,550
What behavior is this, Your Majesty?

648
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:57,990
Your Highness' son is

649
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,090
Joseon's king on the throne right now.

650
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,060
I almost died from poison.

651
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:13,160
Even if he's the former king, if he's a danger to the current king, he could be considered a traitor.

652
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,620
What would the young former king know about this?

653
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,690
We know nothing of it.

654
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,900
Did you not say you'd spare his life?

655
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,020
That's why I'm stopping at an exile.

656
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,460
Since I don't have proof, I can't order death.

657
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,590
Why don't you dethrone the queen instead?

658
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,840
He is too young to be without his mother.

659
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,390
Have you forgotten?

660
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:40,660
When I was even younger than him, I was living alone outside of the palace.

661
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,870
- Your Majesty. 
 - You can't!

662
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:54,290
- You can't! 
 - Grandmother!

663
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:57,590
- You can't! 
 - Grandmother!

664
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:58,770
Your Majesty!

665
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,270
- Grandmother! 
 - You can't!

666
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,740
You can't!

667
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,220
Grandmother!

668
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,260
Your Majesty!

669
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,960
- Your Majesty! 
 - Mother!

670
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,750
Grandmother!

671
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,770
Your Majesty!

672
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:29,160
Please keep your promise.  Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

673
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,020
You feel sad for your grandson,

674
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,310
but you do not worry about your son, who almost died?

675
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,270
What would that child know?

676
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:41,020
What would the queen who lost everything have done?

677
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:46,200
Your grandson's fate is in your hands.

678
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,750
The higher ups have to show respect for the king

679
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,730
in order for the servants and the people to follow.

680
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:58,700
But, you seem as though you haven't made up your mind.

681
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,650
Are you saying that you want to make a deal

682
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,770
over your young nephew's life?

683
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,740
It is what I learned from you.

684
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,060
Please come to my side.

685
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:17,690
Please take action so that the servants will stop mocking me.

686
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:22,800
If that happens, those with treasonous minds

687
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,810
will do away with their ill intentions.

688
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,120
You have to dethrone the queen.

689
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,800
With the former king sent into exile,

690
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,240
his mother cannot continue to be queen.  Not possible.

691
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,220
If we send her out into the world,

692
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,320
she will contact her son in exile or form a rebellious movement.

693
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,970
It's better to keep her in the palace.

694
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:53,220
Under the circumstance, I cannot treat her like a senior the way I used to.

695
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,320
What do you want to do, then?

696
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,480
Say that she's been dethroned as per the proper protocol

697
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,650
but that she's living at the palace by the grace of Queen Mother.

698
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,790
Doing it this way, she can save face.

699
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,660
Your Majesty!

700
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,570
Your Majesty!

701
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,310
Your Majesty.

702
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,770
Your Majesty!

703
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,360
Former king!

704
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,680
Your Majesty.

705
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,890
  Uncle.

706
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,530
  I will take you.

707
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,020
Your Majesty.

708
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,270
Without his mother and his grandmother,

709
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:52,810
that young former king was sent into exile by himself.

710
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:05,450
Why did you call me?

711
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:11,950
In special recognition of your service in slaying Grand Pince Eun Seong,

712
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,380
I've called for you.

713
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:21,630
For His Majesty, will you do anything, no matter what?

714
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,880
His Majesty is my ruler but before that,

715
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,580
he's the one who avenged my father's death.

716
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,420
In his name, there is nothing

717
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,790
I cannot do.

718
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,560
This is chowoo.

719
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,190
Isn't this poison?

720
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:49,000
There is someone you need to get rid of, with this.

721
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,490
You won't be able to have security with you,

722
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:57,390
so we will give you someone to protect you.

723
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,370
Why are you bringing in someone else, when I could be doing the work?

724
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:22,750
I have to check one more time to see if he is one of us or not.

725
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:27,420
If Do Jung Gook can't take care of it, you will finish it.

726
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,180
That is why I called for both of you.

727
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,220
Over there.

728
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,700
Here.

729
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,230
Hurry up.

730
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,260
Right.

731
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:12,910
Let's go.  Hurry.

732
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,310
 Usurpation of the throne notice: The current throne occupant, Yi Kang,

733
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:33,450
 usurped the throne from the young king in exile in a treasonous manner.

734
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,020
 As his blood brother, I urge the people to help me rectify this situation.

735
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:46,370

736
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:56,040
♫   Believing and believing   ♫

737
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,980
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love

738
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,180
 What is this?

739
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,790
  Is it poison again?

740
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,960
 We didn't make a move.

741
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,000
 So who tried to kill Hyungnim?

742
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,400
 How big is this group of traitors

743
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,230
 that they're disturbing the capital like this?

744
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,720
  My brother will not stay still about this. Let's attack my uncle.

745
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,820
 If they are careless, it will create a gap. Lower the guards around them.

746
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,130
 We have to take every step.  We have to save His Majesty.

747
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,470
  Your Majesty, Grand Prince Yang Ahn is a traitor!

748
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,200
 Why did you do it?

749
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,400
 You made me into a puppet.

750
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,540
  Grand Prince: Drawing Love
