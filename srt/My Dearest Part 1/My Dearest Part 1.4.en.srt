1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,349
What are you thinking about?

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,750
On the day of Grandpa Song Chu's
60th wedding anniversary party,

5
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,019
did you see who Lady Gil Chae looked...

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,059
as soon as she heard the news of the war?

7
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,899
They...

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,000
took His Majesty captive!

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,539
She looked at Young Master Yeon Jun.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,880
I knew it.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,450
Did I...

12
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,890
look at that stone?

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,829
And I saw who Gil Chae was looking.

14
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,040
(My Dearest)

15
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,409
(Episode 4)

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,150
This is the fastest way to Heomcheon.

17
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,480
If you go this way, you will see a tavern
before the three-way intersection.

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,549
If you mention my name,

19
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,189
the lady will add one more
ladleful of broth to your soup...

20
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,219
Thanks.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,260
Let us get going.

22
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,290
Let us get going too, Gu Jam.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,790
Right.

24
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,400
Are you not coming with us?

25
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,299
I told you.

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,930
I have no intention
of joining the volunteer army.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,569
I simply followed you to see
how you handle...

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,909
my precious horses and armor.

29
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,680
It seems you have learned
the way to handle the horse.

30
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,739
I will be going now. Let us go.

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,189
A man as cowardly as him
cannot possibly be from a noble family.

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,920
The rumor that
he bought himself a new identity...

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,719
to become the nobility must be true.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Look.

35
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,090
He is a savior who lent us his horses.

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,900
He simply wants to impress the ladies.

37
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,629
Let us go.

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,080
I boasted to Jong Jong
that I was joining the volunteer army.

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,180
Look where we are. This is embarrassing.

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,120
Goodness, I am famished.

41
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,990
Should I cook?

42
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,659
By the way, why are we here?

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,259
We should be fleeing
to somewhere further away.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,699
This is the only path
the foreign intruders can take.

45
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,629
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,099
Considering the state of things,

47
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,000
we must ask for reinforcement.

48
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,800
They promised to preserve the government
as long as Joseon became...

49
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,669
their subject...

50
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,110
You have not learned anything.

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,479
You trust the foreign intruders' words?

52
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,550
Have you forgotten
about the Jingkang Incident?

53
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,479
(The Jingkang Incident was an incident
where Jin Dynasty besieged...)

54
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,750
(and sacked the imperial palaces
of Northern Song Dynasty.)

55
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,919
When the soldiers
of the Jin Dynasty besieged the palace,

56
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,620
Emperor Qinzong left the palace,
trusting the words...

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,759
that they would preserve the government.

58
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,030
But the foreign intruders
of the Jin Dynasty took...

59
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,569
Emperor Qinzong and his 3,000 men to Jin.

60
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:52,800
They made the emperor and ministers' women
their concubines and prostitutes.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,469
(Changgi: prostitute)

62
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,009
And yet you want to trust their words
and leave the palace...

63
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,409
to preserve the government.

64
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,080
They are trying to talk us
into leaving the palace...

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,819
only to repeat what they did
during the Jingkang Incident?

66
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,219
Do you not realize that?

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,789
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,659
Emperor Qinzong refused to listen
to General Zongwang when he suggested...

69
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,789
that they attack the retreating Jin army.

70
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,329
Instead, he dismissed
the general from office.

71
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,930
As a result,
the spirit of the soldiers was dampened,

72
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,870
and they never recovered from it.

73
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,540
You must prepare for the final battle...

74
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,810
and raise the spirit of the soldiers.

75
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,449
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

76
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,769
Thinking about you
protecting the palace...

77
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,339
in this bitter coldness,
wearing shabby clothes,

78
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,480
and eating the bare minimum,

79
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:12,379
I am agonized as if
my whole body is poked with needles.

80
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,949
However, the negotiation for peace
is already out of the question,

81
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,360
and war is the only option we have got.

82
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,790
If reinforcements arrive
from all areas and aid us,

83
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,600
we will be able to defeat the enemies
without a doubt.

84
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Hold out until
the reinforcement arrives...

85
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,639
and serve the country together.

86
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,439
That is...

87
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,569
one noble command, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,310
- That is one noble command, Your Majesty.
- That is one noble command, Your Majesty.

89
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,149
That is one noble command, Your Majesty.

90
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,269
Soon Yak.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,040
- Father.
- Boy.

92
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,290
Why did that stone get involved?

93
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,230
By the way, why did I look at him
at the news of the war?

94
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,389
No way.

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,459
Eun Ae must have seen it wrong.

96
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,529
Right, Jong Jong?

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,199
I saw it too.

98
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,870
What?

99
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,870
I was startled when I heard
the news that the war had broken out,

100
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,509
and I naturally looked at you.

101
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,439
And I found you looking at
that man who does not believe in...

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,339
I mean, Young Master Jang Hyun.

103
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:47,779
Me?

104
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,779
Why did I?

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,180
Why on earth would I look at that stone,

106
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,519
that plant-like man,
the man who does not believe in marriage?

107
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,620
Gil Chae.

108
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,529
You put your hair up?

109
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,490
They only discussed our marriage,

110
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,199
but I consider myself
Young Master Yeon Jun's wife.

111
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
You are like his wife.

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,970
She is unbelievable.

113
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,810
Anyway, Gil Chae.

114
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,879
I am on my way to pray at Seonghwangdang.

115
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,939
Do you want to come along?

116
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,810
Let us go and pray for
the young masters' safe return.

117
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,649
I have never done this before.

118
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,500
Gosh, it is cold.

119
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,769
Here.

120
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,379
Please.

121
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,110
Dear God,
please protect the young masters.

122
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,649
Please keep
the young masters warm on a cold day.

123
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,149
Please illuminate their paths.

124
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,290
- Please.
- Protect them from swords.

125
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:02,889
When they encounter the foreign intruders,

126
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,019
help the young masters break
their limbs and grind their bones.

127
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,120
Make their brains burst,
their skins peeled,

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
and their necks twisted.

129
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,899
Make sure they never
invade our land again.

130
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,329
Dear God,
please protect the young masters.

131
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,769
Please keep
the young masters warm on a cold day.

132
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,069
Please illuminate their paths.

133
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,159
My arm!

134
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,299
My arm.

135
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,470
My arm...

136
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,240
Hey!

137
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,509
Soon Yak!

138
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,649
That is odd.

139
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,659
I brought Lady Gil Chae's perfume pouch.

140
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Physician! Is there a physician around?

141
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,799
You.

142
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,100
You fancy Lady Gil Chae, do you not?

143
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,769
Lady Gil Chae...

144
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,470
fancied you too.

145
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,509
But because...

146
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,620
you got engaged to Lady Eun Ae,

147
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,850
a bloke like myself had a chance too.

148
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,220
Soon Yak.

149
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,120
I was lucky...

150
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,429
Had I known this would happen,

151
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:53,970
I would have told her...

152
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,529
that day.

153
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,269
Look, I fixed the swing.

154
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,549
Give it a little push, will you?

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,820
- Pardon me?
- Hurry.

156
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,590
Right. Sure thing.

157
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,120
All right.

158
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,330
There!

159
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:24,559
- Harder. Push harder.
- Harder?

160
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,070
My, the breeze feels so nice.

161
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,840
There!

162
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,779
My lady!

163
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,620
She has no idea.

164
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,519
Thanks to her,

165
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,850
I...

166
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,889
became a real man.

167
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,659
To me,

168
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,600
she is...

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
Soon Yak.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
Hey.

171
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,409
Soon Yak!

172
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,809
Soon Yak!

173
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,850
Soon Yak...

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,570
General Kwon Jung Gil's army
from Gangwon Province...

175
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,240
and even Governor Jung Se Kyu's army
in Chungcheong Province lost.

176
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,940
Even Lee Eui Bae's army lost
on their way to rescue them.

177
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,009
What are they trying to do?

178
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,649
How come they are focused
on killing off the reinforcements...

179
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,820
instead of attacking the Palace
where I am?

180
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,620
Now, I know...

181
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,190
what they are trying to do.

182
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,230
Do you remember the Battle of Dalinghe?

183
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,570
In the Year of Sinmi,
Jin besieged Ming's Dalinghe...

184
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,600
with its 40,000 soldiers.

185
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
They dug deep trenches
around the fortress...

186
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,110
and beat all the reinforcements
to isolate Dalinghe.

187
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,149
It is exactly what
the foreign intruders are doing now.

188
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,419
As they remained besieged,
they started running out of food.

189
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,750
So some soldiers killed the workers
who were building the fortress walls...

190
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,659
and ate them.

191
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:40,970
When Dalinghe surrendered
and opened the fortress gates,

192
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,740
only half
of the 30,000 Dalinghe residents...

193
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,769
remained alive,

194
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,509
which means 15,000 residents...

195
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,250
did not die while fighting.

196
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,610
They starved to death.

197
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,690
They are trying...

198
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,289
to besiege us and lock us in
so that we would starve to death.

199
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:30,009
My arm...

200
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,620
Where is my arm?

201
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,250
My arm...

202
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,419
Where is my arm?

203
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,059
My arm!

204
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,230
Jun Jeol.

205
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,730
You must survive, no matter what.

206
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,429
My arm.

207
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,169
My arm!

208
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,110
We have done our best.

209
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,110
Let us return.

210
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,409
When we are so close to His Majesty?

211
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,049
I will head back.

212
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,720
I wish to return to Neunggun-ri.

213
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,529
If you wish to return, go for it.

214
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,399
I will keep going by myself.

215
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,210
Hey.

216
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,789
I dozed off.

217
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,210
Where did he go?

218
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,379
Jang Hyun!

219
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,549
What is it?

220
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,360
I hear the horses.

221
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,399
They are coming.

222
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,500
They will loot the village down there
and make their way up.

223
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,269
I will go up that mountain...

224
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,169
and make smoke signals
to inform the other villages.

225
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:40,340
You should take Ryang Eum
and hide in that place I told you about.

226
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,480
Oh, Ryang Eum went to the village.

227
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,049
What?

228
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,750
When?

229
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:52,559
Earlier. He said he had to go
to the village to get something.

230
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,899
I will go and find Ryang Eum.

231
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,169
Go up the mountain
and raise the smoke signal.

232
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,870
Keep the smoke going for hours.
Do you understand?

233
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,379
Yes.

234
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,710
Come and have a look.

235
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,080
My goodness.

236
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,450
Come here and have a look.

237
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,779
I just received a new shipment from Qing.

238
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,019
There are many rare items.

239
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,190
Take your time and browse around.

240
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,929
Goodness. This is too old.

241
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,440
I am sorry. I lost the dagger you gave me.

242
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,149
My gosh!

243
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,089
How did you...

244
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,500
Come along.

245
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:48,970
I am sorry.

246
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,180
You said you had lost the dagger, so...

247
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,809
Did I ask you to get a new one?

248
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,390
If something bad had happened to you...

249
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,799
Let us go.

250
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,470
Once again,

251
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,339
he saved me.

252
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:29,009
- Please protect them.
- Dear deities.

253
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,019
- Protect them so they can return safely.
- Please...

254
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,920
Please protect them.

255
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,619
Dear deities,
please protect our young masters.

256
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,690
- Please...
- Please... Ouch.

257
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,000
Their legs must not feel numb,
unlike my legs.

258
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,400
- Be quiet.
- Gosh.

259
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
- Oh, no.
- Please help them.

260
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,240
Please watch over them.

261
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:03,049
Please watch over them and keep them safe.

262
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,250
Please keep them safe.

263
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,019
And do me a favor.

264
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:10,849
Over there.

265
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,990
If you see smoke
from the top of that mountain,

266
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,130
promise to flee.

267
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,170
Please help them.

268
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,569
However,

269
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,470
there had not been any intruders
even in the Year of Jeongmyo.

270
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,380
How can you be certain that the smoke
is signaling the arrival of our enemies?

271
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,849
That is what that man,
Lee Jang Hyun, clearly told me.

272
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,220
He told me to flee when I saw the smoke.

273
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,380
She is saying that is what Jang Hyun said.

274
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,450
Lee Jang Hyun.

275
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,460
It is a mystery what goes on in his head.

276
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,289
But he has always been sincere
with everything he told us.

277
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,940
Madam Bang Doo.

278
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
We ought to pack this too.

279
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,680
My lady.

280
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,009
- Pack water or silk. Pack the silk first.
- Okay.

281
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,819
Gosh. We should leave the cauldron behind.

282
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,039
Dig deeper.

283
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,039
Yes, my lady.

284
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,079
My lady,
how could you worry about your shoes now?

285
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,519
These are the most valuable things I have.

286
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,670
No!

287
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,150
Where are you headed?

288
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,619
I am thinking about going to Uiseong.

289
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,589
Be safe.

290
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,859
Please be safe.

291
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,359
Listen carefully.

292
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,630
At times like this, the only thing...

293
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,259
women must remember
is to keep their chastity, nothing else.

294
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,960
When women are violated
by the foreign intruders,

295
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,599
they will face death.

296
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,470
And how could women continue to live...

297
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,470
even after a brief encounter?

298
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,210
Please stop.

299
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,710
Let us go, Eun Ae.

300
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,809
Keep that in mind.

301
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Let us go.

302
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh, right.

303
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,410
I forgot to put the lid on the jar.

304
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,940
Go on with the ladies
and wait for me at the dock.

305
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,549
Yes? Go ahead.

306
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,329
Please get on the boat.

307
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,630
All right. Please get on the boat first.

308
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
Gil Chae,
you should get on the boat first.

309
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,970
You too, Eun Ae.

310
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,470
No! I do not want to go!

311
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,279
You should cross the river first
with Young Chae and Je Nam.

312
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,380
I will cross the river
with Jong Jong after you.

313
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,210
He does not want to ride the boat with me.

314
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,619
They need your protection.

315
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,920
I will cross the river with Gil Chae.

316
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,450
Eun Ae.

317
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
But where is Grandma Yi Rang?

318
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,750
What?

319
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,890
What are you doing here?

320
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,420
Gosh.

321
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,259
The intruders are always
accompanied by the crows.

322
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:21,630
It was just like this ten years ago.

323
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,240
They must be close.

324
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,740
You noticed that too...

325
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,880
at our 60th wedding anniversary party,
right?

326
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,319
The masters wore the clothes
they cherished the most.

327
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,849
Given the walking speed
of the ladies and the masters,

328
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,859
the intruders will catch them in no time.

329
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,700
I have killed a lot of those intruders
back in my day.

330
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,869
Let us get rid of them quickly
and join them.

331
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,619
They have all fled.

332
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,319
Find the silk they have hidden...

333
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,420
and women who have not fled yet.

334
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:21,890
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

335
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,339
I have found silk!

336
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:04,829
Who is it?

337
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,400
Find the men who are ambushing us!

338
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,769
- Father...
- We cannot take the boat.

339
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,869
We must find another way.

340
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,539
We must take another path.

341
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,940
Where?

342
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,569
Get up. We must go.

343
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,809
- We must go now.
- Yes.

344
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:04,359
It is him.

345
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,349
Hey!

346
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:17,730
You old devils.

347
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,299
You bought time by tricking us.

348
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,369
The women and the money must be...

349
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:22,970
somewhere nearby.

350
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,039
Go find them.

351
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,799
No.

352
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,380
Let us go.

353
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,279
I will take you to a physician.

354
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,299
Do not say that.

355
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,240
You must meet a better man next time.

356
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,119
Right.

357
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,519
Let us...

358
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,319
meet again in the next life
as man and wife.

359
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,529
I will become a successful farmer
and give you a good life.

360
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,099
Never mind.

361
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,069
It does not matter to me...

362
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,710
that you cannot speak.

363
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,509
I love everything about you.

364
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,859
Footprints.

365
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,599
Chase after them.

366
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,440
We have to go.

367
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,539
We have to go.

368
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,609
Go.

369
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,630
Go.

370
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:00,960
There.

371
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,410
Quiet.

372
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,269
We are saved.

373
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,210
They are gone.

374
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,410
Madam Bang Doo.

375
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,049
The child.

376
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,039
What is going on?

377
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,049
It is good that they have all fled.

378
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,420
No.

379
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,690
Goodness.

380
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,630
Madam.

381
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,670
Do not cry.

382
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,880
They wanted to die together,
and they got their wish granted.

383
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,719
I have to catch these punks.

384
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,329
Catch them? Who?

385
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,599
Those intruders
that killed Grandpa Song Chu.

386
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,039
They must have spread out
everywhere, robbing people.

387
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,510
The three of us will do this?

388
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,679
What is wrong?

389
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,179
You said as a man,
I must wield the sword...

390
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,250
and punish bad men.

391
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:55,420
I have no interest in saving the King,

392
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:59,630
but I cannot forgive those
who did this to Grandpa Song Chu.

393
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,329
I am coming with you.

394
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,179
Darn it.

395
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,559
Come on.

396
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,829
I told you not to make any sound.

397
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,199
Come on. Keep it down.

398
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,670
Keep quiet. Please.

399
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,369
What do we do?

400
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,769
What should we do?

401
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,409
Jong Jong,

402
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,840
you know how to act as a midwife, right?

403
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,940
Me?

404
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:20,409
I cannot do it.

405
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,809
I spent my whole life serving you.

406
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,710
I have never done anything else.

407
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,420
Who is going to act as the midwife then?

408
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:34,619
Right.

409
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,860
I will try.

410
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,670
Please check how dilated it is.

411
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,139
Move aside.

412
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,050
Blood...

413
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,980
- Lady Eun Ae!
- Eun Ae.

414
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,250
Lady Eun Ae!

415
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,289
Lady Eun Ae...

416
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,789
What do we do?

417
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,199
Can you see the baby's head?

418
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,030
I am not sure.

419
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,099
Blood... All I can see is blood.

420
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:54,199
Touch it to see how dilated it is.

421
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,239
What? Touch it?

422
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,929
This much?

423
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,989
It has dilated this much.

424
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,559
Then...

425
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,230
it will be a while...

426
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,650
I see it!

427
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,389
- I see the head.
- How much of it do you see?

428
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,690
A chestnut...

429
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,420
No, like a persimmon of this size.

430
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,059
Hang in there and push a little harder.

431
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,929
Make no sound.

432
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,039
You are almost there.

433
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,909
Push just a little harder.

434
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,579
Pull out the baby.

435
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,179
What? Pull it out?

436
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:33,539
I have it. I am holding the baby.

437
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,699
My lady!

438
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,710
Baby...

439
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,570
Oh, baby. Do not cry.

440
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,699
Please do not cry. Please, baby...

441
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,639
Do not cry, please.

442
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:45,539
Do not cry.

443
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,650
Come here.

444
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,829
Gil Chae.

445
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,739
You did it.

446
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,010
Gil Chae, I knew you would...

447
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,630
It is cold.

448
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,360
It is too cold.

449
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:42,030
If my baby is left like this,

450
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,369
it will die.

451
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,099
Bang Doo...

452
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,750
Madam Bang Doo.

453
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,579
What is wrong?

454
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,650
Madam Bang Doo!

455
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,789
Madam Bang Doo, no...

456
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,929
Jong Jong, stay right next to her.

457
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,199
Pardon?

458
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,940
Eun Ae.

459
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:23,869
- Eun Ae!
- What?

460
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,980
Hold Madam Bang Doo in your arms,

461
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:28,139
or her baby will freeze to death.

462
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,449
I will look for things we could use.

463
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,349
Quick!

464
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:22,329
Excuse me.

465
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,329
The intruders...

466
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,150
I am sorry.

467
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,519
Madam Bang Doo...

468
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,289
She has a baby.

469
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:26,829
Her baby might freeze to death
in this cold weather.

470
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,829
I am truly sorry.

471
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,940
Truly... I am sorry.

472
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,119
Look what I found.

473
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,869
Jong Jong,
mix the grain powder with some water...

474
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,199
and give it to Madam Bang Doo.

475
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,670
I will go and take another look around.

476
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Gil Chae.

477
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,639
Gil Chae!

478
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,650
Gil Chae.

479
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,090
Gil Chae.

480
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:04,730
Is that you, Gil Chae?

481
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,800
Are you alone?

482
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,269
Where are the other girls?

483
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,269
Darn it.

484
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:16,940
I came here because I heard Joseon was
full of fair-skinned women and silk.

485
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,940
I came here because I heard Joseon was
full of fair-skinned women and silk.

486
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:21,739
My family is waiting for me
to bring silk...

487
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,210
and the hostages.

488
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,389
But you are very pretty.
You will be worth at least two hostages.

489
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,070
Before I hand you over,

490
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,400
I ought to have some fun!

491
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,940
No!

492
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,440
When women are violated
by the foreign intruders,

493
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,210
they will face death.

494
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,139
And how could women continue to live...

495
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,110
even after a brief encounter?

496
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,070
Gil Chae.

497
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,139
Nothing happened to me today.

498
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:37,949
But people might not believe me.

499
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,849
So can you not tell...

500
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,079
You and I slipped...

501
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,289
and rolled down the mountain.

502
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,090
Our clothes got ripped, and we bled.

503
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,619
You...

504
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,230
never met a foreign intruder.

505
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,860
I...

506
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,699
never killed anyone.

507
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,489
Nothing...

508
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,519
happened...

509
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,800
to us today.

510
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,070
My lady.

511
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,349
Madam Bang Doo.

512
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,800
I am sorry, my lady.

513
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,969
Do not make me talk.

514
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:12,000
I will get hungry if I talk.

515
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,500
My lady.

516
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,940
We just have to climb over that mountain.

517
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,909
Let us go to Bul Kang in Geumdure.
He is the one who is living on our field.

518
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:29,619
His wife is a great cook.

519
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,889
Let us ask her to give you
some white rice in beef seaweed soup.

520
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,489
We can ask her
to make some taffy for us too.

521
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,900
And some rice punch too.

522
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:45,030
It sounds tasty, does it not?

523
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,239
Just...

524
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,139
hang in there.

525
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,659
Who is that?

526
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,829
Go and check.

527
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,150
Kill him!

528
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:13,150
I know.

529
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,949
You are my husband-to-be, are you not?

530
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,260
But...

531
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,989
where are you right now?

532
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:26,460
I am...

533
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,269
terrified and exhausted.

534
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,030
He has come.

535
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,500
My husband-to-be has really...

536
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,210
Who is that ugly jerk?

537
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:14,480
Women!

538
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,079
Jong Jong, grab the baby and run!

539
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,380
- Now! Get up!
- What?

540
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,719
- Get up.
- They are over here!

541
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,559
Run!

542
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:41,170
No!

543
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,110
No!

544
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:57,750
No!

545
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,239
Are you okay?

546
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:05,480
Lady Gil Chae.

547
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,719
Watch out, my dear!

548
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,039
Are you okay?

549
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,309
You are not hurt?

550
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,619
You are bleeding.

551
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,860
By the way, Lady Gil Chae.

552
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:52,730
Did you just call me...

553
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,030
"my dear?"

554
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,460
(My Dearest)

555
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:44,309
You have been wanting
to make me your husband.

556
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:45,550
Will you keep teasing me?

557
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,719
I feel sorry to disregard your feelings.

558
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,619
Why do not we spend some time
getting to know each other?

559
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,019
How much time should we spend
getting to know each other?

560
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,489
There is a rumor that Khan is here.

561
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:55,289
Will Joseon people be safe?

562
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:56,559
I will risk my life and check...

563
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,860
if Khan is really here.

564
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,159
Where are you going?

565
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,960
I need to finish chasing
after those I was chasing.

566
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,869
You were only saying
that we should get to know each other...

567
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,800
as an easy way out, were you not?

568
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,039
Do you wish me to stay?

569
01:01:08,347 --> 01:01:13,216
