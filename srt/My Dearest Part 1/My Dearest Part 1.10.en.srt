1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,410
Well,

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,139
my lady.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,349
Please marry me.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,829
I will pretend
I never heard what you just said,

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,260
so do not be embarrassed.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,039
You know that he is dead.

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,710
He is dead, so please give me a chance...

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,179
So you fancy me?

9
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,750
Since when?

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,780
Since the moment I first saw you.

11
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,420
If you do not take all of us,

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,320
he will not get on the boat either.

13
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:48,750
I was impressed...

14
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,320
by your will to live.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,990
We keep crossing paths, do we not?

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,899
Officer, however...

17
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,700
The two of us...

18
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,329
are not meant to be together.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,609
(Episode 10)

20
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,019
Gil Chae.

21
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,819
Yes, Young Chae.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,359
What happened?

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,129
Your father is nowhere to be seen.

24
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,700
Gil Chae.

25
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,099
Gil Chae.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,569
Gil Chae.

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,109
Gil Chae.

28
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,709
Excuse me.

29
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,209
Have you seen my dear Gil Chae?

30
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,549
- Father!
- My lord!

31
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,849
- My lord.
- Father.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,950
- Father.
- My lord!

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,450
My lord!

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,790
- Father.
- Father...

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,319
Father...

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,629
Have you seen my dear Gil Chae?

37
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,129
The intruders took my dear Gil Chae.

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,039
Goodness.
This old man must have lost his mind.

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,039
Intruder.

40
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,979
He is an intruder!

41
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,949
You...

42
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,919
dragged Gil Chae away.

43
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,620
Old man! Have you truly lost your mind?

44
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,689
Let go, you crazy old man!

45
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,060
Darn you!

46
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,560
My lord!

47
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,750
The intruders will take you...

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,750
and crush Je Nam's skull.

49
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,650
We must leave at once.

50
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,050
We must go to Neunggun-ri.

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,960
- Father.
- We must go to Neunggun-ri.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,990
- Father.
- We must go to Neunggun-ri.

53
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,789
We must go to Neunggun-ri.

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,960
Lord Yoo.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,699
I slew a hundred intruders
with this sword.

56
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,900
If they show up again,

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,669
I will slay them all with this sword.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,539
You killed that many intruders...

59
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,840
with this sword?

60
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,449
Yes, truly.

61
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,319
I assure you that
both Lady Gil Chae and Je Nam...

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,180
are safe.

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,319
Yes.

64
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,150
I am relieved.

65
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,189
I am truly relieved...

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
now that you are here.

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,930
Please put your worries to rest...

68
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,930
and get some sleep.

69
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,629
Here.

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,680
Thank you.

71
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,819
Thank you
for letting me step in to help out.

72
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,520
My lady.

73
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,560
I can continue to help you.

74
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,060
No, please let me help you.

75
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,889
If you are trying to say again
that we should be together,

76
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,160
I have nothing to tell you.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,300
What is it...

78
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,370
that he has but I do not?

79
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,870
What is it...

80
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,740
that Young Master Yeon Jun has...

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,009
but I do not?

82
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,329
Your father...

83
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,790
was okay overnight, right?

84
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,430
How is your wound?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,970
I got some ointment made for you.

86
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,699
It is just a little scrape.

87
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,699
You got some ointment made for me?

88
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,740
- Did you go to the dispensary yourself?
- Oh, no.

89
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,980
Oh, this. I am okay.

90
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,540
My goodness.

91
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,209
My lady, do not come close.

92
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,009
Oh, dear.

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,189
- It is hot!
- Gosh.

94
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,329
I brought you some clothes...

95
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,339
Thank you.

96
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,910
Here, let me.

97
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,639
These scars...

98
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,680
Did you get these
while trying to save us on the island?

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,379
Pardon?

100
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,480
Oh, well...

101
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,319
Then why did you say
you were not the one who saved us?

102
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,519
That was...

103
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,259
Because I felt shy.

104
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,430
It is done.

105
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,750
My lady.

106
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,889
It always broke my heart to see you...

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,649
do such tough, dangerous work.

108
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,519
If you marry me,

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,290
I will make sure you would never
have to do such things again...

110
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,240
When I smile, men think
that I would become a sweet wife.

111
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,439
When they see that I am caring, they think
I would make a good daughter-in-law.

112
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,649
Even if they can see my brazen side,

113
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,980
they believe I will change
once I become a married woman.

114
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,019
But I will not change.

115
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,360
Many men like my smile,

116
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,360
but none of them likes
my cantankerous side.

117
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,500
But you see,

118
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,300
that is also a part of me.

119
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,740
I cannot only take some things
and leave the others behind.

120
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,910
So please...

121
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,740
give up on me already.

122
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,550
Then come to me
with your feelings for that man.

123
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,420
He is dead anyway.

124
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,459
It does not matter to me.

125
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,480
Look, Ryang Eum is here.
It really is Ryang Eum.

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,579
- You are here.
- Yes.

127
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,480
I heard you went to Simyang.

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,820
Why did you return so suddenly?

129
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,649
Sorry to interrupt.

130
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,289
Are you the famous Ryang Eum?

131
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,190
Hello, I am singer Ryang Eum.

132
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,830
I am Gu Won Moo
from the Military Training Corps.

133
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,730
I am getting married soon.

134
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,840
Would you be able to sing at my wedding?

135
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,840
My bride-to-be...

136
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,740
heard you sing a long time ago
and still cannot forget it to this day.

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,840
Would you please do it for me?

138
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,909
She has heard me sing?

139
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:05,480
I was away from Usimjeong for a while.
Where did she hear it?

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,289
She said she heard it
when she lived in Neunggun-ri.

141
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,220
Neunggun-ri?

142
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,429
You have something on your lips.

143
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,659
Wait.

144
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,830
I will do it for you.

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,539
It is gone.

146
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,070
You are clumsier than I thought.

147
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,379
Eat up.

148
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,350
What is the matter?

149
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,429
Wait, Ryang Eum.

150
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,360
Ryang Eum. Wait.

151
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,399
You are Ryang Eum, right?

152
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,940
Hello, Lady Gil Chae.

153
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,679
I heard you went to Simyang.

154
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,110
I have returned to Joseon
for a little while.

155
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,049
So...

156
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,389
Young Master Jang Hyun.

157
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,259
How did he end up like that?

158
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,100
What grave crime did he commit?

159
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
When he died,

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,210
he did not suffer much,

161
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,409
did he?

162
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
Lady Gil Chae.

163
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,480
Lee Jang Hyun is back.

164
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,309
(My Dearest)

165
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,120
Soon,

166
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,929
the Crown Prince will reach Joseon.

167
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,669
Would they dare
send the Crown Prince back...

168
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,669
and demand I come instead?

169
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,110
Your Majesty.

170
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,019
Wherever you go,

171
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,679
please take me with you.

172
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,490
Yes.

173
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,559
No.

174
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,029
The Crown Prince
will go back after visiting me.

175
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,059
It is strange, though.

176
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,429
At first,
they mistreated the Crown Prince,

177
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,870
breaking my heart.

178
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,039
Why are they spoiling him now?

179
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,909
When the Crown Prince left Simyang,
Yong Gol Dae demanded...

180
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,710
a red coat embroidered with dragons.

181
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,779
Wait.

182
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,750
Is that...

183
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,220
not an outfit...

184
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,919
that only a king is allowed to wear?

185
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,759
Do you know...

186
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,830
what Gwanghae feared the most?

187
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,669
It was treason.

188
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,570
However,

189
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,639
despite fearing treason
more than anything,

190
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,950
when rumors spread that I,
Neungyanggun, was planning a revolt,

191
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,750
he did not believe it.

192
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,419
But those with quick minds...

193
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,419
treated me differently,
as if I had already become King.

194
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,090
These days, my subjects...

195
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,860
treat the Crown Prince so.

196
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,809
Your Majesty.

197
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,220
The Crown Prince has arrived.

198
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,159
(Kang Seok Ki, Crown Princess' Father)

199
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,860
When the Crown Prince visits today,

200
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,769
will His Majesty treat him poorly?

201
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,669
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

202
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,169
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

203
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,879
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

204
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,909
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

205
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,350
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

206
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,570
Your Majesty.

207
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,539
Your son greets you.

208
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,409
Enter.

209
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Father.

210
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,000
The deities blessed me...

211
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,370
with the favor to see you again.

212
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,169
Look up.

213
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,480
Why do you...

214
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,679
look so dreadful?

215
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,350
Not at all.

216
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,059
I was so troubled by the news
that you were unwell.

217
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,690
Yes.

218
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,629
Since I sent you far away,

219
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
I was unable to sleep and it got me sick.

220
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,299
However,

221
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,500
seeing you again...

222
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,169
will bring me back to health.

223
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,279
Crown Prince.

224
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,320
My son!

225
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,460
These are for His Majesty.
Do not miss anything.

226
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,470
How about...

227
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,240
taking an old outfit
for the Crown Prince to wear?

228
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,639
Why would you say that?

229
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,779
He must wear the best.

230
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,009
His Majesty...

231
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,250
exiled the messenger that requested...

232
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,419
the Crown Prince visit Joseon.

233
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,120
That was so the Crown Prince
would not suffer on the way.

234
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,690
He should see
the Crown Prince suffered too.

235
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,080
The deities blessed us.

236
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,549
- They blessed us.
- They blessed us.

237
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,220
- They blessed us.
- They blessed us.

238
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,090
- They blessed us.
- They blessed us.

239
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,299
That was a relief.

240
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,069
But then,

241
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:14,039
nothing the barbarians can do...

242
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,509
will separate a father and son.

243
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,440
Right.

244
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,750
I thought the Crown Prince
would never step on Joseon soil again.

245
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,150
Do you think you are always right?

246
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,789
I would be pleased to be wrong.

247
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,059
So,

248
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,759
where is Officer Nam?

249
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,599
These are all for me?

250
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:22,640
Perhaps?

251
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,410
These?

252
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,009
These?

253
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,279
No. Not these.

254
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,329
Be careful.

255
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,130
Stand still.

256
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,819
My lady.

257
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,519
Wear these shoes and come to me.

258
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,859
What do you take me for?

259
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,759
I might love floral shoes, but still.

260
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,660
That is enough.

261
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,059
Playing hard to get.

262
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,269
It is time you stopped.

263
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,069
Now that Young Master Yeon Jun is married,

264
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,539
you must know
who will remain with you to the end.

265
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,009
Who will...

266
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,740
make you happy.

267
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,210
Young Master Yeon Jun?

268
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,119
If you asked for floral shoes,

269
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,819
he would admonish you
for being extravagant.

270
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,490
If you said you wanted silk clothes,

271
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,130
he would nag you to think first...

272
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,890
of the suffering people.

273
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,200
But my lady.

274
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,400
I am different.

275
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,700
I am Lee Jang Hyun.

276
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,240
If you want floral shoes,

277
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,339
I will bring you
the prettiest pair in the world.

278
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,480
If you desire silk clothes,
I will acquire...

279
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,549
silk clothes even more
precious than the queen's.

280
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,589
You will do that?

281
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,259
Of course, I will.

282
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,460
So now,

283
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,890
the one who suits you is me, Jang Hyun,

284
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,299
who can fulfill everything you desire.

285
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,329
Say it.

286
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,000
Say it.

287
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:36,710
Come on.

288
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,009
Say it.

289
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,109
Say it.

290
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,319
I said, say it.

291
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,319
Come on. Are you keeping quiet
because you are shy?

292
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,619
- What are you doing?
- What?

293
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,059
What are you muttering about?

294
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,099
Mutter about?

295
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,099
Can you not knock?

296
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,769
I did knock.

297
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,140
Have a seat.

298
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,910
Did you figure it out?

299
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:12,440
I did. I looked into it.

300
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,609
Officer Nam's family
seems to have gone downhill.

301
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,109
What?

302
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,849
If I show up,

303
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,960
she will want to run to me and hug me.

304
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:33,930
You have to react. Come on.

305
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,329
Buy bridal gifts!

306
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,140
Buy bridal gifts!

307
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,740
I guess someone is getting married.

308
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,569
Buy bridal gifts!

309
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,940
I told you.

310
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,279
People get married even
in the middle of the most turbulent times.

311
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,849
Right.

312
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,819
We are the only ones
who are slaving away...

313
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,180
until our crotches smell sour.

314
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,150
Buy bridal gifts!

315
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,960
Is no one going to buy this?

316
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,160
Have a nice glass...

317
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,029
and hurry inside.

318
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,730
- Should I do that?
- What?

319
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,440
She is Madam Bang Doo, is she not?

320
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,400
Gosh, I cannot go inside.

321
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,710
Come on.

322
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,039
Let us go inside.

323
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,509
- I cannot.
- Why not?

324
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,410
Maybe if I see the face of the bride...

325
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,410
The bride is here.

326
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,430
Why would the bride come out herself?

327
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,740
I am here, so let us go inside.

328
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,380
Jong Jong.

329
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,869
You must be tired from coming a long way.

330
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,359
My lady.

331
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,630
You saw him too, did you not?

332
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,730
It was him,

333
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,930
was it not?

334
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,230
It was him.

335
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,470
He was alive.

336
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,910
He was alive.

337
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,339
Where are you going?
The bridal gifts are being brought in.

338
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:38,450
You must not leave, my lady.

339
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,190
My lady!

340
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,890
Is anyone here?

341
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,819
Is anyone inside?

342
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,269
It is really you.

343
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
You were alive.

344
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:39,839
Can you not live a day...

345
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,579
without a man?

346
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,660
I am asking you.

347
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,660
Can you not live a day...

348
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,230
without a man?

349
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,140
Is that why you are getting married?

350
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,440
Yes.

351
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,079
You saw me well.

352
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,279
I cannot live a day...

353
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,220
without a man.

354
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,650
Without a man,

355
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,789
I am too lonely to go on, body and soul.

356
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,730
Why?

357
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,700
Is there something wrong with that?

358
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,900
If you love men that much,
why did you not give me a chance?

359
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,069
If you simply needed a man,

360
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,009
regardless of who he is,

361
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,349
why did you not come to me once?

362
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,990
I can go to all men but not you.

363
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,960
I have nothing to share with a man...

364
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,569
who does not mean anything he says.

365
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,700
In just several days,
we will become man and wife.

366
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,339
That reminds me.

367
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,440
I want to record your face before we wed.

368
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,009
Can I hire a painter
to paint your portrait?

369
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,150
Why...

370
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,450
do you look so grim?

371
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,519
I must be tired
from dealing with the guests.

372
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,390
I love seeing your smile.

373
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,619
When you smile,

374
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,359
it feels like
the whole world is smiling too.

375
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,799
You should go inside.

376
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,650
You should go inside first.

377
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,380
Go inside first. Bye.

378
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,910
Is it him?

379
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,779
The man you are marrying.

380
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,359
He seemed nice.

381
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,059
He is a wonderful person.

382
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,390
And he saved my life.

383
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,009
You saved us!

384
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
My lady.

385
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,450
That is why...

386
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,250
you are marrying him?

387
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:47,460
Because he saved your life?

388
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,490
My lady.

389
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,460
Let me tell you the truth. That day...

390
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,640
The person who saved you that day...

391
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,539
was I, not that man.

392
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,089
When I asked you about it in the past,
you said you had never been on the island.

393
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Now,

394
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,089
you say that you were the one...

395
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,890
who saved me that day?

396
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:27,059
I denied it back then...

397
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,000
for you went to Ganghwa Island
because you trusted me.

398
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,109
Knowing you nearly died there,

399
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,480
I felt horrible and guilty.
That is why I denied it.

400
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,160
Do you use such shallow tricks
with other women too?

401
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,289
I foolishly trusted you.

402
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,630
You said not to forget you.

403
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,069
I believed you
when you said to remember you.

404
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,670
But...

405
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,809
why did you forget all about me?

406
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,210
Were the ladies in Simyang
more fun than Joseon women?

407
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,150
Was that why...

408
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,950
you forgot all about me? Because you were
too busy fooling around with those ladies?

409
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,460
I have never forgotten about you.

410
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,029
Not even once.

411
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,200
You should have told me.

412
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,430
"I forgot all about you long ago,"

413
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,599
"so do not wait for me."

414
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,170
"Do not miss me,
and do not let your heart ache for me."

415
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,910
I had no idea. I thought you were dead.

416
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,390
You thought...

417
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,160
- I was dead?
- Yes.

418
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:03,130
I thought you were dead.

419
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,660
I thought I would never...

420
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,569
I thought I would never see you again.

421
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,319
Hurry up and tell him.

422
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,390
Lady Gil Chae cried so much that day.

423
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,289
Holding the fur vest,

424
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,829
she called out your name
over and over again.

425
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,099
"Come back."

426
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,029
"Please come back."

427
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,109
I had never seen her cry like that.

428
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,140
Besides, Ryang Eum was the one...

429
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,880
who said you were dead.

430
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:00,480
So she did not doubt him.

431
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:16,630
When he died,

432
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,869
he did not suffer much,

433
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,170
did he?

434
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,720
No, thankfully.

435
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,190
I see.

436
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:39,890
Good.

437
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,390
Did he ask you...

438
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,799
to relay a message to me?

439
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,940
No, he did not.

440
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,809
To tell you the truth,
I do not really know.

441
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,940
Someone else assisted
Young Master Jang Hyun in Simyang.

442
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,500
When I ran into Lady Gil Chae,

443
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,840
she was already engaged to another man.

444
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:32,139
I still should have told her
that you were not dead,

445
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,880
but I did not want to do that.

446
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,050
That woman...

447
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:45,860
She brings you bad luck.

448
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,159
Date another woman.

449
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,030
What?

450
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,360
Because of her,

451
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,800
you nearly died.

452
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,769
She will hurt you...

453
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,239
and make you miserable.

454
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,039
Look what happened.

455
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,909
She is already engaged to another man...

456
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,219
You.

457
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,030
Why on earth did you...

458
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,199
I do not regret what I did.

459
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,400
Even if I could go back to that moment,

460
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,570
I would do the exact same thing.

461
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,280
Stop. Jang Hyun, please stop.

462
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,829
Forgive me.

463
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,230
I just...

464
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,670
I just thought
that woman would make you miserable.

465
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,340
That is why I did it.

466
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,739
She would make me miserable?

467
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,280
You do not know what she means to me.

468
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,969
Something happened in Simyang.

469
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,579
That is why I could not return
as quickly as I had wanted to.

470
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,219
Something happened?

471
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,750
I am never your priority.

472
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,929
You say you want my heart,

473
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,829
but you always prioritize other things.

474
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,869
Right.

475
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,900
I was a fool for waiting for you.

476
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,710
After all, you left without promising me
when you would return.

477
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:20,110
What about you?

478
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,010
Can you face me unashamed?

479
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,949
I clearly told you.

480
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,250
I said I would never leave you
if you could just say that...

481
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,190
you would forget Yeon Jun.

482
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,699
I told you that
I would always be by your side.

483
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,530
But...

484
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,309
you were so cold to me.

485
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,679
Now, you are marrying another man,
not even Yeon Jun.

486
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,179
I suppose that is our fate, after all.

487
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,849
We were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

488
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,420
And it is too late.

489
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,429
The gifts have already arrived,
so this marriage is now a done deal.

490
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,269
It does not matter anymore.

491
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,510
Whether you are still
secretly thinking of Nam Yeon Jun...

492
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,239
or are engaged to someone else...

493
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,309
No.

494
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,449
I do not care what you think either.

495
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,420
You.

496
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,199
I need you to be mine now.

497
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:03,780
This is the Lee Jang Hyun I know.

498
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:07,579
Whatever and whenever it is...

499
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,389
you do as you wish.

500
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,500
My lady.

501
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,769
Please give me an opportunity.

502
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:35,780
Never again...

503
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,519
will I leave your side.

504
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,949
Never again...

505
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,159
will I make you wait.

506
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,130
So...

507
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,369
please give me one more chance.

508
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,349
I will get a boat ready.

509
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,420
Leave with me.

510
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,429
Young Master Jang Hyun was alive?

511
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,099
He wants me to leave with him.

512
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,440
He dreams big.

513
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,380
He even said
he came to Ganghwa Island to save us.

514
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,179
But it is too late.

515
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,719
He left of his own accord
many times before.

516
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,889
How am I to trust him and leave?

517
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,420
I will not go.

518
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,090
I will never go.

519
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,469
(Usimjeong)

520
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,610
You are alive.

521
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,019
We all thought you were dead.

522
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,789
It is a great relief to see you are well.

523
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,059
Why are you here?

524
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,530
Did you ask Lady Gil Chae...

525
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,460
to leave with you?

526
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,559
The Lee Jang Hyun I know is like the wind.

527
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,030
You may be with Lady Gil Chae now,

528
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,400
but once you leave again,

529
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,670
what is she to do then?

530
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,610
What?

531
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,909
You know nothing about her.

532
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,250
Lady Gil Chae...

533
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,980
is more responsible than most.

534
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,889
Even if she were
to leave everything to be with her love,

535
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,619
it would never make her happy.

536
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,429
If you were to shake her up
and sadden the whole family,

537
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,400
that would eventually make her unhappy.

538
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:17,639
Young Master Yeon Jun.

539
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,409
Are you afraid
she will love me and no one else?

540
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,150
What do you mean?

541
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,679
You knew...

542
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,650
that she loved you.

543
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,289
And yet you abandoned her...

544
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,159
and married Lady Eun Ae.

545
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,159
Why?

546
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,570
Because you did not think you could
handle a woman like Lady Gil Chae.

547
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:48,000
Despite that,
do you not still entertain...

548
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,110
the hope that Lady Gil Chae
still cares for you?

549
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,949
That is why
you still circle her shamelessly...

550
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,960
You can throw a punch?

551
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,099
Where were you all this while,

552
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,130
and now you appear
and try to separate her from her family?

553
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,199
I am...

554
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,679
paying dearly for being absent.

555
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,690
At one time,

556
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,360
I dreamed of pushing you
completely out of...

557
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,530
Lady Gil Chae's heart so I could...

558
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,860
make her my own.

559
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,769
But not anymore.

560
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,639
Whether I get just half,

561
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,380
or even a quarter of her love,

562
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,480
I must claim her.

563
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,159
- What?
- Come along.

564
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,730
Would you like a drink?

565
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:24,070
No, thank you.

566
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,190
I have a question.

567
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,530
What are you doing here?

568
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:58,199
Can you live without minding me?

569
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:21,389
If you can be happy
with someone other than me,

570
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,099
I will leave.

571
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,159
If you want...

572
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,840
a man other than me,

573
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,639
I will never yearn for you
or have regrets.

574
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,409
But...

575
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,019
if that is not the case...

576
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:57,860
Leave with me.

577
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,210
If you do not take my hand now,

578
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,519
I will leave you...

579
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,820
and never show myself again.

580
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,059
You are just the same.

581
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,159
Did you think you could scare me...

582
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:11,769
by saying we would never meet again?

583
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,369
You are always like this.

584
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:19,139
You taunted me with your glib tongue,

585
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:22,440
made me anxious, and made me wait,

586
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,050
and that was torture.

587
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,349
Did you stop to think...

588
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,119
how I felt each time?

589
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,389
No.

590
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:34,690
You made me wait. I know you.

591
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:38,630
Once you obtain something,
you think nothing of it.

592
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,630
Why did you love
Young Master Yeon Jun for so long?

593
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,199
It was because you never won him over.

594
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:48,840
Am I wrong?

595
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:52,809
I also thought...

596
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,650
you would get sick of me
if I let you catch me too soon.

597
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,519
That is why...

598
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:06,360
I decided to be a man you could not catch.

599
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:09,960
Is that why you left me as we fled?

600
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,789
You kissed me gently...

601
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,659
and threw me to the side?

602
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,500
I did not abandon you.

603
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,500
I did not push you away.

604
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,699
I was...

605
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:24,940
I was right here.

606
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,380
I was here. I never left.

607
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,550
Every day, I missed you
and yearned for you.

608
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:40,889
Did you...

609
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,429
really...

610
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,300
miss me?

611
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,869
You waited for me?

612
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,070
No.

613
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:53,969
Not anymore.

614
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:57,969
I will no longer wait for you...

615
00:48:58,539 --> 00:48:59,909
or miss you.

616
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:02,809
I will hate you forever.

617
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,650
Until the day I die.

618
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,449
You should cry and long for me
until you wilt, like I did.

619
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:29,539
Leave.

620
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,440
Go and do not turn back.

621
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,449
That is what you do best, is it not?

622
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,889
I will not get fooled again.

623
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,389
Not again.

624
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,599
My lady.

625
00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:01,369
I will receive your punishment
and die in your hands.

626
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:05,840
So please.

627
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,150
Please come with me.

628
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,670
Officer.

629
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,340
Everyone is looking for you.

630
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,079
Right.

631
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,750
The foreign intruders.

632
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,849
- The foreign intruders.
- Sister!

633
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,519
- Did you not find her yet?
- No.

634
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:32,030
Something must have happened to her.

635
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,000
These days, women
get kidnapped often, you know.

636
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,869
Search the areas
around the house once again.

637
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:40,869
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

638
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,840
- Sister!
- They took Gil Chae.

639
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:48,980
The foreign intruders took Gil Chae.

640
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Stop.

641
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,599
Check inside.

642
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,519
- Gu Jam.
- Jong Jong.

643
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,530
I cannot talk long.

644
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,159
I will head to Samgang Quay.

645
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,730
And so will your lady.

646
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,159
So why do you not...

647
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,269
join us too?

648
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:47,969
How can I do that?

649
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,510
You can just come with her.

650
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,909
Come with her. Bye.

651
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:02,579
You promised. Make sure you come with her.

652
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,030
Excuse me.

653
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:21,739
Yes.

654
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:25,239
Do you have a room?

655
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,239
We have a shared room.

656
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:31,010
(Bongnotbang: Inn's largest room
where several travelers gather together.)

657
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,289
We cannot share the room.

658
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:46,289
Then we will empty the room we use.

659
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,900
Come this way.

660
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:15,590
Come inside.

661
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,289
Here.

662
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,329
Have a seat here.

663
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,559
Excuse me.

664
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:55,360
You look like a noble lady,
and yet you are not wearing a cape.

665
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,769
Perhaps you are...

666
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:00,469
running away?

667
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:03,070
Running away? He is my husband.

668
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,570
Right?

669
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:06,340
Right.

670
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,679
Have a good rest.

671
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,230
Why are you smiling?

672
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,570
Well, it is...

673
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,570
Why are you smiling?

674
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,880
I am sorry. It just came out.

675
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:54,789
This is
an uncomfortable arrangement, is it not?

676
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,030
Take a short nap here.

677
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:02,400
Gu Jam is waiting for us at the quay.

678
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,769
When the day breaks...

679
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,340
Good night.

680
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,480
Are you going to become my husband?

681
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,550
I do not know. We will see about that.

682
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,320
I already caught you,
so it is up to me now.

683
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,760
What did you just say?

684
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,769
Husband? No way.

685
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,409
I will be your servant.

686
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,409
My body is yours.

687
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,050
My soul is yours.

688
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,420
My heart is...

689
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,260
yours too.

690
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:18,800
Gil Chae.

691
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:27,510
My lady.

692
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,090
You have not found her?

693
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:47,530
Please forgive us.

694
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,239
But something strange happened
the day when the bridal gifts were sent.

695
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,440
What happened?

696
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:02,880
She recognized a man
and seemed very surprised.

697
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,650
What?

698
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:10,119
- You saw it too.
- Pardon me?

699
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,389
She seemed surprised
at the sight of a man and froze.

700
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,090
I know nothing about this.

701
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,960
You must tell me what you know.

702
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,130
I truly know nothing.

703
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,130
I just heard
he came back from the dead. I...

704
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,300
Bak Dae!

705
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:27,940
What nonsense are you saying?

706
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,480
How did you find out?

707
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,980
Jong Jong said
she heard some things from Gu Jam.

708
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,519
I doubted I would find you here,
so I am relieved.

709
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,260
Officer Gu's men are out there
looking for you.

710
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,329
So do not go to Samgang Quay.

711
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:01,000
You can just...

712
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,869
curse at me.

713
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,039
How could I criticize you?

714
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,050
Do not worry.

715
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:21,090
I will handle the rest.

716
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,429
Is the man who was thought to be dead
truly back alive?

717
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,170
There is no way...

718
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,639
Lady Gil Chae followed him.

719
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:37,070
You must know this.

720
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:39,570
It is not considered a crime...

721
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,710
for a husband to kill his wife
and the man she committed adultery with.

722
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:52,449
The wedding chest has been received,

723
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,090
so I can safely say that
Lady Gil Chae is already my wife.

724
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,130
If it is true that she went with that man,

725
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,800
I shall kill him to set a deterrent.

726
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,599
And Lady Gil Chae...

727
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:05,929
Officer Gu!

728
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,269
Let go.

729
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,130
What if Young Master Jang Hyun
takes off again?

730
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,699
This is truly reckless.

731
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,539
I brought your favorite clothes, my lady.

732
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:47,340
I bet you did not even bring a cape.

733
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,880
As soon as I settle down,

734
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,179
I will come for you.

735
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,820
Now, I cannot...

736
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,920
No.

737
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:59,489
If I follow you, people will spread
worse rumors about you.

738
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,159
Promise me that
you will come back to get me.

739
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,599
I will not marry anyone to wait for you.

740
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:23,980
Jong Jong.

741
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,250
My lady.

742
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:35,590
I promise you that
I will come back for you.

743
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,429
You should head back now.

744
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:48,269
Yes.

745
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,440
I am sorry, Lady Eun Ae.

746
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,179
I, of all people, know
how much Gil Chae...

747
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,750
missed you.

748
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,420
So today is a happy day.

749
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:08,820
Please...

750
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,489
make Gil Chae happy.

751
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,670
My dear!

752
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,110
Honey.

753
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,510
Does it mean...

754
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:34,920
Yes.

755
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,650
Gil Chae and Young Master Jang Hyun...

756
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,190
In the end,

757
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,389
this happened.

758
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,699
It is a good thing.

759
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,110
It is what Lady Gil Chae wanted.

760
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,119
They took Gil Chae.

761
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,090
The intruders took Gil Chae!

762
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,230
- Gosh, my lord.
- My lord.

763
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,260
- They took Gil Chae.
- My goodness.

764
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,860
- My lord!
- The intruders took Gil Chae away!

765
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,969
They took Gil Chae.

766
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:26,030
- I will take care of Father.
- Gil Chae...

767
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,199
Gil Chae.

768
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,840
The intruders... They took Gil Chae.

769
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,239
Gil Chae.

770
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:38,250
They took Gil Chae.

771
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,820
Perhaps, Lady Gil Chae...

772
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,019
will come back to see you, Father.

773
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:45,820
They took Gil Chae.

774
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,219
The intruders took Gil Chae.

775
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,059
Gil Chae.

776
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,730
Gil Chae.

777
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,960
Gil Chae!

778
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,570
Gil Chae!

779
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:00,099
Gil Chae.

780
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:03,300
Since we cannot go to Samgang Quay,

781
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:05,969
I will go to Jinmotgil
and try to find a boat and a boatman.

782
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,139
I will come with you.

783
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,610
It is chilly outside. Just stay here.

784
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,519
Look.

785
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:18,349
I have already received the wedding chest.

786
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,690
What if people...

787
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,530
point their fingers at me
and call me names?

788
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,690
Are you afraid?

789
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:28,699
Not really.

790
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,530
I can ignore it.

791
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,170
But what if you think
I am too brazen later on...

792
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,539
and start hating me?

793
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,610
If you suddenly leave me again...

794
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,050
You have no idea.

795
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,960
I like how brazen you are.

796
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:06,130
I will see you later.

797
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,880
How is Father?

798
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:58,190
He is losing it again,
thinking that the intruders took you.

799
01:06:59,989 --> 01:07:01,360
Do not worry.

800
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,659
I am sure Madam Bang Doo
is taking great care of him.

801
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,050
I must go and say goodbye to my father.

802
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:36,289
Wait for me at the quay.

803
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,239
Help me find my dear daughter, Gil Chae.

804
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:57,710
The intruders took her.

805
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:00,710
Gil Chae!

806
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,650
Gil Chae.

807
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,260
Gil Chae.

808
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:20,569
Father.

809
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:29,579
Father.

810
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,409
The foreign intruders will not take me.

811
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,180
But...

812
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,649
I must go somewhere.

813
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:40,250
Do not worry about me.

814
01:08:43,489 --> 01:08:44,529
Food.

815
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,600
You must eat on time.

816
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,760
- Food?
- Yes, food.

817
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,300
If you do not eat, I will not come back.

818
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,539
Do not go out...

819
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,979
on your own to look for me.

820
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,579
You must stay at home.

821
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,050
Home?

822
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,189
Are you going to Neunggun-ri?

823
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
Yes.

824
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,989
I will visit Neunggun-ri.

825
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,659
So wait at home.

826
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:24,470
Sir!

827
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,699
- Sir!
- Gil Chae.

828
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,310
One person is not here yet.

829
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:34,479
We will pay you handsomely.
Can we wait another hour?

830
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,539
Here you go.

831
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,300
Silence.

832
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:57,970
Can you be quiet?

833
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:00,630
Do you think she will come?

834
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,710
What?

835
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,109
The sun has gone down.

836
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,510
You think you are smart
but you are so naive.

837
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:12,050
Goodness.

838
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,819
Sir!

839
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,020
Sir!

840
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:21,380
Sir!

841
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,420
Gil Chae.

842
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:33,989
My Gil Chae.

843
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,000
You have been through so much.

844
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,369
Do not worry about me now.

845
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:46,569
Father.

846
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,569
What brings you here this early?

847
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,109
You might as well stay for breakfast.

848
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,590
My lady.

849
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,699
The soup looks nice.

850
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,770
My lady.

851
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:29,579
My lady.

852
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,670
Here.

853
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,640
Come on.

854
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,479
Watch carefully.

855
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:05,609
Oh, dear.

856
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:07,479
I dropped them all.

857
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,189
I enjoyed the meal.

858
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:22,300
It was lovely.

859
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:33,710
Yes.

860
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:24,729
What would you like?

861
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:26,359
Young Master.

862
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,460
Young Master Jang Hyun.

863
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,909
My lady sent you this.

864
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,630
It is true that I briefly wavered,

865
01:16:04,729 --> 01:16:07,430
but I do not trust or love you enough...

866
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:12,039
to leave everything and be with you.

867
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:16,680
If you have any affection left for me,

868
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:20,510
forget all about me.

869
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,039
I will return
with the prettiest floral shoes.

870
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:43,199
I asked if you ever resented me,

871
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,369
and you said...

872
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,539
the day I left you for good,

873
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,569
you resented me so much
you stared to no end.

874
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,180
But however hard you looked,

875
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,909
you could not hate me at all.

876
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,210
You hated yourself for it.

877
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,079
And then you asked me.

878
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:06,619
"You are so harsh."

879
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:09,819
"Did you ever guess my feelings?"

880
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,489
Now that I am speaking, I must admit,

881
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:17,130
I could not even guess.

882
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,300
My heart was breaking...

883
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,539
into a thousand pieces,

884
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,810
and all I could do was wish fervently...

885
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,010
that you would not be like me.

886
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:53,930
(Simyang, 2 years later)

887
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,149
How have you been?

888
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,359
Long time no see.

889
