1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,969
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,570
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

5
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,079
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

6
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,009
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,759
They are here.

8
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,090
The foreign intruders are here.

9
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,159
They...

10
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,399
took His Majesty captive!

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,469
What did you say?

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,969
- How can this be?
- No way.

13
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,170
- They are back?
- What do we do?

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,269
Is it true?

15
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,079
What do we do?

16
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,079
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,879
What is going on?

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,079
What do we do?

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,120
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,469
(My Dearest)

21
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,170
(Episode 3)

22
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,530
What?

23
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,129
Goodness.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,199
You are here.

25
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,909
We are at war.

26
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,310
Is it all right for us to be doing this?

27
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,849
The foreign intruders have His Majesty,

28
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,180
so they will not reach us just yet.

29
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,949
Today is a very special day.

30
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,159
Have some sweet soft persimmons
and get good rest.

31
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,229
You could make love
like a proper wedding day.

32
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,199
How can we do that at a time like this?

33
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,370
Young Master.

34
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,180
Why are you so good to me?

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,250
Because you deserve it.

36
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,840
The foreign intruders have invaded.

37
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,810
The country is ruined.

38
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,110
The government will be destroyed.

39
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:26,879
Close the doors.

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,780
Hide away, ladies.

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,219
Hold a weapon, gentlemen.

42
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,389
Hide away, ladies.

43
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,750
Hide away, ladies.

44
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,689
Hide away, ladies.

45
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:47,770
Father.

46
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,599
Father.

47
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,599
Father.

48
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,469
Father.

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,439
Father.

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,580
Father.

51
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,680
Father.

52
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08,490
Please.

53
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,759
Please, Father.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,330
Father.

55
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,629
Father.

56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Father.

57
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,500
Father.

58
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,269
What is wrong?

59
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,930
What startled you so much...

60
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,000
out there?

61
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,750
So the war broke out in the end.

62
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,750
What will you do?

63
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,980
What will I do? I should flee.

64
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,290
Lee Jang Hyun will flee?

65
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,089
Even I will die
if someone wields a sword at me.

66
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,029
By the way, these foreign intruders.

67
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,160
Would they not leave after several days...

68
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,000
like they did ten years ago
in the Year of Jeongmyo?

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,829
I do not know.

70
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,800
They held His Majesty hostage.

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,170
This is different
from the situation from ten years ago.

72
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,509
He calls himself
the emperor, not the intruder.

73
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:42,149
A war broke out. How can you smile?

74
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,779
Goodness, it is not as if...

75
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,649
the war will be put to an end if I cry.

76
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,069
Your singing is still the best.

77
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,180
The unparalleled singer, Ryang Eum.

78
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,850
A lark like you appears only once
in 10,000 years.

79
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,399
(South Gate)

80
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,610
Did the foreign intruders
really surround Namhan Fortress?

81
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,209
Furthermore,

82
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,779
if the intruders are here,

83
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,850
His Majesty should have left
for Ganghwa Island.

84
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,350
Why is he at the fortress?

85
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,750
I just got the news from the office.

86
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,290
The enemies passed Pyongyang
three days ago...

87
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,889
and arrived at Songdo two days ago.

88
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,189
His Majesty had no time
to head to Ganghwa Island...

89
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,699
so he went to Namhan Fortress.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,170
No matter how fast the foreign army was,

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,300
how can they break into Hanyang
within three days?

92
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,110
Are they not rumors spread by fearmongers?

93
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,240
They are not.

94
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,180
The Yalu River should be frozen right now.

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,639
If the foreign cavalry...

96
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,180
headed straight for Hanyang
instead of stopping at the fortresses,

97
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,180
it would be more than possible.

98
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,050
A direct attack?

99
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,490
(Direct attack: heading straight
for the battle front)

100
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,790
But...

101
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,620
our soldiers are all over Joseon.

102
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,360
Why did they choose
to charge deep into the country?

103
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,899
Because their goal is worth the risk.

104
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:40,870
The king of Joseon.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,870
If the fortress is besieged
along with His Majesty,

106
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,269
they would have achieved their goal.

107
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,980
Come and receive His Majesty's orders!

108
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,050
The royal decree is here!

109
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,019
Come and receive His Majesty's orders!

110
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,089
Hear His Majesty's decree!

111
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:11,160
(Decree: orders by the king
for his subjects)

112
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,170
The Great Jin army
has intruded our borders.

113
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,939
May the loyal subjects
offer your stratagems,

114
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,009
and the brave scholars to join the army...

115
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,779
so as to repay the nation's grace.

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,559
As long as we remain courteous,

117
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,759
how can they bear to harm you?

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,230
However,

119
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,500
I am not a minister...

120
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,840
and Lord Neungbonggun
is not Your Majesty's brother.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,870
If they notice...

122
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,340
How will they recognize
a Joseon royal and minister?

123
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,009
And how can you suggest that we comply
and send His Majesty's brother?

124
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,889
Were you not held captive
by the foreigners in the Year of Gyemi?

125
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,419
I heard that the barbarians
took good care of you...

126
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,389
so as not to break your spirit.

127
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,830
We appreciate your help again.

128
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,769
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,710
Long time no see.

130
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,279
Yes, it has been a while.

131
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,590
Are you...

132
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,759
really the brother of the King of Joseon?

133
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,299
He asks if you are the brother
of the King of Joseon.

134
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,639
And the minister?

135
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,639
He asks if you are a minister.

136
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,009
That is right.

137
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,250
Let me ask you once.

138
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,309
Do not lie to me.

139
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,379
Are they...

140
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,120
truly the King's brother and the minister?

141
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,720
Yes.

142
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,659
They are definitely
the King's brother and the minister.

143
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,669
You should go back.

144
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,799
Go and tell your King.

145
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:37,110
That this time...

146
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,250
This time,

147
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,450
he asks for the crown prince as hostage.

148
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,820
You insolent fool!

149
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,220
How dare you mention His Highness?

150
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,690
Your Majesty, you must not comply.

151
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,360
You must not, Your Majesty!

152
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,330
- You must not, Your Majesty!
- You must not, Your Majesty!

153
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,000
- You must not, Your Majesty!
- You must not, Your Majesty!

154
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,269
- You must not, Your Majesty!
- You must not, Your Majesty!

155
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,090
Who are you, young master?

156
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,019
If you truly insist,

157
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,559
will you...

158
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,159
kiss me on the lips today?

159
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,649
What is going on?

160
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:56,049
We should hurry.

161
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,679
His Majesty has been held captive.

162
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,289
Our mighty ruler...

163
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,690
is fervently calling
for those righteous ones.

164
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,889
Dear people of Joseon,

165
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,600
the time has come for you
to step up to your duty.

166
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:42,669
Let us save His Majesty.

167
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,899
Show the whole world...

168
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,539
the power of your loyalty!

169
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,139
He has a nice voice.

170
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,549
He would have made a great singer.

171
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,179
Have you ever seen
a noble pick up singing?

172
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,649
It is only for the lowly.

173
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,919
Then do you want to learn from me?

174
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,019
We are both lowly.

175
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,659
What?

176
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,950
Why do you keep crying, my lady?

177
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,019
Seeing you cry makes me tear up too.

178
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,450
It is nothing.

179
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,590
And what is wrong with that girl?

180
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,669
Why are you crying?

181
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,669
What is your business?

182
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,210
I just wanted to know why you are crying.

183
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,240
Show the whole world...

184
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,009
the power of your loyalty!

185
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,820
Seems like he is shouting at the top
of his lungs to gather volunteers.

186
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,490
Of course.

187
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,059
Young Master Yeon Jun is not like
some coward who only thinks of escaping.

188
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,429
My.

189
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,960
How did you know
I was planning to evacuate?

190
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,269
Your ugly face tells me so.

191
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,399
No matter what happens to the country,

192
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,299
you only care for your own well-being.

193
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,909
I sure have great discernment.

194
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,440
Those with quick wit are worthy
of becoming my people...

195
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,509
If you are burning with passion, come out!

196
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,120
If your heart is full of loyalty, step up!

197
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,620
I shall do it!

198
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,519
Is there anyone else?

199
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,059
- I will join too!
- Me too!

200
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,559
- Me too!
- Yes!

201
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,500
- I am joining!
- Me too!

202
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,759
Hey. You stay behind.

203
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,929
Why?

204
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Let me join too!

205
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,240
How brave!

206
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,110
What about you?

207
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,350
I am...

208
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,490
I...

209
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,259
have no thoughts
of joining the volunteer army.

210
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,899
Oh, goodness.

211
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,399
Look at his morals.

212
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,639
That is enough.

213
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,009
It is voluntary.

214
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,409
We are asking people
to step forward out of loyalty.

215
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,779
It is not an obligation.

216
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,350
If you are not healthy enough to fight...

217
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,720
My body is perfectly healthy.

218
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,460
However, I have something to ask.

219
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,259
The King fled, abandoning his people.

220
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,529
Why...

221
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,600
should the people save him?

222
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,269
Why?

223
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,470
We are saving the root of our nation.

224
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,679
Fleeing at the first sense of danger.

225
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,379
Is that what the nation's root does?

226
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,509
- You good-for-nothing fool!
- How dare he?

227
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,919
How could he say that?

228
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,250
What is wrong with him?

229
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,820
We need to do our best to...

230
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,919
I do not get it at all.

231
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,330
You do your best and save your King.

232
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,559
My goodness...

233
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,509
Even the snotty kid
raised his hand to volunteer to fight.

234
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,779
I am so very impressed.

235
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,259
It is winter,
so I am most worried about their clothes.

236
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,090
Shall we donate ten geun of
cotton wool each...

237
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,559
to make padded clothes?

238
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,400
That is a great idea.

239
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,829
I will make padded clothes
for Young Master Jun Jeol,

240
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,670
and on the ribbon tie,
I will embroider my name.

241
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,940
On the inside of Young Master Dae Ho's,

242
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,069
I will sew a talisman wrapped in a cloth.

243
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,940
- To keep him alive?
- No.

244
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,240
To make sure his gaze does not wander.

245
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,609
My gosh. There is a talisman for that?

246
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,849
I will also embroider my name
on Young Master Yeon Jun's...

247
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,460
Will you really flee?

248
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,329
While everyone else fights?

249
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,769
Yes.

250
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,799
That is my favorite jacket.
Fold it carefully.

251
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,569
My goodness.

252
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,980
If you were born a man,
you should ride a horse into battle...

253
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,109
and wield a sword.

254
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,119
You, fool. Do you think battles are fun?

255
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,579
It is about punishing the wicked.

256
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,089
Do you think the foreigners intruded
because they are wicked?

257
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,920
They invaded another nation
and are stabbing people to death.

258
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,529
Is that what good people do?

259
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,329
- They are not good either.
- Right.

260
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,329
Anyway,

261
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,769
if all men join the righteous army,

262
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,339
who will be left here?

263
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,470
Well,

264
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,039
the old, the kids, and the women.

265
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,920
This will not do.

266
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,460
Wait here.

267
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,359
Where are you going? Jang...

268
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,230
Goodbye.

269
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,960
- Be in touch.
- I will.

270
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,970
It is freezing cold.

271
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,000
Bye.

272
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,069
- Be safe.
- Okay.

273
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,089
My lady.

274
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,859
We meet again.

275
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,759
You have not fled yet?

276
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,589
I will soon.

277
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,099
Why not...

278
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,970
flee with me?

279
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,970
My goodness.

280
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,680
If we head south, far from the fortress...

281
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,210
I will not flee.

282
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,349
You can run as fast as you can.

283
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,549
They could die.

284
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,490
The righteous army.

285
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,529
You be careful
so as not to break your nose...

286
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:54,700
falling backward as you flee.

287
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
Dignified Young Master Yeon Jun
will defeat the intruders...

288
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,269
Have you seen the barbarians?

289
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,440
- Well...
- No.

290
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,279
They have never reached this far south.

291
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,309
What do you know...

292
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,650
about them?

293
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:17,119
They drink warm blood
and eat raw flesh of animals,

294
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,160
and men and women
eat and sleep huddled together.

295
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,329
I heard they are uncivilized.

296
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,029
Are they not?

297
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,460
They do ingest
the blood and flesh of animals.

298
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,299
But...

299
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,339
have you not heard
they are warriors well-trained enough...

300
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,109
to eat and sleep on running horses?

301
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,880
They are clumsy farming folk,

302
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,309
and most cannot tell paper from writing.

303
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,680
However,

304
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,920
though they cannot read,

305
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,819
they can kill, and well.

306
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,930
Your oh-so-great Young Master Yeon Jun?

307
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:03,170
He who spent most of his days
reading at a desk,

308
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,440
and whose heart breaks for his nation.

309
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,200
That Young Master Yeon Jun.

310
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:11,170
I think highly of his loyalty,

311
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:14,910
but do you think he can even touch
the hair on a barbarian's head?

312
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,150
Oh, no.

313
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:26,160
Against the barbarian warriors
who are expert killers.

314
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:30,630
Do you think he will survive?

315
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,890
Come on!

316
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,259
Fight!

317
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,579
Though they cannot read,

318
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:22,279
they can kill, and well.

319
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,680
Against the barbarian warriors
who are expert killers.

320
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,420
Do you think he will survive?

321
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
My lady.

322
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,970
Why are you here?

323
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,970
Are the preparations going well?

324
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Yes.

325
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,970
The weapons are rusty and we are stiff,

326
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,980
so we will leave
after a few days of training.

327
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,710
But we are in need of armor and horses.

328
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,609
Do not join the army.

329
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
What?

330
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,789
The Qing warriors.

331
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,490
They are skilled killers.

332
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,960
One throw of their lance from horseback...

333
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,829
can skewer five or six men.

334
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,970
You chose to read and study
instead of shooting arrows.

335
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,269
Too kindhearted to even kill a bird.

336
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,740
In battle, face-to-face
with the barbarians, you will clearly...

337
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,180
I could die.

338
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,650
But His Majesty
is locked up in Namhan Fortress.

339
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,950
All the people of Joseon can do...

340
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,190
is live as a coward...

341
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,859
or die with pride.

342
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,569
But...

343
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,210
We have to stop them.

344
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,539
The Qing army are fast and cruel,

345
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,480
- and bookish young scholars...
- Are no match for them.

346
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,950
You know the young master could die...

347
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,019
and did not deter him?

348
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:08,890
Fighting is not done with just strength.

349
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,720
Young Master Yeon Jun
is a passionately loyal strategist.

350
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,519
Are the barbarians not strategic...

351
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,430
and are they not loyal to their master?

352
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,000
Young Master Yeon Jun
studied and trained...

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,859
his whole life to be a loyal subject.

354
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
How could he ignore his nation's plight?

355
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,569
A loyal subject? Yes, that is all great.

356
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,509
It is good to serve the people and King.

357
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,180
I do not care if the King lives or dies.

358
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,210
Gil Chae.

359
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,210
But...

360
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,680
when I think of the young masters
getting shot through the heart...

361
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,150
and bones broken by spears...

362
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,319
Will you let him die?

363
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Yes.

364
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,680
You are right.

365
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,420
Young Master Yeon Jun could die.

366
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,990
I might never see him again.

367
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,950
Yes. That is it.

368
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,250
You are doing the right thing.

369
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,190
What are they saying?

370
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:56,930
Yes.

371
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,460
The conversation must have gone well.

372
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,930
Eun Ae.

373
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,970
Gil Chae.

374
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,240
Yes. Did the talk go well?

375
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,279
Does it mean Young Master Yeon Jun
will not go to the...

376
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,839
Young Master said...

377
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,509
we will wed
before he departs for the battle.

378
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,049
What?

379
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,019
You will wed?

380
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,690
You were right.

381
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,319
Young Master might not return,

382
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,029
and I cannot let him go
without tying a knot.

383
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,660
Thank you.

384
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,980
What do I do?

385
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,150
Stop crying.

386
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,180
Your eyes will get ugly
if you cry too much.

387
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,089
They will not actually wed, will they?

388
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,230
If Young Master Yeon Jun
decides to do it, he will do it.

389
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,490
No.

390
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,930
It is Lady Eun Ae who takes action
once she sets her heart to do something.

391
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,599
I am ruined.

392
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,099
I am completely ruined.

393
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,369
So why did you bother
encouraging Lady Eun Ae...

394
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,839
Shut it.

395
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,609
I wanted him not to go to war.

396
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,240
I did not want him to wed Eun Ae.

397
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,640
Why Eun Ae though?

398
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,410
Why did he choose Eun Ae over me?

399
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,349
You are being too...

400
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,420
Too what?

401
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,349
You know it better than anyone.

402
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,720
Men do not care for the fish
they have already caught,

403
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,890
and they easily get tired of the woman
chasing after them.

404
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,970
Right. You are right.

405
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,599
Right?

406
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,269
So stop obsessing
over Young Master Yeon Jun...

407
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,569
Young Master Yeon Jun has never...

408
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,940
even considered the idea
that I might become someone else's wife.

409
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,710
That is it.

410
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,450
If...

411
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,990
I were to become someone else's wife,

412
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,589
he would realize his feelings...

413
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,059
and finally confess...

414
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,859
that he only loves me.

415
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,029
Then I would pretend to resist
and help him get up while saying,

416
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,930
"I also love you."

417
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,240
My lady!

418
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,769
What?

419
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,190
My lady.

420
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,519
Why did you want to see me?

421
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,630
Are you ready to leave for the militia?

422
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,369
Yes.

423
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,200
With this hand, I will chop the enemy's
head and present it to you, Lady Gil Chae.

424
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh, my goodness.

425
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,140
I do not wish to hear
such a gruesome thing.

426
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,539
I am sorry.

427
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,380
But you fighting the enemy...

428
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,079
is truly reassuring, is it not?

429
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:04,450
Thank you.

430
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,150
No,

431
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,650
I should thank you.

432
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,789
But...

433
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,650
it is truly disheartening.

434
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,559
What? What is?

435
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,529
I believe the elders of our families
have talked about us many years ago.

436
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,700
That we would make
good spouses to each other.

437
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,099
That is simply what the elders desire.

438
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,769
There is no way you would care for
someone as dumb as me.

439
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,309
I heard Young Master Yeon Jun
plans to wed Eun Ae before leaving...

440
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:33,279
to show his love for her.

441
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,579
You are so insensitive.

442
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,019
My lady.

443
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,230
- Goodness. Thank you.
- Thank you.

444
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,430
Thank you.

445
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,799
Goodness.

446
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,369
Eat a lot.

447
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,880
Eat a lot, boy.

448
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,380
Heavens!

449
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,789
Soon, this unworthy man is leaving soon...

450
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,619
to rescue His Majesty.

451
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,359
Before leaving,

452
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,059
I have just one wish.

453
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,200
Come on, Boy.

454
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,799
You should not worry about us.

455
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,000
Right.

456
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,569
What?

457
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,099
Lady Gil Chae.

458
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,539
Please marry me.

459
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,910
What?

460
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,380
My lady.

461
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,759
Young Master, how can you do that
when so many people are present?

462
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,799
It is because my heart is proud...

463
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,730
and unashamed under the sun.

464
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,200
If someone asks what the best thing
I have done in my life is,

465
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,339
I will say it is the courage
I showed today.

466
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,509
Boy!

467
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,539
Why would you behave so disgracefully
in the presence of so many people?

468
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,180
- Father!
- Gosh.

469
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,480
This is my one and only wish.

470
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,849
I might die in the battlefield.

471
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:25,089
Will you ignore my wish?

472
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,990
- Goodness.
- Oh, my goodness.

473
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,460
- Wait.
- Wait.

474
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,029
My goodness.

475
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,769
That was beautiful.

476
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,609
- They look good together.
- They do.

477
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,170
Please marry me.

478
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:19,880
What? Marry him?

479
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,779
You are marrying in a fit of anger?

480
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,450
What does that matter to you?

481
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,119
That naive Young Master Soon Yak
may have proposed to you...

482
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,019
very loudly for no good reason.

483
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,460
Will Young Master Yeon Jun
really change his mind because of that?

484
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,839
You see, Young Master Yeon Jun is...

485
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,539
a practical man.

486
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,970
He might have pretended
to be shaken by you,

487
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,109
but he has no intention of marrying you.

488
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,309
Do you know why?

489
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,180
He cannot handle a woman like you
whose reputation is not so great.

490
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,289
He is too fragile...

491
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,289
to handle someone like you.

492
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,329
What?

493
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:14,099
Young Master Yeon Jun is
practical and fragile?

494
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,569
You are the one
who packed up to flee to save yourself.

495
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,269
Young Master Yeon Jun is
risking his life...

496
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,210
for his people and his King,
and yet you belittle him.

497
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,910
Speak Young Master Yeon Jun's name...

498
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:28,539
with that wretched mouth of yours,

499
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,880
and I will turn
that stone-like face of yours...

500
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,279
into dust.

501
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,859
Dust? That is a bit too harsh, is it not?

502
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,059
What? Young Master Yeon Jun
is practical and fragile?

503
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,700
I have a bad reputation?

504
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,470
Well, your reputation is
not exactly pristine.

505
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,170
Even so.

506
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,880
You are so strange, My lady.

507
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,210
When Young Master Jang Hyun speaks to you,

508
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,609
you react to every word he says.

509
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,250
When other young masters bother you,

510
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,849
you do not let them get near you.

511
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,079
When did I?

512
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,489
I have never done that.

513
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,019
Gosh.

514
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,369
Gil Chae.

515
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,639
Do you plan to wed Young Master Soon Yak?

516
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,039
I do not know.

517
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,579
Actually, I thought you had...

518
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,380
feelings for another one.

519
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,219
Me?

520
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,119
Who?

521
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,250
On the day of
the 60th wedding anniversary party,

522
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,889
we were all shocked at the news
of the war that just broke out.

523
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,090
We did.

524
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,800
Do you know who you first looked at
as soon as you heard that?

525
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,929
What?

526
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,869
Well, I do not remember...

527
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,510
I thought that you had feelings for him.

528
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,380
Actually, I set this meeting up
at Young Master Soon Yak's request.

529
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,809
He will be here soon.

530
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,590
Usually, the wedding date
should be decided upon carefully.

531
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,690
However, that is not possible
with so much unrest.

532
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,260
So I would like to ask, Gil Chae.

533
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,000
Do you intend...

534
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,230
to marry Young Master Soon Yak
before he leaves for the army?

535
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,579
Well, since he is...

536
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,349
the groom my parents chose for me...

537
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:52,820
My lady.

538
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,329
In that case,

539
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,929
shall we have our weddings together?

540
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
What do you think?

541
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,039
I would love that.

542
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,860
My lady.

543
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,199
How cruel.

544
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,639
This is so cruel.

545
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,159
Wipe your tears.

546
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,630
Your skin will crumble
if you dry it in the cold wind.

547
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,409
Are you that upset
about Yeon Jun getting married?

548
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,250
We are about
to lose the country and the King,

549
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,219
- but that is what makes you sad?
- Yes.

550
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:35,059
For me, this is sadder
than losing the country.

551
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,230
In fact, war and death
do not scare or faze me!

552
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,239
Death does not scare or faze you, I see.

553
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,670
You are hopeless.

554
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,119
In that case, how about stopping them
from getting married?

555
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,090
I am upset because I cannot stop them
no matter what I try!

556
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,719
Do you need my help?

557
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,719
My lady.

558
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:12,800
What will you do for me if I help you?

559
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,199
As if you can.

560
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,030
Stop teasing me and leave.

561
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,039
Just go!

562
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,360
I heard that you have problems
getting armor and weapons.

563
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,389
The weapons we procured ten years ago
during the invasion...

564
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,829
are old and rusty.

565
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,059
Although they are being mended...

566
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,500
I can help.

567
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,800
I have armor and weapons
that I bought months ago.

568
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,769
You stocked up on weapons?

569
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,409
Call it a merchant's intuition.

570
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,710
Since I trade with foreigners,

571
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,050
I knew that something big
would happen soon.

572
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,250
To join the battlefield,

573
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:12,889
the people would have
to buy their own weapons and armor.

574
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,460
I knew that
this would be a great business.

575
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,030
You are a member of the gentry...

576
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,900
yet you are blinded by money.

577
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,260
How can you think of gaining wealth...

578
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,000
when the country is in trouble?

579
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,769
What a materialistic fool!

580
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:26,940
Enough.

581
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,940
We are the ones in debt.

582
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,440
We have not even paid you back
for the rice you gave the school.

583
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,179
Is there also a condition this time?

584
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,780
Since you provided rice
in return for your school admission,

585
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,250
you must also have a condition this time.

586
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,559
Now...

587
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,460
we are talking.

588
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,960
Before the voluntary troops leave,

589
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,300
I heard that many are rushing
to get married.

590
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,469
What do you think
of postponing the weddings?

591
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,769
If you were to die on the battlefield...

592
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,639
Are you done?

593
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,010
I thought you were going to war.

594
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,719
Are you not prepared
to sacrifice your life?

595
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,159
For men,

596
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,130
remarrying after their wives die...

597
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,489
would cause no consequences
to their children.

598
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,429
But if widowed women were to remarry,

599
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:30,599
(Remarry: when women have
a second marriage)

600
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,139
their children's past
would be shamed upon...

601
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,900
and they cannot rise up the ranks.

602
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,139
Therefore,

603
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,280
a widowed man
may continue living his life...

604
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,750
but a widowed woman's life...

605
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,219
will stop with the death of her husband.

606
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:53,659
Please spare a thought
for the futures of Neunggun-ri ladies.

607
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:58,559
They were raised with love and care.

608
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:00,199
Do you plan to...

609
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:03,369
drive their futures
off the edge of a cliff?

610
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,170
Lady Gil Chae.

611
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,670
I am leaving soon.

612
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:41,769
Before that,

613
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:44,309
I decided on something...

614
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,440
as I cherish you so much.

615
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,409
What have you decided on?

616
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,920
I will not marry you.

617
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,250
What?

618
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,320
A widowed man
may continue living his life...

619
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,190
but a widowed woman's life...

620
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:06,000
will stop with the death of her husband.

621
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,269
As such, all of us Neunggun-ri men...

622
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,269
have decided not to get married
before we leave.

623
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,610
By all, you mean...

624
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:30,050
Therefore, I will...

625
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,119
My lady.

626
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,989
Lady Gil Chae!

627
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,130
But Young Master, I...

628
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:45,000
I misjudged Lee Jang Hyun.

629
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,400
It seems like he is a very thoughtful man.

630
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,269
But...

631
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,380
Instead,

632
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,179
I will keep you in my heart.

633
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:31,849
It is all right.

634
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,280
At least they are not getting married.

635
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,719
That is good enough.

636
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,019
Call for Young Master Soon Yak.

637
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,590
Again? What for?

638
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,710
My lady.

639
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,480
Jong Jong is looking.

640
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,110
Oh, right.

641
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,750
In Neunggun-ri, you are the best archer...

642
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,590
and you are great with the sword, right?

643
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,320
Are you not the bravest one
in our village?

644
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,929
Well, I...

645
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,860
Eun Ae...

646
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,670
is very concerned that
Young Master Yeon Jun could get hurt.

647
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,800
I would like you to,

648
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,170
for Eun Ae's sake,

649
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,940
stay close to Young Master Yeon Jun.

650
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,980
If you were to shield him
with your broad shoulders...

651
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,550
My lady.

652
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,650
My friend Eun Ae would be pleased,

653
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,719
and so would I.

654
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:21,989
Then...

655
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:24,260
Then what?

656
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,230
When you return, the two of us...

657
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,469
The two of us?

658
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,440
- Without Jong Jong.
- Without Jong Jong?

659
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,280
I will do that.

660
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,949
You have my word.

661
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,519
Goodbye.

662
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,860
- My lady.
- Bye.

663
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,030
Is he leaving or what?

664
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,969
Jong Jong.

665
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,469
He will not marry, right?

666
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,679
Are you following me around?

667
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,750
Do you have anything for me?

668
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,679
Say, a token of gratitude?

669
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,420
What nonsense is that?

670
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,519
Do you still think...

671
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,360
I am a shallow, cowardly, ugly rock?

672
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,659
Do you think...

673
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,030
asking repeatedly
will turn a rock into gold?

674
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,769
If I were to do something
to protect the people,

675
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,539
would I seem less ugly?

676
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,579
To Young Master Soon Yak,

677
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,079
you promised something in return
for protecting Young Master Yeon Jun.

678
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:53,579
Something about being without Jong Jong.

679
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,679
You eavesdropped?

680
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,289
Here is a suggestion.

681
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:00,260
If I assist in protecting the people,

682
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,059
and if I am lucky enough
to come back alive,

683
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:06,230
then...

684
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,940
allow me to kiss your precious lips.

685
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,719
Well done.

686
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,889
That is what to do.

687
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,059
After we leave,

688
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,900
if you come across a barbarian,

689
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:50,369
chase him away by doing what you just did.

690
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,250
Goodbye.

691
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,679
On this day,

692
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,010
I take to the stand
to take a vow with the people.

693
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,219
I swear...

694
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,920
to defeat the intruders
who trespass on our land!

695
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,860
May Joseon stand forever!

696
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,630
May our land thrive forever!

697
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,360
Did I eat
too many ginseng candies this morning?

698
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,389
Why is my heart racing?

699
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,889
Yours too?

700
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,329
Mine too.

701
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,070
Men.

702
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,340
He asked last night
if I would look upon him with favor...

703
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,110
if he were to protect the people.

704
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,480
He decided to join the fight
to impress me.

705
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,150
As if I care for him.

706
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,650
What a fool.

707
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,780
Will you join the army?

708
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,949
No.

709
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,420
I am about to flee.

710
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,690
- He is fleeing with that armor?
- Look at him.

711
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,960
- Of course.
- I knew it.

712
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,460
Oh, this armor?

713
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,730
I am wearing it for fear of...

714
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,670
meeting the Qing army on the road.

715
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,039
I will return.

716
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,210
Stay safe and be brave.

717
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,809
- Please do not worry about me.
- Be safe.

718
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:11,780
I wish I could come with you.

719
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,050
My gosh. Not one person
will bid us farewell.

720
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,789
Who would shed a tear
for someone who chooses to run?

721
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,760
I will return.

722
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,730
- Stay safe.
- I will.

723
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,809
They say a gift from a woman...

724
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:43,210
will keep you alive.

725
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,809
We are fleeing, not fighting.

726
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,050
That is just as scary.

727
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,090
Oh, dear.

728
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,360
I am out of things to give.

729
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,159
Let me see.

730
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,760
Who could you ask?

731
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,960
Soon Yak!

732
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,570
Soon Yak.

733
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,929
Just a moment.

734
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,539
Do not forget...

735
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,079
our promise.

736
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,610
Do not worry. I will guard Yeon Jun...

737
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,780
I am talking about you.

738
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,019
Do not get hurt, okay?

739
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:23,389
Me, you mean?

740
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,289
Do not worry.

741
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,559
I will not lose a single hair.

742
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,719
Soon Yak.

743
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,960
Father.

744
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,340
- Hi.
- Gil Chae.

745
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,179
Do you not have something
for Young Master Jang Hyun?

746
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,780
What?

747
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,090
Oh, I see.

748
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:22,440
I have nothing to give a rock on the run.

749
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,980
I have something for you.

750
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:29,849
Take it.

751
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,369
What a common trick.

752
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,340
Do you give a dagger
to every woman you meet?

753
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,539
Forget it.

754
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,909
Keep it.

755
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,739
And do me a favor.

756
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,579
Over there.

757
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:59,780
If you see smoke
from the top of that mountain,

758
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,750
promise to flee.

759
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,659
Why should we flee
when the young masters fight for us?

760
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:10,059
Also, do you think it is an easy feat
for a whole village to flee?

761
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,360
Some are heavily pregnant...

762
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,130
Then flee on your own.

763
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:16,400
I care not for the others.

764
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,539
You promised.

765
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:27,809
What did she give you?

766
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,280
She said she had nothing to give me.

767
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:35,449
But I thank you.

768
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,289
You treated this wanderer so well.

769
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,559
You did our village a great favor.

770
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,590
And also,

771
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,960
we might become quite close.

772
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,860
What do you mean?

773
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,429
You like Gil Chae.

774
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
No.

775
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,440
Not at all.

776
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,949
Gil Chae and I grew up together.

777
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,780
I know Gil Chae well.

778
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,090
I might know her better than
she knows herself.

779
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,190
I know who Gil Chae has feelings for.

780
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,400
Do you know how I came to know that?

781
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,329
Ladies...

782
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,070
No, every person does it.

783
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,670
It is like a child looking for his mother.

784
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,039
Whenever you face danger,

785
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,809
you look for the person you can rely on.

786
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:42,320
On the day of the 60th wedding anniversary
party, when the news of war broke out,

787
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,050
I found myself looking at
Young Master Yeon Jun.

788
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,320
And I saw who Gil Chae was looking.

789
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,500
Be safe.

790
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,000
Make sure you return.

791
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,639
Gil Chae and I both will wait for you.

792
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:09,039
- Be safe.
- Take care.

793
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,880
We will wait for you.

794
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,750
- Be safe.
- Make sure you return.

795
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,780
Be safe.

796
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,989
Be safe.

797
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:34,769
Be safe.

798
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,469
Take care.

799
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:38,739
You must return.

800
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,210
Please come back.

801
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,949
Even the armor looks
so good on Young Master Yeon Jun.

802
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,289
It is the armor Jang Hyun gave him.

803
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:53,320
- What?
- His condition was most absurd though.

804
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:55,219
What condition?

805
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,760
He told Young Master Yeon Jun
not to wed Eun Ae before leaving.

806
00:56:00,699 --> 00:56:01,730
You are saying...

807
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:05,469
they did not wed
all because of Young Master Jang Hyun?

808
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:06,699
That is it.

809
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:08,099
He does not want others to get married...

810
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,670
because he does not believe in marriage.

811
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,579
Stop them from getting married.

812
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,409
Do you need my help?

813
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,690
Do you know who you first looked at
as soon as you heard that?

814
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,090
Did I...

815
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,530
look at that stone?

816
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,679
What are you thinking about?

817
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,059
On the day of Grandpa Song Chu's
60th wedding anniversary party,

818
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,329
did you see who Lady Gil Chae looked...

819
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:07,400
as soon as she heard the news of the war?

820
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:10,269
They...

821
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,329
took His Majesty captive!

822
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:23,179
She looked at Young Master Yeon Jun.

823
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,650
I knew it.

824
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:52,670
Look.

825
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:03,219
You are from Neunggun-ri.

826
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:05,619
Yes. We received His Majesty's decree.

827
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,989
Our departure got delayed for several days
because of the armor.

828
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,329
- We apologize.
- It is all right.

829
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:13,230
I have been trying to understand
the state of things.

830
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Look.

831
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,269
His Majesty is over there.

832
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,599
We are very close by,

833
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,039
but His Majesty has no clue
that we have stationed here.

834
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:28,880
We will let him know now.

835
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,780
Yes, sir.

836
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,380
Your Majesty, I am an officer
from the Propaganda Office.

837
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,449
Come in.

838
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,420
Your Majesty,

839
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,190
they have fired flaming arrows.

840
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:19,030
The royal forces have arrived.

841
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,230
(Geunwangbyeong: The army
loyal to the king and the royal family)

842
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,329
His Majesty is waiting at Namhan Fortress,

843
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,400
vomiting blood
and waiting for us to rescue him.

844
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:30,840
The name of the man
who dies for His Majesty...

845
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,409
will be recorded in history
and remembered for generations.

846
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,440
So do not fear.

847
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,179
Do not be afraid.

848
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,150
If we die today,
we will be saving His Majesty,

849
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,849
Joseon, and the government.

850
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:46,989
As soon as the day breaks tomorrow,

851
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,960
we will hit the Qing
that have besieged Namhan Fortress...

852
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,460
and take His Majesty to Ganghwa Island.

853
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,030
With your hands,

854
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,730
with your swords,
will you rescue His Majesty?

855
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,849
Ambush!

856
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,650
It is an ambush!

857
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,840
Make sure you stay behind me.

858
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:36,429
Hey!

859
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,449
When I saw you drawing the sword,

860
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:35,090
I thought you were finally
going to go take down the enemies.

861
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,659
Yet you are just peeling persimmons.

862
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,130
You are back.

863
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,730
What happened?

864
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,030
It is just as you predicted.

865
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:49,769
Goodness.

866
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,610
The royal forces of General Jung Se Gyu...

867
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,210
ran into the foreign intruders
on the way to Namhan Fortress,

868
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,309
and they were brutally defeated.

869
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,280
Did they not say
the young masters of Neunggun-ri...

870
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,179
were going to General Jung too?

871
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,929
Anyway, the ones up there
should fight and make a decision.

872
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,260
They would not come all the way down here.

873
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,630
I heard some of
the intruders from Great Jin...

874
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,570
are Mongolian soldiers.

875
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,440
Mongolian soldiers are different.

876
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,880
Different? How so?

877
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,219
Han people and Manchu people
follow Kahn's strict order.

878
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:38,820
The Mongolians have another reason
for joining this war.

879
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,489
What is that?

880
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,429
Wealth and women.

881
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,360
Young Master.

882
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:02,610
(My Dearest)

883
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,130
I hear the horses. They are coming.

884
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:24,329
I will bring them.

885
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:25,699
Go up the mountain
and raise the smoke signal.

886
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,199
Do not take the boat.

887
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,940
Another way...

888
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,440
We have to go another way.

889
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:33,170
The Mongol army has come
to loot the Joseon people.

890
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,940
We just need to get past that mountain.

891
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,880
Take your kids and run! Hurry!

892
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,380
Where are you now?

893
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,280
I am scared and tired.

894
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,920
On this day,

895
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,690
nothing happened to us.

896
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,119
I have to catch these punks.

897
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:54,443
