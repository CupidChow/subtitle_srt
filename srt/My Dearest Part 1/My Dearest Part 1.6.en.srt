1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,410
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,080
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,910
(Episode 6)

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,929
Then let us do this.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
I swear by the moonlight.

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,670
Go to Ganghwa Island.

7
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:39,509
This time, wherever you are,

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,719
I will make sure...

9
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,420
I find you.

10
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,600
What were you going to do
if I said I was not going to go?

11
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,500
Did you think I was going to
follow you wherever you go?

12
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,299
Yes.

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,310
I told you to call me
"big brother," did I not?

14
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,650
By the way, how do you tie this?

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,680
Come on. You are rushing again.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Ryang Eum.

17
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,920
Do you think
your song will work this time?

18
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,120
Do not worry.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,760
I do not know about other things,
but I know...

20
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,730
that that song will work on the intruders.

21
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,599
You are very confident.

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,370
If it does not work, we will
die together. No big deal.

23
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,799
What are you saying?

24
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,269
Let us go. Join the envoy's departure,

25
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,209
and wait for the right time
to remain in the enemy's camp.

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,980
Let us go.

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,010
(Nojin: Jin's military camp)

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,689
I would not mind dying.

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,189
Together.

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,890
(My Dearest)

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,469
Where are you from?

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,669
From Tosan.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,409
I thought Joseon people were gentle,

34
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,409
but they are surprisingly tough.

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,050
They are indeed tough.

36
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,349
Even their dogs are tough.

37
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,090
This one got bitten by a dog
and is still limping around.

38
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,990
Look!

39
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:35,389
Prostrate yourself.

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,030
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,669
It is the banner of the Khan.

42
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,340
That flag always moves with the Khan.

43
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,069
Wherever that flag goes,
the Khan is there.

44
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,479
And wherever Khan is,

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,280
that flag is there.

46
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,810
So, Khan really came?

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,550
Most likely.

48
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,919
I need to see it with my own eyes.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,210
<i>Baby, baby, my baby</i>

50
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,849
<i>Baby, baby, my pretty baby</i>

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,860
<i>- My treasure, go to sleep</i>
- I will make him stop.

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,960
<i>My treasure, go to sleep</i>

53
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,800
<i>Grow well, my small baby</i>

54
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:53,710
<i>Gentle, small wind</i>

55
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,740
<i>Even birds fly to their nests</i>

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,919
<i>Go to sleep, my pretty baby</i>

57
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,949
General!

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,870
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,939
Enter.

60
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,009
It is Khan.

61
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,360
How can your song be...

62
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,170
so sorrowful?

63
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,470
Thinking of my companions
who died on the battlefield,

64
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,199
I felt too sad.

65
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,500
From my homeland,

66
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,269
I brought clothes and food.

67
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,439
But I could not bring the music with me,
and I always felt empty.

68
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,980
I am glad I met you today.

69
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,990
Your Majesty, I am honored.

70
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,079
You are to come here once a day
and sing for me.

71
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,829
His Majesty...

72
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,970
is fussy enough to keep count
of the enemy's firewood...

73
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,569
but is reckless enough
to let his guard down at times.

74
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,970
Especially...

75
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,279
toward the Chahar warriors.

76
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,350
How did you know we came from Chahar?

77
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,550
(Chahar: A province of Inner Mongolia
until Qing's conquest in 1635)

78
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,649
You recognized it!

79
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,589
Yes, it is sand from Chahar.

80
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,089
His Majesty achieved a grand victory
in Chahar and received his royal seal.

81
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,990
We were told that
keeping sand from that place...

82
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,329
would help invite good luck.

83
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,670
Is that so?

84
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,569
Whether it is your good luck charm or not,

85
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,470
we shall find out.

86
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,980
General!

87
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,759
That is nothing. Stop!

88
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,699
It is nothing!

89
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,939
Will we be all right?

90
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,649
Yes, do not worry.

91
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,120
I have never seen intruders
who disliked money.

92
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,919
Do you know why
the Khan is always busy waging war?

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,460
It is because he must accumulate wealth
to feed his men.

94
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,559
However, we should not underestimate
that man, Yong Gol Dae.

95
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,929
Well...

96
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,100
Even so, he is a mere barbarian.

97
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,450
You.

98
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,519
You are not Mongolian.

99
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,350
Not Manchurian either.

100
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,090
- Are you Han Chinese?
- No.

101
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,990
I am from Joseon.

102
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,730
Joseon?

103
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,929
I was taken as a prisoner of war
in the Year of Jeongmyo.

104
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,730
I came here as I was told that
they would let me join the army...

105
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,669
if I made a meaningful contribution
as their guide.

106
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,409
You are guiding them
so they could conquer your homeland.

107
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,580
Are you not ashamed?

108
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,350
In Joseon,

109
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,179
I was a slave all my life.

110
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,519
I deeply despise Joseon.

111
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,129
Where did you get this gold?

112
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,830
Do you not know...

113
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,370
that what porters have
all belong to their masters?

114
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:00,169
After my master abandoned me,

115
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,070
I found a chest with some gold inside.

116
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,840
I could not bring everything with me
as it was too big and heavy.

117
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,450
I only brought some of it.

118
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,950
So...

119
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,879
there is more gold?

120
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,679
Yes.

121
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,889
Since I am a Joseon man,

122
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:20,659
I know where people from Joseon
hide their valuables.

123
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,929
If you let me go,

124
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:25,529
I will tell you where it is.

125
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,620
There was a man named Ha Seo Guk.

126
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,629
Your former king,

127
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,490
Gwanghae,

128
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,860
had sent him as a spy
to find out what the Great Jin was up to.

129
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,000
And he managed to deceive me
and His Majesty as well.

130
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,970
But perhaps,

131
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,240
you could say that pitiful man...

132
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,940
was used by both Joseon and the Great Jin.

133
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,080
No!

134
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,169
So it is you.

135
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,169
Tie him up.

136
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,090
It pains you to see your friend get hurt,

137
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,860
which is why we will...

138
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,259
torture him right before your eyes.

139
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,029
Answer my questions truthfully,

140
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,059
or we will pull out his toenails,
one by one.

141
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,299
General.

142
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,370
See?

143
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,070
This fool is more desperate.

144
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,639
I knew I would recognize the real deal.

145
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,220
Now, let me ask you again.

146
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,559
Where are you from?

147
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,629
And how did you two meet?

148
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,000
If I think that
you are not being truthful,

149
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,070
that fool...

150
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,909
dies.

151
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,720
(Ganghwa Island)

152
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
Where should we go?

153
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,440
Why is it pointing up?
Could this be an ominous sign?

154
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,230
My mother was a nomadic Jurchen
in Hoeryong.

155
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,340
(Hoeryong: North Hamgyong Province,
near the Tumen River)

156
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,370
And my father was from Joseon.

157
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,840
I lost both of my parents
due to Joseon's subjugation...

158
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,750
and became a slave
at the local office in Eunsan.

159
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
I was bitten by a wild animal
and nearly died,

160
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,019
but this man here saved me.

161
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,669
I noticed that you could sing well.

162
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:25,840
I learned a few Jurchen songs
from my mother.

163
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,870
But why did you start singing
out of the blue earlier in the day?

164
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,679
So His Majesty would hear it?

165
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,149
No.

166
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,580
I never even imagined
that His Majesty would hear it.

167
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:42,990
Fine.

168
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,889
Then...

169
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,159
where are you from?

170
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,090
And how did you two meet?

171
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,000
Must you ask the same question
over and over again?

172
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,870
Kill me instead.

173
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,240
Just kill me!

174
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,580
I...

175
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,419
will bite my tongue
and bleed to death right here.

176
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,549
What will you do if His Majesty wishes
to hear the songs of his homeland?

177
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,259
You are not lying.

178
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,870
Fine.

179
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,710
You may sing for His Majesty,
but do it with all your heart.

180
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,350
You must make His Majesty happy.

181
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,389
Come along, lads.

182
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,309
Jang Hyun.

183
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,049
Jang Hyun...

184
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,519
Ryang Eum.

185
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,159
You did well.

186
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,159
Well done.

187
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,509
Your Highness.

188
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,309
Come in.

189
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,879
Your Highness,

190
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,850
I received a letter from Jang Hyun.

191
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,320
(Napseo: a secret letter sent
in a wax ball)

192
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,170
I saw Khan encamped in Tancheon
with my own eyes.

193
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,559
Dorgon is here.

194
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,430
(Dorgon: the 14th son of Nurhaci)

195
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,730
But who are they?

196
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,500
Why are they frisking...

197
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
the elite troops like dogs?

198
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,940
They have red sashes.

199
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,150
Move!

200
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,890
The Dongro forces
led by Dorgon have arrived.

201
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,390
Dodo's troops brought culverins.

202
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,490
There are a total of 34 culverins.

203
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,390
And all the Qing soldiers...

204
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,559
are assembled under the fortress.

205
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,970
Hey, you from Tosan!

206
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,910
- Have a taste.
- It is soft.

207
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,339
Come on.

208
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,450
Come on.

209
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,880
Drink it!

210
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,250
They have acquired plenty of rice
from the Office of the State Granary...

211
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,579
and Gwangheungchang,
the administrative office.

212
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,490
Their horses were also
well-fed and rested,

213
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,349
so they were lustrous.

214
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,920
You would rather die than cut your hair?

215
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,329
Kill me, you fools! Just kill me!

216
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,059
Kill him.

217
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,900
But we cannot let him die easily.

218
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,430
Scalp him first,

219
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:57,940
then kill him.

220
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,119
Please have mercy. Do not kill me, please.

221
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,259
Please. Do not kill me.

222
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,029
Please have mercy. Do not kill me, please.

223
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,269
Both dying and killing
are no big deal to them.

224
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,029
Above all,

225
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:33,240
they had no fear in their eyes.

226
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,140
Khan is in Joseon.

227
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,710
They are here to fight a battle
that they will not...

228
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,880
No, they are here to fight a battle
that they cannot lose.

229
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,049
Khan is here.

230
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,660
If we choose to fight,
we will suffer greatly.

231
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,559
Are you that afraid
of the foreign intruders?

232
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,789
It is not because I am afraid.

233
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,660
It is to save the state.

234
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,059
We cannot save anything
by bending over to our enemy!

235
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,529
That is enough! Khan is here!

236
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,670
That does not change anything!

237
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,700
Listen.

238
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,039
In the Year of Jeongmyo,
after being invaded by the Jurchens...

239
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,509
(Hoin: foreign invaders from the north,
including the Jurchens)

240
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
day by day, we have been fearing...

241
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
the rise of the Great Jin.

242
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,279
Unlike their invasion
in the Year of Jeongmyo,

243
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,920
they unexpectedly chose
to carry out a direct attack...

244
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,519
and rapidly made their way south.

245
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,829
And today, I am locked up here.

246
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,000
Up until now,
I have been hesitating to make peace,

247
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,670
but there is no longer room for loyalty,

248
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,769
and Khan has already made his way
to Tancheon.

249
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,539
Therefore,

250
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,750
I shall now request a peace negotiation...

251
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,220
and prevent any further harm.

252
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,200
The king of Joseon...

253
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,900
is still...

254
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,440
better than Cho Dae Soo of Dalinghe.

255
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,680
He sent me a message,

256
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,509
saying that he had made a big mistake.

257
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,450
Do you want me to send a reply?

258
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,119
It will start like this.

259
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,029
I, the Emperor Taizong of Qing,

260
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,269
will issue an order...

261
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,210
to the king of Joseon.

262
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,940
No matter how rebellious and arrogant
the past letters from the intruders were,

263
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,680
there was never the word "order."

264
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,650
How presumptuous!

265
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,349
We can no longer make peace with them.

266
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,589
If you do,

267
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,460
you will receive criticism
from future generations...

268
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,829
for falling into the trap
of the foreign intruders!

269
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:14,160
How dare he issue an order!

270
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,769
I have learned the principles
of heaven and earth...

271
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:18,640
and have received a calling.

272
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,210
I shall generously accept
he who defects...

273
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,079
and keep he who surrenders safe.

274
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,710
He who stubbornly refuses to surrender...

275
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,380
will surely...

276
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,049
be subjugated.

277
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,259
You must not have enough milk.

278
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,470
You are sure this place is safe, right?

279
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,769
Whether we win or lose,

280
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,839
I just want this war to end already.

281
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,410
But...

282
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,710
if we lose,

283
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:04,180
I heard the intruders
will take away all the women...

284
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,049
to rape them...

285
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,789
and kill them.

286
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,720
That is why I heard that every woman...

287
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,230
should kill themselves if we lose.

288
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,630
You see, my lady,

289
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,470
I do not want to die.

290
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,200
Come off it.

291
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,019
We must defeat them!

292
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,519
We cannot make peace
with them, Your Majesty!

293
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,519
- We must defeat them!
- We must defeat them!

294
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,059
- Defeat them,
- Defeat them,

295
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,730
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

296
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,400
- They are demanding...
- We must defeat them!

297
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,130
to take the Crown Prince hostage...

298
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:00,200
and for us
to call their king "His Majesty."

299
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,509
Therefore,

300
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:05,339
I am here...

301
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,710
to discuss the matter
of calling their king...

302
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,019
Let them know...

303
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,490
that I will leave the fortress.

304
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,019
Your Highness!

305
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:19,720
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

306
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,309
From today, anyone who mentions sending
His Highness as a hostage...

307
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,339
and calling their king "His Majesty,"

308
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,779
will be treated like my enemy
who killed my parents,

309
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,079
and I shall no longer associate with them.

310
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,490
Your Majesty,

311
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,589
I already committed a grave sin
by ripping a sovereign message.

312
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,930
First, punish me.

313
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,329
Then reconsider things carefully,
Your Majesty.

314
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,670
If you rip it,
I will put it back together.

315
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,109
If you rip it again,

316
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,940
I too will put it back together again.

317
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,410
Your Majesty,

318
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,210
if we call their king "His Majesty,"

319
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,720
you will not be able to avoid
leaving the fortress.

320
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,819
Leaving the fortress?

321
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,190
Do not talk irrationally.

322
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,119
Once you leave the fortress,

323
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,559
it will be hard to avoid going through
the shame of being dragged up north.

324
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,930
From old times,
there has never been an instance...

325
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,099
in which the nation
and king have been preserved...

326
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,200
after intruders reached the fortress,
Your Majesty.

327
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,720
Your Majesty.

328
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,890
King of Joseon has sent a decree
referring to himself as a subject.

329
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,460
Even the Crown Prince will be sent
as a hostage.

330
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,599
Finally, we are here.

331
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,430
Now, order the King of Joseon...

332
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,740
to come out of the fortress...

333
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,710
and become my subject.

334
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,079
But...

335
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,910
They will not allow the King
to come out only to face death.

336
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,420
They fear that the same fate
as The Jingkang Incident will...

337
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,180
befall him if he leaves the fortress.

338
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,250
(The Jingkang Incident was an incident
where Jin Dynasty besieged...)

339
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,319
(and sacked the imperial palaces
of Northern Song Dynasty.)

340
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,450
That is true.

341
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,759
However,

342
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,890
since I came to Joseon,

343
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,289
the King must...

344
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
come out of the fortress.

345
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:45,339
Your Majesty,

346
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,410
you must not go outside the fortress.

347
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,180
All of this happened...

348
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,140
because of Choi Myung Gil's crime.

349
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,049
By requesting to send messengers,

350
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,250
he caused unimaginable disgrace.

351
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,480
Pressing us to send a reply,

352
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,420
he feared to defy...

353
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
the enemy's will.

354
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,220
Even if we pull out every hair
from Choi Myung Gil's head,

355
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,589
it is difficult to atone for his sins.

356
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,329
Punish Choi Myung Gil.

357
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,200
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.

358
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:22,009
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.

359
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,839
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

360
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,009
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.

361
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,750
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.
- Punish Choi Myung Gil.

362
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,920
Should I really...

363
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,319
go out of the fortress?

364
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,119
If they intend to spare
Your Majesty's life...

365
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,160
and preserve your throne,

366
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,160
how can they let Your Majesty
come out of the fortress?

367
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,500
They will undoubtedly...

368
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,299
wait for Your Majesty
to come out of the fortress...

369
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,740
to stage a situation similar to
The Jingkang Incident.

370
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,309
Your Majesty,

371
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,910
No matter what I must do,

372
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,279
I will prevent Your Majesty
from going out of the fortress.

373
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,089
Goodness.

374
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,430
Because I am still alive,

375
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,529
I am subjected
to such a miserable situation.

376
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,839
Your Majesty.

377
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:32,740
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

378
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,609
Your Majesty.

379
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,150
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

380
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,119
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

381
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,730
As you wish, we will identify...

382
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,529
the officials who oppose reconciliation,

383
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,900
send them out of the fortress,

384
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,400
and send the Crown Prince as a hostage.

385
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,240
However, please, at least,

386
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,910
let our King refrain
from leaving the fortress.

387
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:10,309
They will kick out the officials
who oppose reconciliation,

388
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,220
and send the Crown Prince as a hostage.

389
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,220
But...

390
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,049
they cannot send the King out.

391
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,960
Are you willing to defy our King...

392
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,730
just to shed blood
and provoke a major conflict?

393
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,200
Is this truly...

394
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,140
what the King of Joseon desires?

395
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,900
No! That is not it at all!

396
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,839
I will convey to His Majesty...

397
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,509
that the King of Joseon
seems to regard our King with disdain.

398
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:41,180
You must bear the burden
of what may come ahead!

399
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:43,650
General!

400
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
This is not the King's will.

401
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,380
It is simply
the wrongdoing of his subjects.

402
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:52,490
We, the subjects,
cannot bring ourselves...

403
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,890
to send Your Majesty out.

404
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,700
If possible, I wish I could
thrust a sword into my abdomen,

405
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,400
revealing our benevolent
King's true intentions!

406
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,970
General.

407
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,710
Their King is not even joining the war,

408
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,250
and how can they still be
truly devoted to him?

409
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,349
Joseon people are...

410
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,450
quite interesting.

411
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,390
If they do not bring news
of the King of Joseon's departure,

412
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:30,390
we will not see another envoy again.

413
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,430
Yes, sir.

414
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,710
Have we not yet received any reply yet?

415
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,880
Khan has ordered not to send envoys...

416
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,849
until the King of Joseon
arrives for the diplomatic mission.

417
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,720
These days, I do not hear
the sound of the chickens these days.

418
00:31:57,089 --> 00:32:00,190
I guess they ran out of chicken
because they served all of them to me.

419
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,759
Tell them not to serve me chickens
from now on.

420
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,750
Let us leave.

421
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,650
Khan has ordered not to send envoys...

422
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,690
until the King of Joseon
leaves the fortress.

423
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,329
But His Majesty is enduring to withstand
any departure, fearing assassination.

424
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,630
There is nothing left for us to do.

425
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,470
Whatever it may be, we need something
that can end the war quickly.

426
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,329
Why the sudden concern for the country?

427
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,369
When did you start
worrying about the nation?

428
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,170
That is right.

429
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,509
But somehow, I am curious
about the fate of this country now.

430
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,910
Why are you risking your life for this?

431
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,450
Have you ever received a proper
response from the Crown Prince's side?

432
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,619
Do they even trust you?

433
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,359
It does not matter whether
the Crown Prince trusts me or not.

434
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,710
His Majesty orders you.

435
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,980
King of Joseon,

436
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,579
come out of the fortress now.

437
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,779
If you do not want to,

438
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,190
let us settle this with a match!
Heaven will render the verdict!

439
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,429
The enemy is suddenly
pressuring us with anger...

440
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,630
and threatening us by firing culverins.

441
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,409
Surely something urgent...

442
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,809
must have happened to the enemy.

443
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,150
Perhaps royal forces arrived
and attacked them from behind.

444
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,510
If that is not it,

445
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,880
perhaps something urgent must have
come up in their country.

446
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,829
The enemy is suddenly pressuring
for a decisive battle or completion...

447
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,989
of the diplomatic mission,
whether our King comes out or not.

448
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,659
Could it be due to
the royal forces attacking?

449
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,769
Or is there a problem in their homeland?

450
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,530
Please inform us quickly.

451
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,769
They must be in a hurry to contact us.

452
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,780
If they were attacked by the royal forces,

453
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,210
there should have been more casualties.

454
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,380
It is not that.

455
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,719
Is what you just said true?

456
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,559
Is what you said true?

457
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,030
You are putting His Majesty in danger.

458
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,869
You still wish to live?

459
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,920
I am here to sing for His Majesty.

460
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:52,190
You need not come here anymore.

461
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,070
What did he say his title was?

462
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,469
The red sash.

463
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,440
Maybe he is a plague inspector.

464
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,309
"Plague inspector?"

465
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,380
Those in charge of discovering
infectious diseases and reporting them.

466
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:49,679
What are you doing here?

467
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,050
I said you need not sing
for His Majesty anymore.

468
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,989
My sand.

469
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,829
I want it back.

470
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:10,670
It protects me and keeps me safe.

471
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,440
Especially...

472
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,340
at dangerous moments such as now.

473
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,639
You see, people do know what is going on!

474
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,750
I have not seen Dodo and Yoto
in the past few days.

475
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,119
So thinking...

476
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,550
that I might soon die here...

477
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,860
So give it back!

478
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,500
I did not know what to do...

479
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,829
as everyone else was avoiding it
knowing it would cost them their lives.

480
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,039
So this is great.

481
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,909
You are a lucky man, so you will survive.

482
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,679
You are...

483
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:55,340
to help the other porters.

484
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,309
It is smallpox.

485
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,010
(Mama: Smallpox)

486
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,960
Smallpox is spreading among them.

487
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,730
Go and let His Highness
the Crown Prince know at once.

488
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:49,730
Come with me.

489
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,300
You have never had smallpox.

490
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,400
I cannot leave now.

491
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,599
Khan is nowhere to be seen.

492
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,210
Does Khan have smallpox?

493
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,079
Or is he simply hiding now?
I must find out.

494
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,110
So hurry up and go.

495
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,019
Smallpox?

496
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:11,489
They rushed to reconcile...

497
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,320
for smallpox is spreading
in Qing's base camp.

498
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,429
A plague inspector was held accountable,
and thus executed.

499
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,230
Khan and the beiles
including Yoto and Dodo...

500
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,769
are nowhere to be seen.
They have been gone for a few days now.

501
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,400
I do not know if Khan is hiding
for he has never had smallpox,

502
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,539
or if he has fallen victim to the disease.

503
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,869
But if Khan is alive,

504
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,650
he will no longer wait
for you to surrender.

505
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,550
He will do whatever it takes...

506
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,380
to pressure His Majesty at the fortress.

507
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,519
Act in haste,

508
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,219
or a bloodbath awaits.

509
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,929
Could they be...

510
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,670
The Khan...

511
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,909
said he would let you keep
your kingdom intact if you surrendered.

512
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,210
Your Majesty.

513
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:09,110
I understand that they are liars,

514
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,250
but I beseech you...

515
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,320
to put your trust in them just this once.

516
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
No.

517
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:18,619
Even though we already promised
to serve the Khan as our emperor,

518
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,260
they still want to drag me out
of the fortress.

519
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,360
I am certain that they are plotting
a scheme such as the Jingkang Incident.

520
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,769
You know what happened.

521
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,570
While Emperor Huizong
was being dragged to Jin,

522
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,570
one of Jin's warriors
threw wine and meat on the ground...

523
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,039
and forced him to eat it.

524
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,940
There is more.

525
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,809
They even made Empress Zhu
pour wine for them.

526
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,449
I would rather die
than suffer such humiliation...

527
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,519
However,

528
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,289
a bloodbath may be unavoidable
if we do not rush to reconcile.

529
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,690
A bloodbath?

530
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,860
In the past, they said...

531
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,829
they would invade Ganghwa Island.
Perhaps, they were not bluffing.

532
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,500
They may fight well on land,

533
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,070
but not on water.

534
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,070
- Ganghwa Island is safe.
- Your Majesty. However,

535
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,739
Khan has come all the way here.

536
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:12,739
If the King of Joseon
does not leave the fortress...

537
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,679
Do you want me to leave the fortress?

538
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,590
No, I was simply...

539
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,960
I simply wish to help you protect
your kingdom.

540
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,489
They said they would let you
keep your kingdom...

541
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,059
if you left the fortress.

542
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,429
How could you, of all people,
say such a thing?

543
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,730
Your Majesty! Please punish me.

544
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:46,280
So...

545
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,780
they will not let their king
leave the fortress.

546
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,880
Correct.

547
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,320
I bet the people of Joseon thought...

548
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:57,150
I was busy dealing with Ming...

549
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,619
and that I did not even care about Joseon.

550
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,059
They were wrong.

551
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:06,559
I put everything on the line
to come to Joseon.

552
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,469
Joseon has been loyal to Ming.

553
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,070
I must make Joseon surrender...

554
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,940
to become the true emperor
sent from the skies.

555
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,139
Smallpox is going around,

556
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,179
but I will not give up.

557
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,349
I will do whatever it takes...

558
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:30,849
to achieve victory in Joseon.

559
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,619
Send a ship to Ganghwa Island.

560
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,130
I do not care what we need to sacrifice.

561
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,300
Conquer Ganghwa Island.

562
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:41,929
It is mine!

563
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,300
It is my cauldron lid!

564
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,199
What? Do you not see
that it is chipped here?

565
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,300
Goodness. I never thought
I would see someone steal a cauldron lid.

566
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,170
Are you done talking?

567
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,710
Yes, I am done. What will you do?

568
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,280
- That darned cauldron lid.
- I told you. It is mine!

569
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,980
- It is mine!
- Everyone carrying and dragging one...

570
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,050
No, it is mine!

571
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,480
You witch! It is mine!

572
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:02,019
Some people are coming out
of the ship down there.

573
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:03,719
But they are all bald.

574
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,789
If I am a thief, then what are you?

575
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,889
- The owner of the cauldron lid!
- Hear me out!

576
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,489
Are you done talking?

577
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:11,690
Go over there and play.

578
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,500
Go over there and play!

579
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,460
Goodness. Go and play, will you?

580
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,440
Were they really bald? How?

581
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,710
Oh, like him?

582
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,139
Or how?

583
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,110
Shiny and bald...

584
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,550
with a little bit of hair here.

585
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,670
Go!

586
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,980
Intruders.

587
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,610
The intruders are here.

588
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,070
Jong Jong, wake up. We must leave.

589
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,730
Wake up! Hurry! We must go!

590
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,570
Intruders! They are here.

591
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:28,869
We must leave now. Get up!

592
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,179
What is going on?

593
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:34,440
You must all leave!

594
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,949
The intruders will be here any minute now!

595
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,510
Nonsense.

596
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,119
What does a girl even know?

597
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:42,719
If you do not wish to heed
a girl's advice, just die here!

598
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:44,019
We just go. Hurry!

599
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,690
- Run!
- The intruders are here!

600
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,230
- Gosh.
- Quick!

601
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,829
They are people from Joseon!

602
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,300
Catch them!

603
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,800
They are running away.

604
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,170
Get them!

605
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:18,719
- Run!
- Quick!

606
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,889
- This way!
- We must run!

607
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:26,860
This way.

608
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,059
Get them!

609
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,469
Come on.

610
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,300
- Oh, no!
- Hurry!

611
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,829
- Hurry!
- Go!

612
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:05,530
- Oh, no!
- Run away!

613
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,289
(Year of Jeongchuk, 43 days
since the outbreak of the Qing invasion)

614
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,630
(The capture of Ganghwa Island)

615
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,400
Hundreds of women fell off
of a cliff to keep their chastity.

616
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,030
On top of the Ganghwa waters...

617
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:40,099
are the headscarves of women.

618
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,369
Kim Sang Yong,
the brother of Minister Kim,

619
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,510
jumped into a burning pile of gunpowder...

620
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,110
along with his grandson.

621
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:49,780
The loyal guard, Min Sung,

622
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,449
also killed himself after killing
his three sons and daughters-in-law.

623
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,090
Three generations of women
have committed suicide,

624
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,789
including Premier Kim's wife
and daughter-in-law.

625
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,090
What about my son?

626
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,989
Is he okay?

627
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:15,670
Ganghwa Island has been captured,

628
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,070
so His Majesty and the Crown Prince
in the Namhan Fortress...

629
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,179
will not be safe.

630
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,250
Then he will be the only one left.

631
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,480
Please.

632
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:35,289
Please protect...

633
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,360
my son.

634
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,670
Go.

635
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,010
This instant.

636
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,360
Madam Bang Doo.

637
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:16,199
Leave me here.

638
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,769
My lady,

639
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,869
I cannot walk anymore.

640
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,800
So just leave me,

641
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,070
and take my baby with you.

642
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,809
Get up.

643
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,110
If you spew such nonsense again,

644
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,679
I will give you a proper beating
even though you just gave birth.

645
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,650
Keep moving.

646
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,929
Please!

647
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,860
Please let us.

648
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,929
- We need to ride it.
- Please let us get on.

649
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,940
- Save us.
- We need to get on the boat.

650
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,039
- I am going!
- Darn it.

651
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,809
- Please!
- Please let us.

652
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,920
This boat is not for you!

653
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:09,449
Step back!

654
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,019
This boat is not for you!

655
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,119
Let us get on that boat too.

656
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,659
How?

657
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:20,059
They are pushing away everyone
who is trying to get on it.

658
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:22,960
- Please!
- My lady.

659
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,829
Look.

660
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,150
No,

661
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:18,750
we can ride the boat.

662
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,920
Head to the boat first.

663
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,920
What? Gil Chae.

664
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:25,090
Gil Chae.

665
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,260
Your Highness.

666
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,400
Give me the baby.

667
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:39,909
I saw a boat.
You were trying to get on it, right?

668
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,909
I will take him to the boat.

669
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,150
Please take good care of him.

670
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,920
Go. Hurry!

671
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,309
I told you to step back.

672
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,780
This boat is not for you!

673
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,579
You are waiting for His Highness, right?

674
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,449
My friend is bringing him here.

675
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:40,940
Please.

676
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,369
Please.

677
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,039
Protect His Highness!

678
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:08,630
Give him to me.

679
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,739
Please let us ride the boat too.

680
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,710
No, but you are allowed.

681
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:18,039
If you do not take all of us,

682
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,179
he will not get on the boat either.

683
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,210
Gil Chae.

684
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,449
At least you should get on the boat.

685
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,079
My lady.

686
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:32,090
Who will feed His Highness?

687
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,289
We have a mother who has just given birth.

688
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,659
She has milk.

689
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:39,760
Yes, I can breastfeed him.

690
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,400
- Let them board.
- Yes, sir.

691
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,269
Get on the boat.

692
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,769
Step back!

693
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:56,610
Jong Jong, get on the boat.

694
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,780
You go first.

695
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,320
Move!

696
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:08,119
Move!

697
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,630
Please let my child get on the boat.

698
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:12,760
My child, please. Please help.

699
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,300
Just my child.

700
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,400
- Just my child, please.
- My lady!

701
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,400
Please, just my child.

702
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,070
My child.

703
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,510
Let go!

704
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,239
Move away from Jong Jong!

705
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,840
There is no room for you all!

706
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,480
Goodness.

707
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,619
Please, my child. No!

708
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,860
Something must have...

709
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,000
happened to my hands.

710
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,769
Do not think about anything.

711
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,769
Thanks to you,
Jong Jong was able to get on the boat.

712
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:13,480
You have been the one who saved us.

713
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,789
It has always been you.

714
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,710
The number of patients
has increased a lot.

715
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,769
His Majesty is not...

716
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:42,110
affected by this, I assume?

717
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,980
His Majesty is a gift from the heavens.

718
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,309
He will never fall ill
with such a disease.

719
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,349
I know.

720
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,780
I am just worried
that the number of patients is...

721
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,090
increasing so much.

722
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,349
I am perfectly fine.
Not the plague, I promise!

723
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,960
I am perfectly fine!

724
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,960
You should never go out to sea.

725
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,360
It is just a cough.
Not the plague, I promise!

726
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:01,300
Go out to sea?

727
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,099
Khan has sent ships to Ganghwa Island.

728
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,699
I am perfectly fine.

729
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,139
Not the plague, I promise!

730
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:18,510
Where did you get this?

731
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,280
Who are you?

732
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,059
Where did you get this?

733
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,510
Hey.

734
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,619
Hey.

735
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:57,519
Darn it.

736
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,460
You cannot stay here.

737
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,130
No matter how skilled and smart you are,

738
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,989
the plague does not discriminate. So...

739
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:14,800
I...

740
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,309
told her to go.

741
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,050
I told her Ganghwa Island was
the safest place in Joseon.

742
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,119
I told her...

743
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,019
to go.

744
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,670
What are you doing?

745
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,039
Where did you get this knife?

746
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,340
It is my trophy.

747
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:59,210
I took it from the Joseon girl I killed.

748
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,579
You killed her?

749
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:05,619
You really did?

750
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:09,019
Well, I did not see her die.

751
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,130
But I am sure she died.

752
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:14,329
How can a woman avoid death?

753
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,139
Come forward if you are used to
going out to the sea.

754
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:25,769
Then His Majesty will
bestow you a big reward.

755
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,980
If you have gone on a boat, come forward.

756
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,050
Who wants to volunteer?

757
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,280
Who likes going out to the sea?

758
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,849
I would not want to do it
if they would give me a fortune.

759
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,190
I would not want it either.

760
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:40,760
They say you catch the plague
if you cross the sea.

761
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,090
I will go.

762
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:45,630
I want to earn merits...

763
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:48,329
and become a proud military officer.

764
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:49,860
What are you doing?

765
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,230
Can I not have some fun too...

766
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,000
if I become an officer?

767
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:14,789
(The island near Ganghwa)

768
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,130
His Highness seems to be
feeling much better now.

769
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:56,300
Can I breastfeed my baby now?

770
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,699
My baby starved all day long.

771
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,050
The intruders must have
sent a search party.

772
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:15,679
We will be in danger if we stay together.
Let us split into two groups.

773
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,519
Do not worry too much.

774
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,320
You are all ladies,
so I will send you to a safer route.

775
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:26,329
Take that path,

776
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:28,860
and we will meet again at the quay.

777
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,599
You will see a boat waiting for us there.

778
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,300
What are you waiting for?
You should leave.

779
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,340
You will miss the boat if you are late.

780
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:38,539
Come on.

781
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,909
Go.

782
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,579
Do not worry.

783
01:00:57,329 --> 01:00:59,489
Will the intruders not take that path?

784
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,929
They will buy us time.

785
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:05,929
Let us go.

786
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,179
If she is the wife
of Joseon's Crown Prince,

787
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,480
we should not mess with her, right?

788
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,750
But we can play with her maids.

789
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:24,989
Even her maids have fair skin.

790
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:25,989
Very fair.

791
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:34,400
I went through so much, and yet I have not
yet gotten the taste of Joseon women.

792
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:37,000
I heard the Mongolians had
their share of fun early on.

793
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:40,030
This is an island,
so cut me some slack, sir.

794
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:13,969
What is this sound?

795
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,139
Boss.

796
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,380
Let me go and check.

797
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:44,530
What is it?

798
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:46,489
It is a cat.

799
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,199
A cat always...

800
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,230
cries like a human baby.

801
01:03:57,369 --> 01:03:58,840
But this is not a cat.

802
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,449
You scumbag!

803
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,219
They are fighting.

804
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,920
Let us go. We must go now.

805
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,619
Go. Hurry.

806
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,320
Quick, move it.

807
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,329
What happened?

808
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,610
Go after them!

809
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:43,380
Get them!

810
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,269
From now on,

811
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,909
no one can cross this point.

812
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,170
Gil Chae, hurry!

813
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,699
I swear by the moonlight.

814
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,769
This time, wherever you are,

815
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,940
I will make sure...

816
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,570
I find you.

817
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,610
Go. I will follow you.

818
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,280
What do you mean?

819
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,480
My lady!

820
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:28,849
Gil Chae!

821
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:45,489
(My Dearest)

822
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,279
You saved us!

823
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,020
Have you fallen for me?

824
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,350
No! Says who?

825
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:12,590
You have not changed one bit.

826
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,460
Our King will leave the fortress.

827
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,090
We wish to make peace too.

828
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,529
The war is over.

829
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,189
I plan to propose to Lady Eun Ae soon.

830
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,699
My lady, shall we go to Qing together?

831
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:24,930
I have always been curious.

832
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,170
Why... What are you doing?

833
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:28,899
Did you ever have
romantic feelings for me?

834
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,210
Do you feel this? Why is it...

835
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,140
that my heart flutters like this
when I see you?
