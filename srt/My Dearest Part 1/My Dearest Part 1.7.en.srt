1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,089
From now on,

4
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,660
no one can cross this point.

5
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,810
I swear by the moonlight.

6
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,979
This time, wherever you are,

7
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,109
I will make sure...

8
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,789
I find you.

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,909
(My Dearest)

10
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,750
You saved us!

11
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,349
My lady.

12
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,259
I thought you abandoned us,
and I resented you.

13
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,330
That is...

14
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,030
I am sorry I misunderstood you.

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,530
I am very grateful.

16
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,639
Do not waste time here. You must go.

17
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
- Okay.
- Come on.

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,870
My lady.

19
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,330
Coming.

20
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,240
I told you.

21
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,110
That I...

22
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,449
will definitely...

23
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,990
find you.

24
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,149
(Three days ago)

25
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,819
(Episode 7)

26
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,250
This is the last letter...

27
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,889
from Jang Hyun.

28
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,399
Your Highness.

29
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
Please end the war as soon as you can.

30
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,430
Insolent fool!

31
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,939
How dare you tell His Highness what to do?

32
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,069
But...

33
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,639
Jang Hyun will leave
for the island tomorrow.

34
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,240
If the war drags on,
we cannot guarantee...

35
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,079
when or whether he will even return.

36
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,250
Your Highness.

37
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:17,420
I shall meet him in person.

38
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,490
Hurry up!

39
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,189
Move it!

40
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,769
Sir.

41
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,699
My stomach hurts.

42
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,509
- Go.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,939
Hurry up!

44
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,889
Have you gone mad?

45
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,120
Why did you come here?

46
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,920
So it was you who sent the letter.

47
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,149
I cannot believe this is happening.

48
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,430
One of the higher-ups
is risking his life to come here.

49
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,600
I have already...

50
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,430
reported everything I know.
Was it not enough?

51
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,040
I know you told us in advance
that Ganghwa Island might be captured.

52
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,839
However, the court was worried that...

53
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,709
the Jingkang Incident might repeat
so peace talks did not happen in time.

54
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,379
Now that Ganghwa Island has been captured,

55
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,949
if His Majesty also leaves the fortress,

56
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,250
how can we avoid facing
what happened at Jingkang?

57
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,189
Is there any way to save our King?

58
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,470
I truly admire you.

59
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,639
Is the king's life that important
in this situation?

60
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,250
Young soldiers are freezing to death,

61
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,949
intelligent scholars
are getting their scalps skinned,

62
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,420
and dozens of women
in Ganghwa Island have killed themselves.

63
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,189
You might as well have asked me
how to save you.

64
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,290
Then,

65
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,500
I shall do my best to help you.

66
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,329
You may be acting like
a petty and spiteful fool,

67
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,339
but you risked your life
to come here for the people, did you not?

68
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,839
However,

69
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,870
the people can only live
if the King is saved.

70
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,509
If the war ends
with His Majesty dying at their hands,

71
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,379
we subjects shall become sinners
for failing to save him.

72
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,250
The people...

73
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,290
will become subjects
of a kingdom without a king.

74
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,990
Do you know the misery
of being an orphaned child?

75
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,899
Do you know the pain
of the people without their king?

76
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,870
How can you not know?

77
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,870
Are you simply pretending not to know?

78
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,579
Fine.

79
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,179
I shall play along with this once.

80
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,049
If you truly want to save the King,

81
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,120
please take advantage of the smallpox.

82
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,580
Will we be able
to preserve our King and government?

83
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,980
Please give me a clear answer.

84
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,149
He asks for a clear answer
if the king and government...

85
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:41,519
will be preserved.

86
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,389
That all depends on His Majesty.

87
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,559
It all depends on His Majesty.

88
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,360
Then, please let me meet His Majesty.

89
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,159
He wants...

90
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,659
to meet His Majesty.

91
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,299
You can talk to me.

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,100
In that case, let me meet Dodo.

93
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,639
I told you to talk to me.

94
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,610
Is it not possible
because they have never had smallpox?

95
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,669
(Saengshin: one who has
never contracted smallpox)

96
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,909
I know that there is a smallpox epidemic.

97
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
I also know...

98
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:11,580
that His Majesty and those like him
have gone into hiding.

99
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,620
He knows that there is
a smallpox epidemic.

100
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,190
Who spread such ridiculous rumors?

101
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,230
Ganghwa Island has been captured.

102
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,159
Your king cannot resist any longer!

103
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,330
Are you not scared
that news of the epidemic will spread?

104
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,039
Take advantage of the smallpox?

105
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,809
Khan brought offerings for rituals.

106
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,139
(Ritual offerings: goods used for rituals)

107
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,840
Khan will make Joseon surrender...

108
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,649
to prove that he has Heaven's will.
That is why he is here.

109
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,179
However, smallpox has spread.

110
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,289
Do you know what that means?

111
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,990
Usually, a smallpox outbreak...

112
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,929
means that the Heavens have been angered.

113
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,659
Since you are much more educated than me,

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,870
you should...

115
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,470
know what to do by now.

116
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,000
His Majesty...

117
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,470
highly treasures the royal seal he won...

118
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,309
when he made Mongolia surrender in Chahar.

119
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,210
Legend has it that...

120
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,379
the seal seeks
for the one who will rule the earth.

121
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,149
Since the seal ended up
in His Majesty's hands,

122
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,850
does that not mean...

123
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,090
that he became the Emperor
due to Heaven's will?

124
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,820
However,

125
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,960
if word gets out that smallpox spread
when he came to Joseon,

126
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,429
who will believe that His Majesty
received Heaven's will?

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,299
Is smallpox not...

128
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,070
the fury of the Heavens?

129
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,669
Do you not know...

130
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,210
that we can wipe out all of you?

131
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,740
Before you wipe us out,

132
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,110
do you not know
that this is a threat to Khan?

133
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,019
General. Ease your fury.

134
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,750
We also wish for amity.

135
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,320
But...

136
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,720
we have a condition.

137
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,330
They will not concede to...

138
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,230
the King staying in the fortress.

139
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,129
This is something you will have to accept.

140
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,700
If you disagree to that, they will...

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,970
storm into the fortress with culverins.

142
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,639
However,

143
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,580
if you promise them that you will
stay mum about the outbreak,

144
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,179
even if the King leaves the fortress,

145
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,419
they will not be able to repeat
what happened at Jingkang.

146
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,159
What they want the most...

147
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,100
is for the king of Joseon...

148
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,200
to bow down to them voluntarily.

149
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,639
Our King will leave the fortress.

150
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,440
However, if something like
the Jingkang Incident happens,

151
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,110
even if my body is torn to shreds,

152
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,350
I will let the whole world know about
the outbreak of smallpox...

153
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:01,019
and prove that
the Heavens are against you.

154
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,029
They know...

155
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,200
that smallpox has spread...

156
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,539
and why Your Majesty is in hiding.

157
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,970
Everything is exposed.

158
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,080
Therefore,

159
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,580
in return for keeping mum
about the outbreak,

160
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,879
they will only send us three officials
who opposed amity...

161
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,549
and we are not
to keep any captives after that.

162
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:35,850
Furthermore,

163
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,389
they have asked
that the Jingkang Incident...

164
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,559
should not repeat itself.

165
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,700
Does Joseon have a skilled arbiter
on their side?

166
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,269
The disease will not go away.

167
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,509
If we do not withdraw our troops
anytime soon, you may...

168
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,340
I am a son of the skies!

169
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,240
I will not get smallpox.

170
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,549
I will wipe them out!

171
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,860
I shall chew on them...

172
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,860
to their bone marrow.

173
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,039
Are they still sitting out there
in the snow,

174
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,409
in silence?

175
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,820
They are opposed to
me leaving the fortress with their lives.

176
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,350
Should I be thankful for their loyalty?

177
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,960
Or should I be resentful...

178
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,190
for their fidelity to die with me?

179
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,230
Your Majesty.

180
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,370
I have no way of knowing
whether my son is alive or not.

181
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,269
You are our only hope now.

182
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
So please,

183
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,610
leave the fortress.

184
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,379
Preserve the state.

185
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,879
Do you believe Khan will let me live...

186
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,950
after dragging me out of the fortress?

187
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,559
Your Majesty,

188
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,129
Khan is not just trying to drag you away.

189
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,240
He is pushing your departure
in order to show the whole world...

190
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,340
that you have become his servant.

191
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,940
That is right.

192
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,009
I should leave the fortress.

193
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,419
However, even if they are to let me live,

194
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,049
a king who lowers his head to intruders...

195
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,419
is as good as dead.

196
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,529
I deposed Gwanghae
for communicating in private...

197
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,200
with the intruders.

198
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,669
But if I bow down to them now,

199
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,970
who will want to serve me?

200
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,039
Who will consider me their king?

201
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,309
Even if the world misunderstands you,

202
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,820
I know.

203
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,659
You are enduring humiliation
for your country.

204
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,230
Only...

205
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,299
those who are brave are capable
of withstanding humiliation...

206
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,669
to save lives.

207
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,669
Yes.

208
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,409
Only you...

209
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,080
will be able to know how I feel.

210
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,019
Even if the whole world
turns their backs on me,

211
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,620
you,

212
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,330
my son...

213
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,700
Father.

214
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,910
Your Majesty, do not trust them.

215
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,779
If you leave,

216
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,920
they will repeat the Jingkang Incident.

217
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,180
- Your Majesty!
- At first, the intruders said...

218
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,289
they would make peace
if we sent the Crown Prince.

219
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,259
But even after promising
to send the Crown Prince,

220
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,220
they made you lower yourself,

221
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,630
and after that,
they made you leave the fortress.

222
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,730
Now, they are trying to drag you away,

223
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,970
Your Majesty!

224
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,500
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

225
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,140
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

226
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,509
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

227
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:53,440
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

228
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,710
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

229
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,220
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

230
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,319
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

231
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,019
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

232
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,289
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

233
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,730
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

234
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,029
- Please do not leave the fortress,
- Please do not leave the fortress,

235
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,500
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

236
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,789
Where are you going?

237
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,190
The turmoil is over.

238
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,190
What do you mean by that?

239
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,759
Does that mean
His Majesty has been dragged away?

240
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,829
Did he lose his life?

241
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,099
No.

242
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,599
His Majesty left the fortress,

243
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,039
but they let him live.

244
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,539
His Majesty bowed down
to the intruders nine times.

245
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,880
How embarrassing.

246
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,009
Darn you. Thanks to that,
the war is now over.

247
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,210
Then did you want to keep running away
for the rest of your life?

248
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,819
That is not what I meant.

249
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,720
How ignorant.

250
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,619
The war is over.

251
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,319
My lady.

252
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:26,799
Let us go.

253
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,710
Let us go home.

254
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,380
What is this?

255
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,960
Darling.

256
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,130
Darling!

257
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,970
Darling! My darling.

258
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,539
Honey.

259
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,809
You went through so much.

260
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,150
Our baby.

261
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,509
Goodness. Oh, my.

262
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,980
Goodness.

263
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,990
Gil Chae.

264
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Gil Chae.

265
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,799
You are alive.

266
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,069
What took you so long?

267
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:07,240
I thought you were never coming back.
I thought you were dead.

268
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,670
I thought you were dead.

269
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,579
It is okay.

270
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,339
It is okay.

271
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,690
Father.

272
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,319
- Gil Chae.
- Hey.

273
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,230
Father.

274
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Father.

275
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,470
Father, it is me, Gil Chae.

276
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,569
Gil Chae?

277
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,380
You know my daughter?

278
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,829
As soon as we crossed the river,

279
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
we ran into the intruders.

280
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,140
Eun Ae, your father...

281
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,079
said he would lure them
and give them the slip.

282
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,549
Thanks to him, we survived.

283
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,720
But your father was caught.

284
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,430
After catching him,

285
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,200
the intruders got mad,
saying he was just a weak, old man...

286
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,339
and killed him on the spot.

287
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,549
We saw everything while hiding.

288
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,089
Father could not get involved
because of us.

289
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,059
And then he ended up...

290
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,539
- Eun Ae.
- My lady.

291
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,069
- My lady.
- I am sorry.

292
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,910
- My lady.
- I am so sorry, Eun Ae.

293
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,049
My lady.

294
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,789
My lady.

295
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,069
I acknowledge those who made
a big contribution during the chaos.

296
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,910
In the midst of war, they pierced through
enemy lines and reached the fortress...

297
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,109
to deliver the message to His Majesty.

298
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,349
Scholar Nam Yeon Jun.

299
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,779
Scholar Choi Dae O.

300
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:51,130
The brave envoys who entered the fortress,

301
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,500
protecting and guiding His Majesty.

302
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,630
Seo Heun Nam.

303
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:00,099
Yoon Yeo Yi. Sun Se Kyu.

304
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:06,279
The heroic figures who cut down the enemy
and raised the nation's stature.

305
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,609
An Bok Cho.

306
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,779
Commander Gu Won Moo.

307
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,359
In particular, Gu Won Moo...

308
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,660
single-handedly annihilated
a dozen enemy soldiers...

309
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,329
and saved the Crown Prince's first son.

310
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,839
Form groups of four, disperse,

311
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,410
and start to search the land.

312
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,750
Let us get moving.

313
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,109
- Okay.
- Okay.

314
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,420
If I catch this guy, I will just...

315
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,019
I...

316
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,960
Look.

317
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,029
Hey.

318
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,539
Jang Hyun!

319
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,539
Goodness.

320
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,849
My goodness, Jang Hyun.

321
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,049
Why are you crying? Did someone die?

322
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,170
The tenant farmers who plowed the land.

323
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,109
It is uncertain whether
they are dead or taken as captives.

324
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,779
There is no hope of their return.

325
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,450
The harvested grains were
all taken away by the intruders,

326
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,980
leaving nothing for seeding.

327
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,279
Those jerks will receive
divine punishment.

328
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,220
And yet you have returned.

329
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,690
I had to come back.

330
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,089
By the way, everything we earned
through our efforts...

331
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,730
was taken away by the intruders.

332
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,029
And I am very sorry about that.

333
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,470
Even if I have to die,
I will die by my lady's side.

334
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,740
For the farmers to return,

335
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,900
prepare the lands for farming,
and produce crops,

336
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,940
it would take a couple of years
at the minimum.

337
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,710
What should do?

338
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,640
Go. You intruders.

339
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,250
- Go. Go away!
- Dad.

340
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,450
- Go away!
- Dad.

341
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,750
I came all the way from Hanyang
to deliver a letter.

342
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,490
Where is Master Kyung's residence?

343
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,700
Master.

344
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you safe amid this turmoil?

345
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,240
Dae O and I entered
the fortress unharmed...

346
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,539
and were able to serve His Majesty.

347
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,339
His Majesty has appointed me...

348
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,779
as a Senior Sixth Rank officer
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

349
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:54,980
(Suchan: Senior sixth rank
officer of Hongmoongwan)

350
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,509
Due to the turmoil,
the Court is extremely busy,

351
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,250
making it impossible
for us to return to Neunggun-ri.

352
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,619
His Majesty has granted a residence,

353
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:08,319
so if it is not suitable for Nunggun-ri
to stay in during this turmoil,

354
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,730
I wish you and Lady Eun Ae...

355
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,059
would join me in Hanyang.

356
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,470
Young Master Yeon Jun is safe.

357
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,980
That is great news, Eun Ae.

358
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,480
Bless him.

359
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,420
My goodness.

360
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,829
Father.

361
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,859
Come with us.

362
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,369
I guess we will be parting ways now.

363
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,069
Forever.

364
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,279
Parting ways?

365
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,380
I will not go anywhere without you.

366
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,750
Father is not with us anymore.
And you will leave us too?

367
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,990
Lady Gil Chae plotted this...

368
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,420
so she could go to Hanyang with us,
did she not?

369
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:15,859
What are you talking about?

370
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,930
Lady Eun Ae begged her to come with her.

371
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,700
Goodness.

372
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,029
Do you not want us to come along?

373
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,930
That is not what I said.

374
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,740
It is just that I am so happy.

375
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,740
After all we have been together.

376
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,470
Look at you.

377
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,380
You treated me far better
than that lame husband of mine.

378
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,210
You and...

379
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,549
the ladies all did.

380
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,720
But still,

381
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,089
if your lady tries to take
Young Master Yeon Jun...

382
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:47,220
- away once again...
- Come on!

383
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
Look.

384
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,839
It is so pretty.

385
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,009
Look at these flowers.

386
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,740
Look.

387
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,559
You look even stronger now.

388
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,299
Should I write it now...

389
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,569
A wife who turned to stone?

390
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,339
You are haunted by her.

391
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,359
All right.

392
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,660
It feels so good.

393
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,500
My lady!

394
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,440
Who is going to fix this now?

395
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,779
Gil Chae.

396
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,660
Thank you for coming with me.

397
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,200
As long as I am with you,

398
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,930
I can go anywhere.

399
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,150
Let us go.

400
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,220
Where are we going?

401
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,019
We must go to Neunggun-ri.

402
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:00,559
We are headed to Neunggun-ri, right?

403
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,789
Yes, we are headed
to Neunggun-ri. Do not worry, Father.

404
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,240
I already did it.

405
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,970
Goodness.

406
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,980
It is a mess.

407
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,519
Buy this.

408
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,089
Even if it is in the middle of a war,
Hanyang is different.

409
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,230
Look how bright the ladies' skins are.

410
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,430
Is the water here different?

411
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,269
Still, I do not see any lady...

412
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:44,230
who is prettier than me.

413
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,839
People never change.

414
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,509
Lady Gil Chae, look.

415
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,170
It is all right.

416
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,450
Do not give up.

417
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,890
You must never give up.

418
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Please.

419
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,630
Father!

420
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:52,269
Father!

421
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,099
Father!

422
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,809
Father, please!

423
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:00,609
Father, I beg you.

424
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,549
Father!

425
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:09,519
Father!

426
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,019
I beg you, please!

427
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,530
Father, please!

428
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,989
Father!

429
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,960
Father, please!

430
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,969
Watch out.

431
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,130
Father!

432
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,699
Come over here.

433
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,610
Hurry up. Come here already.

434
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,750
Where are you going?

435
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,460
Are you leaving me behind again?

436
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,039
Have I told you?

437
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,179
When you smile,

438
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,119
I can hear the marvels of Peru blossom.

439
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,159
Did I ever tell you that?

440
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:41,909
Jang Hyun!

441
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,150
Where on earth is he?

442
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,489
Tell me about it.

443
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,119
Right?

444
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,800
Do you even know who I am talking about?

445
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,670
Were you not referring
to Young Master Jang Hyun?

446
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,139
You are a funny one.

447
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,869
Why should I care about
where Young Master Jang Hyun is?

448
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,380
Forget it then.

449
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,940
That is not the point.

450
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,880
He has lovers all over the country,
is a misogamist,

451
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,949
and talks about mulling or something.
Why should I care about him?

452
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:23,449
Even if I am curious,
how is it my business where he is?

453
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:24,989
What?

454
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,989
He will find me wherever I am?

455
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,320
Goodness.

456
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,159
Just look at him blabbering on.

457
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,460
Consider yourself lucky.

458
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,130
You will be hearing the voice
of the best singer in Joseon.

459
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,239
You can only hear
a voice like his in Hanyang.

460
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,219
You are alive.

461
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:36,960
I knew you would be.

462
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,139
It is called Ushimjung
as it stands for happiness and sorrow?

463
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,639
What a strange name.

464
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,909
There is also an Ushimjung
near the Japanese office, no?

465
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,039
(Waegwan: where Japanese diplomacy
and trading occurs)

466
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,210
Why did you come?

467
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,619
His Highness went to Simyang as a hostage.

468
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,389
I do not know if I can...

469
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,760
serve His Highness well
in such a foreign and barren place.

470
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:12,960
On that note,

471
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,900
can you come with us to Simyang?

472
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:19,170
If you come along, I will be assured
as if I had a thousand troops.

473
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,639
I am not interested.

474
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,079
Enjoy your stay here.

475
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,849
His Highness will offer you
a great reward.

476
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,250
- My lord!
- You are here!

477
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,760
- Why did you take so long?
- Get the food ready.

478
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,929
Hello.

479
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,190
Come on.

480
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,030
Look at them having fun at this time.

481
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,130
The war barely ended.

482
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,269
Goodness.

483
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:54,239
That way.

484
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,739
Let us go.

485
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,369
What are you doing?

486
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,409
This is Young Master Yeon Jun's house.

487
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,239
Oh, all right.

488
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,179
Jong Jong and Lady Gil Chae
definitely live here too.

489
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,179
- Sure.
- Yes.

490
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,789
Why are you not going in?

491
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:13,659
I am going now.

492
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,360
- Let us go in.
- Yes.

493
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,730
No, forget it. Let us leave.

494
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,530
Gu Jam!

495
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,940
Young Master Jang Hyun?

496
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,480
How have you been?

497
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,980
After you disappeared in the mountains,

498
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,750
I was very worried.

499
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,550
Well,

500
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:45,050
I have been here and there,
doing decently.

501
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,190
I must say, where did Gil Chae go?
She is late.

502
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,659
Jong Jong, is Gil Chae still not back yet?

503
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Wait, Lady Eun Ae.

504
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:58,329
I did not come to see Lady Gil Chae.

505
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,800
She often goes out these days...

506
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,110
and only returns after sunset.

507
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,110
Seems like she wanted to explore Hanyang.

508
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,150
She went to explore Hanyang?

509
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,849
By any chance,

510
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,920
do you know...

511
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,219
where she often stops by?

512
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,449
You must have had a hard time.

513
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:20,989
What?

514
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,190
I mean,

515
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,630
you must have had it worse than me.

516
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,739
Well, we enjoyed our stay
at Mount Gwanggyo.

517
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,570
After that...

518
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,639
You know, Lady Gil Chae insisted...

519
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,550
that we had to go to Ganghwa Island.

520
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,920
Goodness, that stubborn girl.

521
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,349
She would not tell us why...

522
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,389
we had to go there.

523
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,320
She just stubbornly insisted...

524
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,920
that we had to get to Ganghwa Island
no matter what.

525
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,929
We had such a terrible time
at Ganghwa Island.

526
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,230
I have to get going.

527
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,039
Gu Jam, let us go.

528
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,599
Wait...

529
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,539
Darn it.

530
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,110
Since we are already here,
why not stay longer?

531
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,409
Why did you get up?

532
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,849
Did you commit a crime?

533
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,750
You are alive.

534
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,599
My, who do we have here?

535
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,670
Your face is perfectly glowing.

536
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,170
Why should I look otherwise?

537
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:18,369
Do you know how much I suffered?

538
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,539
You told me to go to Ganghwa Island.

539
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,550
You said it would be safe!

540
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:27,650
Well, I see you are perfectly fine.

541
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,690
And you are as energetic as ever.

542
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,920
I almost died, you know!

543
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:42,969
Did you wait for me?

544
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,099
Wait for you? Who says so?

545
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,110
Well,

546
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,179
we were totally fine without you.

547
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,250
An amazing military officer saved us.

548
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,090
I see.

549
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,889
- Is that so?
- Yes.

550
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,760
We were about to be caught
by the intruders,

551
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:13,199
but he fought against 17 of them
on his own to save us.

552
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,559
You were extremely lucky, were you not?

553
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,170
But...

554
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,440
that military officer
said something strange.

555
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,510
What did he say?

556
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,280
He said it was not him
who did away with all those intruders.

557
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,420
So I wanted to ask,

558
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,519
by any chance, did we...

559
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,690
ever meet on the island?

560
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,070
"Island?"

561
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,869
What island?

562
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,639
Right?

563
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,280
Of course. It would be impossible
to become one of them...

564
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,150
in that short amount of time,
no matter how odd you may be.

565
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,190
I heard you disappeared out of the blue
while in Namhan Fortress.

566
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,289
Did you flee because you were afraid
that the fortress would be captured?

567
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,730
Seeing how unscathed you are,

568
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,260
it is a good thing you ran away.

569
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,869
Since we got to meet again...

570
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,300
Is it nice?

571
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,400
No.

572
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:28,340
Are you glad?

573
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,909
Says who?

574
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,710
Darn.

575
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,409
I am extremely glad
and happy to see you again.

576
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,380
Though I do not know who he is,
hearing how you survived...

577
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,889
thanks to the military officer
who fought 17 to 1,

578
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,019
I am so thankful.

579
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,090
What is it?

580
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,329
Are you starting to have feelings for
that military officer now?

581
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,070
Excuse me, young master.

582
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,769
I am not someone who likes multiple people
like someone else.

583
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,210
And I am?

584
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,179
You visit places like this.

585
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:09,650
You should know the best.

586
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,170
What is it? What are you doing?

587
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,309
I have been curious for a while now.

588
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:39,880
About what?

589
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,210
Your fan.

590
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,780
Do you not feel cold,
fanning yourself in the winter?

591
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,420
I assumed it was bravado,

592
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,920
but you looked cold.

593
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,170
I...

594
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:06,000
feel hotter than others!

595
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,239
I see.

596
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,809
You generate more heat.

597
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,210
Then you can continue
cooling yourself down.

598
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:17,710
I will be leaving now.

599
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,829
Why did you lie?

600
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:40,239
I thought you saved her
by fighting 17 to 1.

601
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,340
Why did you not tell her that?

602
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,809
Just because...

603
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:51,150
it is embarrassing.

604
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,760
He is so frugal.

605
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,360
So he was here?

606
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:04,989
And this is for you.

607
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,730
Why is this for me?

608
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,030
Did he tell you to give it to me?

609
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,940
No, he never said that,

610
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,440
but I doubt it is for me or Jong Jong...

611
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,710
Is it for me?

612
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,280
Whatever.

613
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,510
If it was for me,
he would have told me earlier.

614
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,750
You met Young Master Jang Hyun? Where?

615
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,980
Where do you think?

616
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,989
He is as promiscuous as the rumors.

617
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:34,420
He was entering Usimjeong
or whatever like it was his house.

618
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,190
That place sells alcohol and laughter.

619
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,360
But how were you there as well?

620
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,130
- What?
- Usimjeong?

621
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:46,599
Did you ask Young Master Dae O
about that place to go there?

622
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:48,570
- What?
- Oh, my.

623
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:50,809
You went there yourself...

624
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,539
to see Young Master Jang Hyun?

625
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,880
Why do my ears itch?
Is there something inside?

626
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,980
Goodness.

627
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,849
Why do you all sound so cheerful?

628
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:02,179
The thing is,
Young Master Jang Hyun was here.

629
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,989
You met Young Master Jang Hyun?

630
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,559
- Is he safe?
- Yes.

631
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:08,820
Where is he right now?

632
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,860
I should also meet him.

633
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:19,869
Long time no see.

634
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:21,969
Welcome.

635
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,940
Young Master Jang Hyun.

636
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,440
I am upset.

637
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,909
Why did you not let me know
how you were doing?

638
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:30,909
You have become
a Senior Sixth Rank officer...

639
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:31,980
for the Office of Royal Decrees.

640
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,980
Yes.

641
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,559
Okay. We can continue talking later.

642
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,119
Let us go inside.

643
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,429
But...

644
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,460
can we go somewhere else...

645
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,630
instead of a place like this?

646
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,500
"A place like this?"

647
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,869
This is my house.

648
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,670
How is a brothel your house?

649
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,900
Since it is my friend's house,
it is also my house.

650
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,969
You know my friend, Ryang Eum, right?

651
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,840
The unparalleled singer, Ryang Eum.

652
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,349
It has been a while.

653
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,159
Here. Eat up.

654
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,360
There may not be a lot due to the war,

655
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,860
but it will still be good.

656
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:24,369
Is that so?

657
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,110
It is tasty.

658
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,019
By the way, Young Master Yeon Jun,

659
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,059
do you remember the day we met
on the road to Mount Gwanggyo?

660
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:50,190
I mean,

661
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,789
your clothes were torn...

662
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,400
and you were limping, but you were still
so determined to save the King.

663
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,900
After that,

664
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,309
it was as if he had been starving
his entire life...

665
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,480
What was it again? Right.

666
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:10,679
He devoured that rice ball.

667
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,980
It was all over his face.

668
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,690
Faithful scholars
go through such hardships.

669
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,429
He is obviously different from someone
who only tries to flee.

670
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:25,559
No.

671
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:26,860
Young Master Jang Hyun is right.

672
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:29,329
I was a complete mess.

673
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,070
I am alive today
thanks to Young Master Jang Hyun.

674
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,150
Madam Bang Doo.

675
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,449
Why did she drink so much?

676
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:48,719
Did you not know?

677
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:50,789
My lady loves drinking.

678
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,090
It is just that she does not drink often.

679
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:04,429
In the near future,

680
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:07,239
I am planning on proposing to Lady Eun Ae.

681
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,940
If I ask her to hold our marriage
when her father is not here,

682
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,079
it will be heartbreaking for her.

683
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:21,880
Please look after her, Lady Gil Chae.

684
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,460
If Soon Yak was alive,

685
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,800
it would have been nice
for us to hold a joint marriage...

686
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,070
as we discussed in Neunggun-ri.

687
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,940
I should be the one
to make Eun Ae pretty for her marriage.

688
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,010
I guess we will not
ever talk in private again.

689
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:52,780
Before Soon Yak died,

690
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,719
he asked me something strange.

691
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
You...

692
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,289
like Lady Gil Chae, do you not?

693
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,269
I could not deny it.

694
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,869
Why could I not do it?

695
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,519
It is too late.

696
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,150
What could you not deny?

697
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,059
Never mind it.

698
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,389
I am drunk,

699
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,460
and I was just being silly.

700
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,400
Please...

701
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,599
tell me.

702
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,280
Lady Gil Chae.

703
00:52:57,949 --> 00:52:58,980
I know it.

704
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,679
That your feeling for me...

705
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:08,019
is like the feeling of a young child
who is eager to get...

706
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,829
the toy she wants.

707
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:13,829
Once you get a hold of me,

708
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:15,900
your feelings will soon die down.

709
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,929
What you are saying is...

710
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,829
that you are not choosing me...

711
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,000
because you think
my feelings will die down?

712
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,570
Do not take me for a fool.

713
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,909
My feelings are genuine.

714
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:28,940
I...

715
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:30,880
Let us stop here.

716
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:39,849
It is fine if you marry Eun Ae.

717
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:42,389
But for the last time,

718
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,989
tell me.

719
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,829
Tell me honestly.

720
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:52,800
For even just once,

721
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,110
have you liked me...

722
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:02,610
as a woman?

723
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,920
From this moment forward,

724
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,460
we will never have
a conversation like this again.

725
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,710
What kind of a man are you?

726
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,380
Young Master Jang Hyun.

727
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:16,719
I know men like you very well.

728
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,519
You are too full of thoughts...

729
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,320
to follow your heart.

730
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,630
You are too full of regrets...

731
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,500
that you cannot live the way
your reason tells you to live.

732
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,500
So...

733
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,329
you let those poor women
decide it for you...

734
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,139
and hide behind their skirts,

735
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:40,079
enjoying watching their sad eyes.

736
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,780
You wonder about,

737
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,780
saying that you are doing
something big for the nation.

738
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,480
But in truth,
you cannot keep your family well...

739
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,090
unless your woman
takes the matter into her own hands.

740
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,829
You are very drunk.

741
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,599
Why do not we go to my house
and drink some more?

742
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,679
You have not changed at all.

743
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:24,019
You are still so naive that you cannot
decipher foe from an ally.

744
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,159
If you were not Lady Eun Ae's fiancé,

745
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,900
I would break that pale neck of yours.

746
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,010
So this is the palace
I have heard about so many times.

747
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,119
Make me a position at Simyang.

748
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:58,949
What made you change your mind?

749
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,519
Everyone thinks the way
to Simyang is the death road.

750
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:04,829
I want to go because
I might die on the way.

751
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:08,000
If I am scared to die,

752
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,130
I will probably have
no time to think about other things.

753
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,510
Where have you been?
You have not even eaten anything.

754
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:19,409
Should we...

755
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,679
go to the Qing?

756
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,079
We just recently came to Hanyang.
Why would we leave?

757
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,179
I do not want to go. I will not go.

758
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,550
Fine. You should stay then, Gu Jam.

759
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,150
- Jang Hyun.
- When are we leaving?

760
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:36,059
Will I have time to retrieve my clothes?

761
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,230
Will you follow him everywhere,
even if it was the toilet?

762
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,059
He is coming with me.

763
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,630
See?

764
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,230
Ryang Eum is the true friend.

765
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,880
You must feel flustered to see
Young Master Yeon Jun...

766
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,519
rushing the marriage.

767
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,389
Why do you care?

768
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,730
When will you develop better taste in man?

769
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,030
Will you have better taste in man
by the time I return?

770
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:23,170
You are going somewhere again?

771
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:26,880
Why?

772
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:29,940
Are you sad that I am leaving?

773
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:32,179
When did I say I was?

774
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,519
No. You look...

775
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,949
a little sad.

776
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:43,889
Whether you go over there
or come here, I am not interested.

777
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,500
Is that right?

778
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,900
I heard you have a woman
in every eight provinces.

779
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,070
Are you going to go flower viewing
in Jeolla Province this time?

780
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,940
Or will you sing the flower song
in Gyeongsang Province?

781
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,909
Then about a month later, you will
return and seduce me all over again.

782
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:04,380
But that will not happen.

783
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,780
I am going to the Qing.

784
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,980
I will serve the Crown Prince.

785
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,090
The Qing?

786
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,820
It is too far to return in a month.

787
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,829
Why all of a sudden?

788
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,260
See?

789
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,929
You are sad to see me go.

790
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,230
That is not true.

791
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,510
I guess you plan to go to the Qing
and date one of the foreign intruders.

792
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,610
I wish I had the time to do that.

793
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,280
I heard I might get
attacked by the foreign intruders...

794
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,219
and die in Simyang.

795
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,690
If I am...

796
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,489
lucky enough to survive it...

797
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,329
and if we meet again,

798
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
then we should...

799
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,469
have a serious conversation.

800
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,800
Although...

801
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,110
I had made up my mind
to not believe in marriage,

802
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,139
if the only way to make...

803
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,389
a certain woman mine is through marriage,

804
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,920
then I am...

805
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,760
willing to marry.

806
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,329
You consider that a marriage proposal?

807
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,570
There is no rush.

808
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,909
I can wait for a very long time.

809
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,150
I always say this,

810
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,650
but you need to mature up, you know.

811
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,750
Gosh.

812
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,900
It is strange.

813
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,599
What is?

814
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,599
Looking into the mirror
does not make me feel any better.

815
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,039
When Young Master Yeon Jun
joined the military,

816
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,510
I felt better while looking
at my pretty self in the mirror.

817
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,409
Why am I not feeling any better today?

818
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,309
Stare longer.

819
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:22,650
Right?

820
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,489
I would feel better
if I stared a little longer, right?

821
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,530
Gosh.

822
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,030
I should go and yell at him.

823
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,179
I prefer this one to this.

824
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,980
Are you that bad at picking horses?

825
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,750
You can tell from their buttocks.

826
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,679
Since this one has a fuller backside,

827
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,389
he will run further.

828
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,260
My lady, what brings you here?

829
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:14,239
I have something to tell you.

830
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,059
I am here to ask
since I could not yesterday.

831
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,130
About what?

832
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,269
What big dreams you have.

833
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:47,969
If you came back,

834
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,800
did you think I would meet with you?

835
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:55,440
- Did you come here to say that?
- Yes.

836
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,110
Just bear in mind
that I will not meet you.

837
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,449
Since I am done, I shall take my leave.

838
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,380
Why will you not meet me?

839
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:07,619
Were you not the one...

840
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,059
who gave me her accessory
so that I would stay safe?

841
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:13,090
When did I?

842
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,869
The ribbon is not mine.

843
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,840
- What?
- What?

844
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,739
I did not say it was a ribbon.

845
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,750
I see.

846
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,820
You mean...

847
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,449
this was your ribbon?

848
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,260
Do not take back what you gave.

849
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:43,260
I did not. I lost it!

850
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,929
My goodness!

851
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,929
Seems like you lost it
by hiding it deep in my bottle.

852
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,800
Give it back!

853
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
Hurry!

854
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,630
You know,

855
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:24,099
I plan to hold on
to this ribbon until I die.

856
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,030
If you really want to take it,

857
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:28,699
here.

858
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:31,809
Put your hand in and try to take it.

859
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,579
You are definitely...

860
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,349
a lowlife, a scoundrel, and a cad!

861
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,579
Let go of me!

862
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,460
What are you...

863
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,659
Do you feel it?

864
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,699
I do not understand myself either.

865
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,940
Why is it that when I look at you,

866
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,179
my silly heart makes such a big fuss?

867
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:01,159
My lady.

868
01:06:01,659 --> 01:06:03,699
Did you really want to kiss me?

869
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:09,599
A man like you...

870
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,909
can die by the intruders' hands.
See if I care...

871
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,219
I know you do not love me yet.

872
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:04,289
I also know that...

873
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,699
your heart still belongs to Yeon Jun.

874
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:15,500
However,

875
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,010
even if you do not love me,

876
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,710
please do not forget me.

877
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,019
On this day,

878
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,920
this very moment you spent with me...

879
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,829
Do not ever forget it.

880
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:09,719
(My Dearest)

881
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,779
I must meet him again.

882
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,779
There is only one thing I desire.

883
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,489
That is your heart.

884
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:39,119
I cannot do that.

885
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:42,189
Will a man who shakes your heart
despite having a fiancée...

886
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:43,689
be good for you?

887
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:44,890
Just leave!

888
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,029
Go and die!

889
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,729
The man in my dreams
has to be Young Master Yeon Jun.

890
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,569
What is it
that Young Master Yeon Jun has...

891
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,470
but I do not?

892
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,640
He is not someone I can forget easily.

893
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,310
You are so cruel.

894
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,696
