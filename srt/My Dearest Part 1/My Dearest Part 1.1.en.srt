1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:17,789
(Spring of 1659,
the 10th year of Hyojong's reign)

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,250
(Head Inspector Shin Yi Rib)

5
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,609
You became a head inspector this year?

6
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:10,980
(Jipyeong: the 5th rank public post
of the Office of Inspector General)

7
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,980
Yes.

8
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,680
I heard you need me to do something.

9
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,299
This was found
after the former Crown Prince passed.

10
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,209
The former Crown Prince?

11
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,640
Crown Prince So Hyun.

12
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,790
This is a draft.

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,430
Those are the words...

14
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,599
(Sacho: draft of the historical record
written by a historical recorder)

15
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,769
that should have been erased from history.

16
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,400
It is the record that should not exist.

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,270
It is full of words of disloyalty
for the late Crown Prince.

18
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,610
By the way,

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,449
there is one thing that bothers me.

20
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,789
There is a man
who is mentioned frequently in this draft.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,430
His whereabouts bother me.

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,599
Find out the authenticity of this draft.

23
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,370
Find that man.

24
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,169
But why would we dig up the record...

25
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,139
that should have been erased?

26
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,439
That is why...

27
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,280
you must do it in confidence.

28
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,060
Among a bunch of military officers,
there was a man who did not behave right.

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,889
He failed to fulfill his duty to report.

30
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,759
He deluded the Crown Prince...

31
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,259
and got the wrong things recorded.

32
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,530
One of the men got cursed,

33
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,900
and gradually went mad.

34
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,500
And His Majesty ordered that...

35
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,199
the man shall never see the light again.

36
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,750
Lee Jang Hyun.

37
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,419
(Haeminseo)

38
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,990
(The government office that treated
poor Joseon people for free.)

39
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,289
I am unwell.

40
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:41,659
Goodness.

41
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,699
You are unbelievable.

42
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,000
Goodness.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,539
It hurts.

44
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, dear.

45
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,669
Goodness.

46
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,919
It hurts.

47
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,520
Help me.

48
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Goodness.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,970
I heard from the lady.

50
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,709
You want to look around the facility.

51
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,879
I heard you treat mental cases here too.

52
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,680
We do.

53
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,120
But we do not take in just anybody.

54
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,560
The noble families bring
their family members here secretly...

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,930
when they can neither
care for the person at home...

56
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,399
nor abandon the person.

57
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,399
By any chance,

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
is there a man who
insists on being the faithful servant...

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,000
of the late Crown Prince?

60
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,509
Do you know the man?

61
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,649
I came to ask him a question.

62
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,220
Ask him a question?

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,990
Having a conversation with him...

64
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,490
is out of the question.

65
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,430
How so?

66
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,860
You will know once you meet him.

67
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,160
What is strange is that someone high-up...

68
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,170
made a special request...

69
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,899
to provide him with good care.

70
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,709
He has been chanting
the same words for several years.

71
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:37,810
Why care for him?

72
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,579
What are those words?

73
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:41,680
He said the man will come and get him...

74
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,879
when the time comes.

75
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,459
My dear husband?

76
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,629
Why did you come so late?

77
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,870
My dear husband.

78
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,100
Mother.

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,040
I passed the state examination.

80
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,910
I passed first too.

81
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,449
My lord! Please save my child!

82
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,220
Please!

83
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,790
Please!

84
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,430
It is him.

85
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,170
I am Head Inspector Shin Yi Rib.

86
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,810
I came to ask you a question.

87
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,550
Can we talk?

88
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,149
Is the man you are waiting for...

89
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:55,990
Lee Jang Hyun?

90
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,430
Recently, I read a strange story.

91
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,000
In that story,

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
there was a man named Lee Jang Hyun.

93
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,069
While his accomplishments
were nothing but lies,

94
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,810
do you...

95
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,680
happen to know him?

96
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,089
So you do understand me.

97
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,389
You are not mad.

98
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,689
Am I right?

99
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,970
Can you tell me...

100
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,699
about Lee Jang Hyun?

101
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,090
Do you hear it?

102
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,590
It is the sound...

103
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,230
of the flowers.

104
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,500
(Spring of 1636,
the 14th year of Injo's reign)

105
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,570
(Episode 1)

106
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,940
- One, two.
- One, two.

107
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,179
- One, two.
- One, two.

108
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,250
How plentiful!

109
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,509
It is huge.

110
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,519
Come quick.

111
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,019
One moment.

112
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,159
You are here.

113
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Let us continue after lunch.

114
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,129
Let us eat first.

115
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,230
- We should continue later.
- Come here already.

116
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,299
Hurry up.

117
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,070
"My father gave life to this body..."

118
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,340
"whereas my mother nurtured it."

119
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,940
- "My father gave life to this body..."
- "My father gave life to this body..."

120
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,279
- "whereas my mother nurtured it."
- "whereas my mother nurtured it."

121
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,009
"My father gave life to this body..."

122
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,580
"whereas my mother nurtured it."

123
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,480
- "My father gave life to this body..."
- "My father gave life to this body..."

124
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,120
- "whereas my mother nurtured it."
- "whereas my mother nurtured it."

125
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,590
- "When I learn to settle,"
- "When I learn to settle,"

126
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,960
- "I will find my will."
- "I will find my will."

127
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,759
- "When I find my will,"
- "When I find my will,"

128
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,129
- "my heart shall be tranquil."
- "my heart shall be tranquil."

129
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,730
- "When my heart is tranquil,"
- "When my heart is tranquil,"

130
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,029
- "I will be at peace."
- "I will be at peace."

131
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,730
- "When I am at peace,"
- "When I am at peace,

132
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,070
- "I can contemplate."

133
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,730

134
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,139
- "I am enlightened."
- "I am enlightened."

135
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,919
Little yellow bird, do tell me.

136
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,789
Who is the fairest in this world?

137
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,330
If you think it is Lady Gil Chae
of Neunggun-ri,

138
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,730
chirp for me.

139
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,929
If it is another lady,

140
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,529
do a handstand for me.

141
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,539
Little yellow bird, do tell me.

142
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:25,440
Who is the fairest in this world?

143
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,779
Tell me at once...

144
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,679
or I will break your legs!

145
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,250
My lady!

146
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,620
What?

147
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,059
I will be scolded if you are late.

148
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,590
You need to please Madam Sam Bong
to get a good future partner.

149
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,159
All the matchmakers go to her first
when they visit our town.

150
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,830
But she does not like me at all.

151
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,169
That is why you should put in more effort.

152
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,870
You need to marry a good husband...

153
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,840
so that I can also live
with my head held high.

154
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,269
Please think of the people around you...

155
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,009
instead of yourself only.

156
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,710
Is that not a lady's ethics?

157
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,110
Do you have to berate me
with your servant's ethics?

158
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,080
Your voice will haunt me in my dreams!

159
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,620
Why, you...

160
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,990
- Eun Ae.
- Yes?

161
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,620
Are you going to the flower festival too?

162
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,259
I will be wearing a pink coat for...

163
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,929
I did not ask you.

164
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,059
You know, the other day,

165
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,669
Young Master Jun Jeol asked to
share my fan during the flower festival.

166
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,330
But he has not said anything about it yet.

167
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,100
If a man confuses you,
it means he does not like you.

168
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,409
If you really want to know
what he thinks of you,

169
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,870
go and talk to him first.

170
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:05,409
You know, smile and tap his shoulder.

171
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,610
My goodness.

172
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,019
Are you asking me
to do something so cunning?

173
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,519
My Young Master Jun Jeol would never fall
for such behavior.

174
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,320
You can do it all you want.

175
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,629
Anyway, Eun Ae...

176
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,990
Me first. Hey, Eun Ae.

177
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,629
- Do you want to embroider together?
- Sure.

178
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,129
Eun Ae agreed to be my partner today.

179
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,440
- Right, Eun Ae?
- But I asked first!

180
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,740
She just partnered with me.

181
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,039
- No, I asked her first.
- This is pretty, right?

182
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,809
You said this time...

183
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,110
I am not going to that silly festival.

184
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,779
Why would anyone pluck weeds
to make pancakes?

185
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,779
And writing poems on fans and whatnot?

186
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,980
How childish.

187
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,220
I heard city folk do not do that.

188
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,820
How boring!

189
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,509
Poor me!

190
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,580
I should look for another lady to serve.

191
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,320
I am so worried about my future...

192
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
that I cannot sleep these days!

193
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,789
She will be the death of me.

194
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,559
Do I have to look for a new master?

195
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,500
Rest assured about your future.

196
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,399
Soon, I will be marrying a handsome man.

197
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,809
I will meet the man of my dreams.

198
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,190
Next time, no matter how much
you want to brag,

199
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,130
think, "They must have one thing
about themselves that is better than me,"

200
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,329
and hold it in.

201
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,130
When I meet the man of my dreams one day,

202
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,769
I am going to give him a pillow
that I embroidered myself.

203
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,539
Then we will be able to meet
in each other's dreams.

204
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,539
When will you learn...

205
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,339
how to embroider
when you are always kicked out?

206
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,650
How many times has it been already?

207
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,119
Is it that hard to sit calmly?

208
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,890
Gosh.

209
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,490
Who are you?

210
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,099
I have been waiting for you,

211
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,670
right here,

212
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,339
for a very long time.

213
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,410
My lady.

214
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,049
My lady.

215
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,690
My lady, the hot water is ready.

216
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,259
Did I not tell you I am afraid I will
hear your voice in my dreams?

217
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,960
Why did you wake me up?

218
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,630
Did you dream the same dream again?

219
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,170
Then with the man
in your dream, did you...

220
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,200
Of course.

221
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,569
Once again, with the man in my dream...

222
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,640
I read a book.

223
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,349
I read chapter one of "Sohak,"

224
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,380
and he read chapter two.

225
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,759
He was about to show me the meaning
of moral training and home management.

226
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,329
But why did you have to wake me up?

227
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,369
Gosh.

228
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,900
You did not even get to see his face yet.

229
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,109
I do not have to see his face.

230
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,339
I am sure he is Young Master Yeon Jun.

231
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,740
Dream on.

232
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,819
People say Young Master Yeon Jun
likes Eun Ae.

233
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,789
Did you think all the men
in this world would like you?

234
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,490
Young Master Yeon Jun and Eun Ae
are not interested in each other.

235
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,660
As if.

236
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:44,230
Everyone in Neunggun-ri knows
that Young Master Yeon Jun likes Eun Ae.

237
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,759
Only you do not know.

238
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,529
I told you not to
talk about Eun Ae in front of me.

239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,269
Eun Ae.

240
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,900
Eun Ae.

241
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,740
Did someone call me?

242
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,609
No one called you.

243
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,450
You must be hearing things...

244
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,779
because you are excited
to see Young Master Yeon Jun.

245
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,650
You are so silly.

246
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,990
Goodness, How pretty.

247
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,690
Will this look better on you?

248
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,619
Or will this look better?

249
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,089
Goodness.

250
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:15,829
It is okay.

251
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,029
But still,
you have not seen him in a while.

252
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,730
You should look pretty.

253
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,869
This is why the cunning Gil Chae...

254
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,170
- keeps...
- Madam Bang Doo.

255
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,940
There you go again.

256
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,450
I wonder if he passed
the entrance to the village yet.

257
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,299
<i>Young Master Yeon Jun likes Eun Ae</i>

258
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,799
<i>- Not Gil Chae</i>
- Why you...

259
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,140
You should leave too.
I am going back to sleep.

260
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,470
I heard Young Master Yeon Jun,
who studied at Sungkyunkwan,

261
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,910
might be at the flower festival today.

262
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,509
Well, if you really do not want to go,
then it cannot be helped.

263
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,789
At times, it is not a bad idea
to commune with flowers.

264
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,789
Well, I should wash my face first.

265
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,470
Oh, my. Eun Ae.

266
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,839
Hi, Gil Chae.

267
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,710
Did I not tell you?

268
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,210
I told you she would come no matter what.

269
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,339
I am actually on my way
to the flower festival.

270
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,880
- Do you want to go together?
- Goodness.

271
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,549
Was today the day of the festival?

272
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,450
I would not have gone
if you did not tell me.

273
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,049
Then shall we go?

274
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,490
- Let us go.
- Okay.

275
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:55,160
I knew she would come.

276
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,930
Your lady knows about...

277
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,990
Young Master Yeon Jun coming today, right?

278
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,259
My lady can go anywhere...

279
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,829
Lady Eun Ae goes.

280
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,069
I remember a man tried to kill himself...

281
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,740
after Lady Gil Chae rejected him.

282
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,740
How is that my lady's fault?

283
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,940
Is it a crime to be pretty?

284
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,910
It is not because she is pretty.

285
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,440
It is because of her behavior.

286
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,809
Another time, she laughed
with her mouth wide open...

287
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,319
in front of all the men.

288
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:22,619
Gosh, how indecent.

289
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,859
Then does something else
other than your mouth open when you laugh?

290
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,259
Oh, my goodness.

291
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,390
You will be a bad influence on your baby.

292
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,430
My gosh.

293
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,059
Hey, what did you just say?

294
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,940
There is one here too.

295
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,779
- Look at this one.
- How pretty.

296
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,460
<i>- Let us go to our homeland</i>
<i>- Let us go to our homeland</i>

297
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,339
Look.

298
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,549
Do you know what happens when you behave
carelessly at the flower festival?

299
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,980
In the Year of Imjin...

300
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,650
When the Japanese raiders raided
in the Year of Imjin,

301
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,950
a Japanese raider tried to rape Deok Bok.

302
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,319
She fought hard and bit his finger.

303
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,559
The Japanese raider got mad
and cut her two hands.

304
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,329
She still did not go with him,

305
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,299
so the Japanese raider beat her to death.

306
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:16,799
Even until the moment of death,
she constantly yelled at the enemy.

307
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,900
When foreign intruders raided
in the Year of Jeongmyo...

308
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,670
When foreign intruders raided
ten years ago in the Year of Jeongmyo,

309
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,539
Lee fled to the mountain,
carrying her mother-in-law.

310
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:28,380
A foreign intruder followed her
and tried to look at her face.

311
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,009
Lee fought back hard,

312
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,779
and the intruder pierced her
two eyes with a knife.

313
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
- Lee...
- It is not like...

314
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,289
there is going to be a war.

315
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,220
Why does she keep repeating
the words she said?

316
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,460
It sounds as if
they are going to raid any minute.

317
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,829
Your Highness, this is Min Ji Sik
from the Propaganda Office.

318
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,369
His Majesty is unwell,

319
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,670
so I am tending to him all day long.

320
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,309
Why are you making such a fuss?

321
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,680
The envoy we sent to Great Jin came back?

322
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,220
Yes. The envoy came back.

323
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,779
The king of Great Jin said...

324
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,990
The king of Great Jin Hong Taiji...

325
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,859
appointed himself as the emperor
and held an ancestral rite?

326
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,990
But Your Majesty,

327
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,869
I did not bend down to them until the end.

328
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,369
Then why did you receive
the document they gave...

329
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,740
instead of tearing it in front of them?

330
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,970
Your Majesty,

331
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,769
you must behead the envoys
and throw them to the foreign invaders.

332
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,039
You are going overboard.

333
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,250
It has been years...

334
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,480
since Great Ming has been
fighting Great Jin.

335
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,619
Once the foreign invaders raid a town,

336
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,220
no house remains untouched.

337
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,789
No man remains normal.

338
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,319
And no man gets to protect his wife.

339
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,099
That is how terribly they affect us.

340
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,269
You still think I am going overboard?

341
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,599
How can we serve the leader
of such people as the emperor?

342
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,210
They say
10,000 mounted troops of Jurchen...

343
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,109
are impossible to fight against.

344
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,579
Daling he of Ming Dynasty fell.

345
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,450
The foreign invaders are
posing a serious threat.

346
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,549
More than that,

347
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:14,819
(Daling he: Ming Dynasty's area
formed around Daling River)

348
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:18,660
They must know that Joseon
is loyal to Ming Dynasty...

349
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,289
and that we would never serve
the king of Great Jin as an emperor.

350
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,029
How dare they force our envoy
to go down on his knees?

351
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,500
What do you think is the reason behind it?

352
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,539
Lee was moving
her husband's body to his hometown.

353
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,079
And the owner of the inn she stayed in
grabbed her by her wrist.

354
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,250
She got her wrist grabbed
while pushing and pulling him.

355
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,119
But Lee cried and said,

356
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,259
"Unfortunately, I lost my husband.
How can I let..."

357
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,000
"How can I let another man
hold my wrists?"

358
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,029
What?

359
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,640
I am rash and cunning?

360
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,869
People who envy me...

361
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,109
think men like me because I am pretty.

362
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,640
But Jong Jong.

363
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,710
It is not because of
my outstanding appearance.

364
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,309
I am a woman...

365
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,880
who works for what she wants.

366
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,450
Of course.

367
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,420
Of course.

368
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,390
See how cunning I can be.

369
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:40,500
Look. Lady Gil Chae is here.

370
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,460
You look even stronger now.

371
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,099
No way.

372
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,440
The mountain paths were steep.

373
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,640
I nearly fell.

374
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,109
Would you lead the way...

375
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,980
when I head back?

376
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,009
Of course, I would.

377
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Young master, you are bad.

378
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,470
What?

379
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,940
What did I do wrong?

380
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,450
I have been looking for you all-day
to ask you to write a poem on my fan.

381
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,210
And you are here only now.

382
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,579
Me?

383
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,579
Who else then?

384
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,150
Are you not the greatest calligrapher
of Neunggun-ri?

385
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,720
That is...

386
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,130
I will...

387
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,099
make sure to write on your fan.

388
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,299
You are going to write it
in your free time. Am I right?

389
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,299
That is your mistake.

390
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:19,400
Should I write it now...

391
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,910
I will write it now.

392
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,349
You are in my way.

393
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:33,119
I am sorry.

394
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
I apologize. No.

395
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:36,589
No. I am sorry.

396
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,390
It is as if I am haunted by the ghost
of the legendary wife who turned to stone.

397
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,920
A wife who turned to stone?

398
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,700
You are haunted by her.

399
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,160
A wife who turned to stone? Gosh.

400
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,299
You are the only one
who makes me laugh, young master.

401
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,369
The ghost of a wife who turned to stone.

402
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,079
Let us go.

403
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,910
Have you heard of that ghost?

404
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,519
I am a very funny man.

405
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,460
I am the strongest man in Neunggun-ri.

406
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,119
I am the master calligrapher.

407
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,760
Goodness.

408
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,139
All right.

409
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,849
Young master.

410
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,849
It is hot.

411
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,619
It is hot!

412
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,199
Ask him how he can promise...

413
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,699
to write a poem to another woman.

414
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,369
He did it in front of me too.

415
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,340
He fell while picking up the brush case.

416
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,210
That is how impatient he was.

417
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,909
Did he forget decorum?

418
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,480
My two eyes are wide open.

419
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,150
How can you promise to write
for another woman?

420
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,230
Young master!

421
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,190
You are unbelievable.

422
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:27,030
Does he...

423
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,599
What?

424
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,429
I cannot hear a word you say.

425
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you like Gil Chae?

426
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,070
No way.

427
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:38,110
Lady Gil Chae has nothing to do with me.

428
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,809
How can I dare...

429
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,019
to have a woman like her?

430
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,949
So, how is everyone doing?

431
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,420
What do you think?

432
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:27,519
Even the Japanese invasion
was not as chaotic as this.

433
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,090
By the way,
where is Young Master Yeon Jun?

434
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,030
Welcome.

435
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:38,530
This way, please.

436
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,150
Young Master Yeon Jun.

437
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,920
Why is he with Father?

438
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,659
Did he...

439
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:05,559
come to ask for permission to woo me?

440
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,159
Oh, dear.

441
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,769
He should have given me a hint first.

442
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,309
Now that everyone is here,
I have something to announce.

443
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:28,480
You must be aware...

444
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,889
that Great Ming is at war with Great Jin.

445
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,230
However, in the letter the king
of Great Jin wrote to His Majesty,

446
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:38,630
he called himself
"the Emperor of Great Qing..."

447
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,230
and referred to Joseon as "your country."

448
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,230
- "Your country?"
- Those shameless intruders!

449
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,500
- What is going on?
- How preposterous!

450
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,940
How dare he call himself the emperor?

451
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,570
However, the royal court does not plan
to fight the Great Jin.

452
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,010
On the contrary, it wants
to send envoys to appease their king.

453
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,010
Envoys?

454
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,010
- That is ridiculous!
- How can that be?

455
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:59,449
- Not another boring talk.
- Therefore,

456
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,750
with Master's permission,

457
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:07,519
I propose that we should write
an appeal to His Majesty.

458
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,030
- All right. Count me in!
- Me too!

459
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,630
Of course. We should help the Great Ming
and teach those intruders a lesson!

460
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,530
- That is right!
- Of course!

461
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,199
How can you be so sure
that the Great Ming will win?

462
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,250
Perhaps the intruders
will beat the Great Ming.

463
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,750
Have you not thought of that possibility?

464
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,219
Do you think that makes sense?

465
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:35,989
Even a child can hurl stones...

466
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,349
better than a foreign intruder!

467
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,750
The Great Ming has 1,000 soldiers.

468
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,360
How can the intruders win?

469
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,590
Really?

470
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,630
A thousand?

471
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,000
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

472
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,300
An army of 1,000 Ming soldiers...

473
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,769
will clearly defeat the foreign intruders?

474
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,610
But did you know?

475
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,750
The intruders do not think so.

476
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,550
The great Ming empire over there...

477
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,989
was once called Yuan,
founded by the Mongols.

478
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:14,420
Before it was called Yuan,

479
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,329
it was the Jin Empire founded
by the intruders.

480
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,960
To the intruders, an army of 1,000...

481
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,570
would be manageable.

482
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:23,969
How dare you?

483
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:25,800
- You impudent fool!
- Shut your mouth!

484
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,070
Do not look down on 1,000 soldiers.

485
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,610
They stay constant
no matter the situation.

486
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,780
One's unfaltering and noble loyalty...

487
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,380
multiplied by 1,000.

488
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,250
Besides,
even if the intruders are roused up,

489
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:41,880
the Great Ming is an empire...

490
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,719
while the Qing is a small kingdom
that just got on its feet.

491
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,590
Do you not know
that the Jin emperor Nurhaci, was slain...

492
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,860
by Yuan Chong Huan of Ming?

493
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,630
- Not just that.
- Of course.

494
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,059
And do you know how General Yuan died?

495
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,769
He died with a thousand cuts
to his body...

496
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,440
through the punishment of lingchi.

497
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,469
(Lingchi: a punishment
where the criminal is tied up and sliced)

498
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,769
By the Ming emperor.

499
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:08,039
When his loyalty to the Ming was doubted,

500
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,380
he died a slow and painful death.

501
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,420
Who wants to sacrifice their life
to fight for a king like that?

502
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,820
Tell me.

503
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,690
I see.

504
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Joseon.

505
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:24,329
These loyal Joseon men would be willing
to fight for him.

506
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,659
However,

507
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,829
these are brave scholars we have here.

508
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,469
How will they fight when war breaks out?

509
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,739
Will they build a wall with their brushes?

510
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,349
Or will they fight with solid ink?

511
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,750
- How dare you?
- Why, that fool...

512
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:48,280
That impudent fool!

513
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,449
My goodness.

514
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,019
Why, that...

515
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,460
Look at him.

516
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,590
How ridiculous.

517
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,230
That jerk.

518
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,260
Ignore him.

519
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,929
- Stop right there.
- My goodness.

520
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:03,900
Why, that fool.

521
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,239
Who is he? How dare he argue
against Young Master Yeon Jun?

522
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,539
Well, I heard the rumors.

523
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,579
- He is one uncouth fellow.
- What?

524
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,909
About a month ago,

525
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,019
he came to our village
to buy soft persimmons.

526
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,789
This place has wonderful feng shui.

527
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:24,789
(A month ago)

528
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,420
Do you even know how to spell "feng shui?"

529
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,159
You were kicked out from every school.

530
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,559
Just tell me about the place you found.

531
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:34,429
Yes, sir.

532
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,800
Well, it can be said
that the village Neunggun-ri...

533
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,599
has delicious rice punch
and soft persimmons.

534
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,369
They offer top-notch bamboo shoot wine.

535
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,809
The village elders are kind and gentle...

536
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,510
so the people follow their orders.

537
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,539
Even the county does not interfere
in their matters.

538
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,539
I see.

539
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,480
They have lax norms about courtship...

540
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,179
so the men and women are very chummy.

541
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,219
I see.

542
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:55,889
I knew you would be pleased.

543
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,420
Perhaps due to that,
there is a sly creature in their midst.

544
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,519
Hold on.

545
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,530
- A sly creature?
- Yes.

546
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,199
It is a fox with nine tails...

547
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,230
No, it is a fox with 99 tails.

548
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,380
I came here by following the scent...

549
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,989
of the famous bamboo.

550
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,489
Please take me in as your disciple.

551
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,130
He asked to be a disciple at our school.

552
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,889
So the teachers said...

553
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,000
that only those who pass an exam...

554
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
can study at our school. And then...

555
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,239
He actually agreed to take the exam.

556
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,739
Does that mean that he actually...

557
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,480
took the exam with young school children?

558
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,780
Why bother taking an exam?

559
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,449
You will not last long anyway.

560
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,750
Oh, you there.
Do you know what is for today's exam?

561
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,260
Look. Let us be quiet.

562
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,460
My goodness.

563
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,500
Let me see.

564
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,329
What could the topic be...

565
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,570
for today?

566
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,239
(Loyalty)

567
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,909
Explain what loyalty is.

568
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,210
A woman's loyalty to her chastity,
a liege's loyalty to the king,

569
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,150
and the loyalty that men
and the people should have for the nation.

570
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,420
What are you doing, young master?

571
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
Jang Hyun!

572
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,929
Come on.

573
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,789
Well.

574
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,230
This topic is too boring.
I am not doing it.

575
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,000
He only knows how to act like a nobleman.

576
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,969
He could not even write a proper passage.

577
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,769
He is not from a true noble family.

578
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,239
Rumors say that he was a lowly peasant...

579
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,880
who paid for fake documents...

580
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,409
to act as a nobleman.

581
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,050
My goodness.

582
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,280
And do you know what he said?

583
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,019
"I have money..."

584
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,579
"so let me join the school!"

585
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,619
Oh, my.

586
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,420
He should be kicked out immediately.

587
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,659
But somehow,
he managed to coax the elders...

588
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,929
There was a guy
who was excellent with his speech.

589
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:20,800
So I asked him to show it to me.

590
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,130
When I stepped on him,

591
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,239
he just screamed, "Ouch!"

592
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,639
When I gave him a big slap on his cheek,

593
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,210
he screamed, "Please spare me!"

594
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:48,719
Why did you kick out someone
who wanted to learn?

595
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,730
Since when was Neunggun-ri
such a heartless place?

596
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,829
I know what he did...

597
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,800
but how could you turn away
an earnest student?

598
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,429
- How could you do that?
- That is unbelievable.

599
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,699
My goodness.

600
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,769
How cruel.

601
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:03,070
Goodness.

602
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,739
In fact, he even managed
to convince Grandpa Song Chu.

603
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,579
As you all know,

604
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,050
that old man has a nasty temper.

605
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,050
Sir!

606
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,590
Are you blind?

607
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,420
Do you not see
that I worked up a sweat to build it?

608
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,460
Please do not be mad. I apologize.

609
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:26,329
Goodness.

610
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,099
I give up.

611
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Sir...

612
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,900
However, that Lee Jang Hyun fellow...

613
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,409
treats Grandpa Song Chu's house
like his own...

614
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,039
and works the old man like his servant.

615
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,679
<i>Go and play, go and play</i>

616
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,280
<i>Play while you are young</i>

617
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,820
<i>You will not be able to once you are old</i>

618
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,019
<i>How wonderful, how wonderful</i>

619
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,960
But...

620
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,030
how did a man without a title
earn so much money?

621
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,969
I heard he sold soft persimmons
and cigarettes...

622
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:08,539
to foreign intruders.

623
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,039
He associates with foreign intruders?

624
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,369
That is what I am saying.

625
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,480
I did not want to say this,

626
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,679
but I saw him once
as I was buying medicine for my mother.

627
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,559
But he was...

628
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,559
This was what he was doing.

629
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,059
I cannot believe he got so close
to foreign intruders.

630
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:38,469
How crude he is.

631
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,340
That is not all. According to the rumors,

632
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:42,769
he goes around all eight provinces
to do business.

633
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,340
But he has women in each province
that he is intimate with.

634
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,750
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

635
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,210
But what is more absurd...

636
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,380
is that he courts good graces
of the women with his gifts, and...

637
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:07,500
Come on.

638
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,769
Take this.

639
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,230
Try opening it.

640
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:21,079
Ribbons with an embroidered design
on just the end is what is in trend.

641
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,510
Oh, my.

642
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,349
How pretty.

643
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,949
You should pass the state examination now.

644
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,550
That way,
my parents will allow our marriage.

645
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:34,920
"Marriage?"

646
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,489
Do not be too upset.

647
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:43,400
I want to hold our wedding
before you pass the examination,

648
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,199
but my parents would not allow...

649
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,199
Gosh.

650
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:50,969
My lady,

651
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,869
do you love me?

652
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,280
- Sorry?
- I guess you do not.

653
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,449
Then do I love you?

654
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,010
I do not think...

655
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,480
my feelings for you are that big yet.

656
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:05,150
But we already met three times,

657
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,719
you gave me a gift,

658
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,929
and I even put my head
on your shoulder today.

659
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,500
So that is the reason why
we should get married?

660
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,199
I thought you would be different
from other women.

661
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,170
Listen carefully, my lady.

662
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,510
The feeling of love is a fleeting emotion.

663
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:28,809
Humans are shallow
so they are not able to keep...

664
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:31,650
such a divine emotion inside of them
for a long time.

665
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,280
Therefore,

666
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,250
it is better not to tie yourself
to someone through marriage.

667
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,659
So from a very long time ago,

668
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,389
I decided to be a misogamist.

669
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,690
What is a misogamist?

670
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,500
"Misos" means hatred.

671
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,099
"Gamos" means marriage.

672
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,900
So a person who does not want to marry.

673
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:57,269
Then why have you been seeing me?

674
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,510
Do a man and a woman have to get married
in order to see each other?

675
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,920
Brother!

676
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,320
This man...

677
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,489
trifled with my feelings!

678
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,630
What do you mean? That is a bit...

679
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,000
- Hey!
- What?

680
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,800
Who are those people?

681
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,530
I told you not to tell people
you are a misogamist.

682
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,599
Stop right there!

683
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,739
Get him!

684
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,969
- Hey, you punk!
- Stop right there!

685
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:32,010
He tells people that he is a misogamist.

686
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,840
- Misogamist?
- What is that?

687
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,139
- Misogamist?
- There is such a word?

688
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:36,510
Why would he not get married?

689
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,610
- I know, right?
- Why would he not get married?

690
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,150
He must be lacking in some way.

691
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,349
I am sure he is probably bad in bed or...

692
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,260
- My lady.
- What?

693
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,139
It is not time for us
to talk about foreign intruders.

694
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,809
We have to stop Lee Jang Hyun
from polluting our fortress.

695
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,139
But he said he would give us rice.

696
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:12,250
You want to accept
a man like him for rice?

697
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,079
He is someone who dared to say
that foreign intruders...

698
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,489
could defeat the Great Ming.

699
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:18,989
Is someone talking about me?

700
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,989
Right. Here.

701
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,030
Someone must be speaking ill of you again.

702
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,099
People speak ill of you wherever you go.

703
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,429
You are going to live until your senility.

704
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,300
Did you really tell them that you would
give them a bribe if they let you in?

705
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,369
Yes. More, please.

706
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,110
Gosh.

707
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,449
You are so embarrassing.

708
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,019
This one. Good.

709
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,130
I do not think...

710
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,000
he will be that bad in bed.

711
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,730
He has a fine figure.

712
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,670
Hey, is that all?

713
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,230
He was so fierce
when he pushed the guys to the edge.

714
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,440
He was like a fierce...

715
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,739
Like an animal preying on a herd of deer?

716
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,780
No. A beast.

717
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,280
Come on.

718
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,019
- A beast?
- Since his gaze was so intense.

719
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,579
Gosh, how boring.

720
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,550
Are you going to talk about
that misogamist all day?

721
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,519
I should...

722
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,030
just go and ride a swing.
Come on, Jong Jong.

723
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,699
- How perverse.
- What?

724
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,380
You have heard of that rumor too, right?

725
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:58,289
From the southern city
called Namwon or whatever,

726
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:00,860
a man named Yi Mong Ryong,
who passed the state examination,

727
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,059
fell in love with Chun Hyang, the daughter
of a kisaeng, and made her his wife.

728
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,929
I mean, I did hear that rumor.

729
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:08,699
But it makes no sense.
How could the daughter of a kisaeng...

730
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,500
Why does that not make sense?

731
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:14,199
Anyway, do you know why Yi Mong Ryong
fell in love with Chun Hyang?

732
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,469
Well,

733
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,309
I think it was
after seeing Chung Hyang on a swing.

734
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:21,940
So why do you think he fell in love
with her after seeing her on a swing?

735
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,030
Oh, my. What are you doing?

736
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,360
If I ride this swing,
my skirt will lift up,

737
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,670
and they will be able to see
my underskirt, slightly.

738
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,170
And if they are lucky,

739
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,369
they can also see my bare skin.

740
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,369
It will make all of their hearts flutter.

741
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,539
The socks are the most important.

742
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:03,849
Jong Jong,

743
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:04,949
let us do this.

744
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:11,260
Open wide.

745
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,300
Come on.

746
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:29,679
What a sight.

747
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,400
Gu Jam, look.

748
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,369
Who is she?

749
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,579
The fox of Neunggun-ri with 99 tails.

750
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,610
Is that so?

751
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,230
I am so full. I should take a walk.

752
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,590
Gosh, I am full.

753
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,539
Let us go and tell our master...

754
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,539
that Lee Jang Hyun
cannot be allowed in the fortress.

755
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,139
We have to...

756
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,340
We have to tell him...

757
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,090
Wait.

758
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,329
I think there is...

759
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,300
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

760
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,429
There was an accident!

761
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,869
- What is going on?
- Something must have...

762
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,269
Where is everyone going?

763
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:08,809
Someone got hurt, so they went to help.

764
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:11,150
Lady Gil Chae fell from the swing.

765
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,349
Then we should hurry there.

766
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,719
A plenty of people are there to help her.

767
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,929
- There.
- Lady Gil Chae!

768
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:32,829
- Lady Gil Chae!
- Lady Gil Chae!

769
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,440
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

770
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,469
Goodness.

771
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,739
Gosh.

772
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,210
The foothold nearly fell.

773
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,409
Bad swing!

774
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,650
Let us fix it right away.

775
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,719
- Let us do it.
- Right.

776
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:53,389
Lift it up.

777
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,389
Is everyone here?

778
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,360
We had to run here.
You could have gotten hurt.

779
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,670
That is not it.

780
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,539
Is it fixed?

781
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:09,969
It needs to be fixed a little more.

782
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,639
Are you not hurt...

783
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,480
Move. I should get back on it.

784
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,010
- Goodness.
- My Lady.

785
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,150
- Goodness.
- Be careful.

786
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,989
As you already know, I have seen
many women from all over the nation.

787
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,300
A woman who has a beautiful face.
A woman who has beautiful hands.

788
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,159
A woman who has a thin waist.
A woman who has thin wrists.

789
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,829
A woman who has a powerful voice.
A woman who has a warm heart.

790
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,400
A woman men love.
And a woman who loves men.

791
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,099
That is not all.

792
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,809
From Seo of Pyongyang Seo family,
who is a self-claimed Yang Guifei...

793
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:48,309
to women from Gyeongsang Province
of Joseon, I have dated them all.

794
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,079
They look fancy on the outside,
but they are empty inside.

795
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,519
Of course, you did.

796
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,679
Gosh.

797
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,389
What did you eat?

798
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,760
So...

799
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:04,489
even the woman who is supposed
to have 99 tails...

800
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:07,400
would not be that special.

801
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,309
Since you went to trouble to tell me,
I would go see it for myself.

802
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:19,809
But...

803
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:21,809
I have no expectations.

804
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,650
As you already know,
I am a very picky person.

805
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,949
The woman I am looking for is...

806
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,130
One day,

807
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,400
you asked me.

808
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:45,900
You asked me
what I was thinking that day...

809
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,039
when I was riding the swing.

810
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,940
I said I do not remember it.

811
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:55,710
But the truth is
I clearly remember everything.

812
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,179
That day,

813
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:02,550
I felt like the man of my dream
would approach me.

814
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,719
So everything before me...

815
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:08,789
turned green...

816
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,829
and pink.

817
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,869
One day, I asked him.

818
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:23,199
"Do you remember the day
you saw me for the first time?"

819
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,079
He answered, "I remember it clearly."

820
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,949
"I heard something very special that day."

821
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,780
I asked him what he heard.

822
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,920
Do you hear it?

823
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:44,889
It is the sound...

824
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,199
of the flowers.

825
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,130
What?

826
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,639
Flowers do not make any sound.

827
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,269
Have you heard of the sound
of a flower blooming in the spring?

828
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,000
Today,

829
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,670
I got to hear that special sound.

830
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:51,030
(My Dearest)

831
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,079
Are you waiting for me?

832
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,110
You smiled at me in the daytime.

833
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,380
The men you have dated before...

834
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,949
must have gotten flustered
by your attention.

835
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,750
But I am not them.

836
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,590
I am curious. I want to know
who you want to date.

837
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,860
You know.

838
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:27,300
I do not believe in marriage.

839
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,860
Then what about the sweet words...

840
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,730
and glances?

841
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,440
I am leaving tomorrow.
I will be away for several months.

842
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,170
I will make a suggestion
he would not be able to turn down.

843
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,110
I will kiss him.

844
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,075
