1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,480
There is...

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,650
only one thing I desire.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,490
Your heart that only cares for me
and no one else.

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,559
If you can just tell me that you will
never think of him again,

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,500
I will not go to Simyang.

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,030
I guess that will not happen.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,439
I will give it to you.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,939
You can have my heart.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,710
So...

12
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,250
please stay.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,189
Please stay.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,200
Stay with me.

15
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:08,030
(My Dearest)

16
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>Baby, baby, my baby</i>

17
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,449
<i>Baby, baby, my pretty baby</i>

18
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,319
<i>My treasure, go to sleep</i>

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,430
<i>Grow well, my small baby</i>

20
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,370
<i>Gentle, small wind</i>

21
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,599
<i>Even birds fly to their nests</i>

22
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,639
Stop!

23
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,039
Here comes His Majesty.

24
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,289
You are...

25
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,120
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,009
You.

27
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,139
Go away.

28
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,620
In Joseon, someone spread a false rumor...

29
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,490
to the Qing troops
that smallpox had spread.

30
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,159
By any chance, are you...

31
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,800
the one who spread...

32
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:52,699
that rumor?

33
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,780
I have already
told General Yong Gol Dae...

34
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,919
regarding that.

35
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,460
General Yong Gol Dae.

36
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,959
You...

37
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,230
tell me.

38
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,970
Did you fail to sniff out
a rat like Ha Seo Guk?

39
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,569
Or is he...

40
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,040
just a pitiful subject
who got lost in the war?

41
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,990
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,189
He does not have
what it takes to be a spy.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How can I possibly not spot a spy?

44
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,610
Rarely do we have a competent spy.

45
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,509
Yuan Chong Huan of Ming died...

46
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,550
thanks to a double spy tactic, after all.

47
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,649
(Bangangye: using captured spies
against their country)

48
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,220
You mean...

49
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,019
You sly fox!

50
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,389
Now,

51
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,800
you have attested to my worth.

52
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,300
Even if you hate me,
you cannot kill me easily.

53
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,379
Fine.

54
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,350
I shall spare your life for now.

55
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,089
However,

56
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,889
prove that you are not a rat first.

57
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
(Episode 9)

58
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,110
Thank you.

59
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:00,189
Thank you.

60
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,529
Go and wash up.

61
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,199
You smell.

62
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,490
How did you get released?

63
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,759
Tell me the details.

64
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,769
From now on,

65
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,810
hunt the escaped Joseon captives
on your own.

66
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,120
That is just how I am.

67
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,959
I am...

68
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:09,360
someone who belongs
neither here nor there.

69
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,840
Yes.

70
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,379
You do not belong on either side.

71
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,850
But for me,

72
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,299
I belong to your side.

73
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,580
Prove that I am not a rat?

74
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:14,720
How dare you feed him trash?

75
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,590
Well...

76
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,129
Hey, give it back.

77
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,330
- Give me!
- No.

78
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,529
- Give it back!
- Do not eat it.

79
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,080
How embarrassing. Forget it.

80
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
In that case,

81
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,179
I will give you an extra doe of barley.

82
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,279
What will you use it for?

83
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,620
If I bring her a girl's sanitary cloth,
she can give birth to a boy.

84
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,960
My madam keeps asking me
to get one for her.

85
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,330
Think of it as a kind deed.

86
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,730
What are you doing?

87
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,230
What did you try to sell?

88
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,409
Do not reprimand Young Chae.

89
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,909
That...

90
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,409
belonged to your mother.

91
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,110
Let us sell it.

92
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,519
We may be able to endure it,

93
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,919
but Je Nam and Dae Bok...

94
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,159
will starve to death.

95
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,759
Just the top?

96
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,299
Any skirts?

97
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,830
I only have the top.

98
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,610
Only two hop of barley?

99
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,580
This is an exquisite top.

100
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,710
Goodness.

101
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,580
You gave me a top without a skirt.

102
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,789
- But...
- Jong Jong.

103
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,250
Let us go.

104
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,759
Look at her selling her clothes,

105
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,960
yet she acts like a noble with a servant.

106
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,769
I apologize.

107
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,480
I have no choice.

108
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,879
Are you asking us to die?

109
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,250
I cannot do anything
as it is banned in the Qing.

110
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,080
- Is he not...
- Sir.

111
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,720
the officer who saved us
at Ganghwa Island?

112
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,850
- Come on.
- How can you do this?

113
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,730
My lady.

114
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,029
It has been a while.

115
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,330
What brings you here?

116
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:44,840
Goodbye.

117
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,899
Jong Jong.

118
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,879
Oh, goodness.

119
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,850
Does this forge belong to you?

120
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,350
Yes.

121
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,419
Please eat up.

122
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,519
You said the forge was yours, right?

123
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,990
Right. Yes.

124
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,629
It is a forge that has been run
by my family for a long time.

125
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,259
Originally, officers had to prepare...

126
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,429
their own swords and arrows.

127
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,730
But why were the blacksmiths not working?

128
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,970
The war is over.

129
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,740
And the Qing prohibited Joseon
from making any weapons,

130
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,779
so I have no work for them.

131
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,210
Then they can make other stuff.

132
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,509
A lot of families...

133
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,350
lost pots and plates from the war.

134
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,549
We need nails and hinges...

135
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,350
to replace the doors of the houses
that caught on fire,

136
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,490
- and...
- I am not sure.

137
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,919
I heard bronze bowls
and farming equipment...

138
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,289
were made at my forge in the past,

139
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,129
but I have never made stuff like that.

140
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,639
What if...

141
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,309
I were to help you?

142
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,940
That is absurd.

143
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,350
How could you do something
that is rough for even the blacksmiths?

144
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,549
I can.

145
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,990
I can do it.

146
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,299
What do you want to make?

147
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,330
I saw a mold for bronze bowls.

148
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,500
I heard you made bronzeware here
in the past.

149
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,870
Yes, originally, bronze bowls
and miscellaneous farming equipment...

150
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,139
were made here.

151
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,809
But after the invasion
in the Year of Jeongmyo,

152
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,779
we only made weapons.

153
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,149
That is great.

154
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,179
Make the bronze bowls again.

155
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,950
The bronze bowls?

156
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,549
If we want to make the bowls,

157
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,250
we need copper.

158
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,230
My goodness.

159
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,759
I cannot believe he gave us
ten precious rolls of cotton fabric.

160
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,830
With these, we can survive
for three months... No.

161
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,970
With one meal a day,
we can survive for a year.

162
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,039
What about after that?

163
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,539
Should we go to him again
and ask him for more?

164
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,409
We can think about that
when the time comes...

165
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,309
This is worth five mun.

166
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,980
Do you not know
it is 1 doe of rice for 1 mun?

167
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,179
Goodness. What year are you living in?

168
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,350
After the war,
rice is as precious as gold.

169
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,379
Even if you bring me ten mun of tongbo,

170
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,820
it is not even worth half doe of barley!

171
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
- How pitiful.
- What in the world?

172
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,320
- Tongbo is not worth anything now.
- What are you saying?

173
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
- I cannot believe you.
- I know, right?

174
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,129
He should just make dishes with those.

175
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,759
If we want to make the bowls,

176
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,500
we need copper.

177
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,039
Go around and exchange these with coins.

178
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,470
If we haggle for a good bargain,
we can buy them at a giveaway price.

179
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,740
Are you saying we should exchange...

180
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,309
this precious cotton fabric
with dirt-cheap tongbo?

181
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,220
With these, I can cook meat soup
for Young Master Je Nam,

182
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,250
and our Dae Bok will also be able to...

183
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,350
- smell...
- Do as I say.

184
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,730
Do you want to eat meat just once,

185
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,889
or do you want to eat it every day?

186
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,000
If you will not accept tongbo,
what will you accept? Why you...

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,570
How dare you yell at me?

188
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,769
Just give me 1 doe of rice.

189
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,470
- I will give you tongbo.
- You...

190
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,669
Why are you two fighting?

191
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,909
- I cannot believe you.
- Come over here.

192
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,039
My gosh.

193
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,580
Sell me your tongbo.

194
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,080
I will buy it for double the price.

195
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,350
- "Double?"
- How much can I buy...

196
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,080
with this amount of tongbo?

197
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,549
This much.

198
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,690
Come on.

199
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,759
Give me this much.

200
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,120
- I cannot.
- What is it?

201
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,659
- Those are tongbo, right?
- Yes.

202
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,889
Why are you carrying it around
when it is so heavy?

203
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:04,930
Follow me.

204
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,730
- I will sell it for you.
- Are you serious?

205
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,569
- Oh, my goodness.
- This way.

206
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,569
Here you go.

207
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,839
Here are my tongbo.

208
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,880
One.

209
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,180
Make a line. Please stand in line.

210
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,609
One.

211
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,220
Here you go.

212
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,589
Make a line.

213
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,920
Stand in line!

214
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,130
Are you saying
you sold the cotton fabric...

215
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,930
for these useless coins?

216
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,160
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

217
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,200
Melt these and make dishes.

218
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,500
These coins may be useless,

219
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,970
but bronze bowls are rare right now.

220
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,210
My lady.

221
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,839
It is illegal to melt tongbo...

222
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,150
and make other goods.

223
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,210
Officer,

224
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,220
one roll of cotton fabric
cannot be bought...

225
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,779
with even 100 mun of tongbo right now.

226
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,819
But if we melt the tongbo
and make bronze bowls...

227
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,589
Who would want to buy...

228
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,519
expensive bronze bowls
at a time like this?

229
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,230
Since you are the eldest grandson
of your family,

230
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,190
you should be aware of how precious...

231
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,329
performing memorial services are
to noblewomen.

232
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,470
You do not know how much they lament
because they have to use...

233
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,140
gourd bowls after their bronze bowls...

234
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,769
were stolen during the war.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,009
Just wait and see.

236
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,680
As I was fleeing,
I noticed that every woman...

237
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,539
had either a jade ring
or some type of gold.

238
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,410
If bronze bowls become available to buy,
they will give those up.

239
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,190
They ran away, risking their lives.

240
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,960
Do we really have to catch
our fellow Joseon people?

241
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:45,500
I do not like this, either.

242
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,259
Do we have to do this?

243
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,539
They are also people who catch escapees...

244
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,009
and sell them.

245
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,680
Do we really have to do
what they are doing?

246
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,809
Go back. Move back.

247
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,480
Go back.

248
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,150
Do not do it if you do not want to.

249
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,849
I can do it myself.

250
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,029
Run!

251
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,740
Hey!

252
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
- Here.
- There we go.

253
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,480
If you polish it, it will become glossy.

254
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,119
People will speak ill of you
if you do stuff like this.

255
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
I just want to see it quickly.

256
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,279
Look at this.

257
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
It is a bronze bowl.

258
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,220
The useless coins
became precious bronzeware.

259
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:37,289
Why did you not repair the tongs
in advance?

260
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,059
Is this how you have been working?

261
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,470
Officer Gu may have been lenient,

262
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,700
- but I will not let it slide.
- Okay.

263
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,569
Goodness.

264
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,180
- Move faster.
- Okay.

265
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,049
She said she would give us
half of the profit.

266
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,519
If you do not give it to us,

267
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,519
I am going to hit your mouth
until it becomes flat.

268
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,859
Hey, she is going to hear you.

269
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,559
She is still a noblewoman.

270
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,589
"Noblewoman?"

271
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,430
How poor is her family...

272
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,900
for her to work outside of the house?

273
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Goodness.

274
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,200
She is poor herself,
but she keeps bossing us around.

275
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,539
How unsightly.

276
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,509
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Gosh.

277
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,250
You see...

278
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,420
Eun Ae.

279
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,400
And you still call yourself a Joseon man?

280
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,539
Shame on you!

281
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,609
Goodness.

282
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,809
The blue man is nowhere to be seen today.

283
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,710
You know the man
wearing a blue mask on his face.

284
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,650
I have never seen such a slim-figured man
as him. He is so quick too.

285
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,589
Right?

286
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,890
Let us go.

287
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,529
Cut one heel each
and send it to their masters.

288
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,039
Yes, My lord.

289
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,210
Please spare us!

290
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,079
Please spare us!

291
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,579
Let me go!

292
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,019
Let me go!

293
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,750
Let me go! Darn you all!

294
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,420
You have caught quite a few of them.

295
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,690
You are resourceful.

296
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,190
Capturing fleeing prisoners...

297
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,359
is a matter of
great importance to His Majesty.

298
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,559
I told you, did I not?

299
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,200
I will become a useful man.

300
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,980
Is there anything else you need?

301
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,180
You are one impertinent fellow.

302
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,049
You think you can get me whatever I need?

303
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,950
If it is something I can do,

304
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,859
I shall do it for you,
whatever that may be.

305
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,329
I need money...

306
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,630
to bribe my superiors.

307
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:37,069
If you allow me to trade on this land,

308
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,109
I will give you 5 on top of 5.

309
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,250
By the way, why are you having no fun?

310
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,279
Are you afraid that I may have
poisoned your drink?

311
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,519
What?

312
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:51,859
You see,

313
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,130
I cannot do business with a man...

314
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,930
who does not enjoy...

315
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,829
drinking or being with women.

316
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,019
Please stop.

317
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,490
You are a strong man.

318
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,160
Drink up.

319
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,329
My lord.

320
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,930
- You are cute.
- He is.

321
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,230
Drink with us.

322
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,700
He is easy to read.

323
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,039
General.

324
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:44,769
Let us go over there.

325
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,819
Drink up.

326
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,559
This is boring.

327
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:50,809
I know.

328
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,380
I know you are not real.

329
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,480
There is no way you are really here.

330
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,009
Why?

331
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,079
Did you not know?

332
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,289
This is how I play.

333
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,700
This is who I really am.

334
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,509
This is me.

335
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,809
I am a dreadful man.

336
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,150
Summon Jang Hyun now.

337
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,890
Your Highness, that is not it.

338
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,990
Summon Jang Hyun right away.

339
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,420
Now!

340
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:25,069
You have been providing
bamboo medicine to Dorgon...

341
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,539
and the royal family behind my back?

342
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,109
Is that how you won over Yong Gol Dae
and spared your life?

343
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,509
How dare you make...

344
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:39,950
the Crown Prince of Joseon
someone who flatters them?

345
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,779
I did not flatter them.

346
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,460
You gave them a helping hand.

347
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,289
Who would think that?

348
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,420
Who would?

349
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,960
Right.

350
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,700
You have been this way
since the beginning.

351
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,170
You looked down...

352
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,700
on me, my father,

353
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,339
and the royal court of Joseon.

354
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,670
It was not just you.

355
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,180
I hear the scholars of Joseon
are refusing to take office...

356
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,480
and going into forest, refusing
to be part of the corrupt royal court.

357
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,220
But do you know
what you are mistaken about?

358
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,220
When faced with threats
from foreign intruders,

359
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,690
His Majesty ordered
the release of grains...

360
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,029
from the royal granary
to supply each area.

361
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,859
When the court officials attacked
Choi Myung Gil, His Majesty protected him.

362
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,799
When Kim Ryu advised
retreating to Ganghwa Island,

363
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,500
His Majesty instructed sending...

364
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,740
the old and infirm first.

365
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,569
But no one knows.

366
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,779
No one realizes it.

367
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,980
Some curse His Majesty
for failing to appease...

368
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,950
the foreign intruders and getting invaded.

369
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:51,250
The others curse His Majesty
for bending over backward...

370
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,359
trying to please the foreign intruders.

371
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,859
How can we stop them...

372
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,089
from disrespecting His Majesty?

373
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,390
How can we?

374
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,200
But why are you so angry, Your Highness?

375
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,299
Could it be that Your Highness...

376
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
considers His Majesty,
who could not protect you,

377
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,539
as incompetent?

378
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,769
Shut it!

379
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,309
But that is not it, Your Highness.

380
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,380
They did not invade us...

381
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,049
because His Majesty is incompetent.

382
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,220
Your Highness,

383
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:28,420
based on my long dealings with them,

384
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,930
I have come to realize that as
the confrontation with the Ming...

385
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,730
draws near, they wanted
to keep Joseon in check...

386
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:37,569
and obtain Joseon's
provisions and soldiers.

387
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,339
For this purpose,
they would have invaded Joseon,

388
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,240
using any excuse they could muster.

389
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,509
The talk of war arising
from the incompetence...

390
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,910
of the Joseon king and court...

391
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,150
It is simply their ploy...

392
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,519
to shift the blame for the war...

393
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,819
onto Joseon.

394
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,960
Would Your Highness also fall victim
to their cunning scheme?

395
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,869
However, Your Highness...

396
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,940
Khan is more cunning...

397
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,039
and crafty than anyone.

398
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,349
He grew up in the midst
of feuds with his own brothers.

399
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,279
He even witnessed his father, Nurhaci,
kill his eldest brother.

400
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,849
So,

401
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,319
when he became Khan,
one of the first things he did...

402
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,690
He subdued his rival Dorgon...

403
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,529
by burying his mother alive.

404
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,069
(Soonjang: burying people alive
along with the dead king)

405
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,900
The people you are up against...

406
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,970
are those...

407
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,940
who will abandon everything to stay alive.

408
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,309
When it comes to their own lives,

409
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,950
they are desperate enough
to go as far as...

410
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,519
to kill their son, brothers, and mother.

411
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,259
For such people,

412
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,970
what will Your Highness' life
mean to them?

413
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,039
Please sit.

414
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,200
Why has Joseon...

415
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,529
not sent their military resources?

416
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,039
Send over 5,000 seok of rice right now...

417
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,869
and inform His Majesty...

418
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,410
of what you will deliver
to Bonghwangseong.

419
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,839
After going to war with the intruders,

420
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,380
scholars said that
all Joseon folk can do now...

421
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,750
is to die honorably...

422
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,820
or grovel for the rest of their lives.

423
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,429
Do you also think so, Your Highness?

424
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,559
Are you saying...

425
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,300
there is another way out?

426
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Yes, Your Highness.

427
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
It is one...

428
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,840
that requires immense courage.

429
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,980
That is to confront the intruders...

430
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,050
so that you may...

431
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,349
live on with pride.

432
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,849
We do not have time to grovel or die.

433
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,320
You need to live.

434
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,829
Live on...

435
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,199
so that you can greet
the bright days ahead.

436
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,679
General.

437
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,349
While I am eager
to send the military provisions,

438
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,690
it will be difficult to produce
all 5,000 seok of rice at once.

439
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,250
Perhaps we can make it up
with some millet instead.

440
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,719
What do you think?

441
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,739
A mix of rice and millet is fine.

442
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,809
Make sure you send it on time.

443
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,690
The Crown Prince sent in...

444
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,429
a mix of rice and millet as tribute?

445
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,030
It would have been tough to send
in 5,000 seok of rice at once.

447
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,269
Thanks to His Highness,

448
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,639
the burden on our people
has been relieved...

449
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,510
and the Qing were extremely pleased.

450
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,579
That is great to hear.

451
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,309
However, I heard that...

452
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,420
the Crown Prince
has been learning Manchu...

453
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,449
and he also followed Khan
by participating in Taoist rituals.

454
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:29,130
After seeing him
join the Taoist rituals one day,

455
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,230
Khan was apparently overjoyed,
or so I heard?

456
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,849
We will keep this for your father's rites.

457
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,519
I am counting on you.

458
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,460
If only I could do it myself.

459
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,130
My lady. People are already gossiping...

460
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,699
about you for making men work
as a noble lady,

461
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,230
how can you sell things?

462
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,300
That will only happen over my dead body.

463
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,369
So many things will happen
over your dead body.

464
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,239
Make sure you visit the big houses...

465
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,880
and ask if they need bronzeware.

466
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
- I am counting on you.
- Yes, my lady.

467
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,050
Do not worry, my lady.

468
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,619
My husband may not be the brightest,

469
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,519
but he is great at bargaining.

470
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,219
I will make sure to sell everything
in half a day.

471
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,690
Goodness.

472
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,400
I will sell everything!

473
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Have a safe trip.

474
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,070
She made bronze bowls at the forge?

475
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:50,769
Yes.

476
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,380
And she saved one for me
so that I could use it...

477
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,650
for Father's rites.

478
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,679
You will be amazed by Gil Chae's acumen.

479
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,619
Ladies should not be out and about.

480
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,750
It is my fault.

481
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,820
All of us are doing fine.

482
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,389
I let you know
so that you would not worry.

483
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,329
Everything aside,

484
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,030
I found a way
to stop you from being exiled.

485
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,639
There is someone
who can sway the scholars' opinions.

486
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,570
He wants to exonerate those
who have been imprisoned...

487
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,110
for refusing to follow the Qing.

488
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,710
He was in the woods for a long time...

489
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,119
but he came out...

490
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,849
during the war to gather troops...

491
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,949
and fight against the intruders.

492
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,019
As his wisdom transcends that of others,

493
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,889
people call him the saint of Joseon.

494
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,309
Are you the wife of Nam Yeon Jun,
a former Senior Sixth Rank officer?

495
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,539
Do you know my husband?

496
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,539
He rejected being promoted
to serve the Qing...

497
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:03,809
and was stripped of his post.
Nam Yeon Jun, the righteous subject.

498
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,880
How could I not know his name?

499
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,519
I heard that
you are gathering people to help...

500
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,519
people like my husband.

501
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,519
- Therefore...
- Did Officer Nam...

502
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,559
send you here?

503
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,800
No.

504
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,130
I came here
after hearing of your reputation.

505
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,599
This matter...

506
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,500
is not up to me, but your husband.

507
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,840
When your husband refused
to go to the Qing,

508
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,010
he lost His Majesty's favor.

509
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:38,909
What does he think of that matter now?

510
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,590
What are you selling?

511
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,860
You want to buy some?

512
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,460
I am selling bronze bowls.

513
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,730
What? You have such rare items?

514
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,599
In that case,
you will be earning big money.

515
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,170
You think these are mine?
They are my madam's.

516
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,010
Well, I will get some tips
if I sell them all.

517
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:14,480
By the way, the shortcut to Bukchon...

518
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,849
is this way, right?

519
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,349
Goodness, no.

520
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:20,190
If you go there,
you will have to take a big round.

521
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,590
You are a lucky one.

522
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,260
Just follow me.
I am also heading to Bukchon.

523
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
Let us go together.

524
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,960
- But this path...
- It is the longer way.

525
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,900
- Come on. Let us go.
- Well...

526
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,269
All right then.

527
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:36,309
Let us go and sell some bronzeware.

528
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,809
I cannot believe you have them.

529
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,909
You idiot! You fool!

530
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:48,780
I know how important those bowls were.

531
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,420
My lady, I deserve to die.

532
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,559
Please kill me, my lady.

533
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,190
Oh, goodness.

534
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:58,429
Do you not know how precious they were?

535
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
Goodness.

536
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,300
They were so important.

537
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,440
Where are they? Where are those guys?

538
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,139
- Show me the way!
- My lady!

539
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,679
- This way?
- Yes.

540
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,110
They escaped ages ago.

541
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,409
You will not find them.

542
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,619
I will find them.

543
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,380
Where did they go?

544
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:22,690
Goodness.

545
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,820
My lady, can we just go back?

546
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,289
Hush.

547
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,090
- My lady!
- Go with her.

548
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,699
Oh, dear. My lady!

549
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,400
You know...

550
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,469
My lady, do not go!

551
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:43,769
He was doing a business.

552
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,010
Give me back my bowls.

553
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,579
Did you come alone?

554
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,210
Give me back my bowls.

555
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,449
You must be here for the bronze bowls.

556
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,550
You came here alone with that small axe?

557
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,559
All right, here.

558
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,829
Come here and take them.

559
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,300
Bak Dae!

560
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,369
What? You came with Bak Dae?

561
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,369
Bak Dae?

562
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:14,070
But it is currently night, not day.

563
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,309
Bak Day! Where are you?

564
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:17,670
- Bak Day!
- "Bak Day?"

565
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,980
- How dare they? Those weasels!
- My friend!

566
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,440
What are you doing? Just take them.

567
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,980
You know,
I found today's dinner too bland.

568
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,550
But a delicious treat just crawled in.

569
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,090
I know.

570
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,190
My bowls.

571
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,329
My lady.

572
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,829
We already got rid of them.

573
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,570
Why would we still have them?

574
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,699
She is so naive.

575
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,449
What?

576
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:13,360
- Let us run away.
- Come on.

577
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,929
- Come on.
- Hurry.

578
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:16,130
- Darn it.
- Come on.

579
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,639
My lady.

580
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,010
There is only one left.

581
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,079
My bowl... Only one.

582
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,400
We should stop now.

583
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,630
I am worried you are oppressing yourself.

584
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,099
There is still one left,

585
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,010
so I am going to sell this
and make a profit.

586
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,309
This time, I will sell it myself.

587
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,480
My lady.

588
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,980
There are two now.

589
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,449
What will happen to our share?

590
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,159
What are we going to do about this?

591
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,400
What about the rice you promised?

592
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,929
It is not over yet.

593
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,800
So step aside, at once.

594
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,449
Jang Hyun.

595
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,420
The transaction went well.

596
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,219
We earned 5,000 nyang.

597
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,889
Exchange 500 nyang with white paper
and send it to the royal men.

598
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,230
And exchange another 500 nyang...

599
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,400
with silk and send it to the royal women.

600
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:59,940
I will go to General Yong Gol Dae myself.

601
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,969
But Jang Hyun,

602
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,440
it is nice to make money,

603
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,510
but do you not think you are
being too friendly with the intruders?

604
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,510
What is wrong with sucking up
to a few people to win their favor?

605
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,289
If you do it too much, we will not
be treated like humans back in Joseon.

606
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:21,190
Did you forget?

607
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,659
I was...

608
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,699
a churl to begin with.

609
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,239
- Please try this.
- Enjoy.

610
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:38,309
Let us drink a lot.

611
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,710
Let us drink.

612
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,010
- Let us drink.
- Let us drink.

613
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,880
I am satisfied.

614
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,150
Have you ever had food like this before?

615
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,050
It tastes good.

616
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,059
It is top-quality bamboo oil.

617
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,690
It is not easy
for even Dorgon to own this.

618
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:58,960
It is only...

619
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,900
for those of you who are here.

620
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,010
What? Those are all ours?

621
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:14,010
They are the best products.

622
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,679
I am very satisfied.

623
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,050
So am I. Thank you so much.

624
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,219
I love it.

625
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,090
- Let us drink!
- Let us drink!

626
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,340
I do need bronzeware,

627
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,309
but I do not have enough rice
or fabric to buy these.

628
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:47,510
Instead of rice,

629
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,050
you have some jewelry, do you not?

630
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,610
You can pay with those instead.

631
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,550
They are two sets
of top-quality bronzeware.

632
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,489
This will not be enough.

633
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:17,940
My lady.

634
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,880
You earned enough for 4
when we only had 2.

635
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:24,380
But...

636
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:27,550
who would buy a jade ring
or a silver hairpin at a time like this?

637
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,980
I am going to a courtesan house.

638
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,119
The only people who would buy these
are courtesans.

639
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,420
My goodness.

640
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,789
Why would you go to a courtesan house?

641
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,929
This time, no matter what,
I will not let you...

642
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,230
I was expecting something more special.

643
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,400
Silver hairpins and jade rings
are so common around here.

644
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,500
But still,

645
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,739
these were used by a noblewoman.

646
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,679
- The workmanship is different.
- Goodness.

647
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,610
If noblewomen use them,

648
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,380
do silver rings become gold rings?

649
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,320
What do you think of this?

650
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,260
Then what do you think...

651
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,860
of wearing that
and dancing like us courtesans?

652
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,789
We need to see
if it would look good on us.

653
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,030
Stop...

654
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,670
Shall I?

655
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,510
What do you think?

656
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,719
Does it not shine?

657
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,789
The daughter of a noble family...

658
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:48,400
is sucking up to courtesans.

659
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,300
What did I tell you?

660
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
She may look fine on the outside,

661
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,039
but her life is doomed.

662
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,369
You are right. I heard
she received bridal gifts once already.

663
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,570
Goodness.

664
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:01,510
What did you say?

665
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,610
- What did you just say?
- What?

666
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,079
What did you just say?

667
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,519
Tell me. What did you say?

668
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:08,519
You punk.

669
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:11,250
How dare you yell at me
when you lost the bronzeware?

670
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,989
What? You punk.

671
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,219
- Stop.
- Let go.

672
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,960
- That is enough.
- Stop it.

673
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,559
I will buy them.

674
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,829
How much do you want?

675
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:21,260
Rather than that,

676
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,630
I heard the Qing envoys
visit this courtesan house often.

677
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,699
By any chance,

678
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,099
have you heard anything they said?

679
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,510
I did overhear the Joseon interpreters.

680
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:37,050
I do not want to be flogged
after saying stuff like that.

681
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,250
(Chidogon: a round stick
that was used to punish thieves)

682
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,519
I promise
that this will not hurt you in any way.

683
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,489
I just want to know what kind of items...

684
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:45,920
they want to buy.

685
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,239
Is doing business
with the intruders highly profitable?

686
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,039
Of course.

687
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,380
But it does require
a tiny amount of effort.

688
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,210
"A tiny amount of effort?"

689
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,909
First,

690
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,050
you need to find owners of fields...

691
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,250
who do not have workers.

692
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:17,150
They will be happy
as long as their crops do not rot,

693
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,250
and I...

694
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,519
will be happy to buy stuff
at a cheap price.

695
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:24,059
If you do not harvest the ginger now,
it will rot.

696
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,059
Why are you not harvesting the ginger?

697
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,360
All of my kids died...

698
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,329
because of the war.

699
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,170
I do not even have workers,
so everything is about to rot.

700
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:36,539
If you need ginger, you can take them...

701
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,340
and pay me however you want.

702
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,840
My workers
will harvest everything for you.

703
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,210
I will pay you for the ginger.

704
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,650
But...

705
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,019
you have to sell all the ginger you have.

706
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,960
He is not buying any ginger.

707
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,500
What do you want to buy?

708
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,670
Dried ginger...

709
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,940
I do not have any.

710
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,099
I want to sell it.

711
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,269
"Sell?"

712
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,440
I do not know if they will be worth much.

713
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,679
So how much
are you going to sell them for?

714
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:23,320
Before, this container
was full of dried ginger.

715
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,150
Why do I not see any today?
By any chance...

716
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,159
My lady!

717
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,860
The Qing people are buying ginger.

718
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,059
The ginger everywhere else is sold out,
so the seller gets to set the price.

719
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:37,269
They are buying everything, even if
the price is tripled and quintupled.

720
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:44,909
The rice is here!

721
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:47,079
Oh, my gosh!

722
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,840
- Rice.
- Goodness.

723
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,210
- Give it to us.
- It is rice.

724
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,409
Can you put it over here?

725
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,550
- It is rice.
- It is rice.

726
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,090
- How precious.
- My goodness.

727
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,389
I made a mistake and only earned enough
for three straw bags.

728
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,489
So instead of the half that I promised,
I will share all the rice...

729
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,730
with you all.

730
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,199
- Goodness.
- Go ahead.

731
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,260
You may go first.

732
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:21,010
With two sets of bronze bowls,
I earned three straw bags worth of rice.

733
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:24,010
I know it is different from the amount
that I promised at first,

734
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,719
but are any of you
willing to trust me once again...

735
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,619
and work with me?

736
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,320
You said you would get at least
half a bag of the rice,

737
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,159
- but we barely got this...
- Well,

738
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:42,260
it has been so long
since I have seen white rice.

739
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,530
If you will have us,
I will work diligently.

740
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,599
Me too.

741
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,769
- Please hire me too.
- Me too.

742
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:50,909
- Me too.
- Me too.

743
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,710
I will do it too.

744
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,909
Please hire me.

745
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,909
Thank you.

746
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,500
Take your time and look at them.

747
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
What do you think?

748
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,969
Would it not come in handy
when you are faced with danger?

749
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:27,809
- My goodness.
- Let me wear the ring too.

750
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,409
This hairpin is...

751
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,349
It is pretty.

752
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:37,119
- Let me try it on.
- Yes.

753
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,590
That belongs here.

754
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,889
That goes here.

755
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,590
That goes there.

756
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,199
The beans belong here.

757
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,130
Thank you.

758
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,269
Thank you, My lady.

759
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,670
Thank you.

760
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:59,570
Goodness.

761
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,179
Next.

762
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,449
Goodness.

763
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,809
Eat a lot, Father.

764
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,920
You too, Je Nam.

765
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:09,619
Chew well and eat a lot.

766
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,750
- Okay.
- Eat a lot. We have got a lot of rice.

767
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,489
You want meat?

768
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,989
Here it comes.

769
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,860
Is it good?

770
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,400
Eat more meat.

771
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,000
Meat.

772
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,639
These ornamental knives'
sleek lines are top-notch,

773
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,369
and the colors are truly elegant.

774
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:31,809
They are neither too flashy nor too dull.

775
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,440
But that is not all.

776
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:36,440
We have also designed them to allow for
a quick draw of the blade from the hilt,

777
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,980
although, of course, it would be
preferable not to have to draw it at all.

778
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,420
What do you think?

779
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,820
Are they not incomparable to other knives?

780
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,820
Yes, they are excellent.

781
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,019
This is a reply from my husband.

782
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,170
If you ask me to go back to being
an envoy and ask me again...

783
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,940
to kneel before the foreign intruders,

784
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,369
I will probably refuse once more.

785
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,010
I said to His Highness...

786
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:09,139
that being righteous
is the only way to save Joseon.

787
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,650
If I were to bow to
the foreign intruders for my own sake,

788
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,480
who would be moved by my actions...

789
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,920
to change the world?

790
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,190
It is not an act of defiance
against Your Highness,

791
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,789
but rather following
a greater sense of loyalty.

792
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,730
So, I shall patiently await the time
when I can fulfill my greater loyalty,

793
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,800
my "time of sainthood,"
even if it means enduring exile.

794
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,239
"Time of sainthood."

795
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:41,679
My lord.

796
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,909
I wish to provide
ink and paper to the scholars...

797
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,050
studying at the school.

798
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,179
Will you accept them?

799
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,320
Are you trying to win my favor...

800
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,420
with material wealth?

801
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,460
Would I ever do such a thing?

802
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,989
In the past,
my father and Eun Ae's father...

803
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,960
established a small school
where they taught young students.

804
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,800
Even Officer Nam studied there.

805
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,170
During these tumultuous times,
Eun Ae's father passed away,

806
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:11,369
and my father is
not in his right mind anymore.

807
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,210
We can no longer hear...

808
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,449
the gentle voices of the two men
who used to teach the students.

809
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,019
Seeing you and
the young students studying here,

810
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,719
it feels as if I am
seeing my father again.

811
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,690
The papers and inkstones are...

812
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,659
a token of my feelings for my father.

813
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,469
Please accept them.

814
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,280
These are all petitions asking...

815
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,050
for Nam Yeon Jun to be released.

816
00:56:57,219 --> 00:57:01,260
How can there suddenly be
so many pleas from all eight provinces?

817
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,159
Your Majesty.

818
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:06,130
Is this also the work of Jang Chul?

819
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,099
People spit at me,

820
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,570
saying I am the king who bowed down...

821
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,869
to the foreign intruders.

822
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,039
While they praise Jang Chul as a man...

823
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,679
who defied the foreign intruders strongly.

824
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,449
If I turn away from Jang Chul's wishes,

825
00:57:27,849 --> 00:57:29,579
he will surely say that
a great man cannot spread his wings...

826
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,119
because the world is a filthy place.

827
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,250
I told you, did I not?

828
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:42,119
You are more reliable than...

829
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:46,860
a few weak scholars.

830
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,929
Right.

831
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:51,900
Now look.

832
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:56,170
Witness how I provide for my people.

833
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:25,699
By the end of today, we need to forge...

834
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:27,469
ten daggers and twenty rakes.

835
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:30,510
I have asked for two barrels
of liquor and ten boiled chickens.

836
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,369
After the day's work,
we shall feast heartily!

837
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:33,409
- Okay.
- Okay.

838
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:35,739
Eat a lot.

839
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,250
We have alcohol too.

840
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:48,860
Thanks to your help,
I gained a large profit.

841
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,400
I know.

842
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,630
That you are still...

843
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,599
just a rat.

844
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,469
However,

845
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,050
you have proven to be quite useful,
so I will keep you by my side.

846
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,619
Do you want to hear the news
you have been dying to hear?

847
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,929
His Majesty will allow
the Crown Prince to visit Joseon soon.

848
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,630
Do not forget my hard work.

849
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,030
Do you understand?

850
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,690
Is it true...

851
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,989
that Khan allowed me to visit Joseon?

852
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,760
Can I visit my father...

853
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,130
at his chamber myself?

854
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:01,230
You sure can, Your Highness.

855
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,030
Your Highness.

856
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,710
Khan allowed the Crown Prince
to visit Joseon?

857
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:12,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

858
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,739
Upon hearing the news
that your health has deteriorated,

859
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,480
His Highness earnestly
asked him to visit his father,

860
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,750
and the men were impressed by his heart.

861
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,820
I told them numerous times
not to ask him to come...

862
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,489
since it is burdensome
for the Crown Prince to make a visit.

863
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,389
Darn you all!

864
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:34,800
If the Crown Prince comes,

865
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:38,599
his first son will have
to replace him in Simyang.

866
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,769
How can a young child
make that perilous journey?

867
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,110
His Highness is going to Joseon?

868
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,309
Are we going back too?

869
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,280
Then I will go there first.

870
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,590
Why?

871
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,719
The Usimjeong in Hanyang
has been left empty.

872
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,559
I will tidy it up...

873
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,260
and get the food ready.

874
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:05,929
What for?

875
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,730
No need for that fuss.

876
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:11,070
Who complains when
the food is not good enough?

877
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,469
They are not made from thin air.

878
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,469
While you are there,

879
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,309
please tell Gil Chae that I am coming.

880
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:26,750
She loves to look prim and fancy.

881
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,480
I should give her some time to doll up.

882
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,219
(Hanyang Brazier)

883
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,849
More beef, please!

884
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:07,559
My, the beef looks glossy.

885
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,360
This place always has good quality beef.

886
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,269
Please dig in.

887
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:34,579
Beef grilled over a brazier is delicious.

888
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:36,679
Please have more.

889
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:44,030
Do you know what the people
are saying about us?

890
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,659
Since we are often together,

891
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,030
they keep wondering
about our relationship.

892
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,269
How silly.

893
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,539
Who cares about what they say?

894
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:00,409
Madam. Please pack some beef for me.

895
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,679
Please help yourself.

896
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,340
And this sleeve.

897
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:04,909
Here, let me.

898
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,349
Here, Je Nam.

899
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,889
Chew properly, all right?

900
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,730
Did you eat with the officer again?

901
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:24,429
You embarrass me.

902
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,739
What is her problem?

903
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,199
Be careful of the intruders.

904
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,650
Father.

905
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:43,079
Are you reminded of back
when we lived in Neunggun-ri?

906
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,099
From now on,

907
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:03,800
I will protect you, Father.

908
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,880
I will take good care
of Young Chae and Je Nam.

909
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,219
Our little Je Nam.

910
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,860
I will dress him in fine clothes...

911
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,429
and see that he passes the state exam.

912
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,000
I will marry Young Chae off...

913
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:32,369
with a trunk full of accessories.

914
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,750
Why are you here?

915
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:58,489
Gil Chae.

916
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,829
Will you really...

917
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,699
fill my trunk with silk
before marrying me off?

918
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,869
Are you sure you want
your embarrassing sister's help?

919
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,400
I just do not like
people gossiping about you.

920
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,539
Tell them to go ahead.

921
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,679
Words will not kill me.

922
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,909
But an empty stomach will.

923
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,380
- Got it?
- Of course.

924
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:24,590
By the way,

925
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,320
do you not like the officer?

926
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,989
It seems like he likes you.

927
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,159
Hey.

928
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,130
Go to sleep.

929
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,969
Do you still think of that person?

930
01:06:45,409 --> 01:06:48,440
Stop thinking about a dead person.

931
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,320
I shall return with
the most beautiful pair of floral shoes.

932
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,929
Liar.

933
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:11,769
I made this as a sample.

934
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:15,039
You can put chopsticks
or an earpick in this dagger.

935
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:16,969
Or even a small pair of scissors.

936
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,710
It can cut fruits,

937
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,309
slice up herbs,

938
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:22,710
or even open chestnuts.

939
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,179
Is it used for eating only?

940
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:29,079
Well, I am not too familiar
with women's tools.

941
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:31,449
I...

942
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:33,590
I should have another bowl
of rice and soup.

943
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:35,960
- Madam.
- Yes?

944
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:37,989
- Another bowl of rice and soup.
- All right.

945
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:39,460
- A huge one, please.
- Sure.

946
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,900
I need to eat a lot to feel full.

947
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,230
When I am full, I can steel my mind.

948
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,539
When my mind is steeled,
I can then say what I want.

949
01:07:51,969 --> 01:07:53,340
Well, my lady.

950
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,980
Please marry me.

951
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,770
I apologize.

952
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:31,510
Sorry for laughing.

953
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,479
Sorry.

954
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,689
Hearing that again...

955
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,460
really brings back memories.

956
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,130
In the past,

957
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:51,529
men pestered me to marry them
whenever they saw me.

958
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,770
Those young Neunggun-ri men...

959
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,170
died and got injured in the war.

960
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:00,909
The others left Neunggun-ri.

961
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:06,750
I wonder where they are
and what they are up to.

962
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,250
My lady, I...

963
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,220
I will pretend I never heard that.

964
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,750
Do not feel embarrassed.

965
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,399
That man is dead already, is he not?

966
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:13,750
Lady Gil Chae.

967
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:16,850
Lee Jang Hyun has arrived.

968
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,760
Like this?

969
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:25,890
The other way.

970
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:29,060
- Like this?
- No, it is...

971
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,100
Jeez. Come on.

972
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,300
How frustrating.

973
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,399
Please do not come anymore.

974
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,069
I plan to try all kinds of delicacies,

975
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:14,909
and travel all around the country...

976
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:16,810
until I am 100 years old, you see.

977
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:25,220
Next time...

978
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,029
In the far, far away future...

979
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:37,729
Let us meet again.

980
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,390
I heard it was somewhere near here.

981
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:06,390
- Jang Hyun.
- Yes?

982
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,659
Do you think she got married?

983
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:10,399
Perhaps that could be true
if it were Young Master Yeon Jun,

984
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:12,600
but she could not have fallen in love
with another man in such a short time.

985
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,069
Not Lady Gil Chae.
I am talking about Jong Jong.

986
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:16,399
Darn it.

987
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,279
Come to think of it,

988
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:25,579
I feel bad saying this,
but this is for the best.

989
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,250
What?

990
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,180
If Lady Gil Chae had to live in poverty,

991
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:32,619
the rich Lee Jang Hyun
would not have left her mind.

992
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,260
If I show up,

993
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:40,930
she will want to run to me and hug me.

994
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,739
You have to react. Come on.

995
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:49,640
Buy bridal gifts!

996
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,109
Buy bridal gifts!

997
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,109
Buy bridal gifts!

998
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:58,350
I heard the new bride has a temper.

999
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:59,979
- Goodness. His voice...
- Watch your mouth.

1000
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,649
- is not powerful enough.
- "New bride?"

1001
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:03,850
I heard she already had marriage talks
with someone before.

1002
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:04,850
She is an old bride.

1003
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,189
- You are right.
- Buy bridal gifts!

1004
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:07,489
Let us go.

1005
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,590
Buy bridal gifts!

1006
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,430
Is no one going to buy this?

1007
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,170
Hurry inside.

1008
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:19,729
What?

1009
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,840
She is Madam Bang Doo, is she not?

1010
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,770
Gosh, I cannot go inside.

1011
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,270
Come on. Let us go inside.

1012
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,779
- I cannot.
- Why not?

1013
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,550
Maybe if I see the face of the bride...

1014
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,050
The bride is here.

1015
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,899
Why would the bride come out herself?

1016
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:56,300
I am here, so let us go inside.

1017
01:13:58,670 --> 01:13:59,710
Jong Jong.

1018
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:49,859
(My Dearest)

1019
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,409
Can you not live without a man?

1020
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,180
Is there something wrong with that?

1021
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:18,520
If you love men that much,
why did you not give me a chance?

1022
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,390
I thought you were dead.

1023
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:21,689
Come with me.

1024
01:15:21,689 --> 01:15:23,659
Did you ask Lady Gil Chae
to leave with you?

1025
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:26,789
He has already left me multiple times.

1026
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,659
But how can I trust him?

1027
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:30,229
It is not considered a crime
for a husband...

1028
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:31,930
to kill his wife
and the man she committed adultery with.

1029
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:34,100
You do not know what she means to me.

1030
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:37,000
What if people point their fingers at me
and call me names?

1031
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,470
It does not matter anymore.

1032
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,439
I do not care what you think either.

1033
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:44,180
I need you to be mine now.

1034
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:51,083
