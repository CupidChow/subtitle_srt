1
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:12,254
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,994
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:17,034
Jong Jong, let us do this.

4
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,034
Yes, my lady.

5
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:19,034
(Episode 2)

6
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,104
Here we go.

7
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:34,614
So...

8
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:37,984
even the woman who is supposed
to have 99 tails...

9
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:40,623
would not be that special.

10
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:45,393
Is he coming? Is he on the way?

11
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:50,793
He is coming.

12
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,033
Remember what I said?

13
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:56,363
It would be dangerous.

14
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:59,073
You can do it, Jong Jong. You can.

15
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:00,804
I am counting on you, Jong Jong.

16
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:34,004
(My Dearest)

17
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:44,653
Have you heard of the sound...

18
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,123
- of the marvel of Peru blooming?
- What are you doing?

19
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,763
What are you doing then?
I was helping you.

20
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:56,123
Who? Me?

21
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,793
When did I ask you to help me?

22
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,634
What?

23
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,373
Was there anyone
who was supposed to receive you?

24
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:05,703
Of course, I...

25
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,254
You are a lucky man.

26
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:23,823
What? I am a lucky man?

27
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,953
I am the lucky one? Not you?

28
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,393
You got to talk to me for a long time
on the first day we met.

29
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,564
You sure are lucky.

30
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,793
Anyway, I do not know
where you rolled in from,

31
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,164
but you can hurry up and get lost.

32
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,733
You have used up all your luck.

33
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:40,844
Should you not at least thank me for...

34
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:42,844
I am talking here.

35
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,543
You call that fixed?

36
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,944
I am hugely disappointed, young master.

37
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,344
I said it is not fixed properly yet.

38
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,983
I will get it fixed again.

39
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,784
It would not happen again.

40
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:00,793
Darn it.
You should have done a better job.

41
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:02,224
Do it right, will you?

42
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,194
- Dae Ho.
- Gosh.

43
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:08,034
She is one loud flower, is she not?

44
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,634
Give it to me.

45
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,634
Flower?

46
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,504
Who is the flower?

47
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:18,073
Who is the marvel of Peru?

48
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:19,944
Gosh.

49
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:34,323
My lady.

50
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,703
They must be talking about
something boring again.

51
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,034
Let us get back.

52
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,173
I do not like the socks after all.

53
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,143
What?

54
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,444
There she goes.

55
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,013
- I should go and talk to her.
- Wait.

56
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:04,823
Why does she...

57
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:06,994
look so down?

58
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:08,823
She was grouchy just a moment ago.

59
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,363
Right. She looks like...

60
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,194
she wants to get slapped
in the face and cry.

61
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:14,233
- What?
- Or maybe it is the opposite.

62
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,733
Maybe she wants to slap someone
in the face and make that person cry.

63
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,603
What are you saying?

64
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,103
Do you hear yourself?

65
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,013
Look.

66
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,314
It is me.

67
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,194
Why is he so worked up?

68
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:50,504
Look.

69
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,734
About that lady who lives here.

70
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,073
There are too many ladies in Neunggun-ri.

71
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:59,314
There is the lady who acts all conceited
thinking that she is pretty.

72
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,213
Right. You mean Lady Gil Chae.

73
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,513
That is her.

74
00:05:04,614 --> 00:05:05,614
Wait. Her name is...

75
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,184
- Gil Chae?
- Yes.

76
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,054
Yoo Gil Chae.

77
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,023
Lord Yoo Kyo Yeon's daughter.

78
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,124
She has broken many hearts.

79
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,234
Oh, I see.

80
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,893
I suppose you are one of them.

81
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,403
"Oh, I see?"

82
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,804
Hey, you.

83
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:25,374
"I see?" What do you see?

84
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,143
He has fallen head over heels
for Lady Gil Chae.

85
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,573
Clearly,

86
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:35,583
even Young Master Jang Hyun
could not help but fall for her charms.

87
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,653
Why are you laughing?

88
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,023
Why do you keep giggling like that?

89
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,294
What do you mean
I could not help but fall for her?

90
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,934
He took care of what he had to do
and returned home.

91
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,494
"Oh, my."

92
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:55,804
"Let me undress you."

93
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:57,973
Goodness. That old man.

94
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:01,544
He has to make me cringe every day,
does he not?

95
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,273
- Mind your own business.
- What?

96
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,874
- The two of them...
- Hey.

97
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:10,854
Stop sewing and go find out
what is going on with my application.

98
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:13,153
They do not want you.

99
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,823
Must you be so stubborn?

100
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,723
You handed in a blank exam paper.
Have you no shame?

101
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,494
You said you were embarrassed of me
for not attending school!

102
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,833
Also,

103
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,833
did you not hear what that fox said?
Gil Chae or whatever her name is.

104
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,134
She said I rolled in out of nowhere...

105
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,143
and told me to hurry up and get lost.

106
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:42,643
Then I shall settle down in this village.

107
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:52,554
You will triple the value of
dried persimmons and pay us with rice...

108
00:06:52,723 --> 00:06:54,393
in return for accepting him
into our school?

109
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:55,893
Yes.

110
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,064
Such insolence!

111
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:58,994
The harvest barn may be empty,

112
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,403
but did you truly think
we would take a bribe and accept him?

113
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,773
Well... I apologize.

114
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:11,273
You have too much rice
and do not know what to do with it?

115
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,583
It is not like
you can throw away the rice.

116
00:07:15,244 --> 00:07:16,314
I suppose...

117
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:17,953
we should just accept it.

118
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,684
You made a wise decision.

119
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:25,153
I must ask you.

120
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:28,864
Why are you so adamant
about joining our school?

121
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,033
If you wish to pass the state exam,

122
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:33,634
there are more reputable schools.

123
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:35,763
I have no interest
in taking the state exam.

124
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:37,903
However,

125
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,674
I have a favor to ask of you.

126
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:41,944
What?

127
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,273
Another one?

128
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,143
What did I say?

129
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,384
I told you that
he must have an ulterior motive.

130
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,013
You must know Grandpa Song Chu.

131
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,984
This December marks
his 60th wedding anniversary.

132
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,783
I wish to organize a party to celebrate
his 60th wedding anniversary.

133
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:58,294
(Hoehonrye:
A 60th wedding anniversary party)

134
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,023
All his life, he farmed
on plots of land owned by the school,

135
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,294
so would it be okay
if the party took place here?

136
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,263
Oh. Of course,

137
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:11,304
I understand that only noble families
host 60th wedding anniversary parties,

138
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,573
so Grandpa Song Chu
should not be allowed to do it, but...

139
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:16,444
Grandpa Song Chu has been married
for 60 years already?

140
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:18,744
I heard his wife was older than him.

141
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,184
Grandma Yi Rang is older than him?

142
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,413
She looks young.

143
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,114
Did you hear the rumors?

144
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,283
Every night, they still...

145
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,554
Stop! That is utter nonsense.

146
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:30,854
Is that true?

147
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:37,333
Anyway,

148
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,934
why would you organize the party for him?

149
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:43,504
Since he works for us,

150
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,004
we should be the ones organizing it.

151
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,673
It is true that only noble families can
host wedding anniversary parties, but...

152
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:50,074
They say...

153
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:54,543
courtesy comes from affection.

154
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,183
"Courtesy comes from affection?"

155
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:04,094
Do you not think that this village
is filled with the scent of bamboo?

156
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,364
My goodness!

157
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,533
Were you...

158
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,204
waiting for me?

159
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,344
What?

160
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,344
No. I was at the school,
taking care of something...

161
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,574
Do not give me that.

162
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:28,643
How did you know
that I would pass by here?

163
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:30,884
Look.

164
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,084
What is the matter with you?

165
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:34,954
I...

166
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,254
was not waiting for you.

167
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,293
I was simply going my way.

168
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,263
I was just walking this path,

169
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:42,994
looking ahead...

170
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,234
Of course, you were.

171
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,964
That is what every man says.

172
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,803
Goodness.
You are using an obvious pickup line...

173
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,433
that On Dal the Idiot probably used
a thousand years ago.

174
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:53,704
In any case...

175
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:54,903
Please excuse me. I have to go.

176
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:58,974
"On Dal the Idiot?"

177
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:00,844
"Pickup line?"

178
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:02,943
Gosh, I am at a loss for words.

179
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,813
I have been at a loss for words all day!

180
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,303
My lady.

181
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,013
I am sorry to say this,

182
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,773
but women cannot enter
the school premises...

183
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:35,543
Do not be so square.

184
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,884
I can never win with you.

185
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,193
Do not do that.

186
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:55,004
What you did just now.

187
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,974
If you have feelings for me,
do not push them aside.

188
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,574
You smiled at me earlier in the day.

189
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:09,043
I know very well...

190
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,254
what that smile meant.

191
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,523
Yes.

192
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:18,624
I could not help but smile
at the sight of you.

193
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,594
Who would not smile?

194
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:22,393
Young Master.

195
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:23,864
You can have...

196
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,964
any man you want.

197
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,033
However,

198
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,334
I am the only one Lady Eun Ae has.

199
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:00,834
Geun Sam said this to me in the past.

200
00:12:01,563 --> 00:12:03,504
"You can live without me,"

201
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,374
"but Yak Soon cannot live without me."

202
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,974
Then he dumped me and went to Yak Soon.

203
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:12,714
You know, when men say things like that,

204
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,513
they actually feel...

205
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,084
I had become too complacent.

206
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,954
I know nothing about Young Master Yeon Jun
who lived in Hanyang for years.

207
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:24,324
Think about it.

208
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,494
The scholars at Sungkyunkwan will go on...

209
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:29,724
to closely assist His Majesty
once they pass the exam,

210
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,994
so matchmakers
must be eyeing them like hawks.

211
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,204
I need help.

212
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,433
From someone who is worldly-wise...

213
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:40,574
and well-versed in the sophisticated
tastes of the people in Hanyang.

214
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:47,413
My gosh!

215
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:48,984
That is absurd!

216
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,614
No way. That cannot happen.

217
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:53,714
What is the matter?

218
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,884
Even if he is worldly-wise...

219
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:58,393
and extremely knowledgeable...

220
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,153
and knows a lot about Hanyang,

221
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:03,293
I cannot accept help from a fool
who does not wish to get married.

222
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,143
Look. I swear, I was not waiting for you,

223
00:13:15,143 --> 00:13:16,273
so do not get the wrong idea...

224
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,474
No.

225
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,013
This is Grandpa Song Chu's house.

226
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,783
Were you waiting for me here?

227
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:30,523
If you wish to spend more time with me,

228
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,494
I shall grant you a chance.

229
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:50,874
Help me, will you?

230
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:55,783
Do I have to? Why would I help you?

231
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:56,984
Because...

232
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:59,783
I know you are dying to attend the school,

233
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:01,153
and my father teaches there.

234
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,653
The thing is,
I have already been accepted.

235
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:08,824
I heard you bribed them.

236
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:10,563
I already know all about it.

237
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,163
If you help me this time,

238
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,263
I will help you too.

239
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:26,244
Come here.

240
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,344
Please come closer.

241
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,324
I will tell you the topic
of the upcoming exam.

242
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:55,074
Will you truly...

243
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:01,084
tell me the next exam topic?

244
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,643
Yes, you have my word.

245
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:06,813
I heard you handed in an empty exam paper.

246
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:11,094
That is why people call you
a fake aristocrat.

247
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:17,063
But what help do you want to receive
from me in return?

248
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,574
Though I was born
and raised in Neunggun-ri,

249
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,273
this village does not suit me.

250
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:32,813
I should live in a place
that is more glamorous and great.

251
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:34,074
Such as...

252
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:36,244
Hanyang?

253
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,224
So I am curious about life in Hanyang.

254
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:43,553
I want to know
what Hanyang people talk about,

255
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:46,023
what kind of clothes they wear,
and what they like.

256
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:48,594
Also, what kind of people
they find attractive...

257
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:51,163
and want to date.

258
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,134
But why do you want
to receive help from me...

259
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,504
when you think I'm a womanizer?

260
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,543
I had poor judgment.

261
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,974
I thought you were approaching me...

262
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,844
with indecent desires, so I was vigilant.

263
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,783
But I heard you were...

264
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,344
a misogamist or whatever.

265
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,214
- Yes.
- Then everything is okay.

266
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:16,384
Then there is nothing between us.

267
00:16:17,153 --> 00:16:19,354
There is no way we will ever get married,

268
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,263
so we are not a man and a woman.

269
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,763
I mean, I am a woman,

270
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,533
but you do not see me as one.

271
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,763
And you are a man,

272
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,063
but I do not see you as one.

273
00:16:30,604 --> 00:16:31,634
We are just...

274
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:34,643
a stone...

275
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,474
or weed to each other.

276
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:44,513
That is why we can help each other
without hesitation.

277
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,484
You will help me, right?

278
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,614
- Take care.
- Thank you.

279
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,554
- Welcome.
- Have a look.

280
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:24,923
Have a look.

281
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:29,864
- Please, try one.
- We have what you will like.

282
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:31,963
Welcome.

283
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:35,134
These days,

284
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:39,233
it is the trend to wear socks
that are smaller than your feet.

285
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:40,834
I see.

286
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,243
Right. Also,

287
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,243
the daughters
of the ministers in Hanyang...

288
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,314
This type of color is...

289
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:52,014
I knew it. I was thinking
it would look good on me.

290
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,514
They hate this color.

291
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,294
They use this type of rouge.

292
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,864
Right.

293
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:16,804
These are the storybooks most liked
by the Hanyang people.

294
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:21,584
They contain the ambitions and hopes
of the people of Hanyang.

295
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:27,824
- Take a look.
- Okay.

296
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,594
"The Story of Woon Yeong?"

297
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,663
It is a written account
of what a scholar heard...

298
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,364
after meeting a woman
named Woon Yeong in his dream.

299
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:41,564
His dream?

300
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:44,774
To be honest,

301
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:49,003
I also dream a vivid dream sometimes.

302
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,544
Sometimes, the dream feels real.

303
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:57,384
The man...

304
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:03,723
What are you doing right now?

305
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:21,643
What is wrong with you?

306
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:27,784
Get changed.

307
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:32,814
We will be going to a place where women
of a high class are not allowed.

308
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:35,554
Let me see. Will this...

309
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,854
fit on you? Here.

310
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:41,794
Are you telling me
to wear a man's clothes?

311
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,794
Do you not want to live in Hanyang?

312
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,134
There.

313
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,703
No.

314
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,604
I said lift it up and then wrap it around.

315
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:56,804
Like this?

316
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,673
The other way.

317
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,213
- Like this?
- No.

318
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:04,243
Jeez. Come on.

319
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:06,384
How frustrating.

320
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,084
Sit over here.

321
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,253
Are you still not done?

322
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,764
I am done.

323
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:58,634
If I were born a man,
I would have been quite handsome.

324
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,173
That is right.

325
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:13,673
Ryang Eum, when are you coming out?

326
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:16,284
- Hurry up.
- Look.

327
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,153
- Hey, look.
- It is Ryang Eum.

328
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,554
- It is Ryang Eum.
- It is Ryang Eum.

329
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:21,584
- It is Ryang Eum!
- It is Ryang Eum!

330
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:23,124
- Ryang Eum.
- Ryang Eum.

331
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:25,824
Who is Ryang Eum?

332
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,794
Consider yourself lucky.

333
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:32,764
You will be hearing the voice
of the best singer in Joseon.

334
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:37,534
You can only hear
a voice like his in Hanyang.

335
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:40,473
Ryang Eum will be making
a special appearance today.

336
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:41,903
But...

337
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:45,643
you just attend flower festivals
in Neunggun-ri.

338
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,284
I am not sure
if you will have a discerning ear.

339
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:12,673
<i>I am looking from afar</i>

340
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:21,143
<i>At your endearing face</i>

341
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:26,453
<i>The face that I missed</i>

342
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:30,683
<i>Was carried</i>

343
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:38,463
<i>By the distant wind</i>

344
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:46,134
<i>You are like me</i>

345
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:55,384
<i>Burying your face in your hands</i>

346
00:23:56,544 --> 00:24:00,554
<i>The moment</i>

347
00:24:00,683 --> 00:24:04,653
<i>I was waiting for</i>

348
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:12,933
<i>Walk on that path</i>

349
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:21,844
<i>Even when you waver</i>

350
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:28,344
<i>In the moonlight</i>

351
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:29,614
Are you crying?

352
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:34,483
<i>I keep</i>

353
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:38,453
<i>Thinking of you</i>

354
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:47,064
<i>But you turn away</i>

355
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:51,804
<i>My lingering feelings</i>

356
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:55,743
<i>Will be dropped</i>

357
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:59,314
<i>One drop at a time</i>

358
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:04,584
<i>With the passing of time</i>

359
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:12,493
<i>This heart that loves you</i>

360
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:17,663
<i>I will only keep it</i>

361
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:21,634
<i>In my heart</i>

362
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,524
How beautiful.

363
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,134
He is indeed the best singer.

364
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:55,104
I love it.

365
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,764
I truly love it.

366
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,774
I have never heard of something
this beautiful in my life.

367
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:24,264
He is indeed the best singer.

368
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:27,233
Let us get going.

369
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:34,104
Ryang Eum!

370
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,294
What is that dream about?

371
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:58,693
What?

372
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:01,634
You said you sometimes have
the most vivid dream.

373
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:05,334
Well, that is...

374
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:09,874
It is nothing.

375
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:11,614
What?

376
00:27:30,193 --> 00:27:32,233
I guess the rumor is true.

377
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,064
You are here alone with me.

378
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:37,163
And yet you are
neither flushing nor stammering.

379
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:41,074
The rumor goes that
you do not believe in marriage...

380
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:42,774
because you are
unable to function as a man.

381
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:46,443
What?

382
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:56,483
Is it wrong?

383
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,183
There is no way.

384
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,334
What is so funny?

385
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:15,403
It is nothing.

386
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:17,903
Let us go back now.

387
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,384
My lady.

388
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:30,284
The men you have dated so far...

389
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:32,324
must be the timid and naive scholars...

390
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,493
who spent their whole lives
studying at school.

391
00:28:38,024 --> 00:28:39,764
So one glance from you...

392
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:42,834
must have made them over the moon.

393
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,274
But my lady,

394
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,104
I am not them.

395
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:56,784
Well.

396
00:28:58,044 --> 00:28:59,284
You will find out soon enough.

397
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,493
What is wrong?

398
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:13,864
Do I suddenly look like a man,

399
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,864
not just some weed or rock?

400
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:33,054
Here. Take this.

401
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:41,864
Your clothes.

402
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:46,433
When should I return them to you?

403
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,604
Tomorrow, I leave on a journey
to trade persimmons for rice.

404
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:51,933
It will take a few months.

405
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:54,574
Then I will see you off tomorrow.

406
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,473
I have to return the clothes anyway.

407
00:29:57,903 --> 00:29:59,044
That sounds good.

408
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,384
What am I thinking?

409
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:41,036
(Moonlight on pear blossoms,
my beloved in my heart)

410
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:44,606
"My beloved in my heart?"

411
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,316
What is that, My lady?

412
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:54,046
A lady must have given it to him.

413
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,417
Why would he carelessly place
an item like this?

414
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,356
What am I expecting from a man like that?

415
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,497
My Lady.

416
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,856
Yeon Jun is in the reception room.

417
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,427
My lady cannot come.

418
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:36,957
The young masters have come.

419
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:50,636
Let us go.

420
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:58,247
I will submit the appeal as it is.

421
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,586
I will read it.

422
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,086
Look how dashing Yeon Jun is.

423
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,386
What am I thinking when I have him?

424
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,396
At a time when the foreign intruder is
proclaiming himself as the emperor,

425
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,626
if we, the nation of propriety,
do not take action,

426
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:15,267
we will be no different from those beasts,

427
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:18,136
and we will end up
losing the trust of our people.

428
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,167
So we implore His Majesty...

429
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,836
to prepare a plan to fight.

430
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:32,987
Your Majesty.

431
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,356
Your Majesty, in all eight provinces,
there have been numerous petitions...

432
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:38,086
requesting to confront
and fight against the foreign invaders.

433
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,157
What is the purpose of sending an envoy
to investigate their intentions?

434
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:44,197
If we do not send envoys now,

435
00:33:44,657 --> 00:33:47,767
they will use it as an excuse
to bring their troops and attack.

436
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:49,267
All right, then.

437
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:51,396
We should send a letter,
reprimanding them...

438
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:55,576
for failing to fulfill the promise
they made in the Year of Jeongmyo.

439
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,876
Once we lose the trust of the people,
it is hard to gain it back.

440
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,247
Do you not know that that is a far graver
problem than the foreign intruders?

441
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,757
Your Majesty.

442
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:15,596
Sending a letter to Great Jin
to urge them to keep...

443
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,027
the promise of the Year of Jeongmyo...

444
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:18,867
will ruin everything.

445
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:22,996
I am aware. Of course, I know that.

446
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,206
However,

447
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,537
I started the coup to punish Gwanghae...

448
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:30,237
for being friendly with those outlanders.

449
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,507
So if I try to curry favor
with Great Jin now,

450
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:37,046
how will the young officers
and scholars react?

451
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:40,717
You do not have to listen to everything
that the young officers are saying.

452
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:43,887
Perhaps,

453
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:47,387
a war with them is unavoidable.

454
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,327
I still vividly remember the pain
of having to flee to Ganghwa Island...

455
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,867
ten years ago.

456
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,468
(Pacheon: When a king evacuates
the palace and flees during a war)

457
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:05,607
They want to conquer Anju no matter what.

458
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:06,678
(Anju: A military strongpoint
in Pyongan Province)

459
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:09,047
Collect the supplies in the storage
and distribute them...

460
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,417
among the soldiers.

461
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:13,288
Then send the rest to the fortress
north of the Chongchon River...

462
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:14,917
so that we can be prepared
for their attack.

463
00:35:16,888 --> 00:35:19,758
We have been preparing for another
invasion since the Year of Jeongmyo,

464
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:22,198
so we must count on them.

465
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,468
Even if all fails,

466
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,368
we still have Ganghwa Island.

467
00:35:34,937 --> 00:35:38,008
(Simyang Palace, Qing)

468
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:02,897
Your Majesty.

469
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,408
The King of Joseon is hiring
military officials to prepare for war.

470
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,868
He ordered to tighten security
at each fortress...

471
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:09,377
and to send cannons and food
to Ganghwa Island.

472
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:12,408
They always have nothing to count on
but Ganghwa Island.

473
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:15,647
However, Your Majesty.

474
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:18,848
Joseon may be a small country,
but when it was Goguryeo,

475
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,317
its army managed
to fight off Sui's one million soldiers...

476
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,388
and eventually won
the seven-year war with Japan.

477
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:28,727
And that is why we could not go in deep
in the Year of Jeongmyo.

478
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:31,297
I am aware.

479
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:34,127
Joseon may be small
but should not be underestimated.

480
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:40,267
Hence, we must find
a different way this time.

481
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:42,738
I...

482
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:45,808
can wait.

483
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:49,917
I waited until my father finally
looked at me and not my seven brothers.

484
00:36:50,718 --> 00:36:52,417
Then after I took the throne,

485
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:55,317
I waited for my brothers to accept
and acknowledge me as their king.

486
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:56,788
Now,

487
00:36:58,058 --> 00:37:00,058
I can and shall wait
until Joseon's rivers freeze.

488
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:02,397
My patience...

489
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,167
has never once betrayed me.

490
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:12,107
Do you know how to revive
someone who is starving to death?

491
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,837
Feeding them grains first
will shock the stomach.

492
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:18,747
Then they will vomit and actually die.

493
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:21,578
Hence, you must give them
a bowl of poop water first.

494
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:24,047
Aged poop water.

495
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,047
(Uiju)

496
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,817
When they no longer look so pale,

497
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:30,187
that is when you give them rice porridge.
That is how you revive them.

498
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,587
That scumbag!

499
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:35,528
He came back to life thanks to my poop.

500
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:36,698
So how dare he...

501
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:39,868
report me to steal my business?

502
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:44,337
So? Are you asking me
to spank Kkeut Soe's butt or something?

503
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,308
That will not do.

504
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:49,738
I will kill him.

505
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,468
- No.
- No?

506
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,198
Why not? Why can I not do it?

507
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,738
Have I been paying bribes
to get treated like this?

508
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:19,567
Kkeut Soe pays bribes too.
He pays more than you do.

509
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:24,008
Do you have proof that Kkeut Soe
was the one who reported you?

510
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:26,408
Tsueda said...

511
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:28,408
You fool.

512
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,718
You believe Tsueda?

513
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:32,917
Do you look down on me?

514
00:38:33,488 --> 00:38:36,218
Do you think
I am still a mere wandering Jurchen?

515
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,468
Ningguchin.

516
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:48,368
Do not forget.

517
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:50,138
You are...

518
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:54,238
only allowed to play
in a small puddle of poop that I give you.

519
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:57,638
You scumbag!

520
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:06,788
Please leave.

521
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:16,258
So? Whose side will he take,
between Ningguchin and Kkeut Soe?

522
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:17,828
I do not know.

523
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:31,678
I will take 100 geun of this.

524
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:35,817
I will pay you with ten boxes of
top-quality persimmons from Neunggun-ri.

525
00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:38,848
Ten boxes of persimmons
for a hundred geun of tobacco?

526
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,817
My goodness.
That cannot be done. Not even you.

527
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:43,917
Instead,

528
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:49,028
I will sell the piles
of old tobacco in that room for you.

529
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:52,328
I heard when you crossed the river
to sell tobacco,

530
00:39:52,328 --> 00:39:54,828
they took everything
and did not even pay you.

531
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,138
Will you truly sell them for me?

532
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,707
What do you plan to do
with all the tobacco?

533
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:03,538
I will exchange them with the rice
I sent to Neunggun-ri.

534
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:06,607
We have a problem! It is an emergency.

535
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:08,917
Jang Hyun.

536
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,118
Tsueda has been stabbed.

537
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,388
- My goodness.
- Gosh, what do we do?

538
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:18,928
- Oh, dear.
- What happened?

539
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:21,227
- Goodness.
- Who did this?

540
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:23,497
- Oh, boy.
- Is he dead or not?

541
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:24,528
He is dead.

542
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:27,067
- My goodness.
- I have no idea what happened.

543
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,667
What on earth happened?

544
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:29,897
- No idea.
- My goodness.

545
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:41,808
Gosh, who are they?

546
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,558
Move!

547
00:40:52,587 --> 00:40:54,388
Boss wants to get to the bottom of this,

548
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:56,698
so watch what you say today.

549
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:58,227
- Move!
- Make way!

550
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,238
It is nice to see Joseon fools,

551
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:13,147
Jurchen fools,

552
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:17,578
and even fools from Tsushima Island
in one place after a long time.

553
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,288
So Tsueda is dead.

554
00:41:24,517 --> 00:41:27,227
For people like us,
even if we die a sudden death,

555
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,098
we should be grateful if it was painless.

556
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,468
But in Uiju,

557
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:37,397
there should not be a single
stabbing incident I do not know about.

558
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:41,538
A few days ago, Tsueda sent me a letter,

559
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:42,977
saying he urgently needed to speak to me.

560
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:43,977
But...

561
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:46,808
he died on his way to meet me.

562
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:47,877
Someone...

563
00:41:48,908 --> 00:41:50,917
killed him to silence him.

564
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:55,247
I bet it was done by those
who are after my business.

565
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:59,888
You think someone is after your business?
How petty.

566
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:03,797
You siphon off rice collected as tax.
You call that a business?

567
00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,198
(Segokmi: Rice collected as tax)

568
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,297
To siphon off the rice,

569
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,667
you have to bribe
so many government officials...

570
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,598
from bottom to top.

571
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:14,607
We work very hard to bribe them...

572
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:17,808
and keep them on our side.
All you do is use them.

573
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:19,948
But you want us out
because it is your business?

574
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:21,408
I knew it!

575
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,877
That is why you reported me!

576
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:27,488
And you killed Tsueda to silence him!

577
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:28,647
Do you have evidence?

578
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:33,328
If one of you...

579
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,258
killed Tsueda,

580
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:38,727
I will finish you off with my own hands.

581
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:47,937
We should take care of it
before Kkeut Soe beats us to it.

582
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:17,937
Darn it.

583
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:19,767
You scumbag.

584
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:21,738
Darn you.

585
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:24,178
Do you think you can get away with this?

586
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:28,607
You little rat!

587
00:43:30,118 --> 00:43:32,317
You know many Joseon swear words.

588
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:35,417
Let me ask you something.

589
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:38,917
Do you think the foreign intruders
will invade Joseon?

590
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:40,357
What?

591
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:42,457
Why are you asking me this?

592
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,198
- Why would you ask me...
- What do you think?

593
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:46,897
I am asking you
because you are one of them.

594
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:51,038
You see, those intruders from Qing...

595
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:53,707
used to consider Joseon
as their elder brother.

596
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:56,607
But now that they think
they have become powerful,

597
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,607
they are vying for a chance
to invade their elder brother.

598
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:00,547
What do you think?

599
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:04,017
It is just like what you are doing.

600
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:10,288
What?

601
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:16,227
You said you would attack Kkeut Soe,

602
00:44:16,227 --> 00:44:18,328
but in reality,
you joined hands with him...

603
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:23,868
and tried to kill Yang Chun.
Did you think I would not know that?

604
00:44:26,308 --> 00:44:27,437
But...

605
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,837
after Tsueda,

606
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,448
your middleman, died,

607
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:36,848
your friendship went down the drain.

608
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,388
- That is what I am saying.
- No.

609
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:41,517
I...

610
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:43,718
said no.

611
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:45,788
It was Kkeut Soe's...

612
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:48,227
idea. Yes.

613
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:04,408
Do not trust him.

614
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:06,377
I said no.

615
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:09,247
It was all his doing!

616
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,477
You punk!

617
00:45:10,517 --> 00:45:12,848
Shut your mouth!

618
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:14,547
Shut it, you punk!

619
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:16,258
You look like a webfoot octopus!

620
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:18,988
I hated you from the start.

621
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:21,288
You little scum!

622
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:25,028
You do not deserve to live, you...

623
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:29,538
Right.

624
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,138
Your henchmen will be here.

625
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:32,738
What?

626
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:33,908
Spare me, please.

627
00:45:35,308 --> 00:45:36,377
Please.

628
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:38,837
Do not worry. I called your henchmen too.

629
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:41,408
They said they would kill Ningguchin.

630
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,917
Since you two are enemies now,

631
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:46,948
fight with all your might.

632
00:45:52,118 --> 00:45:53,388
Hey, Gu Jam, they are coming.

633
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:57,797
Where are you?

634
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,058
(Usimjeong)

635
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:39,808
Did you not get hurt?
You went through a lot.

636
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:41,337
No, he did not.

637
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:44,008
He just moved his mouth.
He did not do anything...

638
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:45,778
Where is Yang Chun?

639
00:47:05,428 --> 00:47:06,528
You are here.

640
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:09,968
Please spare me, Yang Chun.

641
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,207
Please spare me!

642
00:47:17,937 --> 00:47:19,038
Do you know...

643
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:20,477
how to dance?

644
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:21,707
Sorry?

645
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:24,017
"Dance?"

646
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:42,067
Do you want to be my son?

647
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:45,598
What do you think...

648
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,868
of being a father and son to each other...

649
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:51,408
and living here together...

650
00:47:51,678 --> 00:47:54,308
like a family until we die?

651
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:57,778
You must be getting senile.

652
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:00,687
Do you not want to?

653
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,618
I do not.

654
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:04,718
Why not?

655
00:48:12,828 --> 00:48:13,928
Fine.

656
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:16,397
I will make sure you never leave Uiju!

657
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:19,508
Look at how ill-tempered he is. Gosh.

658
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:24,038
Hey.

659
00:48:24,038 --> 00:48:25,207
Do not stop.

660
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:27,747
Keep dancing.

661
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:09,317
Have you awoken?

662
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:10,357
Then...

663
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:12,388
What are you doing?

664
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:15,087
Who are you?

665
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:17,797
My name is Young Rang
because I am bright and starry...

666
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:18,928
like the early morning dew.

667
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,968
Stay still. I know my stuff.

668
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:22,428
Stop.

669
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:25,897
Do you want me to strip you?

670
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:28,138
Do not. Stop.

671
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:29,308
Go away.

672
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,578
Get away from me.

673
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:32,948
Hey...

674
00:49:37,747 --> 00:49:38,877
Right.

675
00:49:39,817 --> 00:49:41,187
What did you say...

676
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,788
your name was again?

677
00:49:42,788 --> 00:49:43,788
Young Rang.

678
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:46,428
Okay. I get that your name is Young Rang.

679
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:50,258
But why were you trying
to take your clothes off here?

680
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:52,968
What do you mean? I am here to serve you.

681
00:49:52,997 --> 00:49:54,098
"Serve?"

682
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:55,497
Do you know...

683
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:57,598
how much everyone fought
because they wanted to serve you?

684
00:49:58,337 --> 00:49:59,837
Stop. Do not move.

685
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:03,437
You should...

686
00:50:04,107 --> 00:50:05,377
come back after...

687
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,778
Wait. How old are you?

688
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:10,017
I am 15 years old.

689
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:13,747
Actually, I turned 16,

690
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:16,087
but I still look like I am 15.

691
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:21,388
Why I ought to...

692
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:24,558
- Master.
- Master. Over here.

693
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:25,997
I have to get you.

694
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:27,497
- We are over here.
- Over here.

695
00:50:27,928 --> 00:50:29,868
- Come over here.
- Master!

696
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:31,198
- We are here.
- Hey.

697
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:33,008
Here you are.

698
00:50:33,808 --> 00:50:36,308
Yes, here I am, you old man.

699
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:39,038
What? You are here.

700
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:41,578
Get out.

701
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:44,848
My gosh.

702
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:47,687
How could you send
a little girl to my room?

703
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:49,587
What? Do you not like her?

704
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:52,357
Then I will send another girl.

705
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:55,658
Gosh, you old man.

706
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:59,127
Do you think I will stay here
if you do that?

707
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:02,198
What?

708
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,038
You are going to leave again?

709
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,707
Last time, you said
you would be away for a month,

710
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:11,308
but you were gone for over a year!

711
00:51:33,297 --> 00:51:34,567
I am old now.

712
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:38,638
I am old.

713
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:46,377
Where did the mighty Gu Yang Chun go?

714
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:48,477
Tell me.

715
00:51:49,408 --> 00:51:50,778
This time,

716
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:54,948
I really will not be gone for a while.

717
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:11,468
Gosh. Why is he bringing him along?

718
00:52:12,138 --> 00:52:14,408
Jang Hyun!

719
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,008
Jang Hyun!

720
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:20,247
Yes.

721
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:22,808
Is the bright Young Rang
here to say goodbye?

722
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,977
Yes.

723
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,618
Do you know how well
everyone is treating me...

724
00:52:25,618 --> 00:52:27,517
for spending the night with you?

725
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:28,747
Is that so?

726
00:52:29,817 --> 00:52:33,127
Then why is there a rumor going around
that I am a eunuch?

727
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:36,187
Ae Ok, that brat.

728
00:52:36,297 --> 00:52:38,658
I told her not to tell anyone.

729
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:40,267
- Young Rang.
- Yes?

730
00:52:40,528 --> 00:52:42,698
Let me make this clear.

731
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,437
I am not...

732
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:47,638
Not...

733
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:50,607
I did not leave you there...

734
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,638
because I am whatever you think I am.

735
00:52:58,178 --> 00:52:59,278
Do you feel sorry?

736
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:01,488
If you feel sorry,

737
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:03,258
can you do me a favor?

738
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:05,288
I will do anything.

739
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:08,658
Until you lose your lanugo,

740
00:53:08,988 --> 00:53:10,258
you better not...

741
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,028
become an official kisaeng.

742
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:14,528
Why not?

743
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:16,368
- You are too young...
- By any chance,

744
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,667
is it because you want me for yourself?

745
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:21,908
Then...

746
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:25,038
will you fix your thing down there?

747
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:26,547
I told you that is not true.

748
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:27,747
You are mistaken.

749
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:28,948
- You got it wrong.
- Let us go.

750
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:30,218
She already found out.
There is no need for excuses.

751
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:31,278
- But...
- How lame.

752
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:32,578
It is not true.

753
00:53:32,578 --> 00:53:33,618
- How am I supposed to know?
- Right?

754
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:35,618
You know it is not true, do you not?

755
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:38,357
Let go! She thinks it is real!

756
00:53:38,357 --> 00:53:40,087
Just let her think that.

757
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:42,727
Jang Hyun, I will be waiting for you!

758
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:45,328
I will wait for you
no matter how long it takes!

759
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:48,528
So you have to fix your disease!

760
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:51,198
I hope your thing down there
works fine next time!

761
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:52,337
Okay?

762
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:53,667
It is not true!

763
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:56,408
I said it is not true!

764
00:54:03,817 --> 00:54:06,247
The weather is so nice.

765
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:10,988
Since it has been a while now...

766
00:54:10,988 --> 00:54:13,357
I'm so glad that man Tsueda is gone now.

767
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:16,627
That scoundrel played tricks...

768
00:54:16,627 --> 00:54:18,198
and colluded like a rat,

769
00:54:18,198 --> 00:54:20,727
and innocent people died because of that.

770
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:24,267
And yet Kkeut Soe gets all worked up...

771
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:26,837
and denies killing Tsueda.

772
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:29,437
Gosh, he's a trickster himself now.

773
00:54:35,778 --> 00:54:37,317
Jang Hyun, Kkeut Soe is...

774
00:54:38,547 --> 00:54:42,087
a dumb man who is innately bad at lying.

775
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,558
But could it have been you
who ordered him to kill Tsueda?

776
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,678
But why?

777
00:55:12,678 --> 00:55:14,747
Why? Because I am a terrible man myself.

778
00:55:24,058 --> 00:55:25,058
Gosh.

779
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,720
Hold it.

780
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,160
- It's going up.
- I am holding it.

781
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,331
- Wait.
- That's it.

782
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,561
Move it.

783
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,030
- Take this.
- Okay.

784
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,530
Here.

785
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,070
What are you doing?

786
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,070
There.

787
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,280
Look at this.

788
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,550
It's turning out nicely.

789
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,621
I know.

790
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,490
That's right.

791
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,481
Sixty years ago,

792
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,510
I was working in the field,

793
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,950
and when I heard the bride was coming,

794
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:30,050
I quickly washed my face
in the stream and went down.

795
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,090
I did not deserve a bride.

796
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
But you see,

797
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,731
from a distance,
a girl walked down cheerfully.

798
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,800
A girl looking like a full moon...

799
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,771
came with just one bundle.

800
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,601
I could not bring myself up
to speak to her,

801
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:51,541
so I snatched her bundle and walked.

802
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,410
I did not enter the bride's room,

803
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,381
and I kept on drinking.

804
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:58,981
People said...

805
00:57:00,381 --> 00:57:02,950
it was because the bride could not speak.

806
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,151
They talked in whispers.

807
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,820
But that was not it.

808
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:12,260
I am sorry about that.

809
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,101
I was just a lowly farmer.

810
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:20,601
How did I deserve
a beautiful bride like her?

811
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:25,541
I got her.

812
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,610
I will make her the most
beautiful bride in the world.

813
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:34,851
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

814
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,651
- Hold on tight.
- Let us help you.

815
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,490
- Careful.
- My goodness.

816
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:57,570
Here.

817
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,140
Lastly.

818
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,561
Lee Jang Hyun said he would arrive on time
for the 60th wedding anniversary party.

819
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,191
What did I tell you?

820
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,501
You should not trust him too much.

821
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,401
He is here.

822
00:58:26,401 --> 00:58:28,570
The rice is here.

823
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:32,340
Is that rice?

824
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,340
That is rice, is it not?

825
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:06,871
It is rice.

826
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,510
It has come.

827
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,711
It arrived.

828
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:18,490
All right.

829
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,490
Here comes the groom.

830
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,760
Look at the groom.

831
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:35,541
Welcome.

832
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:42,640
Here comes the bride.

833
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,660
She is beautiful.

834
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:27,820
The bride drinks.

835
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,700
The groom drinks...

836
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,171
in return.

837
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,780
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

838
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,450
- Live long.
- Live long.

839
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:14,671
- What?
- Who is he?

840
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:18,941
I would like to sing
for this precious event.

841
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,110
- He is going to sing.
- Who is he?

842
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,240
He is going to sing.

843
01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:34,561
<i>I am looking from afar</i>

844
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,360
<i>At your endearing face</i>

845
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,800
<i>The face that I missed</i>

846
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,941
<i>Was carried</i>

847
01:01:52,271 --> 01:01:59,081
<i>By the distant wind</i>

848
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:06,521
<i>You are like me</i>

849
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:15,631
<i>Burying your face in your hands</i>

850
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:20,430
<i>The moment</i>

851
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:24,101
<i>I was waiting for</i>

852
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:31,981
<i>Walk on that path</i>

853
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:40,351
<i>Even when you waver</i>

854
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:47,501
<i>In the moonlight</i>

855
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,771
So she had a crush on someone.

856
01:02:58,271 --> 01:02:59,570
Come on.

857
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:07,820
Today, I will make an offer to Yeon Jun
which he cannot turn down.

858
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,220
Turn down...

859
01:03:09,921 --> 01:03:11,021
What?

860
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:12,720
- I will kiss him.
- My goodness!

861
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:15,961
What if Lord Yoo finds out?

862
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:17,160
How would Father find out?

863
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,360
So hurry up
and fetch Young Master Yeon Jun.

864
01:03:20,691 --> 01:03:24,101
Tell him my face suddenly turned purple,
then I fainted.

865
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:26,871
Hurry, Jong Jong. Go on!

866
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,510
Like this?

867
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:40,881
No.

868
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:44,751
Maybe here.

869
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,061
Young Master Yeon Jun.

870
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,260
Young Master Yeon Jun.

871
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:58,871
My lady! Goodness.

872
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,631
My lady!

873
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,541
Young Master Yeon Jun.

874
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,240
You are covered in sweat.

875
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,171
You should have some water.

876
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:09,110
- Jong Jong!
- No, it is okay.

877
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:11,910
I was just surprised for a moment.

878
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:13,981
Jong Jong.

879
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:22,691
You were surprised?

880
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,260
You are always brave and strong.
What happened?

881
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,530
"Brave and strong?"

882
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:29,430
What are you talking about?

883
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:33,101
I cannot even harm a fly.

884
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:37,711
My gosh!

885
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,251
You little... Go away.

886
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:48,581
How embarrassing.

887
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:51,921
My lady, I flicked it away.

888
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,590
Are you all right?

889
01:05:07,331 --> 01:05:08,501
Young Master Yeon Jun.

890
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:10,901
I have been...

891
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:13,371
trying to feel you out...

892
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:16,180
without revealing how I truly felt.
It must have been frustrating for you.

893
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,351
Now, I wish to tell you.

894
01:05:19,981 --> 01:05:21,021
Yes.

895
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,621
I feel the same way as you do.

896
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,320
What do you mean?

897
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,421
My lady.

898
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,151
I am engaged to Lady Eun Ae.

899
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,820
Who cares about a promise you made
when you were little?

900
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,831
That promise is not the reason
I am staying by Lady Eun Ae's side.

901
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,700
I...

902
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:10,760
truly care for her.

903
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,771
Then...

904
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:18,140
what about those glances...

905
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,610
and the sweet words you said to me?

906
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,581
Did you lead me on to mess with me?

907
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:24,140
You are my teacher's daughter...

908
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:26,450
and Lady Eun Ae's favorite friend, so...

909
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,581
So?

910
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:29,780
You were just being nice to me?

911
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:32,720
You are lying.

912
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:34,390
It is all a lie.

913
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,160
I know.

914
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,590
I know that you...

915
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,731
This never happened.

916
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,711
I was the first one.

917
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,811
I fell for you first,

918
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,941
and you and Eun Ae met because of me.

919
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,010
- I loved you first...
- Gil Chae!

920
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,481
Gil Chae.

921
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,921
Gil Chae.

922
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:27,981
I saved you from being made fun of
for a thousand years to come.

923
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,590
Gil Chae!

924
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:43,320
Gil Chae!

925
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,061
I heard she fainted. Where did she go?

926
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:49,760
Gil Chae!

927
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,860
I wonder where she is.

928
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:52,901
Lady Gil Chae!

929
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:03,941
You were eavesdropping?

930
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,751
"Eavesdropping?" No.

931
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:09,180
How could I not hear
that loud love confession?

932
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,550
How rude!

933
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,921
So in short,
you loved your friend's fiancé?

934
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,660
It is similar to one of the stories
I heard at the market.

935
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,061
A wrongful encounter...

936
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,430
that should have never happened.

937
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,141
Here is the full story.

938
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:33,971
"I trusted my friend
as much as I trusted you."

939
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:38,450
"Hence, I casually introduced you
to my friend."

940
01:08:39,211 --> 01:08:42,081
"After that, the three of us
spent time together often."

941
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,721
"We had fun..."

942
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,160
"and hung out together."

943
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:57,931
So you had a crush on Yeon Jun?

944
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,431
Oh, right.

945
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:03,400
Was he the man
you were waiting for by the swings?

946
01:09:04,471 --> 01:09:06,610
Goodness. I heard there was
a fox with 99 tails in Neunggun-ri...

947
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,711
and was excited to see what you could do.

948
01:09:09,181 --> 01:09:11,381
But you cannot even win a man's heart?

949
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:12,950
Are you...

950
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,150
done talking?

951
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:17,221
What was I saying?

952
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,251
Right.

953
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,820
A fox...

954
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,160
with 99 tails.

955
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:29,100
I can keep rambling on
until my casket gets closed.

956
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,471
But what I truly wish to say is this.

957
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,671
I do not think
you stand a chance with him, so...

958
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:40,270
Shut your mouth.

959
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:41,681
So give up false hope and...

960
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,280
I told you to shut your mouth.

961
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:44,881
Come to me.

962
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,791
Are you proposing to me right now?

963
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:01,261
What? Nonsense.

964
01:10:01,261 --> 01:10:02,831
You already know...

965
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,631
that I do not believe in marriage...

966
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:06,770
Right, you do not wish to get married.

967
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,570
Why get married...

968
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,940
and kill the romance in your heart?

969
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:14,141
Even if you are madly in love,

970
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:16,480
the excitement and passion
quickly fizzle out.

971
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:18,181
My point is,

972
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:21,621
why not forget about marriage
as it is nothing but a hassle?

973
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:24,251
How about we passionately...

974
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:25,921
"Passionately?"

975
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,791
How about we make love to each other?

976
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:35,860
I do not say this to every woman I meet.

977
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:39,200
I cannot have a conversation like this
with other women.

978
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,431
However,

979
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:41,770
you are...

980
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,041
gutsy.

981
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,541
I think we can see eye to eye.

982
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,251
Finally, you are showing your true colors.

983
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,421
Are you smitten by me?

984
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:00,650
Well, since you are a man too,

985
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,160
it is only natural you feel that way.

986
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,660
The moment you first see me,
you feel like you can't breathe.

987
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:07,831
The second time you see me,
you feel your heart wanting me.

988
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,530
And the third time, you become lovesick.

989
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,831
So you'd cry your eyes out like a kid
and get all clingy.

990
01:11:13,371 --> 01:11:14,671
That is...

991
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:17,740
the truth behind the mysterious disease
that has affected every man in this town.

992
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,810
It begins when you fall for me.

993
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:24,980
But you know what?

994
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,520
I...

995
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,921
hate your guts.

996
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:37,060
You hate me?

997
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:38,891
That much?

998
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,730
Yes, I hate you.

999
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:43,400
I suppose you have broken
many women's hearts...

1000
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,171
while living a hedonistic lifestyle.

1001
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:46,371
But I will not fall for your tricks,

1002
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:48,341
so have fun for just a few more days
and leave.

1003
01:11:48,341 --> 01:11:50,100
- Do not wreak havoc on my village.
- Wait, stop.

1004
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:54,810
Why not me?

1005
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,240
You want to know?

1006
01:11:57,341 --> 01:12:01,181
Are you sure you can handle
what I am about to say?

1007
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,650
You converse with foreign intruders,
which is wrong.

1008
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:10,891
You purposely mislead your elders
with your sweet words.

1009
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,591
I caught you eavesdropping on me
hiding like a little rat.

1010
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:15,331
You dared to grab a woman's wrist...

1011
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,200
and rudely bothered her.

1012
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:19,331
You stole women's hearts...

1013
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:22,171
and ran away like a loser. But what?

1014
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,871
You do not believe in marriage?

1015
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,641
Is that so?

1016
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,511
And most importantly,

1017
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,511
I do not like that face of yours.

1018
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,621
You are ugly.

1019
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,730
<i>Darling, my husband</i>

1020
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:56,341
<i>Darling, my husband</i>

1021
01:12:57,141 --> 01:13:01,371
<i>My darling</i>

1022
01:13:01,371 --> 01:13:05,511
<i>Darling, my husband</i>

1023
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,650
- She is here.
<i>- Love</i>

1024
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:07,810
<i>My love</i>

1025
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,551
<i>It is love</i>

1026
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,751
<i>It is definitely love</i>

1027
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:18,091
<i>It is surely love</i>

1028
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:22,060
<i>Goodness, it is love</i>

1029
01:13:22,461 --> 01:13:26,301
<i>Moon, bright moon</i>

1030
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:30,900
<i>No matter how busy you are</i>

1031
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:32,541
They...

1032
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:35,440
were talking behind my back again.

1033
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:37,610
What did they say this time?

1034
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,650
They said you would end up...

1035
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,681
(Kyohyung: death by hanging)

1036
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:46,450
like Uhwudong who was executed
for committing adultery.

1037
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:47,650
(Uhwudong: a woman
from the Joseon dynasty...)

1038
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:49,020
(who was executed for committing adultery)

1039
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,690
They are so mean.

1040
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,001
I wish I was like Uhwudong...

1041
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:00,770
and had more room in my heart
for other men.

1042
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:03,971
I just want to...

1043
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:08,641
give my unchanging love
to a person who is unchanging.

1044
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,520
Are you saying Young Master Yeon Jun
is unchanging?

1045
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,690
Yes.

1046
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:20,891
Young Master Yeon Jun does not change.

1047
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:24,621
Men have no fidelity or discipline,

1048
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:27,860
so they are always
looking for prettier flowers,

1049
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,560
but Young Master Yeon Jun is different.

1050
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,141
With the person I love,

1051
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,740
I just want to
go see flowers in the spring,

1052
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,581
dip my feet with him
in a stream in the summer,

1053
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:53,820
and in the winter, I want to drink
the wine that we made in the fall.

1054
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,301
I just want to grow old
with the person I love.

1055
01:15:15,081 --> 01:15:16,711
Is that the life that you want to live?

1056
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:21,410
<i>Do not make tomorrow come</i>

1057
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:26,121
<i>Do not grow old</i>

1058
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:30,621
<i>And stay like this</i>

1059
01:15:30,621 --> 01:15:34,860
<i>For a hundred years</i>

1060
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:39,200
<i>It is love, my love</i>

1061
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:44,270
<i>Goodness, my love</i>

1062
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:52,310
They say a couple will grow old together
if it snows on their wedding day.

1063
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:56,450
May the both of you live long and prosper.

1064
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:59,350
- Live long and prosper!
- Live long and prosper!

1065
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,560
- Live long and prosper!
- Live long and prosper!

1066
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,310
Disguise yourselves as tradesmen,

1067
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,980
and ride with all your might...

1068
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:25,780
to besiege the palace
where the king of Joseon is.

1069
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,320
Do not waste your time fighting
each fortress in Joseon.

1070
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:14,791
You must enter Hanyang...

1071
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:18,400
before the Joseon king flees to Ganghwa,

1072
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,631
and wait.

1073
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,770
The foreign intruders are here!

1074
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,570
The intruders...

1075
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:31,810
The foreign intruders are here!

1076
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,810
They...

1077
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,881
took His Majesty captive!

1078
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,581
- What did he say?
- What is he saying?

1079
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:42,320
What is he saying?

1080
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,121
- What is he saying?
- What is going on?

1081
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:45,450
Is he saying the truth?

1082
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:46,721
- What is going on?
- What is going on?

1083
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,020
Are you being serious?

1084
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,950
(My Dearest)

1085
01:19:35,131 --> 01:19:37,801
The people of Joseon,
let us save His Majesty!

1086
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,910
Those with a burning heart, come forward!

1087
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:41,841
I will go! Is there no one else?

1088
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,480
I can help.

1089
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:45,041
He could die.

1090
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,350
We have to stop them.

1091
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,211
Stop the army from fighting.

1092
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
My lady,

1093
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,121
The country is being invaded
and the king is being held captive.

1094
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,020
If you step onto the battlefield,
the violent intruders will...

1095
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,461
Then if I am lucky enough
to come back alive,

1096
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:01,931
allow me to kiss your precious lips.

1097
