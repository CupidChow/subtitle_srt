1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,370
I know you do not love me yet.

4
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,370
I also know that...

5
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,780
your heart still belongs to Yeon Jun.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,850
However,

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,649
even if you do not love me,

8
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,119
please do not forget me.

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,490
On this day,

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,399
this very moment you spent with me...

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,409
Do not ever forget it.

12
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,489
I know it.

13
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,890
The man I meet in my dreams every night...

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,930
is my future husband.

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,540
On this day,

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,069
this very moment you spent with me...

17
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,310
Do not ever forget it.

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,150
(My Dearest)

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,590
(Episode 8)

20
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,590
I was so sure it was
Young Master Yeon Jun.

21
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,459
What was, My lady?

22
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,260
I need to see him once more.

23
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,670
Who?

24
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,629
Where are you going now?

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,840
Come on.

26
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,669
You should ride a palanquin, My lady.

27
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:14,870
I would be late if I rode the palanquin.

28
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:16,840
I even drove a horse carriage
during the war.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
- So lend me the horse.
- I cannot let you.

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,909
I cannot.

31
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,550
Lady Gil Chae?

32
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,780
Are you not scared?

33
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,289
I am not scared at all.

34
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,490
So please hurry.

35
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,669
Thank you.

36
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,840
I am relieved that
you volunteered to go to Simyang.

37
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,740
When the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

38
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,280
he will reward you greatly.

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,379
You are not interested, are you?

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
I did not mean it anyway.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,189
It is strange.

42
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,650
It is neither out of loyalty...

43
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,620
nor for your future.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,389
Why are you volunteering to go to Simyang
when it is bound to be dangerous?

45
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,030
Looking sad like someone
leaving his lover behind?

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,159
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,629
Come on.

48
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,400
You think I do not know
anything about love...

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
just because I am a eunuch?

50
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,039
I may not have a tool,

51
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,409
(Nam-nyeo-sang-yeol-ji-sa: A blunt
expression of love between man and woman)

52
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,810
but I do have a heart.

53
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,750
Why am I leaving?

54
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:32,479
I do not know.

55
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,620
I have no reason to stay in Joseon now.

56
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,659
Also...

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,879
The Crown Prince has
never left the palace...

58
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,479
and is not used to sleeping in the open.

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,379
Can you let him sleep...

60
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,150
on a heated floor on the way to Simyang?

61
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,689
Once you reach Simyang,

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,459
do not lose your temper...

63
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,670
or be too timid.

64
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:32,879
I do not know
when I will see Your Majesty again...

65
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,720
once I leave now.

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,300
I am intrigued to see
how fate will unfold...

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,740
for that pitiful son.

68
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,009
- Do not leave, Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

69
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:05,939
Your Highness.

70
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,810
Do not leave us.

71
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,550
Your Highness.

72
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,759
We, your subjects, cannot let you go.

73
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,290
Please do not go,

74
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,329
Your Highness.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,569
Your Highness, please let me go.

76
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,579
Who will take care of my children?

77
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,180
Stop.

78
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,509
Stop.

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,019
No.

80
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:46,980
No.

81
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,920
No.

82
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,790
Hey!

83
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,629
Let us take that girl with us.

84
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,269
She looks pretty.
She will make us some money.

85
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,519
You scumbag, I will kill you!

86
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,850
After the Ganghwa Island incident,
His Majesty announced a ban...

87
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,120
on private enslavement of captives.

88
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,290
Will you disobey His Majesty?

89
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,019
Why is it that
you must always do whatever you want?

90
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,949
What would you have done
if they had dragged you away?

91
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,490
That is what I wanted to say!

92
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,759
Must you always do whatever you want?

93
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,959
- Me?
- Yes.

94
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,959
How dare you kiss me?

95
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,259
And you are off to Simyang?

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,600
What? "M" for "mull?"

97
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,839
So when we "mull over" our relationship,

98
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,639
you can do whatever you wish?

99
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,709
What made you so angry?

100
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,639
The kiss or Simyang?

101
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,910
Or is it both?

102
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,680
Can you not be serious for a moment?

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,449
Is everything a joke to you?

104
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,889
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

105
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,600
Are you suddenly interested in me?

106
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,769
Just a few days ago,
you were bawling because of Yeon Jun...

107
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,870
and did not even care about me.

108
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,910
Oh, I see.

109
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,050
Have you fallen for me
because of the kiss?

110
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,079
What? What nonsense!

111
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,850
Oh, my.

112
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,750
I knew I had a knack for it,

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,319
but I did not know I was that good.

114
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,550
My goodness.

115
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,259
I must have been out of my mind.

116
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,730
What did I expect
from this flippant joker?

117
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,430
So why are you here?

118
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,930
Before you go,
you ought to tell me why you are here.

119
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,750
Do you believe in dreams?

120
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,419
What?

121
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,620
I had a dream...

122
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,889
where my favorite spool started rolling
on the ground. I followed it,

123
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,690
but the path did not seem to end.

124
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,830
I climbed a mountain, crossed a river,

125
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,600
and lost my floral shoes while at it.

126
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,129
It was my favorite pair.

127
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,669
In any case,

128
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:55,370
someone...

129
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,539
That person was none other than...

130
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,139
Are you here to ask me
for a new pair of floral shoes?

131
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,710
Pardon me?

132
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,549
I knew you loved floral shoes,
but this is absurd.

133
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,019
No, let me explain!

134
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,649
Jang Hyun!

135
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,850
Jang Hyun!

136
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,590
I must go.

137
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,029
Watch out for intruders on your way back.

138
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,799
The floral shoes...

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,399
When can I expect them?

140
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,139
My new floral shoes.
When will you give them to me?

141
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,070
I need a new pair at once.

142
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,070
I would appreciate it
if I could receive them soon.

143
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,210
My lady.

144
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,879
You are asking me for floral shoes to wear
in Joseon knowing I am off to Simyang?

145
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,460
Fine. I will do my best.

146
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,820
However, I must ask.

147
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,259
If I bring you a new pair of floral shoes,

148
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,730
what will you give me?

149
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,740
What would you like?

150
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,009
You know what I would like.

151
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,409
There is...

152
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,649
only one thing I desire.

153
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,919
That is your heart.

154
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,820
Your heart that only cares for me...

155
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:22,690
and no one else.

156
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,970
Dream on.

157
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,600
You think you can win my heart
with a pair of floral shoes?

158
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,669
You see, you are always like this.

159
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,269
Everything you say is a joke.

160
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,539
So how could I trust you
and give you my heart?

161
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,649
Everything I say is a joke?

162
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,450
Perhaps, that is what you wish to believe.

163
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,120
It must hurt your pride that
you are interested in a man like me.

164
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,259
A stray from who knows where.

165
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,259
A man who has been through it all.

166
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,429
This has to be a joke...

167
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,769
for you to keep your feelings
for your dear Yeon Jun for a long time.

168
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,440
And I bet you are quite pleased
with the pure, noble image of yourself...

169
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,539
as you tell others that
you only fancy one man.

170
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,149
But you know what?

171
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,179
You are neither noble...

172
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,350
nor pure.

173
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,029
You fancy a man who is engaged.

174
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,399
"Pure" certainly is not a word
I would use to describe such a woman.

175
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,629
Hence,

176
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,899
you are better suited for a man like me,
who has been through it all.

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,309
Just leave!

178
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,450
Go and die!

179
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,090
If you...

180
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,330
can tell me now that
you will never think of Yeon Jun again,

181
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,570
I will not go to Simyang.

182
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,240
It is fine
even if you do not truly mean it.

183
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,980
Keep him in your heart
and think of him whenever you wish.

184
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,649
If you can just...

185
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,820
tell me that you will never
think of him again, I will...

186
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,100
I cannot do that.

187
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,429
He is...

188
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,610
not someone I can forget easily.

189
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,110
You are so cruel.

190
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,350
What is it...

191
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,220
that Young Master Yeon Jun has...

192
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,389
but I do not?

193
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,970
Jang Hyun! Come on!

194
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,379
I must really get going now.

195
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,850
May I go ahead...

196
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,389
and think that
the floral shoes were an excuse...

197
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,320
and that you came here to see me off?

198
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:23,299
I shall return with
the most beautiful pair of floral shoes.

199
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,779
Why are you so hung up on her?
This is so unlike you.

200
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,139
Goodness.

201
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,110
You said you never wished to be wed,

202
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,279
but you would marry Lady Gil Chae at once
if she proposed to you.

203
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,519
She said there was someone
she could not forget easily. What is that?

204
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,460
Is there such a thing?

205
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,759
Of course, there is.

206
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,200
Gab Dol and Gab Soon grew up together.

207
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,929
Surely, they thought
they would marry each other.

208
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,899
However,

209
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,700
that is not something you can control,
you know.

210
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,570
Gab Soon followed her parents' wishes...

211
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,480
and married a wealthy man
in a village nearby.

212
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,610
She had 4 sons and 3 daughters
and lived a happy life.

213
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,320
Her husband was a good man.

214
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,350
Later on, when she was on her deathbed,

215
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,559
she tightly held her husband's hand
and said this.

216
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,460
"Gab Dol."

217
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,360
"I will go first and wait for you,"

218
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,799
"but take your time."

219
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,139
Gab Soon never forgot about Gab Dol.

220
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,509
It is not a feeling
you can easily get rid of.

221
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,009
No one,

222
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,879
not anybody, can change that.

223
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:19,149
Forever, until you die.

224
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,820
Who is that man?

225
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,860
You saw everything. Why are you asking?

226
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,809
Forget about Young Master Yeon Jun now.

227
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,750
To me, Young Master Yeon Jun...

228
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,519
is not just any man.

229
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,750
When I think of him,

230
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,289
I remember the days
when I was the most beautiful.

231
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Can you...

232
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,230
erase your most beautiful days
from your life?

233
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Young master.

234
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,079
How shameless of me.

235
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,650
Your father passed away,

236
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,279
and the Crown Prince
has been taken away as a hostage,

237
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,289
but I am here, trying to satisfy my greed.

238
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,950
Your greed?

239
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,089
I am an incompetent person.

240
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,559
But there is someone...

241
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,029
who does not think of me in that way.

242
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,559
When I am with her,

243
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,900
I feel like I become a decent man.

244
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,579
My lady.

245
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,480
Will you be my wife?

246
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,119
I forgot I had to help the teacher
with his meal.

247
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,240
When women are violated
by the foreign intruders,

248
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,880
they will face death.

249
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,809
And how could women continue to live
even after a brief encounter?

250
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,890
"Unfortunately, I lost my husband."

251
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,359
"How can I let another man
hold my wrists?"

252
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,230
And she cut off her wrists.

253
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,460
How appropriate is her heart
that wants to keep her chastity?

254
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,430
Why are you not sleeping?

255
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,779
Did Young Master Yeon Jun propose to you?

256
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,779
But are you not happy?

257
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,750
- For a long time...
- I have no right.

258
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,359
If you show your skin to a man,

259
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,490
it means you have failed
to preserve your chastity.

260
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,569
But a foreign intruder grabbed my skin.

261
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,069
But how can I...

262
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,009
I cannot.

263
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,049
I do not have the right.

264
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,660
- I...
- I have no idea what you are saying.

265
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,789
Did you forget?

266
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,559
That day,

267
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,230
we got lost,

268
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,529
so our clothes ripped
and we started bleeding.

269
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,970
Nothing happened to us that day.

270
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,619
The person
that Young Master Yeon Jun wants...

271
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,789
is you.

272
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,630
The person who can make
Young Master Yeon Jun happy...

273
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:56,859
is also you.

274
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,329
So the person
who has the right to become his wife...

275
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,000
is you and you only.

276
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,680
Wife, drink the tea.

277
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,390
Husband, drink the tea.

278
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,839
I have not once questioned it.

279
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,009
I believed with all my heart...

280
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,279
that the man in my dreams
would be Young Master Yeon Jun.

281
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:58,720
Watching him being affectionate
to another woman...

282
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,559
was not bad.

283
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,960
Perhaps I was glad
that a man as kind as he existed.

284
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,900
The man in my dreams...

285
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,700
had to be Young Master Yeon Jun.

286
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,670
But...

287
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,680
even after realizing that Young Master
Yeon Jun loves Eun Ae instead of me,

288
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,579
I do not feel that sad.

289
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,920
Did something vanish?

290
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,549
Or...

291
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,019
did a new feeling sprout inside my heart?

292
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,460
You may go ahead.
I have somewhere to stop by in Uiju.

293
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,670
In Uiju?

294
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,269
I will see you in Simyang.

295
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,599
Let us go.

296
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:46,869
Hey.

297
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,710
Why is he so self-centered?

298
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,079
Hey!

299
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,680
Since the intruders
rushed in like a flood,

300
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,519
all the people of Uiju
ran to Yang Chun for help.

301
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,349
It was a bloodbath,
and a lot of people fled.

302
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,789
After that, well...

303
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,759
Where did the old man go?

304
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,109
When the Qing soldiers
first invaded our land, they were fast,

305
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,619
so they did not plunder much...

306
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,279
from Hwanghae Province
or Pyongan Province.

307
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,950
But during this time of retreat,
they remain in multiple locations...

308
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,690
to plunder and extort,

309
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,019
and the effect is quite disastrous.

310
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,460
On their way back to the Qing,

311
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,160
they must pass
through mountain ridges and valleys.

312
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,099
The horses are limping and dying.

313
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,769
They are suffering greatly.

314
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,140
It is farming season,

315
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,670
but everyone has been taken captive,

316
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,740
so there is no hope for cultivation.

317
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,950
The people are going through
a miserable time.

318
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,190
(Simyang)

319
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,450
This is not bad.

320
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,420
I looked into it,
and the owner is a gambling addict,

321
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,789
so he is going to offer
this lodging facility for sale.

322
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,990
(Yeogak: a lodging facility for merchants
that also sells goods on consignment)

323
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,089
That is good.

324
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,430
I should swallow...

325
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,829
this lodging facility soon.

326
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:26,799
We should make a lot of money...

327
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,069
to make an Usimjeong branch.

328
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:30,069
What?

329
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,710
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

330
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,710
Right. Ryang Eum.

331
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,480
You should look into
how the Crown Prince...

332
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,849
deals with the foreign intruders.

333
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,819
When it comes to business,

334
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,559
you need to keep a close eye
on the people who run the country.

335
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,329
(Simgwan: the Crown Prince's quarters
in Simyang)

336
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,470
I am relaying the thoughts
of His Majesty, the Emperor.

337
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:04,269
His Majesty considers it very important...

338
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,339
to catch the Joseon prisoners
who have escaped.

339
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,309
How is it that the Crown Prince
is indifferent about this matter?

340
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,720
How dare you stare
at His Highness like that?

341
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,559
We are not breaking our promise.
We just have no choice.

342
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,890
The grass is so tall right now,

343
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,690
so there is no way of finding the escapees
if they hide in the grass.

344
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,700
There is no point in telling me.

345
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,299
There are numerous escapees
that have crossed the river,

346
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,339
but not a single one
has been caught and sent back.

347
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,049
What on earth are you doing?

348
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,950
His Majesty has prohibited tobacco
for a while now.

349
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,950
But they were brought in once again.

350
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:54,019
Do the Joseon people...

351
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,759
not even listen to their Crown Prince?

352
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,700
Does your country not have any discipline?

353
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,339
A person caught with tobacco...

354
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,839
will receive 80 lashes with a leather whip
and have their ears pierced.

355
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,509
Receive the command of the Emperor.

356
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,009
Why have you not sent the promised troops?

357
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,710
Have you forgotten the firm pact
made below the mountain fortress?

358
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,880
Are you trying to betray us?

359
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,680
Do the Crown Prince and Prince Bong Rim...

360
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,619
not intend to return to Joseon?

361
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,150
Has the King of Joseon abandoned...

362
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,420
the Crown Prince and Prince Bong Rim?

363
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,220
If I...

364
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,430
refuse Joseon's troops,

365
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,430
the Crown Prince's fate
will also become uncertain.

366
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,740
Is that right?

367
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,380
Yes, Your Majesty. The Crown Prince
of Joseon is very stern.

368
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:52,319
Should he be punished
for lifting his head up...

369
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,450
while reading His Majesty's edict?

370
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,519
If the Crown Prince does not
reconcile with us until the end,

371
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,849
there is nothing we can do.

372
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,259
In Simyang, there is Prince Bong Rim.

373
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,329
In Joseon,
there is the Crown Prince's son.

374
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,099
Even if the Crown Prince
gets lost in Simyang,

375
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,769
there are many
who will follow my intentions.

376
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,170
Looking at the era of constant change,
it is like a lesson from the past.

377
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,779
The way of governing is to examine it
deeply, not just superficially...

378
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,210
Your Highness.

379
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,750
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

380
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,220
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

381
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,619
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

382
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,460
Urging him to send provisions
and escaped prisoners,

383
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,559
they pressured the Crown Prince.

384
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,200
But His Highness stood strongly.

385
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,940
Khan was very displeased with it,

386
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,609
and he is pressuring
the Crown Prince in every matter.

387
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,380
His Highness shed tears during the study,

388
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,009
and his illness deepened.

389
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,250
I am greatly concerned for him.

390
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,450
I am worried...

391
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,589
that the Crown Prince
might break under this pressure.

392
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,730
Jang Hyun,

393
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,829
- about opening a branch of Usimjeong.
- Yes?

394
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,269
How about Namwon?

395
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,269
That sounds good.

396
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,440
I will manage it.

397
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,970
That sounds great.

398
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,509
But if we set up a Namwon branch,

399
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,309
Ryang Eum has to come
and sing once a week.

400
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,009
Right. You tell him.

401
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,349
Have you seen Ryang Eum
listening to what I say?

402
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,779
All right.

403
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,789
Ryang Eum.

404
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,660
Have you looked into
the Crown Prince's affairs?

405
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,500
I have, but it does not seem easy.

406
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,599
The intruders whipped the people
who secretly brought in the tobacco...

407
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,470
and threatened the Crown Prince.

408
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,410
He even cried in front of his subjects.

409
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,009
He cried?

410
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,809
The Crown Prince?

411
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,750
He probably will never be able
to return to Joseon...

412
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,150
and die here.

413
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,990
No way.

414
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,190
Khan's father, Nurhaci, came between...

415
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,190
the Emperor of the Ming
and Yuan Chong Huan,

416
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,099
eventually causing
Yuan Chong Huan's death.

417
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,269
You think Nurhaci's son would not use
the manipulative tactics...

418
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,700
against Joseon's King and Crown Prince?

419
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:26,640
These intruders...

420
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,109
will definitely subtly manipulate...

421
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:32,809
the relationship between
Joseon's King and Crown Prince.

422
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,710
If he is being rigid in everything,

423
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,809
it will lead to his demise.

424
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,380
But that is not my concern.

425
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,549
Let us go.

426
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,089
I have a separate business
to attend to in Simyang.

427
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,559
That guy over there...

428
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:57,400
says he will sell 100 geun
of tobacco for 150 nyang,

429
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,700
but in reality,

430
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,240
he would sell it for 100.

431
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,140
And that guy,

432
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,609
he vowed to buy
100 geun of tobacco for 300 nyang,

433
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:10,549
but deep down, he is willing
to pay up to 350 nyang.

434
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,650
So,

435
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,450
if I act as an intermediary,

436
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,650
let them sell and buy at 250 nyang,

437
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,450
take 50 nyang as a commission,

438
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,160
this guy will earn 100 nyang more,

439
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,829
and that guy will save 50 nyang.

440
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,299
What do you call this clever scheme?

441
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,569
Economic innovation.

442
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:31,829
So, if we bring in items...

443
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,640
that cannot be obtained here,

444
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,869
we will make significant profits.

445
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,009
But if we are caught smuggling...

446
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,650
What has gotten into you?
We did these things often in Uiju.

447
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,349
It is different from Uiju.

448
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,650
How so?

449
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,150
I am here as an interpreter for Joseon.

450
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,160
(Cheongyeok: An official who translates
the Manchu language into Joseon language)

451
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,490
The people from the royal family
who trade with me...

452
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,130
will back me up.

453
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,299
It is top quality.

454
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,470
How much do you have?

455
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,079
Where do you find...

456
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,009
quality tobacco like that?

457
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,309
We are not here to do business.

458
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,950
We are here to drink.

459
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,450
Even if you cross the border
to dig up ginseng, you might die.

460
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,990
Even if you secretly trade ginseng,
you might die.

461
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,660
That is why...

462
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,690
you are operating in secrecy.

463
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,529
Trading with the Qing interpreter
would be honorable, right?

464
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,859
Of course,

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,829
you would have to pay him a little.

466
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,170
A Qing interpreter?

467
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:40,940
He is over there.

468
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,549
Jang Hyun!

469
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,680
Jang Hyun! This is bad.

470
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,849
Brother.

471
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,890
All the people selling ginseng
and tobacco are gathering here.

472
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,890
Now, where should I spend the money?

473
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,089
Ryang Eum.

474
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:08,099
Try to find a big sword
the intruders like.

475
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,569
Dorgon is seriously ill.

476
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,240
Joseon's bamboo medicine
is said to have good effects.

477
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,009
Can you get it?

478
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,509
Previously, I got the bamboo medicine
and the blue bamboo upon request.

479
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,480
But I do not know about this time.

480
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:28,049
Bamboo medicine is not something
you can find so easily.

481
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,559
His Highness is treating
Jung Myung Soo poorly.

482
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,029
If he fails to get the bamboo medicine...

483
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,529
When it comes to getting things
from Joseon, you must ask him.

484
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,599
You can find anything if you ask him.

485
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,640
For that, even the royal family
wants to keep him around.

486
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:50,069
Recently, he got the Emperor...

487
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,380
a big sword too.

488
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,779
Who is this man?

489
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,180
We are still doing business
with the Qing and Japanese intruders.

490
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,980
But now that you have
the title of interpreter,

491
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,490
you suddenly look
smarter and more confident.

492
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,190
And we are earning twice as much.

493
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,059
Who is Lee Jang Hyun?

494
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,470
I have heard that you go to
Bonghwangseong to buy things.

495
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,500
By any chance, are you...

496
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,200
doing business here?

497
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,910
The interpreter is expected to pay
for the round trip.

498
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,480
So it has been allowed
for the interpreters...

499
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,250
to trade ginseng and tobacco.

500
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:31,450
Is that why you prioritized...

501
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,720
obtaining money over serving His Highness?

502
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,519
I heard you gave the Emperor
a big sword and flattered him.

503
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,059
How dare you lift your head!

504
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,670
Is there anything you need, Your Highness?

505
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,240
Is there someone...

506
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,380
you need to flatter?

507
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:02,680
How dare you!

508
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,279
Dorgon is looking for the bamboo medicine.

509
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,489
Can you find it hastily?

510
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,760
Dorgon found the bamboo medicine?

511
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,289
Yes.

512
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,730
He presented...

513
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,760
the high-quality one to His Majesty...

514
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,429
and got highly praised.

515
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,670
How did he manage to find it
when I failed to find it?

516
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,769
I heard there is a competent one
among the interpreters they brought along.

517
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,480
Interpreter?

518
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,349
There is an interpreter
that I do not know?

519
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,219
He rarely visits the Joseon Embassy.

520
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,250
He seems to visit Bonghwangseong often
to find what he needs.

521
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,059
Getting in contact with him seems
to be the fastest way...

522
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,059
to find the rarity.

523
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:53,699
Why do you not hire him
as your underling, sir?

524
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:59,199
This is maddening.

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,469
How can we find the leaf
that only grows in the Ming?

526
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,989
You are...

527
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,300
It has been such a long time.

528
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,900
I meant to visit you to say hello.

529
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,940
I thought you died from smallpox.

530
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:37,769
I nearly died.

531
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,079
I volunteered to go to Ganghwa island,
hoping to join the army.

532
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,079
However,
I was taken captive by Joseon's army.

533
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
I thought...

534
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,119
they would kill me.

535
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,190
But because
I am fluent in Qing's language,

536
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,889
they said they would spare me...

537
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,900
if I worked as their interpreter,
so here I am.

538
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,900
Do you expect me to believe that?

539
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,039
So you suspect me?

540
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,869
Both Choi Do Ri and Mak Dong...

541
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,480
became Qing's interpreters
after being taken captive.

542
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,679
So how come you do not believe me?

543
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,679
Do you think...

544
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,650
I will let you off like this?

545
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,760
I suppose you think that I am a spy.

546
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,329
I swear,

547
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,030
I am not a spy.

548
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,170
I should not be a spy. Am I wrong?

549
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,880
If His Majesty finds out
that you failed to catch a spy...

550
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,579
even after pulling out his six toenails,

551
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,820
will you be spared?

552
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:06,960
If you...

553
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,530
wish to take my life,

554
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,170
kindly give me a heads-up.

555
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,579
I must let the royal family know
that I can no longer...

556
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,739
supply them with the goods.

557
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,780
Remember Ha Seo Guk?

558
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,920
Did I tell you
what happened to that spy in the end?

559
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:35,829
In the end,

560
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,000
he got caught and died.
His eyeballs and tongue were ripped out,

561
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,230
and his feet were cut off.

562
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,829
I swear...

563
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,599
there will come a day...

564
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,210
when I will take your life
exactly in that manner.

565
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,659
Will we be all right?

566
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,590
Today, I must see your face
no matter what.

567
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,230
So turn around at once...

568
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,500
No!

569
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,150
The man you have been seeing
in your dreams was bleeding?

570
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,150
Yes.

571
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,179
It has never happened before.

572
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,849
They said going to Simyang was like
asking to get killed.

573
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,960
I suppose you had such a dream
for you were worried.

574
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,059
Yes, I think so too.

575
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,329
Wait, Simyang?
What does that have to do with me?

576
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,130
Let me think.

577
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,969
Who went to Simyang?
Young Master Jang Hyun.

578
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,610
No!

579
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:32,369
I have not even seen that man's face.

580
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,610
He is not Young Master Jang Hyun!

581
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,880
My gosh.
You have not seen that man's face yet?

582
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:41,050
Then you must check his face
the next time you see him in your dream.

583
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,949
It is not like I can control my dreams.

584
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,860
I know what you can do.

585
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:51,159
This stone possesses divine energy.

586
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,460
Wash it with clean water in the morning...

587
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:55,800
and wrap it in this red silk.

588
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,500
Fall asleep
while holding this in your arms,

589
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,440
and you will see his face in your dream.

590
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,769
But remember this.

591
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,510
This stone must not touch the floor.

592
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:08,679
Do you believe such a superstition?

593
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,949
Then shall I just take this?

594
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,519
- Madam Bang Doo.
- Yes, my lady.

595
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,489
Oh, why bother moving that heavy thing?

596
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:20,659
Just toss it. In that corner.

597
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,630
- Shall I?
- Yes.

598
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:25,059
- Right here?
- Sure.

599
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,369
I will leave it here, then.

600
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,150
Does that stone truly possess
some kind of divine energy?

601
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,559
There is no such thing.

602
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,670
She is the real prankster, that one.

603
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,780
Your Highness.

604
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,050
Yesterday, an official from Qing...

605
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:25,619
asked if we had evidence...

606
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,559
that Jung Myung Soo embezzled
the gifts for His Majesty.

607
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,929
General Yong Gol Dae will be here soon
to find out more.

608
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,099
How about we tell them all the details...

609
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,000
about how he has been embezzling
all the silver from Joseon...

610
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:40,869
and how he stole the persimmons and pears?

611
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,369
That reminds me.

612
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,510
Once, I saw Jung Myung Soo
putting aside 1,000 persimmons...

613
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,010
out of the 10,000 persimmons from Joseon.

614
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,880
I asked him why he was not taking them.

615
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:56,219
He said to me,

616
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,360
"I will take them when they are needed."

617
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,860
"Joseon's Crown Prince
should mind his own business."

618
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,659
How dare a mere interpreter
embezzle His Majesty's gifts...

619
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,960
for the Emperor?

620
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,860
There is more.

621
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:11,429
When Jung Myung Soo was in Joseon,

622
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,940
he whipped the Assistant Section Chief
of the Ministry of Defense.

623
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,269
(Jwarang:
Senior sixth-rank in the Six Ministries)

624
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,269
A servant did that.

625
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,440
That lowly servant.

626
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:19,739
Right.

627
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,210
I did hear that Jung Myung Soo
was a servant in the past.

628
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,320
Please allow me to have an audience
with His Highness.

629
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,619
Your Highness.

630
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,989
I suggest you listen
to what Interpreter Lee has to say.

631
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:36,989
Your Highness.

632
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,000
It is not too late yet.

633
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,000
Please do not report Jung Myung Soo.

634
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,429
And...

635
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,469
even if you know something
about this matter,

636
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,969
you must pretend...

637
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:51,969
not to know about it at all.

638
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:52,980
Are you saying...

639
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,949
I should sit idly by
and watch him as he steals...

640
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,409
from both countries like a sneaky rat?

641
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,219
He is dangerous for he is like a rat.

642
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,219
The silver and persimmons...

643
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,019
that rat stole.

644
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,289
Who do you think he shared them with?

645
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,360
Who is the person
that has been working most closely...

646
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,630
with him?

647
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,969
Your Highness!

648
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,119
You are to receive
His Imperial Majesty's order.

649
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,599
"We have found evidence that..."

650
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,599
"Jung Noe Kyung framed
and falsely accused Jung Myung Soo."

651
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,769
"Since the people of Joseon
are my subjects,"

652
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,679
"they must follow my law."

653
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
General.

654
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,460
Your Highness.

655
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,500
Were you involved in this too?

656
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,099
Your Highness.

657
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,340
His Majesty has entrusted me
with all matters regarding Joseon.

658
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:32,880
By reporting Jung Myung Soo for embezzling
the gifts for His Majesty,

659
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,010
you tried to cause me harm.

660
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,010
If you help Jung Noe Kyung
who was after me,

661
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,449
it means you are determined
to eat my flesh.

662
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,949
Your Highness.

663
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,690
If you truly were not involved in this,

664
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,289
everyone who schemed this
with Jung Noe Kyung...

665
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,440
must die at your hands.

666
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,440
Eun Ae,

667
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,309
are you sleeping?

668
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,789
You know, during the war,

669
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,619
I knew you were suffering while fleeing,

670
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,630
but I went to His Majesty instead of you.

671
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,030
I did not know how a person like me
could save His Majesty,

672
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,670
but I had to go to His Majesty
even if it meant I would die.

673
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,809
Do you know why?

674
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,210
I lost my parents,

675
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,579
but the elders of Neunggun-ri raised me.

676
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,320
I was always thankful.

677
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,920
So...

678
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,960
there was never a day that I felt at ease.

679
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,500
I wanted to repay their favor.

680
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,000
I wanted to show them
how well I was raised,

681
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,139
even without a father.

682
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:15,980
It is okay now.

683
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,949
I have His Majesty.

684
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:22,889
If I help His Majesty
become a good and wise king,

685
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,719
the elders in Neunggun-ri
will be so proud.

686
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,960
Eun Ae.

687
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,530
I am going to show my loyalty
to His Majesty.

688
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,099
I am going to give it my all...

689
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,369
to make His Majesty a good and wise king.

690
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,110
Recently,
many officials have stepped down,

691
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,780
using illness as an excuse.

692
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,349
What is the reason?

693
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,289
Are you looking down on me?

694
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,789
Do you think I am dirty for bowing down...

695
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,030
to the foreign intruders?

696
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,130
Your Majesty,

697
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,039
ever since the Crown Prince
has been taken hostage,

698
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:17,409
tears have not stopped falling
from the people's faces.

699
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,539
All of the people are hoping
for His Highness to return...

700
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,280
and preserve the state.

701
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,019
But Your Majesty,

702
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,619
it immediately showed that you despise
hearing anything that is offensive,

703
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,260
and you are not capable
of getting rid of your prejudice.

704
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,860
You are also unable
to calm your eagerness to win,

705
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,599
so how will you do great things
for your country?

706
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,730
So Your Majesty,

707
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,340
rather than suspecting the motives
of the officials' resignments,

708
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,039
may you self-reflect...

709
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,440
and lead yourself...

710
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,909
in the right direction.

711
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,780
The King loving his people,

712
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,019
the officials advising the King,

713
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,219
and the King listening to his officials.
These are what are right.

714
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,860
That way, the intruders will be edified,

715
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:08,659
the world will be moved,

716
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,360
and the Crown Prince
will be able to return.

717
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,210
Very well.

718
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,809
Officer Nam, you are right.

719
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,750
I need to stand upright first.

720
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,389
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

721
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,820
I was deeply moved by your courage.

722
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,530
So I would like to entrust you
with an important task.

723
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,329
Shortly, I need to send a head official...

724
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,369
to the Qing to greet Khan.

725
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,599
Who else could show
Joseon's upright integrity...

726
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,239
in front of the foreign intruders?

727
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,610
There is only you.

728
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,719
Are you sure that stone is effective?

729
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
I could not see his face at all.

730
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,989
Did you sleep with it in your arms?

731
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,460
Are you sure you did not
let go of it while sleeping?

732
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,659
I am pretty sure I was hugging it tightly.

733
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,199
Did you hear the news?

734
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,539
Officer Nam...

735
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,409
has been locked up.

736
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,480
His Majesty appointed him
as a head official,

737
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,780
but Officer Nam rejected his offer, saying
he could not go to the Qing to greet them.

738
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,820
So His Majesty was infuriated...

739
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,519
and punished him
for committing 1 of the 10 big crimes.

740
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:45,949
(Daebulgyeongjoe: 1 out of
the 10 abominations listed...)

741
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,420
(in "The Great Ming Code")

742
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,480
Move.

743
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,809
Confiscate the family fortune...

744
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,849
of the great offender, Nam Yeon Jun!

745
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,489
The foreign intruders.

746
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,960
The foreign intruders are here!

747
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:22,389
The foreign intruders!

748
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,929
The foreign intruders.

749
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,039
We have to go to Neunggun-ri.

750
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,159
We could get a lot of money
if we sell this.

751
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,260
Not this.

752
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,989
Not this.

753
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,699
Did you hear the news?

754
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,170
- People are returning from Simyang.
- What?

755
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,940
They are sending people from Simyang
because of the memorial service,

756
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,300
and some are coming back for good.

757
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,110
You know the elderly lady
in the village next door, right?

758
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,179
She was so gaunt
after her husband left for Simyang,

759
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,550
but after hearing that he would be back,
she was full of energy.

760
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,420
Then...

761
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,980
Young Master Jang Hyun
might come back as well.

762
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,699
My Lord!

763
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,000
Darling!

764
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:48,039
- Goodness, Darling.
- Goodness.

765
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,679
- There he is.
- Where?

766
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:52,510
- Where is he?
- Goodness.

767
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,349
- Dae Man!
- Dae Man!

768
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,489
- Goodness.
- Dae Man.

769
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,159
- Goodness.
- Are you okay?

770
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,789
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

771
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,130
Is he going to be late?

772
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,929
You are a mess!

773
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,159
So...

774
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,699
why did you blow things out of proportion?

775
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,369
- How dare you...
- Yes.

776
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,570
A person like me does not know much.

777
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,679
But...

778
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,550
when it comes to the foreign intruders,

779
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,909
you should ask me.

780
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,449
Can you not tell?

781
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,449
Jung Myung Soo
is just Yong Gol Dae's hands and feet.

782
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,659
Hey.

783
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,190
Then will we live or die?

784
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,059
I doubt they will kill us.

785
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,670
So if you want to live,

786
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,469
give a bribe to either Jung Myung Soo
or Yong Gol Dae...

787
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,170
- Drag him out.
- Yes, sir.

788
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,750
Get up.

789
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,159
He did not frame you.

790
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:13,730
That is right.

791
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,460
He has no interest in others.

792
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:19,829
He knows that General Yong Gol Dae
trusts you the most.

793
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,699
How could he have done such a thing?

794
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,570
Please trust us.

795
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,710
Is that so?

796
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,409
I also do not believe...

797
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,610
that Lee Jang Hyun is that foolish.

798
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:31,809
However,

799
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:36,750
the Crown Prince of Joseon sent
a massive amount of gold as a bribe...

800
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,489
in order to save Jung Noe Kyung,

801
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:39,960
but he failed.

802
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:43,159
There was an order to send
the belongings of Jung Noe Kyung...

803
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,860
and those who will be beheaded to Joseon.

804
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,059
Seeing how such an order has been issued,

805
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,500
it seems Lee Jang Hyun will surely die.

806
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,739
Kill him.

807
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:27,739
Yes, sir.

808
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,960
You are a captive
who ended up becoming the interpreter?

809
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,369
I already told General Yong Gol Dae...

811
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,170
how I ended up here...

812
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,300
as a man of humble origin.

813
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,280
Yes.

814
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:48,820
It is very common...

815
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,949
for the captives
to work as an interpreter.

816
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,860
Right.

817
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,730
However...

818
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:03,900
In Joseon, someone spread a false rumor...

819
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,940
to the Qing troops
that the Emperor had gone mad.

820
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:16,010
By any chance, are you...

821
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:20,949
the one who spread...

822
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:23,920
that rumor?

823
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,539
You are looking for an interpreter
who went to Simyang?

824
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,139
What is his name?

825
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:51,409
It is Lee Jang Hyun.

826
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,150
There are...

827
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,780
too many interpreters, you see.

828
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:57,550
Lee Jang Hyun.

829
00:56:58,219 --> 00:56:59,489
He sounds like the interpreter...

830
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,590
who died along with Jung Noe Kyung.

831
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,030
He died?

832
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,659
If you visit the government office,
you will find the articles...

833
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,860
left by those who died in Simyang.

834
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:12,130
If you find his articles there,
it means he is clearly dead.

835
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,710
There it is.

836
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:29,719
Where is my son?

837
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:30,750
My dear.

838
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,360
Come back.

839
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,489
Come back.

840
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,230
My son.

841
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,929
What do I do?

842
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,119
You know,

843
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,199
I plan to hold on
to this ribbon until I die.

844
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,570
If the wife holds the clothing
he used to wear...

845
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,369
and calls his name three times,

846
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,280
he might come back to life and return.

847
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:04,119
Young Master Jang Hyun!

848
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,949
Come back.

849
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:09,989
When you come back,

850
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,530
I will never be harsh to you again.

851
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:24,070
Young Master Jang Hyun!

852
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,639
Come back.

853
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,380
There is something
I did not get to say yet.

854
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,949
So...

855
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,289
Come back, Young Master Jang Hyun!

856
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,929
Young Master Jang Hyun!

857
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:07,849
Young Master!

858
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:13,320
Young Master!

859
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:29,000
(My Dearest)

860
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,789
Take all my heart.

861
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,860
Do not leave. Stay with me.

862
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,159
Lady Gil Chae, you must live.

863
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,400
You must live
for the good days ahead of you.

864
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,599
He is dead. Stop thinking of him.

865
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,800
Buy all the coins you can find
in the market.

866
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,139
Look!

867
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,809
Those useless coins turned
into this precious brass bowl.

868
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:07,809
I told you.

869
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:09,309
I would much rather count on you...

870
01:05:09,309 --> 01:05:11,679
than a few weak scholars.

871
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,309
Do not come back again.

872
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,150
I plan to live to 100.

873
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,750
Let us meet again.

874
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,096
