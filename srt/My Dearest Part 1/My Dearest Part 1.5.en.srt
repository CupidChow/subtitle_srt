1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
(This drama is a work of fiction
created based on historical facts.)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,980
(Most of the details and depictions
of the characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,260
Are you okay?

4
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:31,539
Lady Gil Chae.

5
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,579
Watch out, my dear!

6
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,130
Are you okay?

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,469
You are not hurt?

8
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,010
You are bleeding.

9
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,920
By the way, Lady Gil Chae.

10
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,920
Did you just call me...

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,150
"my dear?"

12
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,700
(My Dearest)

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,069
Once I swing my club,

14
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,810
the heads of the intruders will rock here,

15
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,340
rock there, and rock back and forth.

16
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,250
We would have to duck
from all their flying heads.

17
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,849
- Right?
- How sly.

18
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,049
Tell me about it.

19
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,659
I thought he was a coward
since he refused to join the army.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,359
What a swindler.

21
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,989
A swindler like him...

22
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,629
grows on me.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,530
I want to be swindled from time to time.

24
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,700
Me too.

25
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,870
In that case,

26
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,210
do you not have Yeon Jun's news
after splitting up with them?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,909
Do not worry. I am sure he made it
into the fortress safely.

28
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,979
I hope so.

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,879
He must be safe.

30
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:32,659
The intruders must not have expected
Joseon to have such a club...

31
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,629
and called me "The Club of Joseon."

32
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,030
I will be called "The Club of Joseon,"
do you not think?

33
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,770
- As if.
- I am telling the truth.

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,740
I heard something strange earlier.

35
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:45,300
Someone called me...

36
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,509
her husband.

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,169
Who was that?

38
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,810
Well, I wonder who.

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,080
Was it not you?

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,050
"Watch out,"

41
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,050
"my dear!"

42
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,419
I think you said that.

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,919
My goodness.

44
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,990
You must have heard things
out of fear for the intruders.

45
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,860
How strange. I definitely heard it.

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,530
Jong Jong.

47
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,830
You heard it, yes?

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,400
Well...

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,500
Gu Jam.

50
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,199
Did you hear it?

51
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,270
I mean...

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,909
Let me ask you, Lady Eun Ae.

53
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,240
- Yes?
- Did you hear it?

54
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,509
"Watch out, my dear!"

55
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,849
Yes, I did.

56
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,719
Have you all lost it?

57
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:41,860
My lady.

58
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey.

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,430
Why are you so dense as her servant?

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,969
Oh, my...

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,129
Goodness.

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,069
Why did you say that? Why did you...

63
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,969
tell me, "Watch out, my dear?"

64
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,669
Lest I got hurt?

65
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,740
Or were you afraid that I would die?

66
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,180
Wait, that is not the point.

67
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,610
Why exactly did you call me your "dear?"

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,379
I see. Deep down, you must have
wanted me as your husband.

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,949
Me?

70
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,090
Want you?

71
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,819
As my husband?

72
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,590
What utter nonsense.

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,259
If I have to marry you,

74
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,129
I would rather shave my head
and be a nun...

75
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,759
I am afraid it is a shame.

76
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,569
Did I not tell you previously?

77
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,540
I...

78
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,939
am not interested in marriage.

79
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,379
My motto is, well...

80
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,509
Courting is essential,

81
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,410
marriage is a choice.

82
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,050
Something like that?

83
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,250
Is that why you have lovers
all across the country?

84
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,759
Because you can never stop courting?

85
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,860
- I have lovers across the country?
- Yes.

86
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,990
It is an open secret.

87
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,129
Did you think I would not know?

88
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,300
No wonder.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,569
Now I see why the Neunggun-ri ladies
were so snarky towards me.

90
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,670
Then why...

91
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,670
do you want me...

92
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,879
as your husband?

93
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,879
I did not do it on purpose!

94
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,810
By accident, I...

95
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,050
"By accident?"

96
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,490
I see you finally remember.

97
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,160
You definitely...

98
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,360
called me "dear."

99
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,629
All right?

100
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,670
My lady.

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,170
Do not be shy.
The fact that you spurted that out...

102
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,209
means that deep down,
you must think of me...

103
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,610
as someone worthy to be your husband.

104
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,709
And so,

105
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,149
even though I do not intend
to get married,

106
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,120
if you really want me
to be your husband...

107
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,120
You must have looked
like Young Master Yeon Jun.

108
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,790
That was why I called you "my dear."

109
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,529
Goodness.

110
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,329
I would not have said that
to a misogamist.

111
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,000
You thought I was Young Master Yeon Jun?

112
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,730
- Madam Bang Doo.
- Okay.

113
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,970
We will be able to sleep warm tonight.

114
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,740
The baby is such a lucky child.

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,079
Shall we call him "Dae Bok?"

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,850
Dae Bok?

117
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,379
Why is he so beautiful?

118
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,050
He must not take after his mother.

119
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,149
I agree.

120
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,620
What is on your mind?

121
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,259
Young Master Yeon Jun.

122
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,860
You are such a petty man.

123
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,629
I am serious.

124
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,360
I wonder if Young Master Yeon Jun...

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,360
is thinking about
the two ladies waiting for him.

126
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:41,930
Or...

127
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,569
is he only thinking about the King?

128
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,800
That just crossed my mind.

129
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,170
In any case,

130
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,079
thank you.

131
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,149
For telling me to flee,

132
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,279
and for saving us today.

133
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,120
I am just grateful, that is all.

134
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,990
Do you really feel grateful?

135
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,129
In that case,

136
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,060
can I...

137
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,230
kiss you this time...

138
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,329
Why, you...

139
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,769
I am not such a serious man.

140
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,009
Serious feelings like your love
for Yeon Jun...

141
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,480
are just...

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,079
too much for me.

143
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,819
What I truly want...

144
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,820
is your warm lips...

145
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,659
Even if I want to be nice to you,

146
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,190
I utterly cannot.

147
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,529
You are such a lousy,
good-for-nothing lowlife.

148
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,299
What a lousy, good-for-nothing lowlife.

149
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,669
I will leave behind a horse and a wagon.

150
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,309
Please carry Madam Bang Doo.

151
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,980
- All right.
- Where are you going?

152
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
Dae Bok.

153
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,649
Lady Gil Chae is scary, yes?

154
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,220
Here.

155
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,860
I have to continue chasing the enemies.

156
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,500
What about us?

157
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,830
What do you mean?

158
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,600
You can just continue to do
what you have been doing.

159
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,100
You even know
how to wield a blade now, do you not?

160
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,539
You should not lose such a boon as this.

161
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,350
I never once used this...

162
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,049
My lady,

163
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,519
I am proud of you.

164
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,929
What did I tell you?

165
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,159
You are more trustworthy...

166
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,399
than a bunch of small-boned scholars.

167
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,840
Come to think of it,

168
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,340
you also saved my life.

169
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,710
Thanks to you,

170
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,809
who mistook me for Young Master Yeon Jun,

171
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,120
I was able to avoid the attack.

172
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,320
Quit making fun of me.

173
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,519
Once you cut your wisdom teeth,

174
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,129
I will stop making fun of you.

175
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,090
- Let us go.
- Wait.

176
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,299
I am leaving.

177
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,899
I do not care.

178
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,629
I wonder if they were able
to get up the mountain.

179
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,190
Jong Jong has a weak body.

180
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,700
You are so mean.

181
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:16,370
Do not worry. She is stronger than you.

182
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,340
Are they refugees?

183
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,210
They look like they have been starving...

184
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,850
What?

185
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,830
- Have some.
- Thank you.

186
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,230
Thank you.

187
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:51,840
Eat up.

188
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,909
I heard General Jung Se Kyu's royal forces
suffered a crushing defeat.

189
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,450
So...

190
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,750
where were you headed?

191
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,480
To His Majesty.

192
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,419
Before that,
we are going to attack the intruders...

193
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,820
and offer a trophy head to His Majesty.

194
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,889
(Trophy head: the head of an enemy
that has been cut during war)

195
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,629
I heard General Kim Jun Ryong's army...

196
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,029
is camped out on Mount Gwanggyo.

197
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,360
Do you want to join us?

198
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,629
Did I not tell you?
I have no interest in saving the King.

199
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,399
By the way,

200
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,470
where are Young Master Soon Yak
and the others?

201
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,289
It has not been long
since they went to battle.

202
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,659
I cannot believe they already died.

203
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,799
They are like sheep without a shepherd.

204
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,980
You are right.

205
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,509
At this rate, they will all end up dead
like Young Master Soon Yak.

206
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,110
I ran into Lady Eun Ae earlier.

207
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,649
She was separated from her parents,

208
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,779
and the ladies were fleeing on their own.

209
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,820
Is everyone safe?

210
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,590
That brings me to my point.

211
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,490
What do you think of giving up
on saving the King...

212
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,830
and protecting Lady Eun Ae instead?

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,570
I cannot do that.

214
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:11,480
I do not think we will be able
to defeat the intruders.

215
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,509
I could die...

216
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,179
before I even get to see His Majesty.

217
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,250
Like Soon Yak.

218
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,950
But...

219
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,190
I do not know how to live a life that is
different from what I have learned.

220
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,629
For my entire life,
I learned that it is my duty...

221
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,029
to fight for the nation
when it is in danger.

222
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,399
A woman obeying a man,
a child serving his parents,

223
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,370
and a subject being loyal to the King
are beautiful orders that should be kept.

224
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,309
In return, a man should protect his woman
and parents should protect their children.

225
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:44,169
And the King and the scholar-officials
should protect the people.

226
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,110
I am going to die
while protecting the King.

227
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,610
If I die for the King,

228
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,059
he will protect the people.

229
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,389
That is the only thing I trust.

230
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,910
Let us go to Mount Gwanggyo together.

231
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,190
We are not going to save the King.

232
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,759
Then?

233
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,769
Bul Kang.

234
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,640
Bul Kang.

235
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,170
Bul Kang.

236
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,549
I...

237
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,259
did not know
I would be doing stuff like this.

238
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,890
Goodness.

239
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,990
Look at the calluses on my hands.

240
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,299
My hands are so dry and dark.

241
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,329
Then should I do it?

242
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,670
Will you?

243
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,039
Why you little...

244
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,539
It is smoking
because you put in wet branches.

245
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,079
Madam Bang Doo,
I told you not to come out in the cold.

246
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,009
You blanched
the dried radish greens, right?

247
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,809
When you blanch the dried radish greens,

248
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,579
add a pinch of salt,
then squeeze the water out.

249
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,819
Then add soybean paste and sesame oil...

250
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,019
and mix everything together.

251
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,430
And finish it by boiling it.

252
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,829
Okay?

253
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,170
The thing is,

254
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,609
I have never eaten
anything like this in my life.

255
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,779
Is that so?

256
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,910
- Then I should eat your fill...
- I have never eaten this before,

257
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,180
so it is fascinating.

258
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,119
I see you did not add sesame oil.

259
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,849
You need sesame oil
to get rid of the bad smell...

260
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,190
and make it more flavorful...

261
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,819
We have no sesame oil.

262
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,230
Goodness. There, there.

263
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,269
At this rate,

264
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,740
we will probably starve to death.

265
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,410
The reinforcements are here?

266
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,720
General, we are here
after receiving your request...

267
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,920
Is this all of you?

268
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,559
Sorry?

269
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,890
It is an ambush!

270
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,059
General, it is an ambush.

271
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,000
Can you fight?

272
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,400
Yes, we can.

273
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,440
But we just came.

274
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,809
They must enjoy fighting.

275
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,880
I know, right?

276
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,579
They must be eager
to get themselves killed.

277
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,619
You better stay on your toes
if you do not want to die by their hands.

278
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,160
What are you saying?
I am "The Club of Joseon."

279
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,319
Hey, wait for me!

280
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,259
What are you doing?

281
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,829
This is our horse!

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,430
So it had an owner.

283
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,099
Where are you going?

284
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,140
I heard
all of the defeated royal forces...

285
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,279
are gathering around General Kim Jun Ryong
on Mount Gwanggyo.

286
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,710
We are going there as well.

287
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,210
You are going near the battlefield?

288
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,980
You will be in more danger.

289
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,880
But still, we should be near
our military to feel safe.

290
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,349
My sons volunteered to join the army.

291
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,490
I should go and help.

292
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,089
I am going to aid
in treating the wounded soldiers.

293
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,000
Anyway, do not think of
taking this horse with you.

294
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,400
Why are they so concerned about others?

295
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,240
They should just worry about fleeing.

296
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,509
I want to go too.

297
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,880
What?

298
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,509
I want to go and help.

299
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,710
I do not want to keep fleeing
like a coward.

300
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,779
Hey, do not even think about it.

301
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,250
You heard the rumors.

302
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,089
General Jung Se Kyu was defeated,

303
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,750
so the volunteer army has been split up.

304
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,789
Young Master Yeon Jun
might be in Mount Gwanggyo.

305
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,529
Mount Gwanggyo is near Mount Heomcheon.

306
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,369
Still, we cannot go.

307
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,880
This is not what I was born to do.

308
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,819
Why did these darn men have to come here?

309
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,190
Sound of flowers, my foot.

310
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,829
I should be heating up my back,
lying down on a warm spot.

311
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,140
Right.

312
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,710
I will just let him die.

313
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,109
Darn it.

314
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:27,849
Open your eyes!

315
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,109
It hurts.

316
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,809
Hold it.

317
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,079
It hurts.

318
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,150
When will I get better?

319
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,960
I will not put up with this any longer.

320
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,869
Mother.

321
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,799
Mother.

322
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,910
What are you doing? Hold him.

323
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,349
Mother, save me.

324
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,019
Mother.

325
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,099
Mother.

326
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,609
You are still there, right?

327
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,440
I am not your mother.

328
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,509
You are here.

329
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,779
Mother.

330
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,049
Do not go anywhere.

331
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,690
I am not your mother.

332
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:13,720
Fine.

333
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,089
I will not go anywhere. I will be here.

334
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,960
Is the physician here?

335
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,869
- Excuse me.
- Where is the physician?

336
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,650
Young Master Yeon Jun.

337
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,589
Young Master Yeon Jun.

338
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,730
How...

339
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,799
Young Master Yeon Jun!

340
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,769
Young Master Yeon Jun! Oh, dear.

341
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,500
Get up.

342
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,809
- Young Master Yeon Jun! What do we do?
- Young Master Yeon Jun!

343
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,779
Help him.

344
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,849
Lie down here.

345
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,920
- Physician!
- Young Master Yeon Jun!

346
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,519
Young Master Yeon Jun!

347
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,509
What?

348
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,170
Hey, you!

349
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,210
You have to tell me what happened.

350
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,680
I should be asking you.

351
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,289
You said you would refuge beyond
the mountains, so why are you here?

352
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Eun Ae insisted on coming along,

353
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
saying she wanted
to help the wounded soldiers.

354
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,759
I knew it.

355
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:07,829
The high and mighty Lady Gil Chae
would not be interested in helping others.

356
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,930
Do you even realize
how many lives I have saved here?

357
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,500
Just a while ago, a young soldier...

358
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,440
tightly held onto my hand,
begging for his life.

359
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,839
You have had your share of troubles,
doing things you do not even care about.

360
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,910
Do not dare say I do not care about it.

361
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:24,049
Are you saying you really care
about the wounded soldiers?

362
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,380
Of course I do.

363
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,950
I worried and got sad
as if it had happened to me.

364
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,650
You should insist that
the sun rose from the ground today.

365
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,160
You are unbelievable.

366
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,690
Why on earth are you so crooked?

367
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,730
I am not as crooked as you,
who likes a taken man.

368
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,960
Hey!

369
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,339
Did you...

370
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,170
Did you just shout at me?

371
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,309
You do it to me too.

372
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,579
I...

373
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,019
I am...

374
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,279
older than you too!

375
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,559
Tell me.

376
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,460
How did Young Master Yeon Jun
end up getting so severely hurt?

377
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,599
No.

378
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,529
What were you doing while Young Master...

379
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,069
was getting himself injured?

380
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,839
Lady Gil Chae.

381
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,470
Is it my fault...

382
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,339
that Young Master Yeon Jun got hurt?

383
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,539
You said you know about
the foreign intruders very well.

384
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,180
If you are so knowledgeable
and impressive,

385
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,750
you should act accordingly!

386
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,369
You pretended all high and mighty,
but look at the state of you.

387
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,380
The cut wound you had got infected.

388
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,509
I am fine.

389
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,779
I have to go back up.

390
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,180
Wait.

391
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,819
Gosh.

392
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,319
Sit.

393
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,930
Do not think about going anywhere.
Sit here tightly.

394
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,759
I said to sit there tightly.

395
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,569
Gosh.

396
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,140
Why is she making a fuss
over something so small?

397
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,049
He got struck deep in his thigh.

398
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,359
There is a chance...

399
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,359
he might not be able to
reproduce in the future.

400
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,430
- What?
- What?

401
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,329
It is fine.

402
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,869
It does not matter.

403
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,369
I am glad you are alive.

404
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,440
Lady Eun Ae.

405
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,670
I was wrong.

406
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,740
It missed it by a nose.

407
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,079
He will be able to
produce offspring after all.

408
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,519
Thank goodness.

409
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,990
Young Master Jang Hyun.

410
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,930
I want to thank you
for helping Young Master Yeon Jun.

411
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,069
I am not sure how I can repay you.

412
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,269
Well.

413
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,299
I did not save them.

414
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,809
He managed to survive
longer than I thought.

415
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,039
I know you protected
Young Master Yeon Jun.

416
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,750
He only studied his whole life
so he is a bad fighter.

417
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:51,049
You must be upset that
even I realized what Gil Chae did not.

418
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,519
The other day,
I told you to think about...

419
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,059
who Gil Chae looked at
during the wedding anniversary party.

420
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,799
She looked at Young Master Yeon Jun.

421
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,099
Not that talk again.

422
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:09,269
When one is shocked and scared,

423
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:12,079
the one they look for
is the one they truly love?

424
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,279
My lady.

425
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,279
Is that not ridiculous in the first place?

426
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,119
What kind of fool would fall for that...

427
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,720
She looked at you.

428
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,390
Me? She looked at me?

429
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,420
Yes.

430
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,500
Why, who do you think she was looking at?

431
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,900
Young Master Yeon Jun?

432
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,799
Gil Chae may cherish him,

433
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,039
but those feelings are not romantic.

434
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,880
Go and ask her if you do not believe me.

435
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,160
I may not be a physician,

436
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,569
but with my experience
from treating hundreds of soldiers,

437
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,569
I can tell that
this wound will not heal easily.

438
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,670
You will have to rest here
for a month at least.

439
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,509
Do you wish for me to stay?

440
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,049
It is not my wish.

441
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:24,980
Your wound is just too severe.

442
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,819
So this small, insignificant wound...

443
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,789
desperately calls
for your care and concern.

444
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,960
Is that it?

445
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,289
Oh, my goodness. You are bleeding.

446
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,490
My goodness.

447
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,460
It was already bleeding.

448
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:51,640
That is not how Lady Eun Ae does it.

449
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:53,980
I know how to do it too.

450
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,710
Everyone thinks Eun Ae
is more competent than me.

451
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,920
But there are things I am better at.

452
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,849
By the way,

453
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,559
Lady Eun Ae told me something strange.

454
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,559
During the wedding anniversary party
in Neunggun-ri,

455
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,029
everyone was frantic
at the news of the intruders.

456
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:19,869
In that situation,

457
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,339
you did not look at anyone else...

458
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,710
but me, is that true?

459
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,890
Come to think of it, you are so lame.

460
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,859
The one you like is
the one you look for when you are scared?

461
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,099
Was that written in scripture?

462
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,730
You actually believe that?

463
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,500
Goodness. How ridiculous.

464
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,710
Still,

465
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,450
I was the first one you looked at, yes?

466
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,130
Even though you say you like another man,

467
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,329
you looked at me
during that state of chaos.

468
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,539
I feel bad that I have to turn you down.

469
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:29,909
What?

470
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,380
So let me suggest...

471
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,710
that we take on a broader perspective.

472
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,849
The words "lover" and "nobody"
are near each other in the dictionary.

473
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,250
But do you know what is
in between those two words?

474
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,789
"M" for "mull."

475
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,059
There is space to mull.

476
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,300
If you do not know what you feel,

477
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,730
how about we take some time...

478
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
to mull over our relationship?

479
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:05,739
If a man and woman mull over
their relationship,

480
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:08,949
they do not have
to give each other an answer.

481
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,820
Neither do they have
to cut each other off right away.

482
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:16,789
We can quietly look after each other...

483
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,559
and have fun from time to time.

484
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:24,860
Then we can decide whether we want
to be "lovers" or "nobodies," that is all.

485
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:27,730
In that case,

486
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,630
until when do we mull about it?

487
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,670
If one of us
starts yearning desperately...

488
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,070
or loses interest, we will call it off.

489
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,610
Mull, my foot.

490
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,079
All this time you must have talked
about misogamism...

491
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,019
and mulling to insult countless women.

492
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,750
I can tell without looking.

493
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,050
Do not even think
of treating me like that.

494
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,889
Wait, my...

495
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,420
My lady.

496
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,659
My goodness!

497
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,789
Mulling is not something awful.

498
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,199
My lady. Are you there?

499
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,170
Are you sleeping?

500
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,679
If you cannot sleep,
do you want me to talk to you?

501
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,960
Is it a mere coincidence?

502
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,900
Whenever the moon is bright,

503
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,670
you are always by my side.

504
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,710
Now you will cross my mind
whenever the moon is bright.

505
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:08,969
The others...

506
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,699
Oh, my.

507
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,170
It is you, Jong Jong.

508
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,170
Well...

509
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,579
Are the others doing fine?

510
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,909
The others?

511
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,849
I see.

512
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,780
Handsome Ryang Eum is fine...

513
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,820
so he does not have to come here.

514
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,090
Not Ryang Eum, I mean...

515
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,559
What has gotten to her?

516
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,860
What do you mean?

517
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,130
I mean Lady Gil Chae.

518
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,869
The smell and discomfort made it hard...

519
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,199
for her to sleep these days.

520
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,440
But she sleeps so soundly
when she is with you.

521
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,980
When we met in the mountains,
she also slept well.

522
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,949
Why does that happen?

523
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,030
By the way,

524
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,199
you do not have to send Gu Jam
my regards or anything.

525
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,599
I did not know snoring
could sound so sweet.

526
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,409
Dear me.

527
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,710
Madam Bang Doo, please take a break.

528
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,880
Everyone is working hard,
how can I take a break?

529
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,019
I should help.

530
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,019
My arm hurts!

531
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,960
If these herbs
can cure Young Master Yeon Jun,

532
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,889
I do not care if my palms blister.

533
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,599
My lady.

534
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,269
This is not a herb.

535
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,059
My, you have harvested a lot.

536
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,059
Please let me.

537
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,289
- Thank you.
- Madam Bang Doo.

538
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:54,500
You are unwell.
Do not carry such heavy things.

539
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,170
Let us go.

540
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,170
Mine is heavy too.

541
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,909
Lady Eun Ae,
this is a lot of precious herbs.

542
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,639
How are you always so competent?

543
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,389
Let us go.

544
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:38,309
Lady Eun Ae, allow me.

545
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,300
Allow me.

546
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,079
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

547
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,690
Come over here.

548
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,429
Come over here.

549
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,250
I am fine.

550
00:41:58,719 --> 00:41:59,920
Where are you going?

551
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,989
Why do you think
I carried all those women across?

552
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:08,360
When getting to know someone,

553
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,429
you are supposed to help them
across a stream like this.

554
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,340
Then are you getting to know...

555
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,809
all of those women too?

556
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,980
- No, it is different.
- What is?

557
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,980
My feelings.

558
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,750
Those who have recovered
from their wounds, come forward!

559
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,250
It is an all-out war!

560
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,920
Take action if you can walk!

561
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,329
Jong Jong asked about you.

562
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,730
Women...

563
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,469
are crazy about men if they are handsome.

564
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,170
I was talking to you, not Ryang Eum.

565
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,199
Me?

566
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,469
Early in the morning, the people
of our nation, who tried to hide,

567
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,809
were killed by our enemies.

568
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,110
The monstrous intruders...

569
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,949
considered the lives of the Joseon people
as light as a feather...

570
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,519
and slaughtered everyone
including the children and the elderly.

571
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,119
So what should we do?

572
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,230
Who will rescue His Majesty...

573
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,300
and how will we protect
the people of our nation?

574
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:24,730
However, do not be afraid.

575
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,110
What? Where did your ribbon go?

576
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,119
Although the reinforcement with provisions
and weapons has not arrived yet,

577
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,019
we have a single chance...

578
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,449
to fight against them.

579
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:50,030
We are going to give it our all...

580
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,130
from the last remaining soldier
to the last arrowhead!

581
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,730
- That means we are all going to die.
- We will wait at the...

582
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,369
Hey, let us leave.

583
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:00,869
He says we are all going to die.

584
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,769
This is where I shall die.

585
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:08,880
We will easily be able to defeat
the intruders as the soldiers of Joseon...

586
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,909
You may leave and preserve your body.

587
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,079
Thank you very much for your help.

588
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,889
We are not weak!

589
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,219
Let us all...

590
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,559
return His Majesty's favor with our lives.

591
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,659
Are you ready?

592
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,469
Look.

593
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,079
You should think of winning a victory.

594
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,110
Why is everyone so determined
to die while fighting?

595
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,619
Since we are already risking our lives,

596
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:49,949
should we not risk them for a fight
that will end up in a victory?

597
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,949
You insolent...

598
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,760
How dare you?

599
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,059
Is there a way...

600
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,030
in which our soldiers can win
without dying?

601
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,159
Do you know what that smoke is?

602
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,030
Since you have fought against them
for ten years in the northern provinces,

603
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,400
you should be able to guess.

604
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:15,579
It is the smoke...

605
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,980
that appears after the intruders burn
the bodies of dead soldiers.

606
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,050
The thing is,

607
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,050
the intruders feel proud
of dying while fighting,

608
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,019
but they find it ignoble
to have their dead bodies...

609
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:31,329
handed over to their enemies.

610
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,199
Therefore,

611
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:35,900
no matter what,

612
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,139
they will not leave the corpses
of their comrades in their enemy's camp.

613
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:01,820
<i>- Like our Manchurian ancestors</i>
<i>- Like our Manchurian ancestors</i>

614
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,429
<i>- Let us shoot arrows</i>
<i>- Let us shoot arrows</i>

615
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:09,300

617

618

619

<i>- Let us go and shoot arrows</i>

620
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,980
Everything we earned while fighting...

621
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,750
will be shared with the family
of those who lost their lives.

622
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:33,889
So do not be afraid of death!

623
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,059
Those who die
while fighting courageously...

624
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:39,030
will live forever in His Majesty's glory.

625
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,369
Burn them.

626
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:27,210
Stop him.

627
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,769
Right now!

628
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,519
The enemy general is dead!

629
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,289
Attack!

630
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,429
Kim Jun Ryong's army
has won a great victory.

631
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,130
Also, Yangguri, the son-in-law of Nurhaci,

632
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,139
whom he cherished the most,

633
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,570
died after being shot by a Joseon soldier.

634
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:41,719
We beat the intruders!

635
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,340
We defeated the Qing soldiers,
so we bought ourselves some time.

636
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:09,750
Once the reinforcements arrive, we will
gather more power to stop the siege...

637
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,750
General!

638
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,119
The relieving force that was supposed
to come with provisions and arrows...

639
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:16,989
has been attacked by the Qing army.

640
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,320
Our source of reinforcements
has been cut off.

641
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,900
We must fight on,

642
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,269
however, we cannot, for we ran out of
arrows and provisions for battle.

643
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:39,309
Thus, I shall assemble a vanguard today...

644
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:41,340
and head for Suwon to gather supplies.

645
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:45,480
The remaining men shall disperse...

646
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,849
and each secure provisions and arrows,

647
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,590
to ultimately rescue His Majesty
from Namhan Fortress.

648
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,269
Your Majesty.

649
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,639
What shall we do, Your Majesty?

650
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,670
Your Majesty.

651
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:13,510
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

652
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,309
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

653
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,480
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

654
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:23,690
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

655
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,789
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

656
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,119
(January 6th, Year of Jeongchuk,
Disbandment of Kim Jun Ryong's Troops)

657
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:36,969
What are you doing?

658
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,369
Let us go.

659
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,309
I will go to the palace.

660
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,579
I, Pyo Eon Kyum, am the senior eunuch...

661
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,480
who serves the Crown Prince.

662
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,449
I came out to visit my mother and happened
to run into the foreign intruders.

663
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:58,690
Now, I will head
to the palace to deliver news...

664
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,360
of Mount Gwanggyo
to His Majesty and the Crown Prince.

665
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,929
Who will accompany me?

666
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,059
I will go with you.

667
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
Thank you.

668
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,829
Is there anyone else?

669
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,170
Is there no one else...

670
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,039
willing to join me?

671
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:18,869
Let us go.

672
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,349
Will you just leave me to die?

673
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,349
Why would you say that?

674
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,380
If I were to encounter
the foreign intruders and meet my end,

675
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:31,820
my men would tell
the Crown Prince I died...

676
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,050
because you abandoned me.

677
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,159
People will think
I am the foreign intruder then.

678
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,219
I heard you were dying
to get an update about me.

679
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:08,090
I appreciate your affection,
but I had a rather high standard.

680
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,030
What are you saying?

681
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,130
Jong Jong.

682
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,559
What were you so curious about?

683
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,869
When the day breaks, I will leave.

684
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:21,769
I have decided to accompany the eunuch
serving the Crown Prince.

685
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,840
Please understand.

686
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,610
I can never...

687
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,380
abandon His Majesty.

688
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,679
Right.

689
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,280
What is happening?

690
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:12,219
It is a rare occasion
that you came to greet me.

691
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,320
Right.

692
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,960
Your turn is not coming.

693
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,360
Should I call him for you?

694
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,730
- Young Master Yeon Jun...
- Stop it. Will you?

695
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:32,409
By the way,

696
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,239
why are you going?

697
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:38,579
You said you are not interested
in rescuing the King.

698
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,880
I am not interested.

699
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:42,449
So why are you going?

700
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,750
You want to know the reason?

701
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,610
What did you and Lady Gil Chae
talk so long about?

702
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,280
You chatted for quite some time.

703
00:55:09,909 --> 00:55:13,110
Chat? You are getting ruder day by day.

704
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:28,199
By the way, my lady.
Why do we have to go all the way there?

705
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,730
Just push.

706
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,500
Push harder.

707
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,309
It is an ambush!

708
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:39,869
- What are you doing?
- I protect His Highness,

709
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,869
so protecting me is like
protecting His Highness.

710
00:56:54,219 --> 00:56:56,849
Stop it!

711
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:58,949
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

712
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,119
Come on.

713
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,219
Stop it.

714
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:02,360
What is going on?

715
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,090
Everyone must be headed there.

716
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,159
Gil Chae.

717
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,099
Must we go there too?

718
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,610
Yes. We must go.

719
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,239
We must.

720
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,659
Go.

721
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,400
The foreign intruders
erected wooden stakes...

722
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,500
and placed bells on top of them,
blocking any possible leakage points.

723
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:49,869
But they are also human.
There must be vulnerabilities.

724
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,639
The monk soldiers have been moving
in and out of the fortress.

725
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:55,739
Then can I truly meet His Majesty?

726
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,550
In ordinary times, you might
never dare to request to see him.

727
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,519
However, after breaking through
death itself to enter the fortress,

728
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,590
how could His Majesty refuse to see you?

729
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,489
Wait.

730
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,429
It is ready. Let us go.

731
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,550
Your Majesty.

732
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,260
Your Majesty, I am overjoyed
to see you being safe and sound.

733
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,360
- I could die today...
- Thank you.

734
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:45,960
I am very proud of you.

735
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,659
Even among the men
who are employed by the government,

736
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,969
there are many people who ran away...

737
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:54,099
because they were afraid
of dying at the fortress.

738
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:57,809
And yet you risked your life to rescue me.

739
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:00,480
Look.

740
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,380
As long as we have scholars
like these in Joseon,

741
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,780
our government will be preserved.

742
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,420
It will be preserved
for all times to come.

743
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,590
You are right, Your Majesty.

744
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,949
This is a big blessing for our nation.

745
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:14,719
- It is a big blessing,
- It is a big blessing,

746
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,219
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

747
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,760
Right.

748
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,110
Your Majesty.

749
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,010
Now that the scholars have brought back
the heads of the foreign intruders,

750
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,519
Joseon's spirit is alive.

751
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,349
Please do not lose your hope...

752
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,789
and spur on the troops
around the fortress...

753
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:51,190
Minister Kim, do the Neunggun-ri scholars
look like hope to you?

754
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:55,300
General Jung's army of 15,000
have all been dispersed...

755
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,530
and only seven of them made it back.

756
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,900
They are proof that
the royal forces are stuck.

757
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,769
In such a dire situation,

758
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,610
words are not enough.

759
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,239
Your Majesty,

760
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,409
since all the royal forces are stuck,

761
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:13,179
we have to send an envoy
and tell them our intent for mediation.

762
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,420
Will they...

763
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,989
agree to mediation?

764
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,320
Since the old days,

765
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,920
invading deep into the enemy's land...

766
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,090
has been the final military resort.

767
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,760
I am sure that...

768
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,429
they also wish for mediation.

769
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,900
It is too early for mediation...

770
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,570
or sending out all our troops to war.

771
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:42,579
Before that,

772
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,980
have our forces reached their camp
with wine and meat?

773
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,920
We appreciate the thought.

774
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:56,019
But all the poultry and crops of Joseon
belong to us now.

775
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,889
Why would we need any of these?

776
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,500
From now on,

777
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,929
I have nothing to discuss
about our countries.

778
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:06,500
His Majesty...

779
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,400
is on his way.

780
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,989
Is that true...

781
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,730
that Khan has arrived?

782
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,159
I cannot be sure.

783
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:37,070
The Jin are still at war with the Ming,

784
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,199
so how is it possible that Khan...

785
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,840
would enter Joseon
instead of fighting the Ming?

786
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:54,820
How long do they intend
to stay in the fortress?

787
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:59,420
The Ming troops held out
for 82 days at Dalinghe.

788
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:01,360
So they will also...

789
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,230
Eighty days?

790
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,639
There is no way that Khan is here.

791
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,070
They must be bluffing.

792
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:22,679
However,

793
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:26,210
if Khan is really here...

794
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:38,889
If only there was someone
who knows the minds of the Jin well.

795
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,429
I do...

796
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,570
know someone.

797
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,239
Our next battle may happen soon...

798
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:51,809
so work hard and mend them now.

799
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,909
What a diligent chap.

800
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,380
Do you not like him
because he is diligent?

801
01:02:57,809 --> 01:02:59,949
That is why the ladies love him.

802
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,050
He has a face that ladies love.

803
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,949
What do you mean by that?

804
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:05,949
How should I put it?

805
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,289
He looks like the faithful type
that will only love one woman.

806
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,190
Unlike someone I know.

807
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,500
You mean, he looks like a swindler.

808
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:21,469
- He will hear.
- Let him hear.

809
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:22,800
Did I say anything wrong?

810
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,280
Look at him smile.

811
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,219
He looks more like a swindler now.

812
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,820
You. We need to talk.

813
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,170
It must have been tough getting here.

814
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:55,769
No, Your Highness.

815
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,469
I arrived safely thanks to
the monk soldier who guided me.

816
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:00,639
Is that so?

817
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:03,409
Seems like the monks are useful
in times like this.

818
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,210
Yes, Your Highness.

819
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:10,320
The bald men have become useful
now that there is a war.

820
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:13,119
Before that,

821
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,489
they only made tofu and paper
for the noble...

822
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:18,829
and got beat up at times.

823
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,599
What other use would they have?

824
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,300
But it is strange, is it not?

825
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,469
The country looks down on these monks.

826
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,639
How is it that
once the country is in danger,

827
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:32,869
those people put their lives
on the line to fight...

828
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,739
till their bald heads glisten with sweat?

829
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:37,480
- Hey, you!
- Oh, dear.

830
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,380
My apologies.

831
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:41,320
I speak without thinking, you see.

832
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,389
I applaud you for coming here
at the risk of your lives.

833
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:50,420
But why is it just you folks?

834
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:53,289
I am greatly disappointed.

835
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:54,900
His Majesty is here.

836
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,869
How can the people
of Joseon take their time...

837
01:04:57,869 --> 01:04:59,670
and prioritize their own lives?

838
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,570
At first,

839
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:05,969
you did not want to come, did you?

840
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:11,050
Did you also think that coming
to the fortress meant your death?

841
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,050
I did not.

842
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,079
Then,

843
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,949
did you think our court was foolish...

844
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:20,590
for being tricked by the Jin?

845
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,820
That is not the case.

846
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,389
His Majesty...

847
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:28,429
is wise enough
to flee before the people did.

848
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,530
I did not think he needed my lowly help...

849
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:36,199
Your Highness!

850
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,809
His Majesty is not any common folk.

851
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,880
Protecting his royal body...

852
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,480
is not just protecting the life
of a person.

853
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,119
His Majesty is Joseon.

854
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:53,719
To protect him means
to protect Joseon society.

855
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:56,190
Are you...

856
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,230
Are you that foolish
not to comprehend that?

857
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,559
Are you that ignorant not to know that?

858
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,730
How dare you send such a fool to me?

859
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,929
Your Highness.

860
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,269
I have sinned.

861
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:08,639
Kick him out.

862
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,800
Go and...

863
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,469
get rid of him
so I never have to see him again.

864
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,750
You fool!

865
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:22,119
How dare you say that to His Highness?

866
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:24,349
So why did you bother calling me?

867
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:25,650
I saw it.

868
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,119
Our troops won under your lead
when we fought against Yangguri.

869
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,730
In the end,

870
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:38,070
we still split up
without getting reinforcements.

871
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,670
You wasted your time.

872
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,039
No.

873
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,400
You earned us time...

874
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,469
and the refugees nearby were able to flee.

875
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,380
You and the volunteer army...

876
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,179
saved hundreds of innocent lives.

877
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,320
When it comes
to protecting people's lives,

878
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:55,820
you are serious.

879
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,750
That is why you lashed out
at His Highness.

880
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:59,150
But...

881
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,219
the people have your compassion.

882
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,190
Did I see wrong?

883
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,130
Rumor has it that Khan is here.

884
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,929
Although, we cannot be sure.

885
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:16,699
We tried to learn through an envoy,

886
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,940
but he would not meet with us
since Khan is touring Jin.

887
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,340
It must be a lie.

888
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,639
However,

889
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:25,050
if Khan is really here,

890
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,980
will the people of Joseon be fine?

891
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,230
Where were you?

892
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,969
How did you get injured?

893
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:49,739
Goodness.

894
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:57,480
Seems like Khan is here.

895
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,150
What?

896
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,619
No way.

897
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,989
It is a rumor.

898
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,019
- But...
- If Khan came here himself,

899
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,329
he might be out
to destroy Joseon completely.

900
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,630
We should not be here.
Let us leave the fortress and flee Joseon.

901
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,170
We only planned to lead
Young Master Yeon Jun here safely.

902
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:30,680
Lady Eun Ae told me something strange.

903
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,449
In that situation,

904
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,920
you did not look at anyone else...

905
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:42,420
but me,

906
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,520
is that true?

907
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,600
Still,

908
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:58,270
I was the first one you looked at, yes?

909
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,680
Darn it.

910
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:16,119
I plan to visit Jin's military camp.

911
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,529
(Nojin: Jin's military camp)

912
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:18,729
What?

913
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:20,659
If Khan is really here,

914
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,260
why is he risking his life...

915
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,800
to be here while they are still
at war with the Ming?

916
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,369
I shall go and find out.

917
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,539
Is that not what you want to know?

918
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:34,979
If you do that,
His Majesty will be pleased...

919
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,710
I am not doing it to please His Majesty.

920
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,949
There are two things in this world that
should not be left to last a long time.

921
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,050
The time spent on a toilet...

922
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,789
and war.

923
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,390
If I find out some useful information,

924
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,930
I am saying you should use it
to end the war.

925
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,500
Of course.

926
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,199
Tell me everything you need.

927
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,670
I do not need anything.

928
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,340
I just need Ryang Eum.

929
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,949
For every armed intruder,
there are one or two porters...

930
01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:19,350
who follow them around.

931
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,960
When porters are wounded or killed,

932
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,819
they are often left behind.

933
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:27,859
Ryang Eum and I
will become abandoned porters.

934
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,619
By the way,

935
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,460
why are you going?

936
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,229
You said you are not interested
in rescuing the King.

937
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,760
You want to know the reason?

938
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,470
The thing is,

939
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:10,239
I do not want to see you cry.

940
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:13,869
Are you saying you are going
because you do not want to see me?

941
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,579
I do not want to see you cry.

942
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,210
That is the same thing.

943
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,350
Also, how do you even know...

944
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,949
when I will cry?

945
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:28,489
There is something like that.

946
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
Right.

947
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,960
I must ask you to do something.

948
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,130
Since the Mongolian soldiers
are everywhere,

949
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,770
go to Ganghwa Island.

950
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:45,039
The intruders are strong on land,
but they are weak on water.

951
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,239
That is why the King has a lot of cannons
and provisions stored in Ganghwa Island.

952
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:51,380
Even his eldest grandson is there.

953
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,579
(Wonson: the king's grandson,
the Crown Prince's eldest son)

954
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:54,619
Even if Joseon becomes the enemy's den,

955
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:56,750
you will be safe on Ganghwa Island.

956
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:02,789
I now see that mulling is...

957
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:07,960
a method used by irresponsible people
to make it easy for them to slip away.

958
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,000
Do not worry about me.

959
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,170
You are not interested anyway, are you?

960
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:21,840
You know very well that we are
and will be suffering,

961
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:24,409
but you are choosing to flee again.

962
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:33,489
Then let us do this.

963
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,159
I swear by the moonlight.

964
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,800
Go to Ganghwa Island.

965
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,699
This time, wherever you are,

966
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:52,109
I will make sure...

967
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,739
I find you.

968
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:20,430
(My Dearest)

969
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:43,560
I received a letter from Jang Hyun.

970
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,729
It looks like something urgent
has happened to the enemies.

971
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:46,989
You were trying to get on
that boat, right?

972
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,100
Let us get on that boat as well.

973
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,760
My lady, I do not want to die.

974
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,470
You guys should go to the boat first.

975
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:55,100
Then, the people who were on that boat...

976
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,739
Send a boat to Ganghwa Island.

977
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,039
Do not come. This boat is not for you!

978
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,010
I need to check with my own eyes.

979
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,510
Run away!

980
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,710
The intruders are coming!

981
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:08,920
I am here to fight a battle
that I will not nor can lose.

982
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,119
Please.

983
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,989
From now on, no one can cross this point.

984
01:14:14,633 --> 01:14:19,008
