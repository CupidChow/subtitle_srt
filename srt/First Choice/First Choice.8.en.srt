00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,680
(First Choice Episode 8)

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
- Why? - Xie.

3
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,120
You want to be like her, don't you?

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Xie Bo Yang!

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Don't come near me!

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,200
- Zhao Zhao. - Mom.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Don't be rash.

8
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,400
Let Zhao Zhao and Ling Mei go.

9
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:34,566
I can pretend nothing happened.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,200
I've become like this...

11
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,419
because of the woman next to you.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You want me...

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,159
to pretend like nothing happened?

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,800
I can't do that, Mr. Huo.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,720
I'm the one you want to deal with,

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
right?

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,360
Then let them go.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,519
Don't you just want money?

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,880
Of course I want money.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
But no amount of money...

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
can quell the hatred in my heart!

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,280
- Zhao Zhao! - Don't come near me!

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Mom.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Don't touch her!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Take me.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Take me.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
- Take me! - Take me!

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
I fired you.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,720
I won't run. It's safer if it's me.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,080
What you want is money!

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm the chairman of Junyue.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,400
- Take me. - Bai Luo An.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,520
Two men...

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
want to die for you.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,800
- You're really something. - Mom.

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
I don't need them.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm Zhao Zhao's mother.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
You will be safest if it's me.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,040
What did I tell you?

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,879
You must listen to me.

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
Zhao Zhao is my child!

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Xie Bo Yang.

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Mr. Xie.

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,519
- You're the one who wants to die. - Mom.

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
I will grant you your wish.

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Zhao Zhao.

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,680
Mom.

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Mom.

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Zhao Zhao.

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,992
Zhao Zhao.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,069
Zhao Zhao, come here.

53
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,366
Zhao Zhao.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Huo Ling!

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
Zhao Zhao, come here.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,440
I'm glad you and Zhao Zhao are okay.

57
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,098
Mr. Huo.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Go.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
The police will be here soon.

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Okay.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
It's okay.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
(Hospital Room 602)

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,905
Huo Ling.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
You're awake.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,320
I'll get the doctor.

66
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,379
Don't go.

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,440
Whenever I think about how Xie Bo Yang almost hurt you,

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
I feel so scared.

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,480
I only feel safe...

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
when I can see you.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,640
But you're the one who got hurt.

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
- You shouldn't... - Luckily, it was me.

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
I told you before.

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,788
I won't let anything happen to you and Zhao Zhao.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Luo An.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,760
I don't want to torture myself anymore.

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
We missed out on five years.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
From now on,

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
let me protect you and Zhao Zhao.

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Okay?

81
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Huo Ling.

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,880
Starting over...

83
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,400
probably won't be better than what we have now.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
I'm doing fine now.

85
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
I have Zhao Zhao.

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I have a job.

87
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
I've started living again.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't move.

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
You...

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
You're bleeding. Let me see.

91
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:17,906
Bai Luo An.

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,000
Why can't we start over?

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
Ling. How did you get hurt?

94
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:29,493
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

95
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,375
You're not fine.

96
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
Silly child.

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,799
If you don't think about yourself,

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,360
you should think about me.

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
You're my only son.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
If anything happens to you,

101
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,329
what should I do?

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Xiao Bai.

103
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
I've long heard that you're back.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Auntie Pei.

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,800
What about Ling's injury?

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Has it got to do with you?

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
I owe it to Ling this time.

108
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,880
What do you mean?

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,360
If you do owe him, you have to pay him back.

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,240
It's a two-way street.

111
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,640
It can't be a clean break.

112
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,960
Don't you think so?

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Mom.

114
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
If there's nothing else,

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
you and Qing Yi should go home.

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Then...

117
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
I won't disturb you.

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
All right. You should get back to work.

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,680
Don't move. Lie down.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Ling.

121
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,199
Qing Yi and I came to see you,

122
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
but you only care about her.

123
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
- Do you know... - Min Yan!

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,640
It's getting late.

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,599
Take my mom and Ms. Shen home.

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,319
Ling, Auntie Pei is just concerned.

127
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,932
Now!

128
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,865
Ling.

129
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,440
You're doing this for an outsider.

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
Aren't you afraid of hurting my feelings?

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,439
Mom.

132
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,500
Have you ever cared about what I want?

133
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
All right.

134
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
Get some rest.

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Qing Yi.

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Let's go.

137
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Find out more about Zhao Zhao's background.

138
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,124
Also,

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
find out about Chen Wen Shi's relationship with Luo An.

140
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,690
All right.

141
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:28,912
I'll get right on it.

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
(Hospital Room 604)

143
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
What did the police say?

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,440
Xie Bo Yang has confessed.

145
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,920
He's been transferred to the prosecutor's office.

146
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
That's good.

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Wen Shi.

148
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Are you okay?

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm fine.

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,999
You can go back.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,560
I'll take care of her.

152
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
What's the difference?

153
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,600
You're still so courteous after all these years.

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,680
Thank you so much.

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,440
We've managed all this time...

156
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,600
thanks to your help.

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,640
If you keep this up, I'll really be angry with you.

158
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
It's been so many years.

159
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,959
I've always regarded Zhao Zhao as my daughter.

160
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,480
It's too late to disown me now.

161
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,959
Will I ever get the chance...

162
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,240
to be her dad?

163
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,120
In Zhao Zhao's heart, you'll always be her Daddy Long Legs.

165
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,600
Congratulations.

166
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,400
The Huo family will never accept Bai Luo An again.

167
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Shouldn't you try harder?

168
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
You've been by her side...

169
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,240
for so many years, but you still haven't made her accept you.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,320
Does she not see you as a man?

171
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Well, if Huo Ling sees you as a woman,

172
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,040
you wouldn't have come here and vented at me.

173
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
I told you before!

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
We're not enemies.

175
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
But we can't be friends.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,840
Do you know...

177
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,920
if Huo Ling finds out that Zhao Zhao is his child,

178
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
you won't stand a chance.

179
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Shen Qing Yi.

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,520
Huo Ling doesn't like you.

181
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,680
Is it worth all your effort?

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,880
At least I'm fighting for it,

183
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,413
unlike you.

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
You're just a coward...

185
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,640
pretending to be her friend.

186
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
Mr. Huo.

187
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Come in.

188
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Mr. Huo.

189
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,200
Your guess was right.

190
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,600
Zhao Zhao's birth date has indeed been altered.

191
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,720
I found the hospital Zhao Zhao was born in...

192
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,880
and discovered her real birth date.

193
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,359
It wasn't four years ago.

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,520
It was five years ago on New Year's Eve.

195
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,617
Really?

196
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,877
Say that again.

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,537
I said...

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
Zhao Zhao's real birthday...

199
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,320
is five years ago on New Year's Eve.

200
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm sure of it this time.

201
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,160
According to the timeline,

202
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,800
when you and Ms. Bai divorced,

203
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,760
she should have been three months pregnant.

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
After that, she worked as a waitress at a Western restaurant.

205
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,879
That's where she met...

206
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
Chen Wen Shi who performed there part-time.

207
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,319
Who gave her permission...

208
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,000
to have Zhao Zhao behind my back?

209
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
She even let Zhao Zhao...

210
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,560
call that flute player Daddy Long Legs.

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,639
Now she's trying to trick me.

212
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,720
If I weren't smart,

213
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
I'd never would have known I had a daughter.

214
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,760
I think she was afraid that if you knew,

215
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,160
you wouldn't let Zhao Zhao be born.

216
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
How is that possible?

217
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
After all, you hated her so much back then.

218
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,720
Even when she saved Old Madam,

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you thought...

220
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:04,640
she was asking for sympathy and forgiveness.

221
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
That's not the same thing.

222
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,560
Zhao Zhao is a life.

223
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
She has the same blood...

224
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,648
as I do.

225
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
No wonder every time I see Zhao Zhao,

226
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
I feel so close to her.

227
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,159
Blood ties...

228
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,200
are really strange.

229
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,520
You've never been a dad. You wouldn't understand.

230
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Not to mention...

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,400
Zhao Zhao and the young me...

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,680
look a lot alike.

233
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,600
You're right.

234
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Get me my phone.

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I need to buy something...

236
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
for Zhao Zhao.

237
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,239
Wait for me. I'll get it.

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
By the way, does your wound still hurt?

239
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,080
- It's okay. - Okay, I'll get the phone.
