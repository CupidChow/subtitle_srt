00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,720
(First Choice Episode 15)

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
Why do you have these?

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,400
Money is like water in a sponge.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Squeeze it,

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,000
and there'll be money.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,360
You have such a big appetite.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,720
Aren't you afraid of stuffing yourself to death?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,280
You're better off dreaming.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Serious offenders...

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,000
who maliciously slander others...

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,160
will be sentenced to up to three years in prison.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
Do you think you can put me in jail...

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,080
with these?

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,642
Bai Luo An.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,800
Not only do you have a big appetite,

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,039
you're also pretty ridiculous.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,560
So you won't do it?

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,759
I won't do it.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,760
What can you do?

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Five years ago,

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,160
when you first returned to the country,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,560
you immediately went to the Huo family to catch up with them.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
After that,

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,240
you entered Junyue's headquarters as an intern.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,600
If I remember correctly,

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,360
you were in the department directly under Huo Ling.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
That month,

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Huo Ling and I got divorced.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
What do you mean?

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,920
Are you trying to say...

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm the mistress who came between you two?

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Bai Luo An.

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
How dare you accuse me?

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,040
You're the one who came later!

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Thanks to you,

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,160
I've been getting a lot of attention online.

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
If people find out...

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,040
that Ms. Shen didn't even spare the ex-wife,

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,600
how would they scold you?

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,480
Mr. Shen loves you very much, doesn't he?

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,560
If a father finds out...

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
that his own daughter...

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,240
will be called a mistress for the rest of her life,

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,559
he'd be heartbroken.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
You...

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,640
If you haven't contacted this lawyer...

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,240
by this time tomorrow,

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,120
then everything I just said...

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,880
will be posted online.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Zhao Zhao.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,120
Daddy, let's go to the Hot Spring Park tomorrow.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Sure.

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,399
I need to talk to Mom.

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Go play.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,520
I heard you resigned.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Yes.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,999
I'll have plenty of time...

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
to spend with you and Zhao Zhao.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,639
Dejia's land development is important to you.

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I know that.

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,560
I don't want you to sacrifice yourself for me and Zhao Zhao.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
I don't think of it as a sacrifice.

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
You and Zhao Zhao...

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
are the most important to me.

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
But...

66
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
All right.

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
If you really want to make it up to me,

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
stop frowning.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Smile.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Smile.

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
What are you doing?

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
(Hot Spring Hotel)

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,040
What? There's only one room left?

74
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,599
Can you check again?

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
When I booked it yesterday, we could still choose the type of room.

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,199
I'm sorry, ma'am. Apart from the room you booked,

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,280
the whole park has been booked today.

78
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Booked?

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,920
You did this, didn't you?

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,560
Does it hurt, Daddy?

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,640
Zhao Zhao, you're really...

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Get up.

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
My hair.

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
(Chen Wen Shi calling)

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,690
Zhao Zhao.

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Get some rest.

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I have to take this call.

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
(Chen Wen Shi calling)

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
Hello, Chen Wen Shi.

90
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Are you looking for Luo An?

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
She's...

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
in the shower.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
What's the matter?

94
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Nothing?

95
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
There's no hurry?

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,640
If there's no hurry,

97
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,400
don't disturb our family of three.

98
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Get down.

99
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
Mom.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,680
Zhao Zhao, you must be sleepy.

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Go to bed early.

102
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
Daddy. Why aren't you sleeping with us tonight?

103
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Daddy...

104
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
will sleep on the floor.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Zhao Zhao.

106
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Go to bed now.

107
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,400
I'll turn off the lights and go to bed.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,559
Sleep early so you can wake up early and play tomorrow.

109
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Okay?

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay.

111
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Luo An.

112
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm... Well...

113
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm afraid of the dark.

114
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Sorry, I forgot.

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
It's okay.

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,400
You remembered that I like pork liver porridge.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
I want Daddy to sleep with me.

118
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay.

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,040
Scoot over, Zhao Zhao.

120
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
Come, Zhao Zhao.

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,978
Go to sleep, Zhao Zhao.

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Lie down with me.

123
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Come on.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Why is it so hot?

125
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
Don't think too much.

126
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
You can do it.

127
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Go to sleep.

128
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Luo An.

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
I can wait.

130
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,760
I can wait until you accept me.

131
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Luo An.

132
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Luo An.

133
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Zhao Zhao.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Have some juice.

135
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,160
That's enough. Come and have some juice.

136
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,840
I'll get it for you.

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Are you tired?

138
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm not tired.

139
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm going to play.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

141
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,840
I haven't seen Zhao Zhao so happy in a long time.

142
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Why?

143
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,280
Do you think I'm just an unscrupulous businessman?

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,760
All I think about is how to make money?

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
You know yourself very well.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't worry.

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
I won't let Zhao Zhao take over the family business.

148
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,320
She won't become like me.

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,560
All I think about is...

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
how to be number one.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Toys? Friends?

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
They will only hinder Junyue's future.

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
I won't let Zhao Zhao...

154
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,400
live this kind of life.

155
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
That's why...

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,760
I just want to see Zhao Zhao...

157
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,280
grow up healthy and happy.

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Whatever she does,

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
I'll give her my full support.

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
What's wrong with someone like you?

161
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,080
You're outstanding and smart.

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
To Zhao Zhao,

163
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,080
you're the best dad in the world.

164
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,280
To me, you're the best...

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the best...

166
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
The best what?

167
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Nothing.

168
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm...

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
a little hungry.

170
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,560
I'm going to get something to eat.

171
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,520
Zhao Zhao, let's go.

172
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Are you okay?

173
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I'm a little dizzy.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
I'll take you back to get some rest.

175
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm fine.

176
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,360
I've just been in the hot spring for too long.

177
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm a little dizzy.

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,720
You can play with Zhao Zhao a little longer.

179
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll be fine after I rest.

180
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay.

181
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Zhao Zhao.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Come on.

183
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Huo Ling?

184
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
What are you doing?

185
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:19,586
Guess.

186
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Ready?

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,600
Happy birthday to you

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
Happy birthday to you

189
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Happy birthday to you

190
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Happy birthday to you

191
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
Thank you, baby.

192
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Be careful of the fire.

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,959
Mom. I asked Daddy to find this seashell for me.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,520
I used it to make a necklace for you.

195
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,880
It's so pretty.

196
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,640
Mom, put it on.

197
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,480
You're so pretty, Mom.

198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,560
Zhao Zhao is also the prettiest little girl...

199
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,120
in the world.

200
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Let's blow out the candle.

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,600
Let's go. Let's blow out the candle.

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,120
Let's do it together.

203
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,400
- Come. - Make a wish.

204
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,200
Okay.

205
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Come.

206
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,560
One, two, three.

207
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
The tadpole asks the duckling,

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,120
"Have you seen my mother?"

209
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,080
The duckling says, "No."

210
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
The tadpole...

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
moves forward again...

212
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,000
to the next person...

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,280
to ask where its mother is.

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,599
(I wonder if I can invite the most beautiful princess...

215
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,840
to come dance with me)

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
Mr. Huo, you shouldn't have.

217
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
It's worth it.
