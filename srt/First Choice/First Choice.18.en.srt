00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,600
(First Choice Episode 18)

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,480
I've got a piece of good news...

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,440
that I haven't had the chance to tell you.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,880
Luo An and I are getting remarried.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
She'll be Mrs. Huo soon.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,720
Does she have the right to stand here now?

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Uncle Gong?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Mr. Huo.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
Are you admitting that you're doing this for personal reasons?

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
I admit that I stopped Dejia's development,

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,000
but that was not because of Bai Luo An.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,200
It's because during my time at Dejia,

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,520
I saw its purpose for existing...

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,800
and its vitality.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Here,

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,200
people can feel the charm of art.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,800
And through art,

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,000
they can relieve mental stress and illness.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,400
If it weren't for Dejia,

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
none of this would exist.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,679
This is a business.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,880
We're not running a charity.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,279
Don't you know...

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,600
you're affecting the company by repeatedly delaying it?

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,240
Don't worry about that.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Shareholders,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
Junyue and Ningxin...

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
have reached a strategic agreement.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
They're investing in the company.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
This is the collaboration agreement.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,399
I think this result...

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
will satisfy everyone.

33
00:01:25,907 --> 00:01:26,907
As for you,

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,960
I asked you to take over Dejia's development.

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
But what have you done?

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
You asked Uncle Gong to sell it...

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,640
to relieve the deficit you caused.

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Don't think that just because you're careful,

39
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
no one would know about it.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Where's the proof of that?

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
I suggest you sort yourself out first.

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,120
You are blind now.

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Do you still want to take over the company?

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Here.

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Let me see.

46
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,000
Who would want a blind man as their chairman?

47
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
What are you talking about, Huo Wei?

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,400
Why do you always hide behind a woman?

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,200
Be a man,

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Huo Ling.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Huo Wei.

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
You're my brother.

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,359
You shouldn't be used by outsiders...

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
to hurt your own family.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
Stop with the nonsense.

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,400
If you can, prove that you're not blind.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,600
If I remember correctly,

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
this blue shirt...

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,320
was my gift to you last year, right?

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Although his eyes were injured previously,

61
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,999
the main cause of his blindness...

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is the pressure on the nerves caused by the blood clots in your brain.

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,999
I just checked.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
Mr. Huo's eyes seem to be reacting to light.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Perhaps after the surgery,

66
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,680
the blood clots are starting to dissipate.

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Doctor.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
How long will it take for me to fully recover?

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm not sure about that.

70
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,920
It depends on your condition.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,640
Get some rest first.

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
That's great.

73
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,160
I'll inform Ms. Bai.

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
There's no need.

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
The fewer people know about this, the better.

76
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,040
Since they all think I'm blind,

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll keep up the act.

78
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
That way, they'll let their guard down.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,880
I know what to do.

80
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,880
You're not blind.

81
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
How is that possible?

82
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
If I don't do this,

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,520
how can I draw you out?

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Uncle Gong.

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
These are your men, right?

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
They've all been caught.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,040
If I call the police now,

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,266
Huo Wei,

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
what will happen to you?

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,280
You're also involved in my mom's fall, right?

91
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Uncle Gong.

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
What do you think?

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Min Yan, call the police.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Let her go.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
All of you, get out of here!

96
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,520
What are you doing, Huo Wei?

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm sorry, An An.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Drive.

99
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,760
- Huo Ling. - Luo An.

100
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Luo An!

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Xiao Wei.

102
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,052
An An.

103
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,239
It's time to eat.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,640
It's noodles with tomato and egg.

105
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
When I was at the orphanage,

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,640
didn't I often make this for you?

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes. but no matter how I made from then on...

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,520
I couldn't make it taste the same.

109
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
You had just arrived at the orphanage.

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
You were so skinny.

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
As for me,

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,600
I didn't know how to cook.

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
I only knew how to make this.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I thought...

115
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:41,480
I could make you eat more,

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
grow bigger and taller.

117
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,040
That way, when other kids bully you,

118
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
you can protect yourself.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,680
If it were possible,

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
I'd rather not grow up.

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,200
If I weren't the Huo family's illegitimate son,

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,720
I could have stayed in the orphanage...

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,960
with you forever.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,920
What happened to you in the Huo family all these years?

125
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Why did you turn out this way?

126
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,760
Let's eat.

127
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,819
Xiao Wei.

128
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
From now on,

129
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm your mother.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
After they brought me back to the Huo family,

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,120
at one point, I thought I had a home...

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,000
and a family.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,479
But when I found out who I really was,

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
I realized...

135
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,240
Fu Wan Pei had never truly accepted me.

136
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,040
She was just afraid.

137
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,279
She was afraid I'd take everything from Huo Ling.

138
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,000
That's why she raised me away from the family.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,119
It wasn't until Huo Ling lost his sight in a car accident...

140
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
that she brought me home.

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,880
It's funny.

142
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
At that time,

143
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,639
I treasured even the slightest bit...

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,160
of fake warmth.

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Here, Xiao Wei.

146
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Have some more.

147
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Thank you, Mom.

148
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
How do you like living at home?

149
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,039
- Eat more. - Okay.

150
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
You're too skinny.

151
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Ling.

152
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Eat up.

153
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
You too, Mom.

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,280
Okay.

155
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,600
But it didn't take long for Huo Ling to recover.

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
So I became a pawn,

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,400
a pawn...

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
that was hated by others.

159
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,920
Mom.

160
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Ling.

161
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Are you okay?

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
I'm fine.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,119
It was not like that, Xiao Wei.

164
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,839
They've never accepted me!

165
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,919
They've never loved me!

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,879
Why did they bring me back?

167
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,679
I had just lost my mother.

168
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,599
And then I lost you.

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,279
Why do they get to take away...

170
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,400
everything I have?

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,480
It's because I have the blood of the Huo family.

172
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,800
That's the meaning of my life.

173
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Xiao Wei.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,160
You didn't do anything wrong.

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,199
Don't punish yourself for other people's mistakes.

176
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
You don't understand anything.

177
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
An An.

179
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You're not me.

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
How can you feel my pain?

181
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,400
How can I let them off so easily?

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,400
I'll make them know...

183
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,120
what it's like to lose everything.

184
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,280
Xiao Wei, that's not true.

185
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
It's not like that!

186
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
Say goodbye to your teacher.

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Bye.

188
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Xuan Xuan, I'm here.

189
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,760
Bye.

190
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Come, Bei Bei.

191
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Grandma is here, right?

192
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Okay.

193
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
- Bye. - Okay.

194
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,576
Mr. Huo.

195
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,226
How did it go?

196
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,199
The car was abandoned...

197
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
in an old parking lot.

198
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
There are no security cameras.

199
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
I don't know where their final destination is.

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
But I've sent people...

201
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,520
to look for them in all the possible places.

202
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm sure we'll find something soon.

203
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,720
I failed to protect Luo An.

204
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
I didn't think Huo Wei would do that.

205
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,680
Mr. Huo. It happened so suddenly.

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,120
Don't blame yourself.

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Besides,

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,000
Mr. Huo and Ms. Bai...

209
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,640
have known each other since they were in the orphanage.

210
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,080
I don't think he'll let anything happen to Ms. Bai.

211
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I hope Huo Wei...

212
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760
won't go to the point of no return.

213
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,040
I'll call Huo Ling later.

214
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
Think carefully before talking.

215
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,960
Or I'll kill you.
