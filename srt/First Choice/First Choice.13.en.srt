00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,560
(First Choice Episode 13)

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,160
We trusted you!

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,840
How could you let our children use toxic paint?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Parents, please calm down.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,560
This must be a misunderstanding.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,040
Misunderstanding? My Xiao Bao took your drawing class...

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
and pooped all night.

8
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,680
Now he's in the hospital with an IV drip!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If anything happens to our Liang Liang,

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,520
I'll haunt you from beyond the grave!

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,559
Yuexin has repeatedly challenged...

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Dejia's bottom line...

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
and played with children's lives.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
I hereby announce...

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,519
that from today onwards,

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,680
Yuexin's partnership with Dejia is terminated.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,719
We also reserve the right to sue Yuexin...

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,240
for damages to Dejia's finances...

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
and reputation.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
The matter hasn't been investigated.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
You're jumping to conclusions...

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,200
based on the parents' words.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,379
Mr. Huo.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,440
- Isn't that too arbitrary? - Arbitrary?

25
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:16,465
Bai Luo An.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,039
Haven't you implicated Dejia enough?

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,840
We've put up with you for a long time.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
Is it Dejia who doesn't want to put up with me...

29
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:27,415
or is it you, Ms. Shen?

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,021
You...

31
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,267
Ling.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,360
Many reporters are already getting wind of this.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,279
If we don't shut it down now,

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
we'll be implicated for sure.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Also,

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,520
Junyue will hold a board meeting soon.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
We can't afford any mistakes.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Ms. Bai.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Dejia will send an investigation team to investigate this.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
In the meantime,

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,640
cooperate with the Art Center's investigation.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,920
I'll be honest with you.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,520
Dejia's acquisition...

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,760
was not done for the sake of art.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,280
It was because of this land.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,880
Huo Ling wants to demolish the Art Center.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,039
Dejia has taken over...

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
the most desirable spot in Ning City.

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,440
I don't think anyone...

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,199
would do that...

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,080
just for art or charity.

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,080
It's the chance to build a business district worth 10 billion.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
What a pity.

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,720
The project you've worked so hard on for so many years...

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,880
will be torn down...

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
along with this building.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,760
I didn't acquire Dejia for charity.

58
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
From now on,

59
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
I'll try my best to be a good dad.

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
Dad! I have a dad now!

61
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Here.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
I'll feed you.

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
I want this.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Don't buy her too much.

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,040
Kids need to eat more.

66
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
It's okay.

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,240
I've made it through these years.

68
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I can do it.

69
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Find out...

70
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
who instructed the parents...

71
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,320
to make a ruckus.

72
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,480
Shen Qing Yi is so aggressive.

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,920
I think someone doesn't want me to go back to Junyue...

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,600
and is using the Healing Gallery...

75
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
as an excuse.

76
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Understood.

77
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,298
Who is it?

78
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,719
Liang Liang's mom? Please hold on.

79
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,079
How dare you come here? If it weren't for you,

80
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,760
Liang Liang wouldn't have to suffer like this.

81
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Liang Liang's mom.

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Don't be mad.

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm here to explain the situation to you today.

84
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Look at this.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
This is our work log.

86
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I brought it with me.

87
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,080
It has the kids' sign-in sheet.

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This day,

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
which is 10 days ago,

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,359
Liang Liang had a low fever...

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
and couldn't attend our therapy class.

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
He took the day off.

93
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,959
The next time he came to our therapy class...

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,320
was a week later.

95
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,240
In this class,

96
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
Liang Liang already had small rashes...

97
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,640
on his mouth and hands.

98
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,160
Coincidentally,

99
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
the kids in that particular class...

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
also claimed to be allergic to the paint.

101
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
That's because they used your toxic paint.

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
What? Are you turning the blame on me?

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,480
No. That's not what I meant.

104
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Regarding the paint,

105
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,200
we have an explanation here.

106
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
Look at this.

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,599
This is the production and operation license...

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,160
for the paint we use at the Healing Gallery.

109
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,320
It says it's all-natural.

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
It meets the criteria.

111
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,040
As for the rest of the paints,

112
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
we've already sent them to the relevant department...

113
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
for quality testing.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,239
If anything happens,

115
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,840
we'll be responsible to the end.

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,240
So the reason I'm here today...

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,399
is I'm hoping...

118
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,959
that you can take your child to the hospital...

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
for a checkup...

120
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
to see if the cause of the allergy...

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,440
is our paint,

122
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,640
or if it's hand, foot, and mouth disease.

123
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,159
What are you talking about? Get out of my house!

124
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Liang Liang's mom, you...

125
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Have you cried enough?

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,160
Do you have the energy to carry luggage?

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
I don't.

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
Didn't you want to avoid suspicion?

129
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Why are you back?

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,600
As the people in charge of Dejia and Yuexin,

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
we should avoid suspicion.

132
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,680
But I missed you two.

133
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't move.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,879
I'm the one who's hurt.

135
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,239
Why are you yelling at me?

136
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,560
You're injured, but you're still acting tough.

137
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,060
I shouldn't have placed it directly.

138
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
It might be a bit irritating.

139
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,640
The gallery was framed.

140
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I know.

141
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,240
It all started because of me.

142
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
I've already sent Min Yan to deal with it.

143
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,520
I need more time.

144
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Huo Ling.

145
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Are you hiding something from me?

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
No.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Huo.

148
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,920
When were you going to tell me...

149
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
about Dejia's land development project?

150
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
What did Shen Qing Yi say to you?

151
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,520
That Junyue acquired Dejia for its land...

152
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
and will demolish the Art Center overnight?

153
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Bai Luo An.

154
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Don't you know how I feel about you?

155
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Are you suspecting me?

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
Don't you have a conscience?

157
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm nothing.

158
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
How can I compare...

159
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,080
to a multi-billion-dollar real estate project?

160
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
Besides, you were in cahoots with Shen Qing Yi that day.

161
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
Who's the one without a conscience?

162
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Are you jealous...

163
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,960
of me and Shen Qing Yi?

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm not.

165
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Fine.

166
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
You are not.

167
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Luo An.

168
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,240
I did come to Dejia...

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,640
for the land development project.

170
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,480
But when I saw...

171
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
what you did...

172
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,960
for Zhao Zhao...

173
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,400
and the children at the Healing Gallery,

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I gave up on...

175
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,840
tearing down the Art Center.

176
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
And because of that,

177
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,920
Junyue's board of directors are dissatisfied with me.

178
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,640
What happened at the Healing Gallery wasn't simple.

179
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,480
The true culprit...

180
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,265
isn't Shen Qing Yi.

181
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Give me some time.

182
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,960
I can handle it.

183
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,280
I can find out the truth on my own.

184
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,880
But if Shen Qing Yi is involved,

185
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,680
don't worry too much about her.

186
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Silly girl.

187
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,040
I only feel sorry for you and Zhao Zhao.

188
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Luo An.

189
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,960
I know you're capable.

190
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
You can take good care of Zhao Zhao on your own.

191
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,320
But I just hope...

192
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,920
that when you need help the most,

193
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,480
I'll be the person you rely on the most.
