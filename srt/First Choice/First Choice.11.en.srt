00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
(First Choice Episode 11)

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Bai Luo An.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Do you think...

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,560
I should donate my blood?

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
You...

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,360
My blood type is AB.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
I'll go.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Bai Luo An.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,520
Why didn't you tell me when you had Zhao Zhao?

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,480
Was it fun to lie to me?

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
How could I tell you?

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,400
You hated me so much back then.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,200
Drop your hypocritical sincerity!

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
If I had told you, would you have let me have her?

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,360
You'll think I'm using the baby as leverage.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
So?

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
Are you trying to take revenge on me...

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,400
by making my daughter call someone else her dad?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
We've been divorced for years!

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,239
You are marrying Shen Qing Yi.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,360
Leave me alone!

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Doctor,

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
How's my daughter?

24
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,959
She's in good condition.

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,240
She'll be out soon.

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Thank you.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Qing Yi.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Look at this flower. Does it look good in this vase?

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Qing Yi?

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,719
What's wrong with you lately?

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
You've been absent-minded.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,199
Did Ling bully you again?

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
No.

34
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,280
He's nice to me.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Ling.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
Why did you suddenly come back?

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Mrs. Zhang's stewed fish maw is quite good today.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
I was just about to ask someone to bring it to you.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
There's no need.

40
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,720
I just came back from the hospital. I have no appetite.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Why did you go to the hospital again?

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,379
Are you unwell?

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,705
I'm fine.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
It's Zhao Zhao.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
She's in the hospital.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Zhao Zhao?

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Mom.

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
There's something I need to tell you.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
When Luo An and I divorced,

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
she was already pregnant.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Zhao Zhao...

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,440
is your granddaughter.

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
Ling, any child of the Huos...

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,160
must be brought back.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
But...

56
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm only talking about the child.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
Her mother is just her mother.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,640
You know what I mean, right?

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Mom.

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Luo An raised Zhao Zhao on her own.

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
She can't live without her mom.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
I want to give Zhao Zhao a complete family.

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Auntie Pei.

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Ling.

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Uncle Shen is your biggest supporter at Junyue.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Moreover,

67
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,120
you and Qing Yi...

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
have been together for so many years.

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Everyone knows about your relationship.

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
If you do this,

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,440
you'll be letting Qing Yi down.

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Ever since I was little,

73
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
you've arranged how my life should go.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I know,

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,880
after my father passed away,

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
you supported the company and the family alone.

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
It wasn't easy.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
But this time,

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
I won't listen to you anymore.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,520
If you don't accept Luo An,

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
you will lose me as your son.

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Qing Yi.

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
You and Ling...

84
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,760
are not meant to be.

85
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Ling.

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,200
Ling!

87
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,480
Ling.

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Please.

89
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,159
You have no idea how much I love you.

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Love me?

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,240
Loving me means bribing Ling Mei...

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,240
to release the photos of me and Luo An?

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,759
Loving me means using my mom to control me?

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,120
That's not love!

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,760
That's just your selfish possessiveness.

96
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,760
You knew about it?

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Luo An lied to you,

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,560
yet you still can't forget her.

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
I made one little mistake...

100
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
and you won't let it go.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
No matter what I do,

102
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,920
I can't win your heart back.

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Does our past...

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
mean nothing to you?

105
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Stop it.

106
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
They're watching.

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
No.

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
No way.

109
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,680
Stop it. They're watching.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm rehearsing.

111
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,826
Wait for me over there.

112
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,273
Stop it. I'll be done soon. Go.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Be good.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,360
You let me go first.

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
If the Shen family wants to call off the engagement, so be it.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,880
I, Huo Ling,

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,160
will not be manipulated by anyone!

118
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,920
When I was in despair,

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,920
Luo An was by my side.

120
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,560
She's the one I truly love.

121
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Are you here to laugh at me?

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,640
Or to see how pathetic I am?

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
How pitiful I am?

124
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Qing Yi.

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,200
I've treated you as my sister-in-law all these years.

126
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
My brother treats you this way.

127
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,760
So even though I'm his brother, I can't stand it.

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
That's how he is.

129
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,439
It's so easy for him...

130
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,080
to say all those fancy words.

131
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
They say love is precious.

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
But in reality,

133
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
it's nothing.

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
You're right.

135
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
What's sincerity?

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
What's devotion?

137
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
They're all worthless in the face of reality and profit.

138
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,880
I want to see...

139
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
how much Bai Luo An's heart...

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,400
is worth to Huo Ling.

141
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
What are you doing?

142
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
It's obvious.

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
From today onwards,

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,960
I'll be living here.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,040
I've made it clear to you.

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,680
There's nothing between us.

147
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
I've told my mom and Shen Qing Yi everything.

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,840
It's all done.

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,360
It doesn't matter if you don't accept me.

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
But I hope you won't reject me...

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
and let me stay to take care of Zhao Zhao.

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Do you know what you're saying?

153
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,480
I just want to stay by Zhao Zhao's side...

154
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,880
to make up for the five years I was gone.

155
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
I missed my chance once.

156
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,880
I don't want to miss it again.

157
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Besides,

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Zhao Zhao has just been discharged from the hospital.

159
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,760
She needs to change her dressing and go for follow-ups.

160
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
There will come a time when you can't do it alone.

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
You'll need someone to help you.

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Right?

163
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,240
Wen Shi will be here.

164
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,280
Are you kidding me?

165
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I won't let...

166
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,640
that flute player get closer to Zhao Zhao.

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
Not only will I not leave,

168
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
I'll also block the way.

169
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Lower your voice.

170
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Besides,

171
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
isn't it good to have another person...

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,880
doting on Zhao Zhao?

173
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,640
I want her to accept me as soon as possible.

174
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
If you want to bond with your daughter,

175
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
you can do that anytime.

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
But you don't have to live here.

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes.

178
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,399
But I got kicked out of the house...

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,839
for disobeying my mom.

180
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,240
I have nowhere to go now.

181
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,920
I can only stay at a hotel then.

182
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
There'll be people taking pictures of me.

183
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
How can I build a perfect, fatherly image...

184
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,360
in front of Zhao Zhao?

185
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,240
You don't want Zhao Zhao's dad...

186
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,880
to be a womanizer, do you?

187
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
You...

188
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
You...

189
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,280
You can sleep in Zhao Zhao's room.

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Huo Ling?

191
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
He's gone?

192
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,040
He's not used to living here.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
What are you thinking about?

194
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,360
You scared me.

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Why aren't you sleeping?

196
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,120
What's the big deal?

197
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,440
I want to sleep...
