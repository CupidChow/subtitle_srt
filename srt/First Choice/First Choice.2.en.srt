00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,720
(First Choice Episode 2)

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,080
- Zhao Zhao. - Mom!

3
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:16,787
Zhao Zhao. Why did you come here alone?

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
Uncle.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,000
This is your daughter?

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
It's none of your business.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,840
Mom.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,559
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
I lost the little sun.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,240
It's okay.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,440
Zhao Zhao is my sun.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,400
Do you mean this?

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,400
Uncle. Why do you have the same one?

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
I kept it...

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
as a reminder of my naivety back then.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,399
I thought you really loved me.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
(Six years ago)

18
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:13,960
So all of this was fake?

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,335
Let me explain.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Stop it!

21
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,885
Yes, I admit it!

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,719
I got close to you with an ulterior motive.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
But...

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,360
But then I...

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,840
I have sincere feelings for you.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,960
We've been together for so long, Huo Ling.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,520
Drop your hypocritical sincerity!

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
The divorce papers have been drafted.

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Don't let me see you again.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
But it's useless now.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,720
Because I have someone more unforgettable now.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Mr. Huo.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Are you all right?

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
Mr. Xie has been taken away.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,840
I just didn't expect such an incident would happen...

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
right after we acquired Dejia.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
You acquired Dejia?

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
What do you want to do?

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,652
Why?

40
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,739
Are you scared?

41
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:31,797
Bai Luo An.

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,840
You have to pay...

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
for your wrongdoings.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
Find out when Bai Luo An had her child.

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Also,

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,640
suspend all of Dejia's projects.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
The little moles...

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,880
finally found their father after many hardships.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Their dad...

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,760
ate too many fermented grapes...

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,080
and passed out by a big tree.

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,080
He was sleeping soundly.

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,400
Mom.

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,000
When can I see my dad?

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Didn't I tell you...

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,880
that your dad is a prince?

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
To keep world peace,

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,480
he's currently fighting with dragons.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,480
When Zhao Zhao grows up,

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,920
Dad will come back.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Mom.

63
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't want to go to kindergarten.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,959
They think I'm not healthy.

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,440
They won't play with me.

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Then don't go.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
Then,

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
go to work with me tomorrow, okay?

69
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Okay.

70
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,880
(Chen Wen Shi)

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Hello, Wen Shi?

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,783
Xiao Bai.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Is Zhao Zhao all right?

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,004
She's fine.

75
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,280
She sneaked over to see me.

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Don't worry.

77
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,560
I'm not charming.

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,240
I can't keep the older one.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
I can't keep the younger one either.

80
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:50,785
Chen Wen...

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,640
Chen Wen Shi, be serious.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Okay.

83
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,267
Okay, as long as she's fine.

84
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,553
I have to go.

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,480
Okay. Bye.

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Zhao Zhao.

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Today, I encountered a big problem in my life.

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't know what to do either.

89
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,320
But for you,

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,679
I'll work hard to continue...

91
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,040
the art healing project.

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
(Director's Office, Dejia Art Center)

93
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,479
Ms. Bai, have a seat here.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
The new director will be here soon.

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,640
(Shen Qing Yi, new director of Dejia Art Center)

96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Shen Qing Yi.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
Do you have anything else to say?

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,279
You don't deserve Ling's love.

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
(Six years ago)

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,640
Do you want to tell him?

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
Or should I?

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll tell him myself.

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,960
You're the new director?

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
Auntie Pei arranged it.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,160
The matter has blown up.

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,159
There's no one suitable for this job for now.

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,560
I've been with Ling all these years.

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm familiar with Junyue.

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,767
Don't worry.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,960
My relationship with Huo Ling is all in the past now.

111
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,960
I only care about my project now.

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,920
Ling?

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
When did you get here?

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,080
A while ago.

115
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Ms. Bai.

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Regarding Mr. Xie,

117
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,880
the Group has set up an investigation team to investigate.

118
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,120
Since your project is involved,

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
we can only put it on hold.

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,639
We can only resume the evaluation...

121
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,000
after the investigation results are out.

122
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
This is also what Mr. Huo wants.

123
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,160
Why is Shen Qing Yi the new director?

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,960
Old Madam just notified us today.

125
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,480
We just found out too.

126
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Do as my mother wishes.

127
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
How is the investigation into her child going?

128
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
All we know so far is...

129
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,520
that Zhao Zhao was born four years ago on New Year's Eve.

130
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,840
That was a year after you divorced Ms. Bai.

131
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Don't worry.

132
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,440
My relationship with Huo Ling is all in the past now.

133
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
All I care about now is my project.

134
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
You're lying. Admit it.

135
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,719
I'm not lying.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,919
-My dad is a prince! -Why is it so noisy?

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,559
That's Ms. Bai's art healing project...

138
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
at our art center.

139
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,800
I told them to stop.

140
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,160
I don't know why it's still going on.

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
I'll ask them to move out now.

142
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,916
It's okay.

143
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
My dad is a prince.

144
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
You're lying. Admit it.

145
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Look.

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,599
How can a prince in a fairy tale...

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,280
be her dad?

148
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Zhao Zhao is obviously lying.

149
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,720
Yes, she's lying.

150
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,079
I'm not lying!

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
My dad is the most handsome prince.

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go back to work.

153
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,519
Zhao Zhao is lying and bluffing.

154
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,519
Let's not play with her.

155
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,159
Yes, we don't play with liars.

156
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,280
Fine, don't play with me.

157
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Zhao Zhao.

158
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Are you okay?

159
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Daddy Prince.

160
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,039
Look, this is my Daddy Prince.

161
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,240
Isn't he handsome?

162
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Zhao Zhao.

163
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,080
Didn't I tell you...

164
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
not to just call anyone your dad?

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Ling?

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,800
Why are you still here?

167
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Zhao Zhao!

168
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,059
Daddy Long Legs!

169
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,206
- Daddy Long Legs! - I've missed you so much.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I've missed you.

171
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,039
Chen Wen Shi.

172
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,159
And you too, little Zhao Zhao.

173
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,200
Right? Give me a kiss.

174
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,954
Who is he?

175
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,093
He's a flautist who just won an international award.

176
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,280
But I've never heard of him getting married.

177
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,240
Hello, Mr. Chen.

178
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm Shen Qing Yi, the new acting director of Dejia.

179
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
May I have the honor...

180
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,480
of inviting you to perform at Dejia?

181
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,960
Come on, Zhao Zhao.

182
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Ms. Shen.

183
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,360
Dejia is one of the best concert halls domestically.

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680
It's not a stage that just any so-called artist can perform on.

185
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Art is never about technique.

186
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,360
It's about facing the art with a sincere and pure heart.

187
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,365
Mr. Huo.

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,605
What do you think?

189
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,240
Of course.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,440
I've been thinking about accepting some solo recitals.

191
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,640
But I trust Xiao Bai's judgment more.

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
Wherever Xiao Bai's project is,

193
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
that's where I'll be.

194
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,120
Since Mr. Chen said so,

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,520
we don't have to force him.

196
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
After all,

197
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,480
there's no shortage of artists in this world.

198
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Therefore,

199
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,560
Ms. Bai, please move out as soon as possible.

200
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,760
Don't affect our operations here.

201
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Businessmen...

202
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,480
don't understand art and romance.

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
It's understandable.

204
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Without the support of a material economy,

205
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,640
art and romance are just words.

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,320
Zhao Zhao!

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,520
- Zhao Zhao, what's wrong? - Zhao Zhao!

208
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,152
- Don't scare me. - Get out of my way!

209
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,177
Zhao Zhao.

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,458
Zhao Zhao.

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,752
Huo Ling!

212
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:01,672
Huo Ling!
