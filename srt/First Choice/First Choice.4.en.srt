00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,640
(First Choice Episode 4)

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Bai Luo An.

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,720
Are you worried about me?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
You're Dejia's investor.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,840
If anything happens to you,

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,600
Yuexin will go down with you.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Let go.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,839
I said, let go!

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Let go?

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,279
You disappeared for five years when I let go.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,600
You even got married and had a kid with someone else.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,079
Bai Luo An. You're so cruel.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,520
When did I...

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,439
We've each started our lives over.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,959
Let's not pester each other.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
First, it was Gu Xiao Yu. Now, it's Chen Wen Shi.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,480
What do they have that I don't?

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,239
I said let go!

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
Let go!

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Let go!

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,160
Let go of me!

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Huo Ling!

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Huo Ling!

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Let go!

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Let go!

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Let go of me, Huo Ling!

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Let go!

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,200
Any news from Shen Qing Yi?

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,920
(Six years ago)

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Mr. Huo.

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Have some water.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Xiao Yu's corneas...

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,080
were donated to him.

34
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:29,393
I'm blind.

35
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
If the Shen family wants to call off the engagement, so be it.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I, Huo Ling,

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,720
will not be controlled by anyone!

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,039
- Mr. Huo. - Let go!

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
I want to hear it from her!

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,759
Mr. Huo. The doctor said you just had surgery.

41
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
You need to rest. You can't do strenuous activities.

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Mr. Huo!

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Huo!

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Who are you?

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
- This is... - I'm...

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
a caregiver Ms. Shen hired...

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,200
to take care of you.

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
Shen Qing Yi hired her?

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Xiao Yu.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,320
I just want to see your eyes one more time.

51
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Just one more time.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
Then I'll leave.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
She did.

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
Here, Mr. Huo. Here.

55
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
Come slowly. Be careful. Come.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mr. Huo.

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Ms. Shen still cares about you.

58
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Your eyes...

59
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
You can see?

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
It's just that the swelling has gone down.

61
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
But...

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,040
it's enough for me to see some people's true colors.

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Bai Luo An.

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,640
When are you going to stop lying to me?

65
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
You know everything?

66
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,639
- I... - Shen Qing Yi kicked me away...

67
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,280
when I needed help the most.

68
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,080
Why would she hire...

69
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
a caregiver to help me?

70
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
So...

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,400
why did you stay with me?

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I...

73
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,040
- It hurts. - Are you okay?

74
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Don't move.

75
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
You like me.

76
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Mr. Huo.

77
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,359
Since your eyesight has recovered,

78
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,919
I don't think there's a need...

79
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,600
for me to stay with you anymore.

80
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
I'm officially resigning...

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
from now on.

82
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,018
After all,

83
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,360
you don't pay me.

84
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,640
I don't think I need to report to you.

85
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,760
Then, take care.

86
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:33,641
Goodbye.

87
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
Who said you can leave me?

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,240
From the moment you lit up my dark world,

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I decided then...

90
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,120
to spend the rest of my life loving you...

91
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
and protecting you.

92
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,000
Will you give me this chance?

93
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Xiao Yu.

94
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,200
Although our relationship didn't start out in a genuine manner,

95
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I think I'm really in love with Huo Ling.

96
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,760
I do.

97
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Huo Ling.

98
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Huo Ling?

99
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,640
The person who donated the corneas to me...

100
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
was your first love, Gu Xiao Yu.

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,698
Yes.

102
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,680
That's why you approached me.

103
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,240
All the care and concern you showed for me...

104
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,880
was because of him.

105
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
I...

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,760
I've always wanted to explain this to you.

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,520
But I haven't had the chance.

108
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,240
- Actually... - You're such a good actress.

109
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:53,726
I was so blind.

110
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,080
I thought you really loved me.

111
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
So all of this was fake.

112
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Let me explain, Huo Ling.

113
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Forget it!

114
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,040
I won't be fooled by you anymore.

115
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,440
Yes, I admit it!

116
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,839
I got close to you with an ulterior motive.

117
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
But...

118
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,720
But then I...

119
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,079
I have sincere feelings for you.

120
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
We've been together for so long, Huo Ling.

121
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,240
- I... - Keep your phony sincerity!

122
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
What makes you think...

123
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,040
I'd be willing to be a substitute for a dead person?

124
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640
You're so cruel.

125
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,440
When I was in despair,

126
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
you were the one who gave me hope.

127
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,920
And you're the one who took it all away.

128
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
That's not what happened, Huo Ling.

129
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,920
The doctor said your eyes weren't healed yet.

130
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,759
You weren't supposed to be agitated.

131
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,960
- So I... - Enough!

132
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
The divorce papers have been drafted.

133
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,320
Don't let me see you again.

134
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,040
(Pregnancy test report)

135
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
Don't forget, Huo Ling.

136
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,880
Five years ago,

137
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,560
you were the one who ended our relationship.

138
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Since that's the case,

139
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
please move the Healing Gallery...

140
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,840
out of the Art Center as soon as possible.

141
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,800
Don't let me see you again.

142
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,880
Huo Ling, calm down.

143
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,440
Mixing art with life...

144
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,360
has always been Dejia's philosophy.

145
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,519
What Yuexin Healing is doing now...

146
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,840
is allowing special children from ordinary families...

147
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,959
to use Dejia as an art platform...

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,080
to heal their bodies and minds.

149
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,880
I didn't buy Dejia for charity.

150
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,520
I thought because you've been in the dark,

151
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,080
you'd know better...

152
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,160
that you need to light the way for others as you move forward.

153
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,120
I was wrong about you.
