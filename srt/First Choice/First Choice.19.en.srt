00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,520
(First Choice Episode 19)

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,639
Didn't I tell you...

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,760
not to touch her?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,960
This is our only way now.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,440
Huo Ling cares about her so much.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,200
He would do anything for her.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,800
Even if he had to give up all of his Huo family shares,

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,880
he would agree without hesitation.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Do you understand?

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,680
Are you saying...

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
I can only win by relying on her?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,960
None of that matters anymore.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,680
We've come this far.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,919
I've done so much for you.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
You can't give up now.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,040
Have you considered what will happen to me?

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
For me?

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,320
Didn't you do it for yourself?

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Xiao Wei.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,800
No matter what,

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,920
we're in this together.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Besides,

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
once we get Junyue Group's shares,

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
the Huo family will be finished.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,720
You can avenge your mother's wrongful death.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,120
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Xiao Wei.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Is there anything else you're not telling me?

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,080
- Is it about your mom? - Shut up!

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Xiao Wei.

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,360
Remember what you've been through.

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
Why do they get to do bad things...

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,440
without consequences?

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Do good people...

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,000
deserve to be bullied?

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
There's more.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
If we let her go now,

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,920
we'll truly have nothing left.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
In the future,

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,720
we'll have to stay in prison.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Prison.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,720
I'll wait for your good news.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Xiao Wei.

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,320
You can tell me anything.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
Tell me the truth.

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
An An.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
At first,

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,640
I thought my mom's death was an accident.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
I didn't know until I met Uncle Gong.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,400
All of this...

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,440
was the Huo family's doing.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,160
My mother didn't love the old Mr. Huo.

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
In order to get my mother,

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,159
he sent Zhang Man Jiang, her lover at the time,

55
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
to Xinjiang.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,120
As soon as he got to Xinjiang, he had an accident.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
Old Mr. Huo seized the opportunity...

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,360
and took my mother by force.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Later on,

60
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,279
she found out that Zhang Man Jiang's death...

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
might not have been an accident.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,560
Later on,

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,520
when she found out she was pregnant with me,

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,360
she ran away from the Huo family.

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,400
In order to avoid the Huo family,

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
she kept moving...

67
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,920
and changing jobs.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,000
In the end,

69
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
she died from exhaustion.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
Because of the Huo family,

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,760
I lost my happy family.

72
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,520
They ruined my life.

73
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
An An.

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
If...

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
If you were me,

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,960
what would you do?

77
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Xiao Wei.

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't have the right to make any decisions for you.

79
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Xiao Wei.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
But have you ever thought about this?

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
Why didn't your mother tell you about it?

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
Because as a mother,

83
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,520
no matter how shabby her own life is,

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
she wants her child to have a good life.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,079
She didn't want you to get involved...

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,039
in the matters of the past generation.

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,080
She didn't want that.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,319
She just wanted you to have a good life.

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Xiao Wei.

90
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,360
If she were still alive,

91
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,280
if she saw what you've done to yourself...

92
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,840
just to get revenge,

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
she wouldn't be happy, Xiao Wei.

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
An An.

95
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,360
Uncle Gong is right about something.

96
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,280
Everything shouldn't be like this.

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,880
Since the heavens can't finish it,

98
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll do it.

99
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Xiao Wei.

100
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
It's not like that, Xiao Wei.

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Xiao Wei!

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
I've brought what you asked for.

103
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
With this,

104
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
all the Huo family assets in Junyue...

105
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,440
can be transferred to you.

106
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Where's Luo An?

107
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,680
I need to make sure she's safe.

108
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
(Calling Uncle Gong)

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,600
- Speak! - Leave me, Huo Ling!

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't need you to do anything for me.

111
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
Where is she? Let her go!

112
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,000
Give me the seal first.

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Sure.

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
But come here first.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
I need to talk to you.

116
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Uncle Gong!

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,200
Uncle Gong, come back!

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Uncle Gong!

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Find her yourself.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Luo An.

121
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Luo An!

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Luo An!

123
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Luo An!

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Luo An!

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Luo An!

126
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:46,920
Luo An!

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Luo An!

128
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Luo An!

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Luo An!

130
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,040
I'll find you!

131
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,160
Hang in there!

132
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Huo Ling!

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Huo Ling!

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
Huo Ling!

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Luo An.

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Did they do anything to you?

137
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,026
Don't be scared.

138
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm here.

139
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
It's okay.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Huo Ling.

141
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,840
It's all my fault.

143
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,359
It's always my fault.

144
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Nonsense.

145
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Your safety is the most important.

146
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Since I was little,

147
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
Junyue has kept me in chains.

148
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
If Huo Wei likes it, let him have it.

149
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
As long as you're by my side,

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
I can give up everything.

151
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Mom.

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Junyue is under my control now.

153
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
I've finally...

154
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,680
avenged you.

155
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,799
If the old Mr. Huo...

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
were to know...

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,879
that his son...

158
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,519
gave away...

159
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,079
his life's work...

160
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
for a woman,

161
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,920
he'd roll over in his grave!

162
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Uncle Gong.

163
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
Zhang Man Jiang's death in Xinjiang...

164
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
had something to do with you, right?

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Xiao Wei.

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Who told you that?

167
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,880
The Huo family...

168
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
is not your enemy.

169
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,160
(Personal Information)

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
10 years ago,

171
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
your mother's lover, Zhang Man Jiang,

172
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,320
went to Xinjiang with Uncle Gong on a construction job.

173
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,439
To pocket the job fee,

174
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,560
Uncle Gong froze Zhang Man Jiang to death in the snow.

175
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
It was our father who found out the truth.

176
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,680
Later, Uncle Gong went to prison.

177
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
10 years later, our father...

178
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,960
thought of him as an old worker who'd worked hard for Junyue,

179
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,520
so he gave him another position.

180
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
I didn't expect him to repay his kindness with ingratitude.

181
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
He made you think...

182
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,960
that Dad was the one who ruined your family.

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
You ruined my mom's life!

184
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Xiao Wei!

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,880
You want to kill me?

186
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,960
Junyue would fall back into their hands!

187
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,880
I don't care about Junyue!

188
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
You've ruined my life too.

189
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm going to kill you!

190
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,919
- Let go of me! - Calm down.

191
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,200
You're sacrificing yourself for him. Is it worth it?

192
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Leave me alone!

193
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
I must kill him today!

194
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Huo Wei!

195
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Huo Wei!

196
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Wake up.

197
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,480
- Huo Wei? - Mr. Huo.

198
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I've called the police.

199
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
They'll be here soon.

200
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,400
(Hospital Room 602)

201
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,805
Zhao Zhao.

202
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,480
Draw slowly.

203
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Stop drawing. Uncle Xiao Wei will wake up soon.

204
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Uncle Xiao Wei, you're awake.

205
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Zhao Zhao.

206
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,005
An An.

207
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,292
Huo Ling.

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Don't move.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Take it slow.

210
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
Thank you, An An.

211
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Huo Ling.

212
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,240
I've done so many things to hurt you.

213
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,040
Why did you save me?

214
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
You're my brother.

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,240
The only thing you need to do now is to get well soon.

216
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Then I can make it up to you.

217
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Slow down.

218
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Call the doctor again.

219
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,120
- Huo Ling. - Go on.

220
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Mom...

221
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,280
How is she?

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Don't worry. She has recovered and left the hospital.

223
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
After going through so much,

224
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,320
Mom has been reflecting on herself.

225
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,880
She feels she owes you and Luo An.

226
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
She's waiting for you to come home.

227
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,279
What are you doing?

228
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
He's injured.

229
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
Thank you, An An.

230
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
Why are you calling her An An?

231
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,200
She's your sister-in-law now.

232
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,280
That's what they used to call me at the orphanage.

233
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Let's continue with that.

234
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,360
I really miss those days...

235
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
and the food you made.

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,360
- Tomato egg noodles. - Tomato egg noodles.

237
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,614
Zhao Zhao.

238
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Zhao Zhao.

239
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,840
Why did you draw a watch for me?

240
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,200
So that no one can see your scar.

241
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,479
Bai Luo An, you're really something.

242
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
Chen Wen Shi left, and now my brother is next in line?

243
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Why do you have boyfriends everywhere?

244
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
I think...

245
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
you're too narrow-minded.

246
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,600
Why are you jealous of your own brother?

247
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,200
Who told you to be his childhood friend?

248
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
I...

249
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,760
But you and I are legally married.

250
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Why are you so sweet lately?

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Mom.

252
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
(Huo Wei attempted to assault a person with a knife)

253
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,120
(He was in criminal detention for 10 days and fined 20,000)
