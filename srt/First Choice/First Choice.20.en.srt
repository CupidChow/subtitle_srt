00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,400
(First Choice Episode 20)

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
- Mr. Huo is here. - That's great.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
Congratulations.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,800
Junyue's chairman...

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
has to be you.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,200
Junyue is where it is today...

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,480
because of the hard work...

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,840
that all the shareholders have put in.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm sure you've all seen it in the news.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
The media is very interested in Dejia's development.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,152
I plan to use...

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,680
parent-child art as the central theme...

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
and create a children's immersive experience...

15
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,240
and an exploration gallery for Dejia.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Luo An.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,720
The grand opening is tomorrow.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Are you nervous?

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,680
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,320
Will you...

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,680
be my first child?

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Little kid.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,080
Welcome to the Healing Gallery.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
From here,

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll bring you into a fantasy world.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Here. Hold my hand.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
When you think of happiness,

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
what do you think of?

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll count to three.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Start.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Grandma, this is for you.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Zhao Zhao.

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
My darling, I missed you so much.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,159
Grandma, if you don't come back soon,

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm going to ask Totoro for help.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
Totoro? Who's that?

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,840
In the animated movie Uncle Xiao Wei showed me,

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,919
Totoro can make a big bus...

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,200
and take me to Grandma.

41
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,105
Mom.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,875
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,480
I should be the one apologizing.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
All these years,

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,000
I've made you suffer.

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
From now on,

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
our family...

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,720
must be well.

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,000
Luo An. You've been busy at home these days.

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,560
You even brought me food.

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Thank you so much.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Auntie Pei.

53
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Don't mention it.

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,120
It's what I should do.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,960
What happened in the past was my fault.

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,920
I made you suffer a lot.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,560
Let's not talk about that.

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
It's all in the past.

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Okay. It's all in the past.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,319
So you and Huo Ling...

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,440
Are you...

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,520
When will you call me Mom?

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Mom.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,016
Don't worry.

65
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,113
We'll remarry right away.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,870
Did I say yes?

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
That's right, Huo Ling.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,840
An An is the darling of the Art Center now.

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,879
Her admirers have backed up Ning City Highway.

70
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Xiao Wei!

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
You're good.

72
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,920
You're betraying me. Why are you betraying me?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,280
Spare me!

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Long time no see.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
You must be very happy now.

76
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
(Chen Wen Shi)

77
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
It's Wen Shi.

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
Hello, Chen Wen Shi.

79
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,920
You said you'd be...

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,759
You said you'd come today.

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,880
Why did you stand me up?

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,439
I didn't know I was so popular now.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,800
You're so full of yourself.

85
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Let me tell you.

86
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,520
I've concerts lined up for the next two years.

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
What do you think?

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
Do you regret it?

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,800
Beware that Huo Ling may use the Internet to destroy you.

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Don't do that.

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm just kidding.

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Just kidding.

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,320
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm going on stage.

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Good luck with the show.

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,098
Xiao Bai.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,520
You must be happy.

98
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
Otherwise, I might regret it.

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,159
Okay, I'm hanging up.

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm going on stage.

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
I heard the Healing Gallery is opening a branch.

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,120
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,440
How have you been?

104
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm fine.

105
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
I just have a boyfriend who's 10 years younger than me.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Everything about him is fine.

107
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
He's just too clingy.

108
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,720
It's so annoying.

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
You're making me cringe.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
How's Zhao Zhao health?

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,520
She's fine.

112
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,760
The scar is almost gone.

113
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:01,632
Luo An.

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Actually,

115
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,538
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

116
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,600
I was too stubborn.

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,880
Now that I think about it,

118
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,320
it doesn't have to be Huo Ling.

119
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
I was too serious.

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,280
I wanted to prove that I'm as good as you.

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
You're the best in the world.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,600
In your own life,

123
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,200
you deserve all the best in the world.

124
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,760
I wish you happiness.

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Thank you.

126
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
We're talking about your little secret.

128
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,560
I heard you were still a bedwetter at the age of eight.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
Thank you so much...

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
for coming.

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
We have two pieces of good news today.

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Please witness them with me.

133
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,800
First, Yuexin Healing Gallery...

134
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,280
will open three branches...

135
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
in the three other core areas.

136
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,320
You're all welcome to attend the opening ceremonies.

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
And now...

138
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,800
for the most important moment...

139
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
of today.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Bai Luo An.

141
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I love you.

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Will you marry me?

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,032
Yes.

144
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
I think...

145
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,160
I'm the happiest man...

146
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,120
in the world.

147
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Do you think I'm hallucinating?

148
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Why would you be hallucinating?

149
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,800
I...

150
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,800
I have good news for you.

151
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm pregnant.

152
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Really?

153
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm going to be a father again.
