00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,600
(First Choice Episode 6)

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,400
Bai Luo An and I divorced five years ago.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,360
We've rekindled our relationship.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,840
- Are you crazy? - What?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,840
I just said we are back together.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,040
Are you going to deny it?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,640
Could it be...

8
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,800
that you want to announce your marriage to Chen Wen Shi in public?

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,920
Do you think our relationship isn't messy enough?

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,880
Or do you want to become...

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,080
a slut?

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Let go.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,839
This is a private matter between Mr. Huo and Ms. Bai.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,319
It's none of our business.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
But this way,

16
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,239
Dejia and Yuexin will have...

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
a connection.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
To be fair...

19
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,360
I'll abstain...

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,360
from voting on the philanthropic projects.

21
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:53,873
Ling.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Let's continue.

23
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:04,787
Ling.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
Was what you said true?

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I knew it.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,719
You must be worried that the rumors would affect Dejia.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,280
That's why you said that. Am I right?

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
That's all for my presentation.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,120
Thank you, executives.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Xiao Bai.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,600
I'll wait for you outside.

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Congratulations, Ms. Bai.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,440
But I hope you don't misunderstand...

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,000
what Huo Ling said just now.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840
After all, Junyue just acquired Dejia.

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
He doesn't want any more trouble.

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Thank you for your concern, Ms. Shen.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
However,

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,400
you're the one who shouldn't get the wrong idea.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Xiao Bai.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
Wen Shi.

42
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,000
I need to talk to Huo Ling.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
All right.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,760
I won't give you another chance to hurt Xiao Bai and Zhao Zhao.

45
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:07,318
Mr. Huo.

46
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,255
This is the email he sent.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,680
It is 10 million.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,656
Come in.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
No matter what,

50
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,800
thank you for today.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't thank me.

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,120
I didn't do it for you. I did it for Dejia.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't overthink it.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
What's with that photo?

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,640
I traced the IP address.

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,079
The sender is Xie Bo Yang.

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
(Pay me 10 million if you don't want your intimate photos...

58
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
with Bai Luo An released. You have three days.)

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Mr. Xie?

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,080
He asked for 10 million to keep his mouth shut.

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
We had an agreement.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,680
But I don't know why...

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
he suddenly changed his mind.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Don't worry.

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,400
We've sent people to search the whole city.

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
He has nowhere to run.

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
But even if Mr. Xie was able to take the photos,

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,999
how could he get my computer...

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
and tamper with my presentation?

70
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
Someone in the center must be helping him.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
Excuse me for interrupting.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Ling, Auntie Pei wants us to have dinner at the old house tonight.

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,800
I'll take care...

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
of this myself.

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
(Xie Calling)

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,800
Hello, sir. Where are you?

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
Huo Ling has sent people to look for me.

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
I tricked him. He won't let me go.

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,439
What we need to do now is to get the money...

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
and get out of here.

81
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,400
If we only wanted the 10 million,

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,000
we wouldn't be in so much trouble.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
That's right.

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,159
If this guy hadn't doubled the reward...

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,999
and gave me the opportunity to humiliate Bai Luo An in public,

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,359
I wouldn't have taken such a risk.

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,439
You understand me, don't you?

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,720
- Xiao Mei. - Sir.

89
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
I'll go see him tomorrow.

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't worry. I'll go to you when I get the money.

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Okay.

92
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,840
You've lost weight again. Have more.

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Thank you, Auntie Pei.

94
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Ling.

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,840
All these years, Qing Yi has been by your side.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,760
She's done her best for me too.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,720
You should marry her as soon as possible.

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Auntie Pei.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,560
We're still young.

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
There's no rush.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
You may be young,

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,159
but your parents and I...

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,640
are not young anymore.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,960
We still have to worry about you.

105
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
It smells so good.

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Qing Yi, you're here.

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,839
No wonder Mother made so much food.

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Mrs. Zhao. Set the table for Wei.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,985
Huo Ling.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,160
If you can come home every day to eat with me,

111
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,360
I'll make something special for you every day.

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,360
Mom, I'm doing my internship at Junyue.

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
It's more convenient for me to stay at the office.

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,127
Wei.

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,040
We have your favorite stewed lamb shank today.

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,280
No matter how busy you are,

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,040
make sure you eat well.

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank you, Mom.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,184
Huo Ling.

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm going blind from reading the reports lately.

121
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,803
You're in a better position.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,840
You get to cultivate yourself at the art center every day.

123
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,039
Most importantly,

124
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:02,225
you have Qing Yi by your side.

125
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,760
There's so much delicious food.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
Can't it shut you up?

127
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Sure.

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
You guys go ahead.

129
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:18,200
I still have a report to go through.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,760
In the past six months,

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,160
Huo Wei has won...

132
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,640
many people's hearts at Junyue.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,359
Some of them...

134
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
are people whom your father did not deal with in the past.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
Some people are cold-hearted.

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,599
Regarding Dejia's land development,

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,960
you have to be careful.

138
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,879
There can't be any mistakes.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,680
Dejia's social status and prestige in Ning City...

140
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
are higher and bigger than we had thought.

141
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,840
It will take some time to demolish it smoothly.

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
We have to hurry.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ling.

144
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,320
I heard some rumors today.

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,599
When did Bai Luo An get back?

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,240
She's even involved with Dejia.

147
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,760
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,320
Why bring up someone who's irrelevant?

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,200
What about the photo?

150
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,198
Auntie Pei.

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,840
It was a misunderstanding.

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
We'll sort it out soon.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right, Ling?

154
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,551
Ling.

155
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,640
You're my only son.

156
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,439
Everything I do...

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
is for your own good.

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,120
Whether it's family background or personality,

159
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,400
Qing Yi is the best person to be your wife.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,160
Let go of the past.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,240
Forgive yourself.

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Huo Ling.

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,360
This is just the appetizer.

164
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
There's more for you later.

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,440
I heard she's Mr. Huo's ex-wife.

166
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,799
No wonder he's so good to her.

167
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,639
But doesn't Mr. Huo have a fiancée?

168
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,960
Is the mistress her or Ms. Shen?

169
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
I don't know.

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
Are you avoiding me?

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
No.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Then what was that look on your face just now?

173
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,840
I...

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm afraid people will misunderstand our relationship.

175
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Misunderstand?

176
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,400
I only said the truth.

177
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,680
Aren't you going to marry Shen Qing Yi?

178
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Thank you.

179
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Mr. Huo.

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,160
Why are they together?

181
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
What's going on?

182
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
That's strange.

183
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
What's going on?

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,039
Mr. Huo. Should we stop...

185
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
those chattering outside?

186
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
No.

187
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
Let them be.

188
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Understood.

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,560
Why are you here?

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm doing the same as you.

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,560
You suspect Ling Mei too?

192
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,839
Min Yan found out...

193
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,560
that Ling Mei was Mr. Xie's mistress.

194
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,759
He's suspecting that Mr. Xie...

195
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,679
ordered Ling Mei to release the photo.

196
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
If we don't get rid of her,

197
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,840
she'll be trouble in the future.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Follow her. She's getting away.
