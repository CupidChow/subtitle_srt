00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,480
(First Choice Episode 12)

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,560
I want to sleep...

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
on the sofa.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,760
Zhao Zhao's bed is too small. I can't sleep in it.

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,440
Don't blame me if you get a cold.

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
And you said you don't care about me...

7
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Zhao Zhao!

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
Wake up.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,480
We're going to be late. Put on your shoes.

10
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Zhao Zhao, let's go.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
We're going to be late.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,160
It's the weekend. Why didn't you sleep in?

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Weekend?

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Weekend...

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Zhao Zhao.

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,919
I forgot that today is Saturday.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,320
There's no kindergarten today.

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
You must be sleepy.

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Sleep some more.

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
It smells good.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Doesn't it?

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Go wash up. It will be ready soon.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,240
You're quite talented.

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
You have no idea how many rubber bands...

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
I broke during practice.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Luo An.

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
Thank you for taking such good care of Zhao Zhao.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
It's been tough on you...

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
all these years.

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
From now on,

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,920
I'll work hard to be a good dad.

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Zhao Zhao.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Let's eat.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,239
Daddy Prince has magic.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
He can make heart-shaped eggs.

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,360
This is all we have in the fridge.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Let's make do with this.

38
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,200
If you like it,

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Daddy Prince will make it for you every day.

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
I like it!

41
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,239
Daddy Prince cooks better...

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
than Daddy Long Legs.

43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
Zhao Zhao.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
You have a dad now.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,520
You can't call others Dad.

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Do you understand?

47
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:34,912
Do you understand?

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,440
Shouldn't I explain to Zhao Zhao...

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,360
about my relationship with her?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She can't just call...

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,400
someone else Dad.

52
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:49,308
Okay.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,114
Zhao Zhao.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
Let me tell you something.

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,573
I know.

56
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:58,758
Daddy Prince is my dad.

57
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:01,973
That's right!

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
That's my daughter. You're so smart.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,959
Zhao Zhao. You're too young.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
You might not understand.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This man...

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,320
is your dad.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
But he's different from Daddy Long Legs.

64
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
That means...

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
I know Daddy Prince is my real dad.

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Daddy Long Legs isn't.

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,800
You're smart like me.

68
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Zhao Zhao, don't forget...

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,839
you have a dad now.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,120
You can only call him Uncle.

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,080
Call me Dad. Let me hear it.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,120
Dad! I have a dad now!

73
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
Good girl. Here.

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
Here.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,320
This one... Look, there are four of them.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
Zhao Zhao and I don't eat bean paste.

77
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Why are you buying so many of them?

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,800
It's for Wen Shi.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,680
Wen Shi is going on a tour abroad.

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm afraid he won't be used to the food there.

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,239
So I thought I'd buy him some.

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
It's hard to find it when he's abroad.

83
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Abroad?

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
That's good.

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Get him more.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,719
- Childish. - Ma'am, congratulations.

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,119
You're the 10,000th customer...

88
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,839
to patronize our store!

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,279
We've prepared a three-day, two-night...

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,720
Hot Spring Park package just for you.

91
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,600
Thank you for your support all this time.

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Really?

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Thank you.

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,079
Zhao Zhao, Mom won a prize.

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,039
That's great! Zhao Zhao can finally...

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,840
go on a trip with Dad and Mom.

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,720
That depends on Dad.

98
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,199
Please show me your ID.

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll register your information.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,199
Is an ID number okay?

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,400
I lost my wallet a while ago.

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,720
Why do you have it?

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,320
That night,

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
you left it at the hotel reception.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Thank you.

106
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm coming.

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Why are you here? Come on in.

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Come on, Zhao Zhao.

109
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Come.

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Zhao Zhao heard that you were injured.

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,360
She kept saying she wanted to see Daddy Long...

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
I mean, Uncle Chen.

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,440
Isn't that right, Zhao Zhao?

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,559
Uncle Chen.

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,519
Is your hand better?

116
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,999
It was all Zhao Zhao's fault.

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
You got hurt because of me.

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Of course not.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,079
I recovered a long time ago.

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,800
I just couldn't bear to remove it.

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,200
It's a medal for protecting Zhao Zhao.

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Isn't it cool?

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Yes!

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Here. I have a small gift for you.

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Here.

126
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
You're living such a messy life,

127
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,880
but you're still in the mood to please some man.

128
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,799
Some man?

129
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Wen Shi is my friend.

130
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,520
What am I to you then?

131
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
You...

132
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,800
If my hand is crippled,

133
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,919
Xiao Bai will feel guilty for the rest of her life.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,840
Perhaps she'll soften up and marry me then.

135
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,319
You're not skilled enough.

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,240
You can't blame it on your small injury.

137
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
No, it's torn.

138
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
- Hurry. - Are you all right?

139
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,560
Xiao Bai, no. I need bandages.

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
This... This is acting!

141
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,280
It's a shame he didn't become an actor.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
Why's he playing the flute?

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,560
What's going on between you and Huo Ling?

144
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
He's Zhao Zhao's biological father.

145
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,520
This is something I can't give Zhao Zhao no matter what.

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I just want to know...

147
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,320
if you two are back together.

148
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
Of course not.

149
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
We're just like...

150
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,240
an ordinary divorced couple.

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,400
For the sake of their children, they co-exist in peace.

152
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,199
That's understandable. It's understandable.

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I understand.

154
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
- It hurts. - How did you get hurt too?

155
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,840
Wen Shi, get the alcohol disinfectant and gauze.

156
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
Okay.

157
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,840
How blatantly lovey-dovey.

158
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,280
He really has no respect for you and Uncle Shen.

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,840
Apart from being sarcastic,

160
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
what else can you do?

161
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,080
Don't be impatient.

162
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,412
I already have a plan.

163
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,517
I'm just waiting for your approval.

164
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Mr. Huo.

165
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,079
Ms. Bai knows how you feel.

166
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
She'll definitely say yes.

167
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,960
Luo An is so stupid.

168
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
If I don't make it clear,

169
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,639
she'll think I'm with her...

170
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,552
because of Zhao Zhao.

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,998
Mr. Huo.

172
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,072
I've got bad news.

173
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,395
Something happened at the Healing Gallery.
