00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,680
(First Choice Episode 10)

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,359
Auntie Pei, are you receiving a new treatment?

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,320
You're looking better and better.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,293
Really?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,160
I didn't really do anything.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,179
What's wrong?

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Nothing.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,920
When I get back, I will talk some sense into Huo Ling.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,220
It's not his fault.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,000
No matter how much he wants to stay out of it,

11
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,934
he can't stop someone from clinging to him.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,280
The weather has changed lately.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,720
Does the scar on your leg hurt?

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
No.

15
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,720
It's healing well.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Auntie Pei.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,480
You didn't ask me to come here...

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
just to talk about the past, right?

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
Ling is a nostalgic person.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,800
He has a strong sense of responsibility.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,480
I know you're a good girl.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,600
It's just that after you left,

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,920
Ling got really sick.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
As his mother,

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,079
I'll never allow...

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,760
someone who hurt him...

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
to enter his life again.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,480
You're a mother now.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,960
You should understand how I feel.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Even though...

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,840
broken glass can be put back together,

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,280
there will still be cracks.

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,760
The cracks will always be there.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Xiao Bai.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,520
Let Huo Ling go.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Don't worry.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Huo Ling and I...

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,280
won't be involved with each other anymore.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
I know what to do.

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Bill, please.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Xiao Bai.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,760
If you have any problems in the future,

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
you can come to me.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Auntie Pei.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,480
I'm doing very well now.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
In the future,

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
it will only get better.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Have you really thought it through?

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Let me tell you.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,120
If you pass up on this chance, it won't come by again.

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,390
Wen Shi.

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
Let's be together.

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I told you not to come into my office without my permission.

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
And don't touch anything on my desk.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,080
You bought it for Zhao Zhao?

56
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm afraid you're making a mistake.

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,545
Ling.

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
What do you think of this flower?

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,280
I heard tulips symbolize everlasting love.

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,959
What do you think it means...

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
when a woman gives such a flower...

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
to a man?

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't understand what you mean.

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
I don't want to either.

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,439
I saw Bai Luo An...

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,080
buying these flowers today.

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,760
So I bought an identical bouquet.

68
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
But I don't think...

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
she's giving her bouquet to you.

70
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,040
What do you mean?

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
Don't you know?

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,960
Bai Luo An is dating Chen Wen Shi.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,840
After the concert today,

74
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,439
Bai Luo An will bring...

75
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
her bouquet of tulips...

76
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,480
to Chen Wen Shi and congratulate him.

77
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,800
Then Chen Wen Shi will propose to her...

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
in front of everyone.

79
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Impossible.

80
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,480
Why not?

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Ling.

82
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,959
I've been good to you...

83
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,360
all these years.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
I don't understand why you're still thinking about her.

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,520
She's been lying to you from the start.

86
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,920
Even now, she's just playing with you.

87
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,560
Why don't you turn around and look at me?

88
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
(Congratulations to flautist Mr. Chen Wen Shi...

89
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
for his successful solo concert)

90
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,292
Wen Shi.

91
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,880
This necklace suits your suit better.

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,960
It's low-key and elegant.

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Of course you have good taste.

94
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
After all, you chose me.

95
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Come on.

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,480
I haven't said yes yet.

97
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Xiao Bai.

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
It's good to have you by my side.

99
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
It was worth the wait.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
It's just that...

101
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
Huo Ling...

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
At first,

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,479
I just wanted to use him...

104
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
to complete Yuexin Healing's project.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
But then he saved Zhao Zhao.

106
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm quite grateful to him.

107
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,720
But he seems to have misunderstood me.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,840
I don't know how to explain it to him.

109
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,760
From the beginning until now,

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,519
he's just a bit of solace...

111
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
after Xiao Yu left me.

112
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,960
The one I love now...

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
is you.

114
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
What are you doing, Chen Wen Shi?

115
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm leaving.

116
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Xiao Bai.

117
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
You know how I feel about you.

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,880
Yet you made me put on such a big show for you.

119
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
I have a heart too.

120
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,360
It hurts too.

121
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm sorry, Wen Shi.

122
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,359
I had no other way.

123
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,520
- I... - If you really feel sorry for me,

124
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
let's continue with that kiss.

125
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
Let go, Chen Wen Shi.

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Let go!

127
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
You...

128
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm willing to wait.

129
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,280
I'll wait until you accept me willingly.

130
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
Wen Shi.

131
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,440
Why don't you just hate me?

132
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,480
I was a jerk for so long.

133
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
You're my karma.

134
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
(Congratulations to flautist Mr. Chen Wen Shi...

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
for his successful solo concert)

136
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
Don't you know?

137
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,760
Bai Luo An is dating Chen Wen Shi.

138
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,880
After the concert today,

139
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Bai Luo An will bring...

140
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,080
her bouquet of tulips...

141
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,520
to Chen Wen Shi and congratulate him.

142
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Huo Ling.

143
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,160
Let go of me! We're divorced.

144
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
It's none of your business.

145
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,000
You want to get rid of me so soon?

146
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Yes. We no longer have anything to do with each other.

147
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
That'll never happen.

148
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
I won't allow my daughter to call someone else Dad.

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Let go of me!

150
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,240
Xiao Bai has nothing to do with you anymore.

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
Stop pestering her if you're a man.

152
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,052
Wen Shi!

153
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Wen Shi.

154
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,640
You'd better keep an eye on her then.

155
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,480
Staying with a woman like her...

156
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,120
will only embarrass you.

157
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,400
Don't cross the line!

158
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Let go.

159
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Let go!

160
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,520
Huo Ling! Are you done?

161
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,959
How can I make you understand?

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,360
It's over between us!

163
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,040
I heard Mr. Huo and Mr. Chen got into a fight.

164
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
Ms. Bai even got hurt.

165
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,080
- Mom! Mom! - What happened?

166
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:25,268
Right?

167
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,120
Why are you here?

168
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
Are you here to make fun of me for your mom?

169
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Even though he knows...

170
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,559
Bai Luo An is going to be with Chen Wen Shi,

171
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,480
he still refuses to choose me.

172
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,720
Am I that inferior to her?

173
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,799
Auntie, what's wrong with my mom?

174
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Your mom is fine!

175
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
I'm the one who's not fine.

176
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Everyone knows about my relationship with Huo Ling.

177
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,720
Yet he still fights for her in public.

178
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
Why am I saying all this to a child?

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
Auntie, where's my mom?

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Zhao Zhao.

181
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Zhao Zhao.

182
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,640
(Operating Room)

183
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,885
Xiao Bai.

184
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,800
It'll be okay.

185
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:35,747
Zhao Zhao...

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,320
is afraid of the pain when she gets injections.

187
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,575
- Yes. - She got so many stitches today.

188
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,176
I...

189
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,160
It should have been me instead.

190
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,919
- Yes. - I'm her mom,

191
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,479
but I can't take care of my own child.

192
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I...

193
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:50,981
Xiao Bai.

194
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,880
You're doing very well.

195
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Every child will get hurt while growing up.

196
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,999
You can't be with her...

197
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
all the time.

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,772
Right?

199
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,680
Don't blame yourself.

200
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,672
Don't worry.

201
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,280
I've found the best doctor...

202
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,840
to treat Zhao Zhao.

203
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
She'll be fine.

204
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,840
(Operating Room)

205
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
Doctor. How's my daughter?

206
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,560
She's lost a lot of blood.

207
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,040
The hospital's blood bank supply is low.

208
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,999
Do any of you have AB blood type?

209
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes.

210
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
(Paternity Test Report)

211
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Huo Ling.

212
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,000
You have the same blood type as Zhao Zhao, right?

213
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Hurry up, then.

214
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Doctor.

215
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
As far as I know,

216
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,280
immediate family members can't donate blood, right?

217
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
That's right.

218
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Bai Luo An.

219
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,240
Do you think...

220
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
I should donate my blood?
