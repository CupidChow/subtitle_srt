00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,640
(First Choice Episode 17)

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,560
Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Huo Wei.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,839
Do you know where your brother is?

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,600
I haven't been able to reach him for the past few days.

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,520
An An, don't panic.

7
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:45,773
I...

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,639
I'm sorry. I'm confused because I care.

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
I...

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
So much has happened in the past few days.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
An An.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,960
There was something I wanted to ask you the last time we met.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Do you really not remember me?

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I'm Xiao Wei.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Xiao Wei?

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
An An.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,160
You're Xiao Wei?

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,160
You've grown so tall.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,840
I don't recognize you anymore.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,440
When you first left the orphanage,

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
I was so worried about you.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Now that you're doing so well with the Huo family,

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
I'm happy for you.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
If I had a choice,

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
I would rather not come back.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,880
I would rather have just stayed there with you.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
No matter what,

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,920
there would have been someone who truly cared about me.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
I don't have to be like now...

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,320
being at the mercy of others.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,485
I have to listen to others.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,471
How I wish for the sky to be vast.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,880
I want to be free.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm sorry, Xiao Wei.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,400
I was too naive. Right?

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,640
I didn't know.

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
It has nothing to do with you.

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
After my mom passed away,

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,960
you were the only one who was good to me.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
And those who hurt me...

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
have never felt guilty about it.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
I have to get back at them.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,200
I have to make them feel...

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
what I feel.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,240
Xiao Wei, does what you're about to do...

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,480
have anything to do with Huo Ling?

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
An An.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
Nothing I do will hurt you.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
But the Huo family...

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,960
brought it upon themselves.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't want you to get too close to them.

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm afraid they'll drag you down with them.

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Do you understand?

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,160
Xiao Wei, you...

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,440
Are you looking for this?

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,000
I was wondering where it was. It was with you.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Where is Huo Ling?

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Why haven't I been able to contact him?

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Mr. Huo...

61
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,800
went abroad for a last-minute meeting.

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,000
I've been busy lately too.

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
You're still hiding it from me?

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
If nothing happened,

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
why hasn't Huo Ling gone...

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,600
to see Auntie Pei in so long?

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
He's not even looking for Zhao Zhao!

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
You worry too much. Mr. Huo is really fine.

69
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,640
- It's just that... - That's enough!

70
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,200
Go and tell him...

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm marrying someone else tomorrow.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
I'll find Zhao Zhao a new dad.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ms. Bai.

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,040
Don't put me in a difficult position.

75
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm just following orders.

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Where have you been?

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Why did you suddenly disappear?

78
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
You scared me.

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm fine.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,440
I just had something urgent to take care of.

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
I can't show my face for a while.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,480
You should have told me.

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Huo Ling.

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
What is it that you can't tell me?

85
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
I understand how you feel.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
But there are some things...

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
that I have to face alone.

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Luo An.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
Now that you know I'm fine,

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
you should go home.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Huo Ling.

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,200
What do you think of my lipstick today?

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,440
- Mr. Huo. - Get out.

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,966
Yes.

95
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Luo An.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,840
What's wrong with you today?

97
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Why are you so fierce?

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Answer my question first.

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,400
You never wear lipstick.

100
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,120
You even asked me if you look pretty.

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,720
What's wrong with your eyes?

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,640
Why can't you see again?

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
My eyes are fine.

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
You're still trying to hide it from me.

105
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I had an interview this morning.

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,400
I purposely wore lipstick.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Or have you forgotten?

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,680
When we first met,

109
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
you looked just like this.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you think you can fool me?

111
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm sorry, Luo An.

112
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,520
I didn't mean to lie to you.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,639
They attacked my mom.

114
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Then they attacked me.

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,000
They are obviously after the Huo family.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,280
I don't want to drag you and Zhao Zhao into this.

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Only by staying away from you...

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
can I guarantee your safety.

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
The person you're talking about...

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,920
is Huo Wei?

121
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,159
I noticed Huo Wei's dirty tricks...

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,200
a long time ago.

123
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,520
But there's no concrete evidence.

124
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,480
The company is holding a shareholders' meeting.

125
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,840
If they see me like this,

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,480
they'll take the opportunity to take everything from Junyue.

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Don't worry.

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I promised you.

129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,160
No matter what happens,

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
we will stand together.

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
Do you know what that means?

132
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm not afraid.

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Trust me.

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
I can take care of myself.

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
He's been hiding for so long.

136
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,120
I thought he was either dead or crippled.

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,120
I didn't expect him to be blind.

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
But it's good.

139
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
If he's blind,

140
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
he can't compete with you...

141
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,800
at the shareholders' meeting.

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
Such a tough life he has.

143
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
Keep an eye on him.

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm afraid he has something up his sleeve.

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
You're right.

146
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,400
Huo Ling won't give up easily.

147
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Do you think...

148
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,880
we should kidnap Bai Luo An and threaten him?

149
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
Didn't I tell you...

150
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
not to touch her?

151
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm not killing her.

152
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
Once you have Junyue under your control,

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,040
you can let her go.

154
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
You mean...

155
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,320
I can't win if I don't use a woman to threaten him?

156
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,239
Of course not, Xiao Wei.

157
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Listen to me.

158
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,480
I told you her life is important.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
It's more important than mine.

160
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,400
It's even more important than yours.

161
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,440
All right.

162
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,720
I got it.

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Luo An.

164
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
Turn on the faucet for me.

165
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I can't find the hot water tap.

166
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Coming.

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Can you do it alone?

168
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,200
I think so.

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I can.

170
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Your eyes haven't healed yet.

171
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,040
Don't get hurt again.

172
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
But if I don't wash up,

173
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm going to hate myself.

174
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
I'll wash you.

175
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Okay.

176
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I'm so sad.

177
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
I can't even kiss you.

178
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,040
Is Huo Ling not coming?

179
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm sorry, everyone.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
I haven't been feeling well lately.

181
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,880
This is the only way...

182
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I can meet everyone.

183
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,425
Huo Ling.

184
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Don't force yourself.

185
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,035
Look.

186
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,839
While you were away,

187
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,080
it didn't seem to have affected anything at all.

188
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
You may not know this,

189
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
but as the chairman, I'm not just in charge of the company's...

190
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
internal affairs. There are external matters as well.

191
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
That's right.

192
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,680
You've never been the chairman.

193
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
That's why you don't know.

194
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,640
External matters?

195
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,479
Are you talking about the scandalous news of yours...

196
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,200
that everyone has been discussing?

197
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,760
Tell me about it.

198
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
It's nothing.

199
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
It's something about...

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
seduction,

201
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
kidnapping,

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,720
and the toxic paint incident.

203
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,680
They're all related to this lady, right?

204
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,080
Who is she again?

205
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,919
She's your ex-wife.

206
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,240
Bai Luo An, right?

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Mr. Huo.

208
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,599
What you shouldn't do...

209
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,960
is to use the company for your personal interests.

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
Just to win over a pretty woman,

211
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,280
you postponed Dejia's redevelopment...

212
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,400
for half a year.

213
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes.

214
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,960
If Mr. Huo Wei hadn't taken over,

215
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,560
Junyue's financials...

216
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,560
would have been in big trouble.

217
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
An irresponsible person like him...

218
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,160
doesn't deserve to be the chairman anymore.

219
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Huo Wei.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,560
Those who haven't experienced it...

221
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,839
might not know about it.

222
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
How do you know about it?

223
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Seduction?

224
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,680
A competitor set Huo Ling up.

225
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Kidnapping?

226
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,599
That was because Huo Ling found out that the former gallery director...

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
embezzled money and received bribes.

228
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
And the toxic paint incident...

229
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,080
was even more unwarranted.

230
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,200
Can you say the termination of Dejia's redevelopment project...

231
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,080
has nothing to do with you?

232
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,000
Mr. Huo did all this...

233
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
just for...

234
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,360
your artistic healing ideals, right?

235
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
I forgot to ask.

236
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,200
I wonder what in what capacity...

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
is Ms. Bai here today?

238
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
This is the Junyue shareholders' meeting.

239
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Are you our business partner?

240
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
A witness?

241
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
An ex-wife?

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Or...

243
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,920
lover?

244
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Mr. Gong.

245
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
I've got a piece of good news...

246
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,360
that I haven't had the chance to tell you.

247
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Luo An and I are getting remarried.
