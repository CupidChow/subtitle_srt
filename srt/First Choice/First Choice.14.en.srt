00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,760
(First Choice Episode 14)

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,680
I'll just use ice and a towel.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,520
It won't sting too much.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Huo Ling.

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,400
You shouldn't be so good to me.

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,920
It makes me greedy.

7
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
It makes me want to be loved by you more.

8
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
It's not just because of Zhao Zhao.

9
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Ms. Bai. Why did Yuexin use toxic paints?

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,719
Ms. Bai. Have you been to the hospital...

11
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,760
to see the sick children?

12
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,839
I heard Dejia has signed a million-dollar compensation...

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
agreement with the victims' families.

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Is that true?

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,919
The cause of the mass allergy among the children...

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
in the art therapy classes is still under investigation.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I believe...

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,400
that Yuexin will be able to give you an answer soon.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,360
In the meantime, any false reports about Yuexin...

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,800
will be prosecuted according to the law.

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,079
Mr. Huo. Does Dejia not supervise Yuexin...

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
because Bai Luo An is your ex-wife?

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Serious offenders who maliciously slander others...

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,480
will be sentenced to up to three years in prison.

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Everyone,

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
do you need me to explain the law to you?

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Move.

28
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,880
How long were you going to keep it from me?

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Hasn't she always been like this?

30
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
Did you see the news?

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,040
You came at the right time.

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
I have something to tell you.

33
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:45,218
Tell me.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,632
Wait.

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,480
I can help with the media too.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,080
I think Xiao Bai is talking to me.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Someone is trying so hard to make me trend.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
If I don't respond,

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
isn't that impolite?

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Leave it to me.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
I've been in the industry for so long.

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
I do have some friends in the media.

43
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,439
If I weren't involved,

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,560
you wouldn't have the right to interfere.

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,719
That's right. If it weren't for you,

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
I wouldn't need to step in.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
You're just a flute player...

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Stop. If you want to argue,

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,640
go somewhere else.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
I have to write a statement.

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
I think this one needs to be amended.

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
You write it then.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
Go home and practice your flute.

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,160
Do you even understand it?

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,599
Yuexin's response was great.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,880
I can tell she's confident.

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
That's right.

58
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,360
She's probably being slandered by a rival company again.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Are you ready...

60
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
for the parents?

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
What's wrong?

62
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:56,640
You're panicking already?

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,560
On behalf of Yuexin Healing, I solemnly promise you...

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,959
that if the direct cause...

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,520
of the children's allergies...

66
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,040
is related to the paints used by Yuexin Healing,

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,839
we will not only cover...

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,560
each child's treatment,

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,279
we will also compensate each child...

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,799
with five million...

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,640
for emotional and physical damages.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,160
We hope everyone will take note of the outcome together.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
What a ridiculous compensation amount.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
You're good at diverting attention.

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,879
The paints that Yuexin uses...

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,520
are all natural and plant-based.

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,280
They're far above the national standards.

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,040
We'd like to ask the public to take note of this as well.

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,479
We've called the police...

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,560
and sent the paints to the authorities for testing.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
We'll wait for the truth.

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
We won't betray your trust.

83
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:41,113
Of course, we won't accept any slander as well.

84
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,473
Huo Ling has people looking into this.

85
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:46,907
Junyue will be holding the shareholders' meeting soon.

86
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,759
No matter what, we can't let Ling know about this.

87
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:51,806
Hey.

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
I'm talking to you.

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
We're in this together.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,519
Don't worry.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,760
Neither of us can run away.

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Xiao Wei.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,600
(Portfolio)

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,840
Fate is playing tricks on us.

95
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,919
The person you've been looking for...

96
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,840
has been by your side all this time.

97
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
(Personal Information)

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I told you not to disobey me!

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Don't you dare touch him again!

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Scram!

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
An An.

102
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,960
An An, wait for me.

103
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I'll come back and marry you in the future.

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
An An.

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
I didn't expect that when we meet again,

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
I would involve you in this.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
There's more, Xiao Wei.

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,840
Are you wavering because of her?

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
How did it go with Shen Lin Shan?

110
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Don't worry.

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,040
Shen Qing Yi is his Achilles' heel.

112
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
All right.

113
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Shen Qing Yi.

114
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll have you...

115
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
make up to An An first.

116
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,339
Come in.

117
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,409
Mr. Huo.

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
In the bank accounts of the parents who made a ruckus...

119
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,240
are large amounts of cash which have been transferred recently.

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,080
I've checked the account number.

121
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
The person behind this...

122
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
is...Shen Qing Yi.

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,040
Mr. Shen has been acting strange lately.

124
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,039
During the Group's meetings,

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,280
he has repeatedly challenged you...

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,040
for delaying Dejia's land development project...

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
and causing the Group's financial strains.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,640
Shen Lin Shan may love his daughter,

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,120
but he's not stupid enough to publicly oppose me...

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
just to get revenge for his daughter.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Set up an appointment with Mr. Shen for me.

132
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,640
I want to see...

133
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
who's stirring things up behind the scenes.

134
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Understood.

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
If the Shen family has nothing to do,

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,280
I'll make them...

137
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
busy.

138
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
By the way,

139
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,680
handle the parents who caused a ruckus...

140
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,160
and the reporters.

141
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Understood.

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,880
Yuexin's scandal has subsided,

143
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
but Dejia's influence isn't what it used to be.

144
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Mr. Huo. Why don't we strike while the iron is hot...

145
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
and demolish the Art Center at once?

146
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Mr. Huo.

147
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,120
You were the one who insisted...

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
on working at Dejia.

149
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,720
But it has been six months.

150
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
The development project...

151
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
hasn't happened yet.

152
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,880
The Group has invested hundreds of millions.

153
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Until now,

154
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
we haven't heard a peep.

155
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,320
What are we going to tell the shareholders?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
Mr. Shen,

157
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
are you blaming Mr. Huo...

158
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,920
for using the company for personal reasons...

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
and for not doing a good job?

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm just...

161
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,960
being objective.

162
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I'd caution...

163
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
against driving a wedge...

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,480
between us.

165
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Mr. Shen.

166
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,840
You can't say that.

167
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,800
We all want the best for the Group.

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
If you ask me,

169
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,320
there's no need to lose so much profit...

170
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
over such a small gallery.

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,800
If the old chairman were still here,

172
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
he wouldn't allow...

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,560
such a ridiculous thing to happen.

174
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Everyone here...

175
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,840
is a founding member of Junyue.

176
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,160
Naturally, you've more experience than I do.

177
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,240
Although the Dejia land project is progressing slowly,

178
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,600
it has never stalled.

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,400
But since Mr. Shen mentioned...

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,520
about answering to the shareholders,

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
I can step down.

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
As of today,

183
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
I'm resigning as the CEO of Dejia.

184
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,980
Huo Wei will take over.

185
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,520
Huo Ling. I'm not qualified.

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I've made up my mind.

It's all your fault...
