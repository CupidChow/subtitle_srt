00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,480
(First Choice Episode 16)

2
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
You're awake.

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,600
No way...

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Last night...

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We...

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,600
Last night...

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
What about it?

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Anyway, the situation is up to you.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,039
Can you call me your boyfriend now?

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
It's not too much, right?

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Of course,

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
if you want me to be your husband,

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,640
I won't turn you down.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,320
We're both adults.

15
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Even if something happens,

16
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:15,026
so what?

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Where are you going?

18
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm going to see if Zhao Zhao is awake.

19
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,720
(Shuiyuncai Hot Spring Hotel)

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Did you have fun yesterday?

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,280
The hot spring was fun?

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,480
Let's come again, okay?

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,479
I left something in the room.

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll ask the front desk.

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,080
Is this it?

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
Why did you draw me?

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
I was so angry when you left.

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
I burned all your photos.

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
If I secretly took photos of you,

30
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
you would have scolded me.

31
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,040
So I drew you.

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
I'll look at it when I miss you.

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Here.

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Give me your phone.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,680
Give me your phone.

36
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Zhao Zhao.

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,120
Zhao Zhao, look at the camera.

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Done.

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
Give me your phone.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Give me your phone.

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
Zhao Zhao.

42
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Say cheese.

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,440
Cheese.

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Slowly.

45
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
This can be our new screen saver.

46
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
- Let's go. - Here we go.

47
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Slow down.

48
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,600
Call Mr. Lin.

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,200
Tell him...

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
to meet me in my office at 3:30pm.

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Dad.

52
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
What are you doing here?

53
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
I need to talk to you.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can go back first.

55
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Dad.

56
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,800
How could you force Ling to resign at the shareholders' meeting?

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,880
How am I supposed to face him now?

58
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,680
You've been in love with him for years.

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
You've been helping him with everything.

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,285
And then what?

61
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,933
He looked...

62
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,225
for someone else instead.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,480
I know you're doing this for my own good.

64
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,559
But it doesn't matter...

65
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
if he chooses Bai Luo An or not.

66
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,080
As long as to him,

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,639
I'm the only person...

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
he can't live without.

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,679
I believe that one day,

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,120
Ling will come back to me.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,280
But if you do this now,

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
won't all my effort be in vain?

73
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,000
You're one to talk.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm doing this...

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
because of the trouble you caused.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,319
You wasted 10 million...

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,720
on Bai Luo An.

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
At my age,

79
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
and with my status,

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
I still have to be threatened...

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
by that brat.

82
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Huo Wei?

83
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
If...

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
I don't go against Huo Ling,

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,560
Huo Wei will expose you...

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,560
for slandering the Healing Gallery...

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,560
and ruin your reputation.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Do you understand?

89
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
Huo Wei used me.

90
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,760
- But he planned all of it... - That's enough.

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
This matter...

92
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
is over.

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,840
- Let's not talk about it again. - Dad.

94
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Dad!

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Hello?

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
You are saying...

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,320
that Huo Wei and Bai Luo An are from the same orphanage?

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,360
They were very close?

100
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
Send me the information first.

101
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
That's all.

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
After so many years,

103
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,599
Bai Luo An approached Ling...

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,640
at such a crucial time during the shareholders' meeting.

105
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
And at this moment,

106
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,800
Huo Wei used the Junyue founders to suppress Ling.

107
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,840
Have they been working together behind my back all this time?

108
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,040
(Huo Ling)

109
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Mrs. Zhang.

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Is Auntie Pei back yet?

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,080
She probably went out to buy flowers.

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,960
Ms. Shen. Why don't you come back later?

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,639
Then, when she comes back,

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,840
give this to her for me.

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,999
It's very important. Give it to her as soon as she comes back.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All right.

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm sure once Auntie Pei sees what's on the flash drive,

118
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,640
she'll know it's Bai Luo An's scheme.

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
Let's go. Fasten your seat belt.

120
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
What's the matter?

121
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
I have bad news, Mr. Huo.

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,479
Something happened to Old Madam.

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,240
She fell down the stairs this morning.

124
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
She's in a coma in the hospital.

125
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,992
What?

126
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,640
Huo Ling. You're finally here.

127
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,520
The doctor said Mother is out of danger.

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
But they don't know when she'll wake up.

129
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
What happened?

130
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Xiao Wei.

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Huo Wei!

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,680
There was only Mrs. Zhang at home.

133
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
She said that looking from where Mother was,

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
she must have tripped when she went downstairs.

135
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,240
She's been worried about you for the past few days.

136
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,880
She must not have rested well.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Mother has always been cautious.

138
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,400
Why would she slip and fall all of a sudden?

139
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Why are you here?

140
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
Auntie Pei likes flowers.

141
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I wanted...

142
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,560
to bring her some flowers...

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
to cheer her up.

144
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
Maybe she'll wake up soon.

145
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
I grew up without a mother.

146
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
To me,

147
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,280
Auntie Pei is the closest thing I have to a mother.

148
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,840
Of course I wish Auntie Pei well.

149
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
I heard from Min Yan...

150
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,160
that you haven't eaten anything.

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll eat with you.

152
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,280
Don't worry too much.

153
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
Everything will be fine.

154
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
It's okay.

156
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,640
An An. Are you okay?

157
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Thank you.

158
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,440
You came to see Auntie Pei too.

159
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
I'm here to see you.

160
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
See me?

161
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Me?

162
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:07,440
You've been coming to the hospital a lot lately.

163
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,040
Why? Are you going to make up with my brother?

164
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Do you...

165
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,400
not want us to get back together?

166
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,440
What if I don't?

167
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,240
My brother is childish and selfish.

168
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,360
He's jealous of a dead person.

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
He didn't even know you were pregnant.

170
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
If I were him,

171
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
I wouldn't have done that to you.

172
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
You...

173
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,760
came here to tell me this?

174
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,680
Why are you telling me this?

175
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
An An.

176
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm just kidding.

177
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,440
You didn't take it seriously, did you?

178
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,480
No.

179
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,800
You and your brother...

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,880
are really different.

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,440
How did you get the scar on your hand?

182
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,920
I got it when I was a kid...

183
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,440
saving a little boy at the orphanage.

184
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,840
How's the little boy now?

185
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,920
Right now,

186
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
he should be about your age.

187
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,600
But later on,

188
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,400
he was adopted.

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,440
I haven't seen him since.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
He's probably forgotten about me by now.

191
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
How could he forget you?

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Actually...

193
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Hold on.

194
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Hello?

195
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Yes, that's me.

196
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,800
That's me.

197
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
Okay, go ahead.

198
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Uncle Gong.

199
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I think...

200
00:15:10,681 --> 00:15:11,840
you're getting old.

201
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
You went easy on her.

202
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
She's still alive.

203
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
If she dies,

204
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,280
that would be bad.

205
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Huo Ling won't let us go then.

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Am I afraid of him?

207
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,840
Where's the person I asked you to find?

208
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Are we...

209
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
really going to continue?

210
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Uncle Gong.

211
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,480
What's wrong now?

212
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Are you afraid?

213
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
I just think...

214
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
that Junyue...

215
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,960
is in your hands now.

216
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,800
There's no need to destroy their family.

217
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
How is it not necessary?

218
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,999
If the Huo family didn't kill my mom,

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,079
would I have to live like a dog...

220
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,480
in the orphanage?

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,239
Would I have to see An An...

222
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,000
throw herself at Huo Ling?

223
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Listen carefully.

224
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Right now,

225
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,360
whoever stops me from taking revenge...

226
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,680
will die like my mother...

227
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
and the Huo family.

228
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Do you understand?

229
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay.

230
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I understand.

231
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
(Luo An)
