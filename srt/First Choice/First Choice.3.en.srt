00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,440
(First Choice Episode 3)

2
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,720
(Medical Room 604)

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,679
It wasn't an asthma attack.

4
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:24,200
She just needs observation and rest.

5
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:26,766
Thank you, doctor.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
- How is she? - She's fine.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,880
That's good. Thank you.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,920
It's not asthma?

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,840
Stop pretending.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Stop pretending.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
You're still pretending?

12
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,000
You're still pretending.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
You scared me to death. Did you know that?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Zhao Zhao knows.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,560
I just don't want to see Daddy Prince bully you.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
Zhao Zhao.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,280
Promise me.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,640
Don't lie to me like this again.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,240
I was so scared.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
Mom, don't be scared.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
I won't do this again.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Thank you.

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,720
Thank goodness you drove Zhao Zhao here in time.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,160
That's why she didn't get worse.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,040
Zhao Zhao has asthma.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,240
You should be more careful.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,680
I don't know how you and Bai Luo An are taking care of the child.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
But it's to be expected.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,280
She has always had poor taste.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
You're right.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,320
It's my fault.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,640
I didn't take good care of Xiao Bai and Zhao Zhao.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Thank you for reminding me.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
This won't happen again.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Don't thank me.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
She should be the one thanking me.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
After all, I'm her ex-husband.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
As for you,

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't care at all.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
Xiao Bai told me.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
She said...

42
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,480
she's done with you.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,320
If possible, she hopes to never see you again.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
You must be disappointed.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Zhao Zhao is fine now.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,400
- Don't worry. - Okay.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
You didn't tell him anything?

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,040
Zhao Zhao is my child.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,320
He doesn't need to know the rest.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,480
He's not stupid.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,120
He'll find out sooner or later.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
How long do you think you can hide it?

53
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,680
As long as I can.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Xiao Bai.

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I'll give you a chance.

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,094
Look.

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Zhao Zhao is so clingy to me.

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Why don't you consider...

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
letting me be her real dad?

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
That way, even if Huo Ling finds out, there's nothing he can do.

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,599
Chen Wen Shi!

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,999
You're teasing me again, aren't you?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
You think I'm not tired enough?

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,279
If your ex-girlfriends find out about this,

65
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
they'll kill me.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you in trouble again?

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,479
Your ex-girlfriends...

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
are out to get me.

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,920
I won't take the hit for you.

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm too tired.

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
I'm busy.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,440
You caught me.

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Okay.

74
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,240
I'll take the hit myself, okay?

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
You're not a good friend.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
You must be hungry.

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll get you some food.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Wait for me.

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Mr. Huo, I need to use the washroom.

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,880
I made this little sun keychain.

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
Keep it with you.

82
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
It will illuminate you...

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,825
and keep you company.

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,733
Luo An.

85
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's have a baby.

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
A boy or a girl?

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,480
A girl.

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,880
Just like you.

89
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:40,085
I want to see what you look like when you're little.

90
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:41,172
That's right.

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
If the child looks like you, it'll be doomed.

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I'm ticklish!

93
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
It's ticklish!

94
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,800
If one day,

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
I go blind again,

96
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,680
will you still stay with me?

97
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
Didn't I promise you...

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,880
that I'll always be by your side?

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
Bai Luo An.

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,440
You're really something.

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
You actually have a daughter with someone else.

102
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Come in.

103
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,799
Mr. Huo, Ms. Bai from Yuexin would like to see you.

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
- I won't see her. - Understood.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Wait.

106
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
Let her wait outside.

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Understood.

108
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,599
Ms. Bai, Mr. Huo is busy right now.

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Please wait a moment.

110
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,479
I'm sorry, Ms. Bai.

111
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Mr. Huo has left for the banquet.

112
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
Please tell me where Mr. Huo is having this dinner.

113
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,840
Huo Ling is drunk.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,960
I'll take him to the hotel later.

115
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Make arrangements for someone...

116
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
to take pictures of us...

117
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,080
spending the night together.

118
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
I'd like to see...

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,599
if the high and mighty Junyue Group...

120
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,640
will still turn their back on us.

121
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,839
Hello. I'm here to deliver a document to my boss.

122
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,520
But I can't get through to him.

123
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,199
If I don't give him this document,

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
I might lose my job. Can you help?

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,520
Let me register your ID.

126
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,381
Okay.

127
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,935
Thank you.

128
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,126
Mr. Huo.

129
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,820
You're not drunk.

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,360
Take your men and get lost.

131
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo.

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Mr. Huo, have another glass.

133
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
Bai Luo An.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
Hello, it's room service.

135
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
Huo Ling?
