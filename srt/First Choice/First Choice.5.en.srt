00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,480
(First Choice Episode 5)

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,479
I failed to take a photo of Huo Ling in bed.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,520
It was my mistake.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,879
But there was another woman...

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,960
in his room tonight.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,279
It looks like...

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,600
things are getting interesting.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,160
By cutting the philanthropic project...

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,000
and using the budget for large-scale concerts,

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
we can increase Dejia's media exposure...

11
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,600
in a short period of time.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought because you've been in the dark,

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,480
you'd know better...

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,480
that you need to light the way for others as you move forward.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,560
I was wrong about you.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,720
Restart the philanthropic project evaluation.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,840
Inform Yuexin's Ms. Bai...

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,920
to attend next week's evaluation.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
That's all for now.

21
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,920
Are there any other ingredients you'd like to avoid?

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,639
- No. - Okay, please wait a moment.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay, thank you.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
Why did you want to come here?

25
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:58,729
Xiao Bai.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
You don't have to move the Healing Gallery.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
Dejia will continue to work with you.

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Really?

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Don't tell me you sold yourself...

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
to them for me?

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,040
(Paternity Test Report)

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,880
Why did you suspect Zhao Zhao?

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,680
It seems like you already knew.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
I've seen Huo Ling's childhood photos.

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,520
Zhao Zhao's and his eyes...

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
look very similar.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,239
The Huo family will never allow...

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,360
their blood relation to be outside of the family.

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,160
If Huo Ling finds out,

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,159
he will definitely take Zhao Zhao...

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,680
away from Bai Luo An.

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,120
You don't want that...

43
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,919
to happen, do you?

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,880
Are you giving me money...

45
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,999
to take Zhao Zhao and Bai Luo An...

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
away from Ning City?

47
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm expensive.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Dejia's anniversary solo concert...

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,520
is a performance opportunity many musicians dream.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,040
(Dejia's Anniversary Solo Concert contract)

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
But after this concert,

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,439
I don't want to see Bai Luo An...

53
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,320
and Zhao Zhao in Ning City again.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Mr. Chen.

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
You and I are not enemies.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,000
Think about it.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Think about it.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,960
Dejia will fully support Bai Luo An's Healing Gallery.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,520
Otherwise, Huo Ling will receive this recording.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
I think, compared to Bai Luo An,

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,200
you'd really rather Huo Ling not know about Zhao Zhao's identity.

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
You!

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
You're despicable.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
So are you.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Thank you.

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm expensive.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
Chen Wen Shi.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,960
Be serious.

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,200
I just think...

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
that you're an artist.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,120
Don't compromise because of me.

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Actually,

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Dejia invited me to be their solo recitalist for their anniversary.

74
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,000
That's great.

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,312
I told you.

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,878
I knew you could do it.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Luo An.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
All these years,

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,520
you were the only one who believed in me unconditionally.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
Do you remember this place?

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
It's where we first met.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
(Five years ago)

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,999
Come on, perform for me.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come on.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
You darn performer.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,400
Didn't you hear what I said?

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm expensive.

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
Expensive?

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I'll make you cheap!

91
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:37,559
What a farce!

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,320
Stop! I've called the police.

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,279
I've taken photos of you beating him up.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,559
Leave! Why are you taking photos?

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,238
Go!

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Get up.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Are you okay?

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Are you okay?

99
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
It's the first time...

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
we've met.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,280
Why did you help me?

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
You performed beautifully just now.

103
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sure you'll have your own solo concert.

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
I should be the one thanking you.

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
(From Min Yan, Ms. Bai, we invite you to participate...

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
in Dejia's vendors evaluation meeting next week.)

107
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,400
(Bai Luo An, Han ethnicity, Born November 20, 1995)

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Sir.

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,959
When your subordinate was delivering your documents,

110
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
she left her wallet here.

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
Sir. Your subordinate must really like you.

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,544
Huo Ling.

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,680
No matter what happens,

114
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll always be by your side.

115
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,919
Mr. Huo, Ms. Bai has submitted...

116
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,320
the materials for next week's evaluation.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,040
Should I tell her that you arranged it?

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
There's no need.

119
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,780
What's the matter?

120
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
If you don't perform well later,

121
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,840
are you going to say there's a problem with your voice?

122
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Xiao Bai.

123
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Drink this.

124
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't worry, Mr. Huo.

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,440
I'll do a good job.

126
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,280
I won't let Wen Shi's efforts go to waste.

127
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,200
Chen Wen Shi.

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,440
Hello, executives of Dejia.

129
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm the artistic director of Yuexin Healing Center,

130
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,149
Bai Luo An.

131
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Ms. Bai. Mr. Huo.

132
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
What are they doing?

133
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,040
What's going on?

134
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,960
What are they doing?

135
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
- This is ridiculous. - What are they doing?

136
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,480
- Seriously. - What's going on?

137
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,120
Mr. Xie just left,

138
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,288
and she's already in Mr. Huo's bed.

139
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
I can't believe Mr. Huo.

140
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,800
Doesn't he find it dirty?

141
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,080
Article seven of the Dejia Employee Manual...

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,440
says that whoever discusses a manager's affairs...

143
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,160
will be fired and be ineligible for rehire.

144
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
Don't give me orders.

145
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
Mr. Huo.

146
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,559
You said I don't find it dirty?

147
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Mr. Huo, you misunderstood me.

148
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,999
I didn't mean it that way.

149
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,280
If you want to stay in Dejia,

150
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,000
watch your mouth.

151
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Huo.

152
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Xiao Bai.

153
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,749
Are you all right?

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm fine.

155
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,400
I saved him out of kindness,

156
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
but I became a target instead.

157
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,520
During the signing ceremony later, I want to propose to you publicly.

158
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,879
That way, the rumors about you and Huo Ling...

159
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
will disperse.

160
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,400
Chen Wen Shi.

161
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,440
I'm embarrassed enough.

162
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,000
It's my problem. I'll solve it.

163
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,039
I'm serious. Think about it.

164
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,360
We have a meeting!

165
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
Xiao Bai.

166
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
You...

167
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,880
You're not married.

168
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm sorry, everyone.

169
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,640
There were some problems with my presentation just now.

170
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Let's continue.

171
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Ms. Bai. Do you think we have amnesia?

172
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,440
Or do you think you have Mr. Huo's support?

173
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,559
That's why you can keep pushing...

174
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
Dejia's bottom line.

175
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,440
What happened between you and Mr. Xie...

176
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,879
has already put Dejia under pressure from the media.

177
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,040
Now you're in an ambiguous relationship with Mr. Huo.

178
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
If these photos are leaked,

179
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,640
how will the public see Dejia and Mr. Huo?

180
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Yes.

181
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,240
What's your relationship with Mr. Huo?

182
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
I forgot to introduce her to you.

183
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,960
Bai Luo An and I divorced five years ago.

184
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,040
We've rekindled our relationship.

185
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,560
Rekindled?

186
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,599
What's going on?

187
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,960
They got back together just like that?

188
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,320
- Are you crazy? - What?

189
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,199
I just said we are back together.

190
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,319
Are you going to deny it?

191
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Could it be...

192
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:41,640
that you want to announce your marriage to Chen Wen Shi in public?

193
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,680
Do you think our relationship isn't messy enough?

194
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
Or do you want to be a slut?
