00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,440
(First Choice Episode 9)

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
- Zhao Zhao. - Zhao Zhao.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
Look at that bunny.

4
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,240
- Zhao Zhao, look at that. - It's so cute.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
- Zhao Zhao, look. - Look at the ears.

6
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,680
There's an alpaca called Di Jia over there.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,320
Zhao Zhao. You sent this?

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,479
(Daddy Long Legs, will you go out with me tomorrow?)

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,640
(Daddy Prince, will you go out with me tomorrow?)

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,080
I just don't want my mom to suffer alone.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,079
Thank you for coming today.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
- Of course. - It's my pleasure.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,720
Excuse me, Mom.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,879
Me?

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
You want me to give way?

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,719
Kids have to tie their legs...

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
to their parents'.

18
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:02,680
You need to work together to find a treasure chest in the ball pit.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,880
Then you'll get a medal of bravery.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,360
You have three minutes.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,640
Follow me, everyone.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Have you ever seen a kid with two dads?

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,720
Why are you the dad?

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
How about...

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,040
playing rock paper scissors?

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Zhao Zhao.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's go.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm just giving him a chance.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,348
Go on.

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Zhao Zhao! I found it.

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Daddy Prince.

32
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:44,120
I like Daddy Prince the most.

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,959
Next, we'll be shooting at the loops.

34
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,840
This level must be cleared in 90 seconds.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Children and parents, please take note.

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,999
The first person to complete the challenge...

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,600
will receive two medals of bravery.

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,439
However, if you fail...

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,999
to complete the challenge within 90 seconds,

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,479
the medals of bravery you've received before...

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,880
will be confiscated.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,200
Everyone, come with me.

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,520
Mr. Huo must be tired.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
This requires explosive power.

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Let me do it.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
If you lose,

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll lose the medal I just won.

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,879
- Let's go. - Okay.

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, let's go.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,799
Daddy Prince! Daddy Long Legs!

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You can do it!

52
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
Don't worry, Zhao Zhao.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,039
Daddy Long Legs is the best.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,480
You'll get a medal for sure.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Change your profession.

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,960
Stop playing the flute.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Switch to bragging.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
You can't handle it, Mr. Huo?

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We haven't even started.

60
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,120
Don't be so sarcastic.

61
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
I won't lose to you.

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Fine.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,520
Let's raise the stakes.

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,879
If I lose, I'm out.

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,400
If you lose,

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
you're out.

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,240
What are you doing?

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
What do you take Luo An for?

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm asking if you dare.

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
It's starting.

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's start with the next group.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,280
You can do it!

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,240
Daddy Prince, you can do it!

74
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
The little sun doll!

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,120
The little sun doll fell on the floor.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
The little sun doll!

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Stop.

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,119
Congratulations to the dad who's carrying...

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,520
the little sun doll on his victory.

80
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
I won, Zhao Zhao!

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,400
Daddy Prince is the best!

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,760
Daddy Prince picked up the little sun doll.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,400
Thank you, Zhao Zhao.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
- Here you go. - You're welcome.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What's wrong?

86
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
Why are you sitting here alone?

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Let's find a place to eat.

88
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,400
At least I'm fighting for it,

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
unlike you.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,880
You're just a coward...

91
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,040
pretending to be her friend.

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,360
What are you doing, Chen Wen Shi?

93
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
I've always liked you.

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,840
Let me take care of you and Zhao Zhao, okay?

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,840
Chen Wen Shi.

96
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:56,893
If you joke around with me again,

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll block you.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,080
I didn't want you to feel burdened.

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
So, all these years,

100
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
I've been giving you the impression that I'm joking.

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,280
Actually, I meant every word I said.

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,999
From the first time I saw you,

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I've already liked you.

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,519
I've always tried really hard to stay by your side...

105
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,880
just to give you a shoulder to lean on.

106
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,920
You really don't have any feelings for me?

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
I...

108
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,440
I've never really thought about it that way.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,200
I thought we were just good friends.

110
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
What about now?

111
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Now...

112
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
You don't have to answer me now.

113
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,040
You can think about it, then tell me.

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I can wait, no matter how long it takes.

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Wen Shi...

116
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Zhao Zhao is hungry.

117
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Zhao Zhao...

118
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
I still have work to do.

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,960
I'll play with you and Zhao Zhao next time.

120
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm leaving.

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,360
Let's go.

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Slow down.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Zhao Zhao.

124
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
Say goodbye to Uncle Huo.

125
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,800
Daddy Prince, can you do the jigsaw puzzle with me?

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,965
Zhao Zhao.

127
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,040
Can you do it next time?

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,280
He's tired from playing with you all day.

129
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
It's time for him to go home and rest.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm not tired.

131
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,600
Since Zhao Zhao wants to play so much,

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
I can stay a little longer.

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,479
I'll eat alone when I get home anyway.

134
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,240
I'll watch TV alone.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
Playing with Zhao Zhao is more fun.

136
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm hungry too.

137
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,040
Mom's porridge is the best.

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,520
- Mom. - Really?

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,520
What a coincidence. Daddy Prince loves porridge.

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,360
- Can I stay? - Can he stay?

141
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
Zhao Zhao says you can.

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
You can have a meal before you leave.

143
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
- Yay! - Yay!

144
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Daddy Prince!

145
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
I found it!

146
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Zhao Zhao, you're amazing.

147
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Piece it together!

148
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,120
Daddy, do you want me to draw some energy on you?

149
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,800
Daddy Prince, you're a cat with a big face!

150
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Meow.

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
I'll give you some energy.

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Zhao Zhao.

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Stop it.

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Your mom needs energy too.

155
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,680
- Draw on her. - Okay.

156
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
Let's eat.

157
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,959
I love pork liver porridge.

158
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,000
All these years,

159
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,720
you still remember that I like pork liver.

160
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,034
I don't remember.

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,959
I have favism,

162
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,320
so I need to eat more pork liver.

163
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,280
Favism?

164
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,760
She takes after me indeed.

165
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
Zhao Zhao, let's eat.

166
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,400
And you, go home when you're done.

167
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,440
It's getting late.

168
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,625
What?

169
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
But I promised Zhao Zhao...

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,200
to finish these puzzles.

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Right, Zhao Zhao?

172
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:17,466
Yes.

173
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Yes?

174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,120
- No. - Yes.

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,120
Is it this one?

176
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
Is it?

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
- What are you... - Is there anything else?

178
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, no.

179
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Zhao Zhao.

180
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,360
It's 9 o'clock. It's time to go to bed.

181
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
We're almost done.

182
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
Zhao Zhao.

183
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,800
Let's finish it together some other day, okay?

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,679
It's very late today.

185
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,440
Uncle Huo has to go home and sleep.

186
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,040
It's so foggy.

187
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
It's dangerous to drive.

188
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:09,611
Yes.

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,498
Right?

190
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,798
Let's finish this.

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,240
Darn you, Huo Ling.

192
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
He really knows how to use the child.

193
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm sorry you have to spend the night on the couch.

194
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
Is your stomach acting up again?

195
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,280
I'll get you some medicine.

196
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
Are you so concerned about me...

197
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,640
because I'm Zhao Zhao's father?

198
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,439
Zhao Zhao is so adorable.

199
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
How could she be your daughter?

200
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Stop dreaming.

201
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Get up and take your medicine.

202
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,280
I'm letting you stay this time...

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,440
because of Zhao Zhao.

204
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,280
There won't be a next time.

205
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,560
What's between us...

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
is over.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
Stop being so full of yourself, all right?

208
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you think I'm doing this for you?

209
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm doing this for Zhao Zhao.

210
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,719
If you won't admit that Zhao Zhao is my daughter,

211
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
that's fine.

212
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,840
I'll keep her company and watch her grow up happily.

213
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
I won't let her grow up without a dad.

214
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,880
Get some rest.
