00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
(First Choice Episode 7)

2
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
(You're being followed! Be careful!)

3
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Are you okay?

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm fine.

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Let's go after them.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Let's split up.

7
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,085
Huo Ling!

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
What is it?

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
The door is locked.

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,360
Did you get a good look at the person?

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
I only saw a woman.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
The battery is dead.

13
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
We can only wait for Min Yan to find us.

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
Maybe someone would come up.

15
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
In a place like this,

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I don't know when someone will come up.

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Are you hurt?

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
No.

19
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me see.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Don't move.

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
This is...

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,720
A wound heals.

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
But scars won't.

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Auntie Pei!

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Xiao Bai.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
You're bleeding.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,520
I thought you were...

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,280
You thought I risked everything to save Auntie Pei...

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,600
to gain your sympathy...

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
and make you forgive me.

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,600
So, in your heart,

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,719
I'm nothing but a liar...

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
and a calculating woman.

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm capable of anything.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
What do you want me to think?

36
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,800
When I saw those photos of you and Gu Xiao Yu,

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,080
my mind went blank.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
How could I have believed you?

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
That's when I realized...

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,080
I never really knew you.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
That's enough, Huo Ling!

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,880
Even if I've let you down during those years,

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
it was five years,

44
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,440
five years of companionship and care.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
I've repaid you, right?

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,220
Who are you people?

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,400
- What do you want? - Where's Mr. Huo?

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,080
Since you don't want to talk,

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
please come with us.

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
What are you doing?

52
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Let go of me!

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
You won't give me a way out?

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,280
Let's go down together.

55
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I'm not cold.

56
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Did you apply for a patent for being stubborn?

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,324
Put it on.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Otherwise, I'll owe you another favor.

59
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,424
I'm not cold.

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
My nose was itchy.

61
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
You should get a share of that patent.

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
You...

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
You...

64
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
What are you doing?

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,000
If we are both sick,

66
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
who's going to take care of Zhao Zhao?

67
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Let go.

68
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,640
- Let go of me! - Don't move!

69
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Let go!

70
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
I told you not to move.

71
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,840
Then just let go of me!

72
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
You...

73
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I said don't move!

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It's not my fault!

75
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Sir!

76
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,520
It's not what you think!

77
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
It's not what you think!

78
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Sir! I...

79
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Sir!

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,960
We're trapped outside.

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Open the door, sir.

82
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
You youngsters...

83
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
really know how to have fun.

84
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:56,518
Let go.

85
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,008
Sir.

86
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,373
Do you have a phone?

87
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:04,532
Can I borrow it?

88
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
What are you doing?

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,600
How are you going to get down like this?

90
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
You...

91
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
must be tired.

92
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Put me down.

93
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm not tired.

94
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,320
I've never felt better.

95
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Put me down.

96
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Luo An.

97
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
If only...

98
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Huo Ling.

99
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,120
What happened in the past...

100
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
will never change.

101
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:09,812
Thank you.

102
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Mr. Huo.

103
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,920
I've got bad news. Zhao Zhao is missing.

104
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Wen Shi!

105
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Xiao Bai.

106
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,960
Why did Zhao Zhao suddenly disappear?

107
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
It's all my fault.

108
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,320
My afternoon rehearsal finished late.

109
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,080
When I got there, Zhao Zhao was already gone.

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,599
I've looked everywhere.

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
But...

112
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
This medicine...

113
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,319
I've been telling Zhao Zhao...

114
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
to bring this medicine with her.

115
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,799
She wouldn't have left it here...

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
and gone out alone.

117
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,000
If she doesn't take the medicine every 12 hours,

118
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,599
Zhao Zhao will...

119
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,166
Xiao Bai.

120
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,919
Calm down. I'm sorry.

121
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,840
It's my responsibility to take care of Zhao Zhao.

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
Call the police. Call the police first.

123
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Call the police.

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
- Hello? - It's me.

125
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Xie Bo Yang!

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,680
Zhao Zhao is with you!

127
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,440
- You... - Put it on speaker.

128
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,360
If you want your daughter to live, give me ten million.

129
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
This is Huo Ling.

130
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,240
I can give it to you,

131
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,720
but if you dare to hurt the child,

132
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,280
I won't let you get away with it.

133
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
Prepare the money and wait for my call.

134
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,840
If you call the police,

135
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
you'll have to collect your daughter's body.

136
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Zhao Zhao.

137
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Zhao Zhao.

138
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Zhao Zhao will be fine.

139
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,920
I'll take care of everything.

140
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Zhao Zhao will be fine.

141
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,680
When are you going to let me go?

142
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
I told you I don't know anything.

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
You can leave...

144
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,920
anytime you want.

145
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,520
No one is stopping you.

146
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
You are not lying to me?

147
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,599
There's no one out there.

148
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
This door was never locked.

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
I never forbade you from using your phone.

150
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,090
Fine. You win.

151
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Mr. Huo. Everything has been arranged.

152
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
Everything is going according to plan.

153
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
Will she really go to Xie Bo Yang?

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,520
This is the only way now.

155
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,400
It's all your mom's fault.

156
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,959
Don't blame me.

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
If you want to blame someone,

158
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
blame yourself for being born to Bai Luo An.

159
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Shut up!

160
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,099
Xie.

161
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Have they paid up?

162
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,765
Here.

163
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,167
It's all here.

164
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,360
You're amazing, Xiao Mei.

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,359
10 million!

166
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Xie. Are you crazy?

167
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Don't be afraid. I've arranged everything.

168
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,600
Come on. Move aside.

169
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Xie.

170
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
Why don't we let the kid go?

171
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,919
We have the money now.

172
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,240
It's not too late to turn back.

173
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
If you don't want to do it, you'll end up like her.

174
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,280
At this point,

175
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,360
I can't get myself out of this.

176
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
We're in this together.

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,280
Xiao Mei is the smartest.

178
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,959
Sit down.

179
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't worry. I've made plans for everything.

180
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,519
Look.

181
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,200
Look how much you're worth.

182
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Zhao Zhao.

183
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Xie Bo Yang...

184
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
was last seen around here.

185
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,080
But this place is so big. There's not enough time.

186
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,280
Zhao Zhao has to take her medicine in an hour.

187
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,280
We have to find her soon.

188
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,000
Ling Mei sent her location.

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
They're nearby.

190
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,800
Xie Bo Yang...

191
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
is targeting you, Luo An.

192
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,639
Zhao Zhao is my child.

193
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
No matter what happens,

194
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll always be with her.

195
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
Okay, but no matter what happens, you have to promise me...

196
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,040
that you'll do as I say.

197
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,000
Nothing can happen...

198
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,080
to Zhao Zhao or you.

199
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
What are you doing?

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Nothing.

201
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Give me your phone.

202
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Give it to me!

203
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
(Ms. Bai. Come quickly)
