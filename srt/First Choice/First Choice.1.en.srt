1
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Huo Ling.

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,360
Let go of me. We're divorced.

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
So,

4
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,319
you rejected me because of him!

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,640
It's none of your business.

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,920
You're already trying to get rid of me.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,320
Yes. We no longer have anything to do with each other.

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,439
Bai Luo An.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,520
That won't ever happen.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
I won't let my daughter call anyone else her dad!

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Let go!

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880
(First Choice Episode 1)

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
(One month ago)

14
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Mr. Xie organized this evening banquet personally.

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Half of the celebrities in Ning City have come to see it.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,039
It seems that the young chairman of Junyue Group, Huo Ling,

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,280
is indeed extraordinary.

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,240
I heard that Huo Ling is the only son of Chairman Huo.

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,599
Not only is he sharp-eyed,

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
he's also very decisive.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,919
But since he left the country five years ago,

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,960
he rarely appears in public.

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,679
Now that he's back,

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
he bought Dejia for a fortune.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,119
Mr. Xie is doing this...

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,440
because he doesn't want to upset the King of Hell.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Xie Bo Yang is the current director of Dejia Arts Center.

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Blind expansion during his tenure...

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,640
caused problems with Dejia's funding.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,719
He was also reported by others many times...

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
for misappropriating company funds.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
The most recent report was made...

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,040
by Bai...

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
It was Bai Luo An.

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,720
(Bai Luo An, Operations Director, Yuexin Healing)

36
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,599
Isn't this Bai Luo An,

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,640
Operations Director of Yuexin Healing?

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,719
Didn't Mr. Xie terminate the partnership with Yuexin?

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is she here?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,240
Mr. Xie won't blame me for coming uninvited, right?

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
No.

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
It's our honor to have you here.

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,840
The subordinates must have messed up.

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
I'll punish them later.

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
There's no need for that.

46
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,080
Please take good care...

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
of Yuexin Healing's project.

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Well...

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
That depends on your sincerity.

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,880
I happen to know a place.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
- Mr. Huo is here. - Mr. Huo is here.

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
- Take a picture! - Take a picture!

53
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:52,719
Little one, are you okay?

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Thank you, uncle.

55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,360
Zhao Zhao is fine.

56
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:57,593
Go on.

57
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Mr. Huo.

58
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,760
The banquet is about to start.

59
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
Get rid of the photos.

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Understood.

61
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,279
I heard Mr. Huo has been divorced for five years.

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,480
He still hasn't found anyone to remarry.

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
What kind of woman is good enough for Mr. Huo?

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Hello, everyone.

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm Huo Ling from Junyue Capital.

66
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,080
Today, we'll talk about Dejia's future.

67
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
When I say Dejia,

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
what comes to mind first?

69
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
Fine art for a niche market,

70
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,520
or a city landmark on the brink of bankruptcy?

71
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Xiao Bai.

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so pretty today.

73
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
Mr. Xie.

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,600
You suspended Yuexin Healing's project...

75
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
to force my hand.

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,485
Yes.

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,440
If I don't do something drastic,

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,559
can I force you to do what I want?

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,960
A business model of diverse art...

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm also looking forward to Dejia...

81
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,880
bringing artistic energy...

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
to Junyue's business ecosystem.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Xiao Bai.

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,560
You're so pretty today.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Mr. Xie.

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,880
You suspended Yuexin Healing's project...

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,840
to force my hand.

88
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
Bai Luo An?

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,200
If I don't do something drastic,

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
will you come here quietly?

91
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
How Dejia's money is used...

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,880
and used on whom,

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
is all up to me.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,599
What's wrong? You're already here.

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,280
You're not ready yet? Come on.

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Let go of me!

97
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Mr. Xie!

98
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,280
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

99
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
Luo An.

100
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
(Six years ago)

101
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,760
From the moment you lit up my dark world,

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
I decided then...

103
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
to spend the rest of my life loving you...

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
and protecting you.

105
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
Who did this?

106
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Mr. Huo.

107
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
She seduced me.

108
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,378
Save it...

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
for the police.

110
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,892
One more thing.

111
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,799
You're fired.

112
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Mr. Huo, it's a misunderstanding.

113
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Yes.

114
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:04,043
Mr. Huo.

115
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Thank you...

116
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
for just now.

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
You haven't changed at all.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,520
You're still so good at playing men.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,880
It's a shame that your taste is getting worse.

120
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,160
You're even interested in trash like him.

121
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,960
If you just want to humiliate me,

122
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,163
you've succeeded.

123
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,546
Humiliate?

124
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I've succeeded?

125
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
- Bai Luo An, do you know... - Mom!

126
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,972
Zhao Zhao.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Zhao Zhao.

128
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,600
Why did you come here alone?

129
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,119
Little one, are you all right?

130
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Thank you, uncle.

131
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
Zhao Zhao is fine.

132
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,440
This is your daughter?
