@Drama Otaku

2
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,370
Good morning.

3
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,320
It's Wednesday, 28th February.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,130
How's your morning today?

5
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,930
This year, 2024, is a leap year.

6
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,330
Tomorrow is a day that comes only once every four years,

7
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,070
29th February.

8
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,600
A leap year has 366 days.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,270
That's very special, isn't it?

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,200
By the way,

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,460
do you know why we have leap years?

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,730
Because the earth orbits around the sun...

13
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,700
Minato.

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,330
Minato.

15
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,640
You scared me.

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,390
I thought you were dead.

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,010
You have to stop doing this.

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,950
- Here.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,110
It still works?

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,860
Yeah.

21
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,640
It's surprisingly durable.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,860
What's on that MD you're listening to?

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,680
It's an old song I wrote.

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,100
The song about your first love?

25
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,470
A special day that only comes around once every four years.

26
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,560
How are you planning to spend it?

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,010
Hey, Himari.

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,890
What's wrong?

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,140
Stop following me.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,740
Why are you crying?

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,530
It's got nothing to do with you, Kotaro.

32
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,910
You used to tell me everything.

33
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,600
C'mon. Tell me.

34
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,370
We're not kids anymore.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,470
Leave me alone.

36
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,520
What's with her?

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,330
Hey, Mom!

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,850
Welcome back, Himari.

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,810
Welcome back.

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,870
You're early.

41
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,870
Oh. You're here too, Dad.

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,770
Hey, what...

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,600
I can't be here?

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Stop that.

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,770
Smells good.

46
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,300
It's Mom's favourite flower, isn't it?

47
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,070
That's right.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,060
Your dad got them for me.

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,540
Is that... a birthday present?

50
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,000
Tomorrow is Mom's first birthday in four years!

51
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,650
Yeah, four years.

52
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,020
Mom's birthday

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Tomorrow, Mom will finally turn...

54
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,860
Nine!

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Well, even if my birthday is only every four years,

56
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,650
I still get older every year, don't I?

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,020
That's true.

58
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,270
Kayoda-san, you have a minute?

59
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,500
Sure.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,950
Himari.

61
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,970
What is it?

62
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,930
Did something happen?

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,250
Nothing.

64
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,260
Hmm?

65
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,230
Did you have a fight with Kotaro-kun?

66
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,110
It's got nothing to do with Kotaro.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,220
He's just a childhood friend who butts his nose into everything.

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,780
The boy that I like.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,800
He has a girlfriend.

70
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,520
You mentioned him before.

71
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,920
He's a senior at school?

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,450
I wish I hadn't fallen for him.

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,810
Falling in love...

74
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,330
Finding someone that you like.

75
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,260
Is a really beautiful thing.

76
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,650
But when you fall in love.

77
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,810
It's nothing but pain.

78
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,780
Hey, Himari.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,370
I need you to do something for me.

80
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Himari!

81
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,760
What are you doing?

82
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,780
Mom asked me to bring her this box.

83
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,350
Himari, come with me.

84
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,790
Today the doctor said,

85
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,370
to be prepared.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,900
But Mom looks fine.

87
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,320
When she moved from the hospital to this facility,

88
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,270
they said she might not make it to her birthday.

89
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,310
Do you remember?

90
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,270
But Mom,

91
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,200
really hung in there.

92
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,670
Even though it must have been so tough on her.

93
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,130
She's always smiling

94
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,970
That's why.

95
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,470
For her birthday tomorrow.

96
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,070
Let's make it extra special for her.

97
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Himari.

98
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,470
I have a favour to ask.

99
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,330
What is it?

100
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,570
Go to Tokyo.

101
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,470
Find this man.

102
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,800
And give that to him.

103
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:42,130
366 Days

104
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,110
Okinawa

105
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,180
Luckily you didn't break it.

106
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,180
They said it'll be two weeks before the cast can come off.

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,160
You should stop riding that scooter.

108
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,730
Ride a bike instead.

109
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,130
No way. Bicycles are so lame.

110
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,470
That helmet is even lamer.

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,070
Lame how?

112
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,500
Lame.

113
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,870
Kayoda-san.

114
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,480
Kayoda Ryusei-san.

115
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,370
Here!

116
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,070
Oh, sorry, can you hold this?

117
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,710
Oh, c'mon...

118
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,250
I'm so sorry.

119
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,570
Ah.

120
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,830
Um, ah, that's actually my...

121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,370
That was Minato-senpai, right?

122
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,490
You know him, Ryusei?

123
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,500
He's in third year at our school.

124
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,600
He was kendo club captain.

125
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,870
Good looking, smart, respected.

126
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,130
Miu, you don't know him?

127
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,490
Nope.

128
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,710
His mom got sick.

129
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,130
And he quit club activities.

130
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,130
He lost his father in an accident.

131
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,900
So apparently Minato-senpai is taking care of her by himself.

132
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,670
Um...

133
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,770
Excuse me, Minato-senpai...

134
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,970
Is he here?

135
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,370
He's taking a break from school.

136
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,630
His mom passed away.

137
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,800
Minato.

138
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,300
It's been so hard on you.

139
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,630
Taking care of your mother all by yourself, day after day.

140
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,130
And then she was just gone.

141
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,570
Thank you so much.

142
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much!

143
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm going now.

144
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,630
Oh, Miu!

145
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you here to buy our sata-andagi again?
(Okinawa style sugar doughnuts)

146
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,930
Because they're delicious!

147
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,330
Ryusei, I'm glad to see your cast is off.

148
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,330
Oh right.

149
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,500
Back in top form!

150
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,170
Right, Miu.

151
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,890
Did you meet up with Minato-senpai?

152
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,600
Ah... no.

153
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,310
It seems he hasn't been back to school.

154
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,520
I see.

155
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm home.

156
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,290
Welcome back.

157
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,810
Um.

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,900
Excuse me!

159
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm Tamashiro Miu in first year class one.

160
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,520
Minato-senpai, yes?

161
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,300
What is it?

162
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,470
You dropped this MD,

163
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,730
when we bumped into each other at the hospital.

164
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,600
This...

165
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,330
That one is mine.

166
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,400
Sorry.

167
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,840
It's the same album.

168
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,730
Aren't you coming back to school?

169
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,970
Here.

170
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,710
This is the world's most delicious sata-andagi.

171
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,800
It's from a shop run by the family of a childhood friend.

172
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,480
The brown sugar ones are the best.

173
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,870
It's good.

174
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,530
I'll see you.

175
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,530
Minato-senpai.

176
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,790
See you at school.

177
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,970
Thanks.

178
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:26,930
Miu.

179
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,570
Go take your bath.

180
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,380
Don't just barge into my room like that, Mom!

181
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,770
Fine.

182
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,930
Makiya Minato.

183
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,200
Long time no see.

184
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,190
Songs to cheer you up - Part 1!!

185
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,220
Recommendations (1)

186
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,210
Songs to cheer you up - Part 2!!

187
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Smells good.

188
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,830
I really like...

189
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,530
This scent.

190
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,800
The sea really seems to go on forever.

191
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,680
I wonder what the world is like beyond.

192
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,820
I want to go see.

193
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,810
What lies beyond.

194
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,030
What are you doing after graduation, Minato-senpai?

195
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,130
I'm planning to go to university in Tokyo.

196
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,700
I was torn if I should stay in Okinawa.

197
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,350
I want to challenge myself to do what I want to do.

198
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,870
I want to live without regrets.

199
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,000
If it's Minato-senpai,

200
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,900
you can be anything you want,

201
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,840
anywhere you go.

202
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,170
What is it that you want to do, Minato-senpai?

203
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,270
Music saved me when I was going through difficult times.

204
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,670
That's why someday,

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
I'd like to make my own music.

206
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,770
Not just someone who enjoys music,

207
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,270
but who creates it too.

208
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
That's awesome.

209
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,800
And you, Tamashiro-san?

210
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,400
What are your dreams?

211
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,300
My mother works as an interpreter.

212
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,170
I've always looked up to her.

213
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,080
That's why I'm doing my best studying English.

214
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,200
I see.

215
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,300
But the future for me,

216
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,370
Still seems so far away.

217
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,150
I'm having fun now,

218
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,770
I wish it could go on forever.

219
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,400
I know that's impossible of course.

220
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,200
But...

221
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,800
I believe there are things that never change.

222
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,220
Say cheese!

223
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,380
Minato-senpai!

224
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,760
Congratulations on your graduation!

225
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,870
Please take this, congratulations!

226
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,430
Minato-senpai, can we take a picture with you?

227
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you doing sitting there?

228
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,090
Going home?

229
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,010
Yeah.

230
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,240
It's your leap year birthday today.

231
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,020
I bet your mom is going all out and preparing a feast.

232
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,800
I don't want to celebrate my birthday this year.

233
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,390
Miu.

234
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
What?

235
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,000
Ah.

236
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,650
Ah... em...

237
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,500
What the...

238
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,690
Funny face!

239
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,030
Stop it!

240
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,010
You're sure you don't want to go?

241
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,430
To look for Minato-senpai.

242
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,330
Minato-senpai.

243
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,200
It's Leap Day today.

244
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,300
It's my birthday today.

245
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,070
I know.

246
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,930
Eh?

247
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,990
How do you know?

248
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,130
Well.

249
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay.

250
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,440
Minato-senpai, do you know this then?

251
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,530
On the 29th of February,

252
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,670
if a woman proposes to a man,

253
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,260
he can't refuse.

254
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,490
What's that?

255
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,420
I think it's some ancient law in Ireland, or some other country.

256
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,860
That's a weird law.

257
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,390
We're in Japan.

258
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,270
I know.

259
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,970
I'm just saying.

260
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,890
Okay then.

261
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,300
Just for today,

262
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,250
I'll grant you anything that you wish for.

263
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,870
Because it's your birthday.

264
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,170
It's special.

265
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,470
You'll really grant me any wish?

266
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,870
Anything?

267
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,910
As long as it's within my means.

268
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,250
I like you.

269
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,960
Please go out with me.

270
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,530
I lied.

271
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,480
Please forget everything I just said.

272
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,770
Eh?

273
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,070
You can just say no to that.

274
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,380
I wonder what I should wish for...

275
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,170
Ah, someday I'd like to listen to a song written by Minato-senpai.

276
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't want to say no.

277
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,810
Huh?

278
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,400
I like you.

279
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,150
Won't you go out with me?

280
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,300
Yes!

281
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,930
Alright.

282
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,470
I'll be in touch.

283
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,370
Okay.

284
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,200
Minato-senpai.

285
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,500
I'm going to Tokyo after I graduate high school.

286
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,850
I also want to see what lies beyond the sea.

287
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,330
So...

288
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,970
Please wait for me.

289
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:26,890
I got it.

290
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,510
I'll be waiting.

291
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,730
Miu.

292
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,960
Okay!

293
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,760
Hey, your going away pressie.

294
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,760
Thank you!

295
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,170
Might be a bit burnt though.

296
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,050
I'll eat around it.

297
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,250
I can't believe you're heading to Tokyo for university.

298
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,530
I studied like crazy these last two years.

299
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,570
What are you doing...

300
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,540
Well, come back anytime.

301
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,980
You can always find me in this town.

302
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,420
All the best to you and the shop.

303
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Miu!

304
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,900
Minato-senpai!

305
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,970
You're here.

306
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes, I'm here!

307
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,100
Um...

308
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,930
First year?

309
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,750
Yes.

310
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,940
The event fee is 1000 yen,

311
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,680
please write your name and faculty here.

312
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,710
Okay.

313
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,670
-Miu-chan?
- Huh?

314
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,260
I'm Kasumi.

315
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,750
I'm the vocalist in Minato's band.

316
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,740
I've heard a lot about you from Minato.

317
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,100
I'm so happy to be able to meet you.

318
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,900
Pleased to meet you.

319
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,930
Hearing you say that makes all the practising worthwhile.

320
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,510
Teach me how to do it next time?

321
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,450
Oh, sure.

322
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,230
Come over the clubroom next week.

323
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,220
Great, thanks!

324
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,860
Minato.

325
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,270
How many of the new students do you think we'll get?

326
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,500
I'd say maybe 30-40 or so?

327
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,450
That many?

328
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,200
Minato-san is so cool, isn't he?

329
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,270
The one next to him was at reception, that's Kasumi-san.

330
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,770
She's gorgeous.

331
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,270
They look good together.

332
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,070
I wonder if they're dating?

333
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,500
Yeah, I wonder if they are.

334
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,880
What is that?

335
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,950
Oh they're so dating.

336
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,820
They do look really close.

337
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,390
He's really so handsome.

338
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,680
- I want to talk to him.
- What to do?

339
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,600
... about the sound.

340
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,190
You know, there's more depth to the sound, and it feels just amazing.

341
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,380
Is that so? I also...

342
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,910
Hey...

343
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,180
Why do you have to be such the cool dude?
(Okinawan dialect)

344
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,900
What?

345
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,830
Now, now.

346
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,850
She said he’s trying to act all cool.

347
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,790
She's cute.

348
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
Miu-chan.

349
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,650
When I'm with Miu,

350
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,650
I feel at ease,

351
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,070
like I can relax.

352
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,070
I see.

353
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,000
I could come to Tokyo,

354
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,290
thanks to Miu.

355
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,750
At a time when nothing seemed to matter anymore.

356
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,800
She helped me move forward.

357
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,300
Being able to once again pursue my love for music.

358
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,100
Was all thanks to Miu.

359
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,900
So....

360
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,330
that's how it was.

361
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,170
I'm grateful to you too, Kasumi.

362
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,900
As someone who just liked music,

363
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,820
You're the one who taught me everything from scratch.

364
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,970
What's with this all of a sudden? There's no need.

365
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,400
Still, I think it's something that needed to be said.

366
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,400
I want to seriously pursue being a singer.

367
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,470
Let's work hard together, alright?

368
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Eh?

369
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,220
Oi.

370
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,570
Why are you angry?

371
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,100
You've changed, Minato-senpai.

372
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,270
You're just like one of the Tokyoites.

373
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,330
Miu hasn't changed.

374
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,970
Miu's the same as always.

375
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,400
I haven't changed.

376
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,970
I don't want to change.

377
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,570
That's not what I meant.

378
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,700
It's not Minato-senpai.

379
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,100
I told you to call me Minato.

380
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,820
Minato.

381
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,930
Yes.

382
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,260
Minato, you're an idiot.

383
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,750
What's with you?

384
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,500
Let's go home.

385
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,800
Okay.

386
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,060
Idiot.

387
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,100
Alright...

388
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,000
- What?
- You've got cream on your face.

389
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,370
What are you wishing for?

390
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,500
It's a secret.

391
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,180
- You, Minato?
- Secret.

392
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,050
- Show me, show me.
- It's a secret!

393
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,640
May these happy days
last forever.

394
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,690
May this happiness continue
for 365 days and more.
- 1st January, 2007 Miu

395
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,490
Are you okay?

396
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,670
Here you go.

397
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,670
- Leave this to me.
- Okay.

398
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,380
Miu's birthday

399
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
Minato.

400
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,470
You said you like the smell of this, right?

401
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,450
My mother loved this scent.

402
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,680
I see.

403
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,370
When I was a kid,

404
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,550
The house would be surrounded by so many of these flowers.

405
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,800
So when I smell this scent.

406
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,170
It reminds me of such happy days.

407
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,870
Let's make lots of happy memories together from here on.

408
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,930
Hey Minato, do you remember?

409
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,060
Hmm?

410
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,450
At my last leap birthday,

411
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,570
I made this wish, I wanted you to play me a song that you wrote.

412
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,670
That's right.

413
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,600
Right?

414
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,600
So for my next leap birthday,

415
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,170
play me something written by you.

416
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,600
I want to listen to it at that beach in Okinawa.

417
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,530
In four years.

418
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,190
I'll do my best.

419
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,400
It's a promise.

420
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,070
I'll be back late again tonight.

421
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,770
Working overtime everyday...

422
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,810
Don't push yourself too hard.

423
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,070
Good luck with job hunting, Miu.

424
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,000
- I'll see you.
- I'm going now.

425
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,330
And we can close this meeting on the Leap Days music video.

426
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,070
Good work everyone.

427
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Good work.

428
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,470
Good work everyone.

429
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,370
I'm going to head off, you good?

430
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,400
Preparations for next month's recording going well?

431
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,350
Yes.

432
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,930
I'll review the revised project plan by the end of the day.

433
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,120
Can you take a look at it tomorrow?

434
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,250
Sure.

435
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,370
Woah...

436
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,130
You write your own lyrics too, huh?

437
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,500
"When I think of you, my..."

438
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,630
Hey, hey...

439
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,220
This has nothing to do with work...

440
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,030
It's a promise I made to my girlfriend.

441
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,060
Write her a song,

442
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,310
by her next leap birthday.

443
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,480
Leap year?

444
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,500
I didn't expect you to be such a romantic, Minato.

445
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,270
C'mon...

446
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,490
- Aw, I wanna see...
- No, no, no...

447
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,670
- Just a bit, c'mon!
- Noooo...

448
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,610
Enough, enough.

449
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,530
Please go home.

450
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,130
Got it.

451
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,000
Don't stay too late.

452
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,100
Alright, I'm off then.

453
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,530
See you.

Welcome home.

464
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,830
Another long day today.

465
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,030
You must be tired.

466
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,630
There's dinner.

467
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,020

Interpreter openings - Okinawa

469
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,720
How's the job hunt going?

470
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,730
The final interview that I went for recently.

471
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,230
I didn't make the cut.

472
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,370
With that, I've been rejected by all the interpreter related companies in Tokyo.

473
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,380
I see.

474
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,240
It's frustrating, but what can I do.

475
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,370
I'm thinking to look into other companies

476
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,470
besides interpreter related ones.

477
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,370
But you've been studying so hard to become an interpreter.

478
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,770
Can you just give up like that?

479
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,100
Yes but...

480
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,170
I've been rejected by dozens of companies, what else can I do?

481
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,900
That may be true but...

482
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,100
There's a hiring freeze now.

483
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,330
Things were different during your time.

484
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,200
Sorry.

485
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm sorry too.

486
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,070
I'll go prepare the bath.

487
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,670
Everything okay with prep for next week?

488
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,130
Yes.

489
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,090
The venue staff are also ready.

490
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,370
Thank you.

491
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,900
Eh?

492
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,210
Minato.

493
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,860
Long time no see.

494
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,110
Kasumi?

495
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,630
What are you doing here, Kasumi?

496
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,470
Actually, at my live show recently,

497
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,200
I was approach by some people from your company.

498
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,140
Oh really?

499
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,670
Yeah.

500
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,970
I wanted to surprise you.

501
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,200
So I kept it a secret.

502
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,580
That's amazing.

503
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,700
Congrats.

504
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, my debut hasn't been confirmed yet.

505
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,020
But I've always hoped to work together with you.

506
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:45,970
I'll do my best.

507
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,400
Minato, you look tired.

508
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,500
Work keeping you really busy?

509
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,600
Just a little sleep deprived, that's all.

510
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,470
Ouch.

511
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,740
Coming.

512
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,400
Ryusei!

513
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,340
Yo, long time no see!

514
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,690
What a surprise!

515
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,530
Showing up out of the blue.

516
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,690
I'm in Tokyo for my cousin's wedding.

517
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:01,400
So I thought I'd see check in on you.

518
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,800
See, you didn't go home for New Year's.

519
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,900
Your mom and dad are worried.

520
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,370
They're wondering if you're doing okay.

521
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,720
What, are you spying on me?

522
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,570
Something like that.

523
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,920
It's all done!

524
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,200
Gosh thanks!

525
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,850
How's the job hunt going?

526
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,390
Going well?

527
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,210
Total bust.

528
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,700
But I have Minato cheering me on.

529
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,690
You're getting along well then.

530
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,960
I totally thought you were going to get dumped.

531
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,950
And then come back home crying.

532
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,440
Hey, that's just rude!

533
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,340
You know, your mom and dad...

534
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,050
were really hoping that you'd go back.

535
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,870
Back home to Okinawa after you graduate from university.

536
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,730
Actually, that's what they wanted me to tell you.

537
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,600
Well, I think you should do what you want to do.

538
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,900
It's your life, Miu.

539
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,870
If you ask me,

540
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,570
I'll aways be on your side.

541
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,270
Thank you, Ryusei.

542
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,000
I want to be with Minato.

543
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,730
I want to see more of the world with Minato.

544
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,440
That's why,

545
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,370
I'll stay here and keep trying my best.

546
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,720
Ok, I see.

Incoming call

548
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,320
Minato.

549
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,780
It's so late.

550
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,820
I got worried when I couldn't reach you.

551
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,080
Sorry.

552
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,540
Some problems cropped up at work.

553
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,810
What's all this?

554
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,100
Ah.

555
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,850
Ryusei came over today with presents for us from home.

556
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,020
He was in Tokyo for his cousin's wedding.

557
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,090
He came here?

558
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,770
He dropped these off and left right after.

559
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,400
Do you want some, Minato?

560
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,270
Sata-andagi from Ryusei's shop.

561
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,770
We haven't had it in a while.

562
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,000
More importantly, how's job hunting?

563
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,440
I'm applying to a bunch of things.

564
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,900
There are all kinds of companies in Tokyo.

565
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,070
What about interpreter jobs?

566
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,530
You were looking at interpreter jobs in Okinawa the other day.

567
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,300
Yeah.

568
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,250
But it's okay.

569
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,800
I've made up my mind.

570
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,630
What do you mean?

571
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,660
It's been your dream since you were a kid.

572
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,900
Does it matter so little to you?

573
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,300
I was serious about it.

574
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,170
But aside from our dreams,

575
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,600
Everyday life is also important too.

576
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,470
I think being able to continue the life I have now,

577
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,800
is also a kind of dream.

578
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,370
So you like the way things are now.

579
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,470
How long are you going to keep saying that?

580
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,770
You need to give serious thought to your own future.

581
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,870
I am thinking about it.

582
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,770
Even if I seem unsure about things.

583
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,500
But it's because I want to be with you forever, Minato.

584
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,700
Because?

585
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,250
There's no such thing as forever.

586
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,470
I need to take a walk.

587
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,800
You should go to bed first.

588
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,240
Miu.

589
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,480
I'll be done with work early today.

590
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,500
Why don't we go out for dinner tonight?

591
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,490
The place I applied to today.

592
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,870
Is pretty close to your office.

593
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,730
If I get the job.

594
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,360
We could take the leap and move closer to work.

595
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,770
It'll make commuting a lot easier.

596
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,220
Yeah, that's true.

597
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,700
Well, I've got to get the job first, don't I?

598
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,600
Miu.

599
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,840
Hmm? What is it?

600
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,870
Oh nothing.

601
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,060
What is it...

602
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,210
I was thinking how you always look like you enjoy your food.

603
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,090
It's because it is delicious.

604
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,080
Heh, yeah.

605
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,540
If I'm with you, Minato.

606
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,030
Everything tastes good.

607
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,590
Ah, that was delicious.

608
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,270
It's been a while since we had dinner together.

609
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm sorry about everything.

610
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,270
All I do is work everyday.

611
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,000
Come home late.

612
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,000
I haven't been there for you at all for your job search.

613
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,800
You're busy with work.

614
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,100
Can't be helped.

615
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,770
I'm sorry about the other day.

616
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,130
You take care of everything around the apartment.

617
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,470
I said we should go on a trip.

618
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,900
But we never did.

619
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,540
When work calms down for you,

620
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,870
let's take a week off and go somewhere.

621
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,400
Maybe go abroad even, what about it?

622
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,560
I'm sorry.

623
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,830
I already said it's fine.

624
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,070
Minato.

625
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,900
What's wrong?

626
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Miu.

627
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:18,700
I...

628
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,370
I...

629
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,000
can't be with you anymore, Miu.

630
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,300
Eh?

631
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,730
Let's break up.

632
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:38,870
Why?

633
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,200
Sorry.

634
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,200
You can't just say sorry, I don't get it.

635
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,500
There's nothing more I can do for you, Miu.

636
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:52,870
That's not true.

637
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:53,750
Miu.

638
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,300
No, no.

639
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,330
No, no...

640
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,200
Why, Minato?

641
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,530
Please break up with me.

642
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:09,970
I beg you.

643
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,380
I love you.

644
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,870
Miu.

645
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,130
Sorry to keep calling.

646
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,700
You left this behind in the apartment.

647
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,400
I said you could throw it away.

648
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,100
There's something I want to tell you...

649
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,100
What is it?

650
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,280
I...

651
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,430
Here.

652
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,100
I can't accept this.

653
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,670
I don't love you anymore, Miu.

654
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,500
And I don't plan to see you again.

655
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,430
Please forget me.

656
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:56,140
Tokyo

657
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,360
I wanna go home.

658
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,810
Mommy...

659
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,270
Kotaro?

660
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,200
Eh? Eh? What are you doing here?

661
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,570
Kotaro!!

662
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,010
What!

663
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,910
Thanks.

664
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,290
Scary.

665
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,620
I was worried about you.

666
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,300
So I followed you.

667
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,450
Wait, so you were nearby the whole time?

668
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,630
I thought I could help if anything happened.

669
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,730
So I was keeping a watch out.

670
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,610
What the heck?

671
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,690
You should've said something right from the start.

672
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:37,330
Boy, I really can't figure out the streets of Tokyo.

673
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,370
I'm done.

674
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,300
I want to go back to Okinawa.

675
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:51,500
But your dad asked you do something really important for him, didn't he?

676
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,470
How do you know?

677
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,370
Speaking of.

678
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,070
Let's see what this is.

679
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,830
What's wrong?

680
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:27,980
Okinawa

681
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,620
Miu!

682
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,800
Ryusei.

683
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,680
Welcome home.

684
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,500
I heard from your mom that you're coming back today.

685
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,540
I'm back.

686
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,270
Come, I'll carry that.

687
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,300
You're...

688
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,530
Why didn't you say anything to Minato-senpai?

689
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,000
You may have broken up but you should still talk this through.

690
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,670
Minato doesn't have any feelings for me anymore,

691
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,330
it would just hurt even more.

692
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,700
This is not the time to say things like that.

693
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,100
What are your plans?

694
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:51,600
My job search hasn't been going well.

695
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,930
I thought of giving up my dreams of being an interpreter.

696
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,600
I thought as long as I could be with Minato,

697
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,570
everything would be fine.

698
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:10,670
That's probably why Minato got frustrated and left.

699
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:18,000
But then I found out I was pregnant.

700
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,070
I was overwhelmed and my mind was a blank.

701
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:33,090
But I realised I want to keep the baby.

702
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,200
And I don't want to give up my dream of being an interpreter.

703
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,970
Just as I looked up to my mom when I was a kid.

704
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:50,330
I want my child to look at me the same way.

705
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,900
I'm sorry.

706
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:08,530
But I want to have this baby.

707
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,160
You want this baby?

708
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:15,320
What about university?

709
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,600
I'll be sure to finish university.

710
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,370
And I'll look for a job.

711
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,700
Please.

712
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,740
Who is he?

713
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,070
Sorry!

714
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,500
It's me.

715
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,330
Ryusei...

716
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,300
- What...
- It's me.

717
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,440
I'm the father.

718
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,600
I'll take full responsibility and raise the child.

719
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,300
So...

720
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,470
I beg you.

721
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,970
Hey wai-... where are you going...

722
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,050
What did you mean doing that?

723
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,470
Sorry. Are you shocked?

724
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,070
Don't joke about things like that.

725
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:18,300
I wasn't joking.

726
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,130
I'm serious.

727
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,470
I've tried giving up so many times but...

728
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,330
I just couldn't.

729
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,300
I...

730
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,730
I've always loved you, Miu.

731
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,700
What?

732
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,130
As I thought, you never realised it.

733
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,870
You really are dense.

734
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,330
Sorry.

735
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,370
I hadn't planned on ever telling you this.

736
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:59,100
But when you said you wanted to keep fighting.

737
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,070
I knew I wanted to be by your side supporting you.

738
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:08,400
I want us to raise this child together..

739
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,930
I'm sorry, Ryusei.

740
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,400
I don't plan on getting married.

741
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:27,030
Are you still in love with Minato-senpai?

742
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,990
That's okay, you know.

743
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:39,370
Let me be by your side.

744
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,900
Who knows what the future holds?

745
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:48,130
You might end up completely smitten with me.

746
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:52,060
Smitten?

747
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,670
I want you to keep smiling like that, Miu.

748
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,400
I'll see you.

749
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,870
Minato, I brought something for you.

750
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,600
Here.

751
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:48,670
It's from everyone.

752
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,930
Thank you.

753
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,900
Doesn't it look just like you?

754
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,770
I heard this from our junior in the club.

755
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,930
Miu-chan is going back to Okinawa after graduation.

756
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,730
I see.

757
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:22,070
Call me whenever you need anything.

758
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:25,770
I don't want you to feel lonely, so I'm happy to come hang out.

759
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,400
You must be busy though, Kasumi.

760
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:31,870
Don't worry about me.

761
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,900
Focus on your work.

762
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,570
I'm looking forward to your debut.

763
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:42,780
Don't say that.

764
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,700
Focus on getting well soon,

765
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,810
So we can fulfill our dreams together.

766
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,070
I'll be waiting for you to come back, however long it takes.

767
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,530
Just say the word, and I will.

768
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,170
What are you listening to?

769
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,700
Here.

770
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:47,800
Thank you.

771
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:08,100
I haven't seen that in a while.

772
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,570
A smile on Minato's face..

773
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

774
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,530
Leaving you all alone.

775
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,870
Causing you nothing but pain.

776
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,570
What are you saying?

777
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,900
I want you to always be smiling, Minato.

778
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,000
Please don't say such things.

779
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,010
I can't wait to hear

780
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:57,920
a song written by Minato.

781
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,570
After Mom died.

782
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,600
Nothing...

783
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,130
Nothing mattered anymore.

784
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,970
Whether it's school,

785
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,400
or the future,

786
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,700
I didn't want to think about anything.

787
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,470
Nothing brought me joy.

788
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,450
Nothing I ate tasted of anything.

789
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:01,870
Here.

790
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:05,070
This is the world's most delicious sata-andagi.

791
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,850
For the first time in a while,

792
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,470
I could taste something.

793
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,730
How you made everything you ate look delicious.

794
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,970
How you looked so happy listening to music.

795
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,840
I loved it all.

796
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,470
If it's Minato-senpai,

797
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,400
you can be anything you want,

798
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,530
anywhere you go.

799
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,170
Your words gave me the push I needed.

800
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,360
Someday I'd like to listen to a song written by Minato-senpai.

801
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:42,270
I could dream once again.

802
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:51,930
"May these happy days last forever."

803
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,000
That was what I wished for.

804
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:57,770
But then...

805
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,220
Observation

806
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,930
You have acute myeloid leukaemia.

807
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,260
I'll make the arrangements for hospitalisation.

808
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,930
You need to be admitted today.

809
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,070
Please inform your family as well.

810
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,530
W-wait a minute.

811
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,900
It's too sudden... all this.

812
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,670
Why me?

813
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,100
When I've finally found happiness.

814
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:36,530
If I'd told Miu.

815
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,970
Surely.

816
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:40,870
She would have sacrificed everything.

817
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,300
To stay by my side.

818
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,570
There's no such thing as forever.

819
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,800
If we had stayed together.

820
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:52,670
I would only be holding her back.

821
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:57,970
I didn't want that.

822
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,570
But..

823
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:11,900
I didn't want to let you go.

824
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,700
More than anything...

825
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,400
I wanted Miu by my side.

826
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,270
Miu.

827
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,400
Hmm? What is it?

828
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,000
Oh nothing.

829
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,700
What is it?

830
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,850
How I wanted to tell you

831
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,490
... about my illness.

832
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,410
But...

833
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,970
I just want to see you keep smiling.

834
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,570
And I couldn't bring myself to say anything.

835
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,870
Please break up with me.

836
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:48,070
In the end,

837
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,600
I was afraid of dragging Miu into it.

838
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,500
So I ran away.

839
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:33,990
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
Chemotherapy Treatment - Patient Consent Form

840
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:26,270
Yo.

841
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,170
Weather's nice today, huh?

842
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,300
Ryota-san.

843
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,690
Don't you have to work?

844
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:32,700
Skipped out.

845
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,100
Don't tell the boss, eh.

846
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,070
I'm really sorry,

847
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:39,670
for being such a burden.

848
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,270
Nobody thinks you're a burden.

849
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,670
Don't worry about anything to do with work.

850
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:45,970
Focus on getting well,

851
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,430
so you can come back soon.

852
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:50,800
Speaking of...

853
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:53,770
Here.

854
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
It got mixed up with a bunch of files at work.

855
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,970
It's something important to you, isn't it?

856
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,330
What was it again?

857
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,960
A leap year promise?

858
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,130
It's okay.

859
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,400
It's all in the past.

860
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,000
Aren't you going to regret it?

861
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,570
Why did you break up with her?

862
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,130
She's someone very special, isn't she?

863
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,000
She's special...

864
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,000
And it's because she's so precious to me...

865
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,870
That I want her to be happy.

866
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,070
You're strong, Minato.

867
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,330
I'm not strong at all.

868
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,330
I wasn't mentally prepared for this at all.

869
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,530
Every time I think I was going to die...

870
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,070
I would see Miu's face.

871
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,370
Minato,

872
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:01,200
you said this when you joined us.

873
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:05,530
Music saved you.

874
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,200
That some day,

875
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,470
you wanted to make music like that too.

876
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,470
There's someone waiting for you to write them a song, isn't there?

877
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:30,870
I'm sorry.

878
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:47,980
Okinawa

879
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,930
We can narrow down the location after the site inspections tomorrow.

880
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,070
Each place is so beautiful.

881
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,700
It's really hard to choose.

882
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,030
But they'd like to pick the perfect location.

883
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:32,600
Yo.

884
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:33,970
Ryusei.

885
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,000
How's work?

886
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,300
Going well?

887
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:44,970
Mmmm...

888
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,320
I still have some way to go.

889
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,480
Gotta work hard at it.

890
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:54,070
You know, your parents are both worried about you.

891
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,670
Juggling both work and caring for Himari,

892
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,500
giving your all to everything.

893
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,730
Careful that you don't collapse one of these days.

894
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:04,300
I'll be fine.

895
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,900
You're such a worrywart.

896
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,730
You haven't been in contact with Minato-senpai?

897
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:18,950
Yeah.

898
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,570
We've never been in touch.

899
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:30,470
I don't know where he is, what he's doing, but...

900
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,670
I hope he's doing well.

901
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:44,730
Minato took me somewhere far beyond these waters.

902
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,170
I couldn't have done it by myself.

903
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,570
I see.

904
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,070
Did you have fun?

905
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,600
Yeah.

906
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,800
I had so much fun.

907
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,170
This helmet is just for you.

908
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,400
I don't want to hear that it's lame.

909
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:12,270
You're going to dry yourself out crying like that.

910
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,400
I'm not crying.

911
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,470
Miu.

912
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,930
Look there.

913
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,330
There's still so much to see out there.

914
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:25,770
For you, for me.

915
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,200
Himari too.

916
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,870
We've got a long life ahead of us, we'll keep going forever.

917
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,040
Makiya-san, are you ready?

918
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:19,200
Yes, coming.

919
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,160
One, two... Minato!

920
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,220
Congrats on getting discharged!

921
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,130
What a surprise!

922
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,270
- But why?
- It's a happy occasion.

923
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,200
So we're here.

924
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,200
I haven't laughed like that in such a long time.

925
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,930
Ryota-san looked so happy.

926
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:44,530
He's been waiting so long for you to come back to the office.

927
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,010
And you're finally making your debut.

928
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:50,770
That's really amazing.

929
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,070
It's only just the beginning.

930
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,370
I wonder what kind of world will unfold from here on.

931
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,530
I'm excited.

932
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,210
It's a new start for me too.

933
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,170
I'm so glad you've recovered.

934
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,400
You've fought hard these three years, Minato.

935
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:12,730
Thank you.

936
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:15,770
I'm really grateful to you, Kasumi.

937
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:24,230
Enough time has passed so I can say this.

938
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:25,730
You know...

939
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:30,400
I really liked you back in university.

940
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:32,530
Eh?

941
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,730
Ahhh, got that off my chest.

942
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,000
Just so you know, I'm speaking in past tense.

943
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:41,130
I had no idea.

944
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,900
Minato, you're dense as a brick.

945
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,870
Besides, you were completely devoted to Miu from the moment you met.

946
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,800
I never stood a chance.

947
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:59,500
But that's what I liked most about you.

948
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,200
And that's the end of the story.

949
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:07,170
I hope we can stay best friends from here on.

950
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,130
Kasumi.

951
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:16,770
Thank you.

952
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,970
Alright, that's enough.

953
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,100
I heard about it from Ryota-san.

954
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:32,300
About your promise to Miu-chan.

955
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,800
It's tomorrow right?

956
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,170
Going to Okinawa?

957
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:43,670
I hope you fulfil your promise.

958
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,730
Hey Himari, be careful when you're eating.

959
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:31,900
Here we go.

960
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,070
Is it yummy?

961
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:37,170
Yes!

962
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,200
Alright, let's have some banana too.

963
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:42,330
Miu, I'll take over.

964
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,330
Oh thanks!

965
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:47,670
Now Himari, Papa's going to feed you now.

966
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:48,570
Hima-chan,

967
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,670
Let's eat with Papa!

968
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,370
Alright, eat up!

969
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,800
Ooh, you're eating kiwi.

970
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:02,000
Ooh, yummy.

971
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:10,500
Look at that face, looks just like Himari.

972
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:11,530
You think?

973
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,270
Tomorrow's the big day.

974
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:17,930
Your wedding.

975
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,770
When I think back,

976
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,370
over these past three years.

977
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:28,720
Ryusei has always been by my side, supporting me.

978
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:35,530
That's why I proposed to Ryusei,

979
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,130
Let's become a real family.

980
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,300
Ryusei-kun once said to me,

981
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:48,700
"Even if it takes ten years, twenty years."

982
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:50,200
"I'll be waiting for Miu."

983
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,740
"I don't mind waiting my whole life for her."

984
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,930
You're a lucky girl.

985
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:11,370
Do take care of Ryusei-kun and make him happy, okay?

986
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,300
I will.

987
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,220
Smells nice.

988
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,570
Thank you very much!

989
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:55,730
Ryusei-kun.

990
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,100
Do you have a moment?

991
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:58,280
Sure.

992
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:05,600
Ryusei-kun, I've been meaning to thank you properly all this time.

993
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:08,700
Ryusei-kun.

994
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,260
My heartfelt thanks.

995
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,170
Not just Miu,

996
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,700
but also Himari.

997
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,130
You accepted them unconditionally.

998
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:23,130
What are you saying?

999
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,000
I should be the one to thank you.

1000
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,770
Becoming a father to Himari...

1001
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:34,330
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

1002
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:38,270
You're a good man, Ryusei-kun.

1003
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,770
I know it's not going to be easy.

1004
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:44,530
But for Miu,

1005
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,930
and for Himari,

1006
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:49,330
I entrust them to you.

1007
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,700
Please stop, Father.

1008
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,670
The real thing is tomorrow, after all.

1009
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,530
That's true.

1010
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,900
I look forward to tomorrow's wedding ceremony.

1011
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,200
Yes.

1012
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:02,930
See you.

1013
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:30,930
Why?

1014
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:34,570
Why now?

1015
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,800
What's the point at this stage?

1016
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:42,500
Are you trying to take Miu away from me again?

1017
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:44,620
No, no I'm not.

1018
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:46,330
Well then, why are you here?

1019
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,700
It's just...

1020
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:54,570
What is it?

1021
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,570
Explain yourself.

1022
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:09,070
Miu has had to go through so much on her own.

1023
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,530
Came back pregnant.

1024
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:14,330
Had a baby.

1025
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,870
Worked like crazy while raising a kid.

1026
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,500
Came back pregnant?

1027
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:22,870
No!

1028
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:26,930
Himari is mine.

1029
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:38,930
Please leave.

1030
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:41,070
I beg you.

1031
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,130
Tamashiro Miu

1032
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,130
The number you have dialled...

1033
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,800
That looks so yummy.

1034
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,070
Can I please have another?

1035
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,930
What flavour is this?

1036
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:34,000
- Soda.
- Soda?

1037
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:35,330
One, two...

1038
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,400
How's the taste?

1039
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,600
Yummy.

1040
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,400
Yummy?

1041
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:46,970
Um, is Minato-senpai back yet?

1042
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,900
Not yet it seems.

1043
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,600
Are you alright?

1044
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,480
Thanks for your help.

1045
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,060
Miu.

1046
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:36,670
Miu?

1047
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,710
We're home.

1048
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,380
Ryusei.

1049
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,610
What's going on?

1050
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:57,060
I will absolutely make you and Himari happy.

1051
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:08,710
Himari.

1052
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:20,370
This was Mom's favourite smell, wasn't it?

1053
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:22,470
What?

1054
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:27,000
It's your favourite, Minato.

1055
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:27,870
Eh?

1056
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:32,500
You were the one who said you like it, Minato.

1057
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,340
So your mom, dad and I

1058
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,700
surrounded the house with them.

1059
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:44,170
You must never forget the things that you love.

1060
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:12,310
Excuse me.

1061
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,690
Can you please stop?

1062
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,550
Thank you!

1063
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,410
- Thank you!
- Congratulations!

1064
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,890
What's wrong, Himari?

1065
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:53,270
Miu?

1066
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:54,430
Something the matter?

1067
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:55,370
Himari...

1068
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,780
What's the matter, Himari?

1069
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,030
Let's go.

1070
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:55,560
Tokyo

1071
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:06,100
Himari.

1072
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:07,500
Are you okay?

1073
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,030
Hello, Himari.

1074
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,330
Dad.

1075
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,000
Did you meet Minato-senpai?

1076
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,470
Is that man...

1077
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,950
my real father?

1078
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,370
Yes, he is.

1079
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:51,070
How could you keep something like this from me?

1080
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,530
We were going to tell you when you turned twenty.

1081
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,700
It was a promise I made with your mother.

1082
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:03,080
But your mother is...

1083
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:07,860
That's why,

1084
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,300
I want you and your mom,

1085
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:13,200
and your real father to all meet.

1086
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,980
How can you decide something like that?

1087
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:20,730
You can't spring that on me and expect me to understand.

1088
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,300
I don't want to see him.

1089
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:30,730
Himari.

1090
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,070
Where are you going?

1091
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,670
Back home to Okinawa.

1092
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,580
Wait.

1093
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,280
What about your promise to your dad?

1094
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,450
I don't care.

1095
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,300
Don't tell me you know everything, Kotaro.

1096
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,670
I don't know anything.

1097
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,090
All I know.

1098
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:57,870
Is that your dad is trying desperately.

1099
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,430
But...

1100
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:03,000
You should save your frustrations,

1101
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:08,200
and tell your dad when you get home.

1102
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,140
Alright?

1103
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:39,180
This is it.

1104
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,530
Alright.

1105
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,000
C'mon, go.

1106
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,770
You're coming right, Kotaro?

1107
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:55,700
I'll wait here.

1108
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:03,000
We're not kids anymore, are we?

1109
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,700
What's the matter?

1110
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:49,500
Mochizuki Kasumi?

1111
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:51,990
No way.

1112
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:55,350
Can you push the reverb a bit more on the guitar?

1113
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:56,670
So you mean...

1114
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:58,570
Minato.

1115
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:00,330
You have a visitor.

1116
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,600
Let's take a break and try it later.

1117
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:04,870
Thanks.

1118
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:08,130
- Good day.
- Good day.

1119
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:14,300
Come in.

1120
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,580
I'll leave you.

1121
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,880
Take your time.

1122
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:32,210
Huh?

1123
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:46,020
You are...

1124
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:49,420
Minato-san, right?

1125
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,890
Yes, I am.

1126
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,330
Here.

1127
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,020
Please look at the label inside.

1128
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,070
It's from my mom.

1129
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,520
My mom's sick.

1130
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,960
She might not make it.

1131
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:57,050
Please listen to it.

1132
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,440
It's the second track.

1133
01:46:29,380 --> 01:46:30,280
Minato.

1134
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,400
How are you?

1135
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,770
I'm doing well.

1136
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:48,180
Actually, I'm getting married tomorrow.

1137
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:52,570
You know.

1138
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,300
I had a baby.

1139
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,600
Her name is Himari.

1140
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,300
Always cheerful

1141
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:06,370
like a ray of sunshine.

1142
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:09,870
She's my treasure.

1143
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,600
Also,

1144
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:14,600
I fulfilled my dream of becoming an interpreter.

1145
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:18,570
My days are hectic but,

1146
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:21,570
I'm living life without any regrets.

1147
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:26,580
Hey, Minato.

1148
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:31,220
Do you remember the first time we met?

1149
01:47:33,070 --> 01:47:36,900
You were going through a really tough time.

1150
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:38,810
You were in so much pain.

1151
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,000
That's why when I saw you smile for the very first time,

1152
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:47,470
I remember feeling so happy.

1153
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:54,930
When I realised that I always wanted to be by your side, to see you smile.

1154
01:47:57,290 --> 01:48:00,940
I think that's when I fell in love with you.

1155
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:05,870
When we started dating.

1156
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,470
Everyday was filled with joy.

1157
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,780
Minato, if ever again,

1158
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:17,200
you are going through pain and difficulties.

1159
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:20,510
I want to protect you.

1160
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:25,000
I want to make you happy, Minato.

1161
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,670
That’s what I started thinking..

1162
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:32,670
Since getting to know you, Minato.

1163
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:36,160
The scent of those flowers,

1164
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:40,870
the way you touch your nose when you're embarrassed,

1165
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:44,800
the overwhelming joy,

1166
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,200
the pain of heartbreak.

1167
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,330
You gave me all of that.

1168
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,800
These are the treasures of my life.

1169
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,170
The one who brought sunshine to my life,

1170
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,700
is you, Minato.

1171
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,900
I'm glad I met you, Minato.

1172
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,500
I hope the path you've chosen,

1173
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,970
is filled with ever lasting happiness.

1174
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,070
Thank you.

1175
01:49:29,470 --> 01:49:30,270
Minato.

1176
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:54,700
I love loved you.

1177
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:04,870
You're...

1178
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:11,380
my real father, aren't you?

1179
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,600
The man who raised you,

1180
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:23,930
is your real father.

1181
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:38,110
Hey.

1182
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,500
Could you give this to your mother for me?

1183
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:44,070
Tell her I'm sorry it's late.

1184
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:54,300
Can you let me see that?

1185
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,130
29th February.

1186
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:06,670
It's the same day.

1187
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:13,800
Are you really not going to see my mother?

1188
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,800
You may never be able to see her again.

1189
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:28,400
The person your mother wants by her side in her final moments,

1190
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:30,870
is not me.

1191
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,370
You better get home.

1192
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:49,470
Where's Himari?

1193
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,070
She went to Tokyo.

1194
01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:58,500
To meet Minato-senpai.

1195
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:00,900
What?

1196
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:06,270
I'm sure Himari will bring Minato-senpai back with her.

1197
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:09,870
What do you mean?

1198
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:17,700
I want the three of you,

1199
01:53:21,370 --> 01:53:25,270
you, Himari, and Minato-senpai,

1200
01:53:26,730 --> 01:53:28,700
to spend time together as a real family.

1201
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:32,970
Why would you say something like that?

1202
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,300
I did something terrible.

1203
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:46,060
The day before our wedding.

1204
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:51,100
You left an MD in the mailbox at Minato-senpai's home.

1205
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,500
And I took it.

1206
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,000
And so,

1207
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:00,400
he never received it.

1208
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:05,770
The MD you meant for Minato-senpai.

1209
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:14,400
I'm sorry.

1210
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,570
I was scared.

1211
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,930
Of losing you and Himari.

1212
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,570
I was so scared.

1213
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,870
There's no need to apologise, Ryusei.

1214
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,900
No need at all.

1215
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,670
Ryusei, you've always been,

1216
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,700
right by my side.

1217
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,530
You brought me so much joy,

1218
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:18,500
Thank you,

1219
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:22,930
for always being by my side.

1220
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,570
For being Himari's father,

1221
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:37,070
for becoming a family,

1222
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:43,300
I'm truly thankful.

1223
01:55:49,930 --> 01:55:51,260
You're the one

1224
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:55,970
I want by my side to the very end.

1225
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:35,730
Hey Mom.

1226
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:44,470
I have something for you.

1227
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:50,270
It's from Minato-senpai.

1228
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:57,130
He says he's sorry it's late.

1229
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:31,140
Himari!
