I swear I felt our daughter kicking me.

10

Let me ask you,

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,400
what counts as "not smoothly"?

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,560
Let me think.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,970
For example,

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,860
alien invasion?

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,350
Or maybe… you don't love me anymore.

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,010
Then you'd better
hope for an alien invasion.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,630
That's a bit more realistic.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,710
