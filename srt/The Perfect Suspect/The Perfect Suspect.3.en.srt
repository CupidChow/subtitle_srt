Why did this painting make you frown?

2
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,790
I don't really get it.

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
You don't have to fully get a painting.

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,750
So this symbolizes the bond?

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,340
But I think

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,480
it's more like something else—

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,470
a trap.

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
A trap is the ultimate form of a bond.

9
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,750
When someone falls into the trap,

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,540
the emotional connection
ties into a dead knot.

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,880
Then I guess the trap

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,110
is usually love.

19
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,150

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,190

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,710
If that's the case,

23
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,120
wouldn't that basically be

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,850

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960

you ruined her whole family.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,910
That's because

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,310
I had a relationship

32
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,680
with Yang Youmo.

33
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,450
I admit that I lied at the police station.

34
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,590
I said we were just friends.

35
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,290
But that's because I was afraid

36
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,370
it might affect Lyuyun Group's reputation.

37
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,280

After that,

00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,000
he started pursuing me intensely,

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,750
and we grew close.

43
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,960
But soon I found

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
he lied to me.

45
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,310
What did he lie to you?

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
He was already married.

Since then,

51

I've been trying to
stay away from Yang Youmo.

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
But I didn't expect it
to be exposed so soon.

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,750
Even Mrs. Zhang misunderstood me.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,720
She thought I seduced her son

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,430
and I was the reason

56
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,090
that their family broke down.

57
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,680
Youmo and I didn't talk much.

We were classmates,

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720

mentioned you a lot.

563
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,220
She said you often...

564
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:21,960
I know there's been

565
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,880
a lot of gossip about me lately.

566
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,920
You know

567
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,240
what a rich, beautiful woman

568
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,830
attracts most easily?

569
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,790
Rumors.

570
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,030
Director is capable indeed.

571
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,840
Nothing beats experience.

572
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,000
Don't flatter me.

573
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,080
Speaking nicely to my face,

574
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,580
and slandering me behind my back.

575
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,750
Who's slandering you, Master?

576
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,070
Saying me act like a woman?

577
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,310
Who would dare say that?

578
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,110
Then what's with
the "softie in disguise" saying?

579
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,510
Stop laughing.

580
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
You're not innocent either.

581
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,330
Take care, Master.

582
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,620
Take care, Master.

583
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,890
I've investigated Fang Qinchun.

584
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,790
She lives a hard life.

585
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,250
Qian Cheng made her
a joint liability person

586
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,550
who owes a lot of debt.

587
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,610
But this woman is quite admirable.

588
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,640
She fell from her fortune

589
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,790
and could still
make a living by selling beef offal.

590
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,070
Because she has a son.

591
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,070
She's a mother.

592
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,240
Hello, Ms. Zhao.

593
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,920
I'll give you a lead.

594
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,880
The police are tracing

595
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,030
the source of adrenaline and anesthetics.

596
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,300
Is this related to Yang Youmo's case?

597
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,640
Yes.

598
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,800
It's related to Yang Youmo.

599
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,510
Five.

600
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,510
Eight.

601
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,440
King.

602
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,510
-Take it?
-No.

603
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,270
Pass.

604
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,200
9-10-J-Q-K.

605
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,440
Take or fold? Pay up.

606
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,480
Kai.

607
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,490
What's the point of gambling?

608
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,830
Knowledge is power.

609
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
-Got it.
-Yes, Kai.

610
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,410
Long.

611
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,270
Boss.

612
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,640
Is there anyone selling anesthetics

613
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,070
or adrenaline stuff lately?

614
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Actually, yeah, someone we know.

615
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,880
Who?

616
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,030
Xie Wuqiang.

617
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,410
I don't necessarily pay with my life.

618
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,640
But you must pay back your debt.

619
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,240
Understand?

620
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,310
Are you mute or what?

621
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
Got it.

622
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,720
Let's do charity today,

623
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,190
so you can go home safely.

624
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,640
Thank you, Kai.

625
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,510
Thank you, Kai.

626
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,200
But you must pay me back.

627
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,270
I… I'll pay. I will.

628
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
You're finally back.

629
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,070
I've been waiting for you all night.

630
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,720
The people from the hotel
donated money to Xiaohua today.

631
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,550
How did you know?

632
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,490
Someone posted it on Moments.

633
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,440
I saw it.

634
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,070
Let me see.

635
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,070
The money's for Xiaohua's treatment.

636
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,840
Let me see.

637
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,670
The money's for Xiaohua's treatment.

638
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,630
Let me see.

639
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,550
How dare you!

640
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,800
The money's for Xiaohua's treatment.

641
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,929
Treatment for what?

642
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,440
You can't take it.

643
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,800
It's for Xiaohua's treatment!

644
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,480
Mom.

645
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,250
Get back inside!

646
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,320
He hit you?

647
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,080
Xie Wuqiang, are you even human?

648
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,840
Your son has only half a life left,

649
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,280
and you still beat him?

650
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,800
I asked him to deliver the goods
but he couldn't even collect the money.

651
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,929
Shouldn't I hit him?

652
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,710
The people from the hotel
are really shameless.

653
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,440
So many people donated
only a few thousand yuan.

654
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,230
Give me the money.

655
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,230
It's for the child's treatment.

656
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,280
It's for the child!

657
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,310
You can't take it!

658
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,440
Didn't you say it yourself?

659
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,969
He has only half a life left.

660
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,890
Would this money
really save his half-life?

661
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,030
Besides, if I don't gamble,

662
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,550
where would I get money for a kidney?

663
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,610
You can't—

664
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,440
Xiaohua.

665
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,280
Get in here.

666
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,190
I said get in here!

667
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,070
Don't hit my mom!

668
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,530
-Don't hit my mom!
-Get in!

669
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,550
Xiaohua. Xiaohua!

670
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,590
Hide.

671
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,650
-Get in.
-Xiaohua!

672
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,140
Haven't beat you in days, huh?

673
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,710
Mom.

674
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,450
Useless thing.

675
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,050
It's so late. Who's there?

676
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,230
Long.

677
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,250
Son.

678
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,550
Kai,

679
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,530
could you give me two more days?

680
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
I'm not here for money.

681
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,190
I need a name.

682
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,370
Anyone been asking you for drugs lately?

683
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,320
I…

684
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,940
I haven't really—

685
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,960
Think again.

686
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,200
Lots of people buy all kinds of stuff.

687
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,450
Please give me a hint, Kai.

688
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,590
Alright.

689
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,880
Before November 3rd,

690
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,280
who asked you for
anesthetics and adrenaline?

691
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,470
November 3rd...

692
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,220
November 3rd...

693
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,240
The day Yang Youmo
died on the tower crane?

694
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,640
You seem to know something, right?

695
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,400
No, no.

696
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,840
I was just talking nonsense.

697
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,510
That was huge news in Xinggang.

698
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,440
Of course I—

699
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,670
Don't say that out there.

700
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,050
Big mouths die fast.

701
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,920
No... I'll go back and check.

702
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,860
I'll check properly, really.

703
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,920
Good. You might get a reward.

704
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,220
Thank you, Kai.

705
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,660
Thank you, Kai.

706
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,710
Please hurry up.

707
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,110
-Okay. Coming.
-Thanks.

708
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,030
This photo

709
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,070
looked odd the first time I saw it.

710
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,630
Look at Luo Lijuan's face—

711
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,150
her smile was forced.

712
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,670
The store owner said

713
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,440
Luo Lijuan really
looked forward to this child.

714
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,920
But look at her face.

715
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,480
There wasn't

716
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,710
any joy or happiness after a mom

717
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,590
gave birth.

718
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,070
And look at the time.

719
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,630
That date...

720
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,830
It's the second day after Tong was born.

721
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,440
I was wondering

722
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,570
why there were no photos
from the first day of birth?

723
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,280
And I found these.

724
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,140
This photo with Zhang Qiaoyun in it

725
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,590
was taken on the first day Tong was born.

726
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,440
At that time,

727
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,630
Yang Youmo was with Zhao Qian

728
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,360
the whole day.

729
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,650
Art exhibition by day,

730
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,000
and party by night.

731
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,550
Yang Youmo

732
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,710
put this photo in the car

733
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,670
and his home

734
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,700
to show people that he was

735
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,800
a good husband.

736
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,750
You get it?

737
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,000
What's that saying again?

738
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,800
Trying...

739
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,700
Trying to hide it
makes it more conspicuous.

740
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,600
I was talking about blindness.

741
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,690
That's what I meant too.

742
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,400
All vegetarian?

743
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,110
Less meat,

744
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,280
more greens.

745
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,800
Hello?

746
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,880
20 skewers of meat, please.

747
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,670
Alright.

748
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,800
Are you sure?

749
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,590
You saw him

750
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,480
going up from here.

751
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,480
Right?

752
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,710
I… I think so.

753
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,240
What do you mean "think so"?

754
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,000
It... It was dark.

755
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
I forgot.

756
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,780
Then keep an eye on it.

757
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,480
Listen,

758
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,590
if you see anyone who looks like him,

759
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,650
tell me right away.

760
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,160
Got it?

761
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,750
If you can't find him,

762
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,160
I'll beat your mom to death!

763
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,730
Watch closely.

764
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
Is that him?

765
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,030
You useless thing.

766
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,710
I know you killed Yang Youmo.

767
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Stop pretending.

768
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,510
My son recognized you.

769
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,110
You took the drugs
at the meeting spot that day,

770
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,230
and he followed you

771
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,670
all the way to your place.

772
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,030
Unexpected?

773
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,400
I have my son
follow every new client once.

774
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,510
That's why I know where you live.

775
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,320
Just admit what you did.

776
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
I'm not a cop.

777
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
What are you afraid of?

778
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,710
I just want to make a

779
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,230
win-win deal with you.

780
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,640
Why did you film him?

781
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,640
He has Alzheimer's.

782
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,230
The surveillance system is broken.

783
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,510
What if he forgot to pay again?

784
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,170
I should at least take a photo.

785
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,670
Alzheimer's?

786
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,930
