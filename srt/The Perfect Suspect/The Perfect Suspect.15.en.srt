and you've been wrong ever since.

367
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,720
Are you going to keep making mistakes?

368
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,880
The only way now that can free you from pain

369
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,680
and atone for your sins

370
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,000
is to confess and seek leniency

371
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,010
to end the wrongdoing.

372
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,460
That's the only way

373
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,590
you'll be free of this burden.

374
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,400
Yang Yan's still alive.

375
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,950
Over there.

376
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
This is the place.

377
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,000
Anyone there?

378
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,639
♪ There's a cat on the windowsill ♪

379
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,270
♪ Hiding quietly in the corner still ♪

380
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,900
♪ The cat hides from me, and
I hide from the cat ♪

381
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,320
♪ We're playing hide and seek like that ♪

382
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,460
♪ Inside the closet, quiet and low ♪

383
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,889
♪ It can't be found here ♪

384
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:34,679
Turn it off.

385
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,960
♪ You come to seek, I go to hide ♪

386
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:40,850
♪ You'll never find me ♪

387
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,250
Please, stop playing it.

388
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,270
We meet again,

389
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,460
Yang Yan.

390
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,210
Yang Yan,

391
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,660
I just saw another pair
of slippers outside

392
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,460
and two sets of toothbrushes.

393
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,880
Who's living here with you?

394
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,650
Leaving flowers
in Liao Yifan's memorial space—

395
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,570
that's the signal between
you and Liao Boyan, isn't it?

396
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Who are you?

397
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,590
Who are you?

398
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,660
Where's Yifan?

399
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,590
Where's Yifan?

400
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,190
Where's Yifan?

401
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,700
I never thought

402
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
that in the end, it was

403
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,840
that bunny-like girl Yang Yan

404
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,880
who dragged Liao Boyan into this.

405
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,110
What did you say? Bunny?

406
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,230
Zhao Qian,

407
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,440
that way of undervaluing people's lives

408
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,070
got you where you are today.

409
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,440
Look at me now.

410
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,190
Don't quibble about my words.

411
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,070
But you can't push all the blame

412
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,670
onto me alone.

413
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,360
One hand alone can't clap.

414
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,190
Have you ever considered

415
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,120
what kind of person Yang Youmo was?

416
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,190
If he were honest and upright,

417
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,390
with nothing to hide,

418
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,150
could I have controlled him?

419
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,590
I never loved Yang Youmo.

420
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,150
How could I possibly

421
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,680
fall in love with someone
like Zhao Yinghong?

422
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,360
From the moment I saw him,

423
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,150
I knew they were the same kind.

424
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,840
Greedy, hypocritical.

425
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,480
In others' eyes,
they played perfect fathers

426
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
and husbands.

427
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,320
Because no one saw

428
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
who they really were.

429
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,440
Just like no one saw what Zhao Yinghong

430
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,590
did to my mother.

431
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,670
So I had to tear

432
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,440
that fake mask off myself.

433
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
I just enjoyed too much

434
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
the process of
making devils reveal their true faces.

435
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,550
I felt this was what I should do,

436
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,670
and it proved to be right.

437
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,150
Yang Youmo

438
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,590
was a devil.

439
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,550
Have you ever lived with a devil?

440
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,000
I had a bunny that I really liked.

441
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,880
I brought it home and
asked my dad to name it.

442
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,800
My dad grabbed my hand

443
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,530
and forced me to throw
the bunny into the dog cage.

444
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,710
I watched it as it was

445
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,670
bitten to death alive.

446
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,440
My father told me,

447
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,630
this is how the world works.

448
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,190
Survival of the fittest.

449
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,840
Only the strong

450
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,000
deserve to live in this world.

451
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,000
Back then, I didn't know

452
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,670
why my mom committed suicide.

453
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,550
I thought she was happy.

454
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,800
She was smiling when she died.

455
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
She touched me

456
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,760
with her hand.

457
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,390
I felt like she wanted to say something.

458
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,490
Since then, I've become
obsessed with being clean.

459
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,840
I must keep my hands and face

460
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,480
clean all the time.

461
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,960
I hate children.

462
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,230
I hate the sound of their laughter.

463
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,800
Because I might be different from them.

464
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,670
I never had a childhood like theirs.

465
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,160
When I'm in a bad mood,
I'll go back to the old house.

466
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,540
Because there's still
someone locked up there—

467
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,190
the little me.

468
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,870
I would throw bunnies into the dog cage,

469
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,360
watch them being bitten to death,

470
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,400
and hear them cry.

471
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,230
I find it so stress-relieving.

472
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't know why

473
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,590
I've become like Zhao Yinghong

474
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,590
who I hate the most.

475
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,480
I admit it.

476
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,290
I admit to everything.

477
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,550
All those things

478
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,850
were all done by me, Zhao Qian.

479
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,400
Dad!

480
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,960
Dad, help me!

00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,390
It's so dirty here!

482
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
You don't listen to me,

483
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,440
and now you'll be punished.

484
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,550
Why? I didn't turn into a bunny.

485
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,320
I didn't turn into a bunny!

486
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,630
Why are you doing this to me?

487
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:15,960
Dad,

488
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,800
you can't kill me.

489
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,110
Please don't kill me, Dad!
