you're more like a philanthropist.

382

Yes.

383
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,350
He used to work for me.

I'd like to discuss with you too.

388
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,480

There's no such thing as threats.

392

393

What threat could there be?

394
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,950
Ms. Zhao, have you forgotten

395

there's still someone
out there Trying to kill you?

396
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,200
Murder is illegal.

the law and catch criminals.

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
So I can rest easy.

399

Ms. Zhao, there's an urgent matter
that needs your attention.

400
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,350

401

402

Ms. Zhao, please carry on.

403

gave specific instructions

404
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,920
that we can investigate,

405
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,590
but it must not
affect Lyuyun's operations.

For her to treat you like this,

What reason?

475
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,510
He was pursuing me.

476
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,980
But I had no feelings for him.

477
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,000
He was a senior at the company,

Then when his embezzlement came to light,

the rumors in the company

483
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,110

Either way, Fang Qinchun's

during a flash flood near a reservoir.

751

You said the truth is uncovered on foot,

752
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,390
so I visited the area.

A month before the incident,

754
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,630
Yang Youmo had gone there to sketch.

755
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,690
More importantly,

756
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,630
He asked local residents

757
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,430
about the weather,

it eventually will.

764
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,600
So it wasn't the flood
that targeted Yang Yan.

765
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,150
It was Yang Youmo who targeted the flood.

766
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,000
First, let me say,

767
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,190
this isn't a fairy tale.

768
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,110
