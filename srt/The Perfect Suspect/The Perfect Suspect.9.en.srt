1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,510
That day in the alley, I saw you

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,430
repeatedly kowtowing to Zhao Qian's men.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,320
I felt sorry for you.

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,510
In a fit of anger, I ran to your house

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,490
and poured gasoline on the bed.

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,790
So the kidnapping of Dong...

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,010
It was also an act I put on.

8
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,000
Why?

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,230
Because I wanted to push you to the edge,

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,920
so that you could finally make up
your mind to stand up to Zhao Qian.

11
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,320
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,950
But if I had the chance to do
it all over again,

13
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,680
I'd still make the same choice.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,950
Because I

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,350
am running out of chances.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,330
The chances you're talking about,

17
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,070
you mean this, right?

18
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,350
You went through my things?

19
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,509
I've almost forgotten

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,940
why I must kill Zhao Qian.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,500
But you can't forget.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,000
Zhao Qian killed your husband

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,229
and made you an accomplice,

24
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,560
pursued by debt collectors.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,160
She's also oppressed you and your son,
both openly and secretly.

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,030
Are you confident about your next move?

27
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,570
Yes.

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,480
We can show everyone

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Zhao Qian's true colors.

30
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,360
But you must tell me

31
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,390
what Qian Cheng left for you.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
Apart from a bitter life,

33
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,079
he left nothing.

34
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,990
Think it over carefully.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,310
Every detail,

36
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,680
including any unusual reactions

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
or weird things.

38
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,280
Weird things?

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,910
There's a key, which is quite weird,

40
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,400
but I believe it's

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
something left by a mistress of his.

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,680
What key?

43
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,670
The back of the key tag is
stamped with "026."

[Episode 9]

46
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,380
Hurry up.

47
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,720
01. We are at 05. Not this one.

48
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,750
It isn't 02, either.

49
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,510
05!

50
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,240
Uncle Liao, it's me!

51
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm Zhong Renxi!

52
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
I know you're in there.

53
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,360
If you don't open the door,

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,310
we won't leave.

55
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,040
Uncle Liao, please open the door.

56
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Uncle Liao. Uncle Liao.

57
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,270
Uncle Liao!

58
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,560
You...

59
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you want?

60
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,360
Uncle Liao.

61
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,190
Uncle Liao, do you remember me?

62
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,070
I don't.

63
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,020
It's okay, I'll help you remember.

64
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,600
I know you fell sick.

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,830
Starting from today,

66
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,830
we'll come here every day after school.

67
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,120
We'll help you with housework

68
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,330
and accompany you to buy groceries.

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,430
Our class is the most united

70
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,490
and the most loyal.

71
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,870
We've all read Zhong Renxi's essay,

72
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,930
and we all know you.

73
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,300
Uncle Liao, this is the essay I wrote.

74
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,600
[My Superhero]

75
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,159
It's about your story.

76
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,360
It even won an award.

77
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,080
I want to share it with you. Look.

78
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,210
Let me read it to you.

79
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,130
My superhero.

80
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,230
Superheroes don't just exist in movies.

81
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,580
They also exist in real life.

82
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,640
When I was four, my brain...

83
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,510
The Liao Boyan you knew is already dead!

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,950
He's human, and I'm a ghost!

85
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,010
Do you understand?

86
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
Uncle Liao...

87
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,400
U... Uncle Liao.

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,660
Get out!

89
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,080
Uncle Liao.

90
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,870
Uncle Liao, I...

91
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,750
I just wanted to make your life better,

92
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,190
to help you become who you used to be.

93
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,750
Uncle Liao, my dad said

94
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,510
he wrongly blamed you.

95
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,310
You are a good person.

96
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,750
Uncle Liao...

97
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,410
Dr. Liao,

98
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,850
this is Zhong Ning.

99
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,830
This tea was a gift from someone.

100
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,030
I heard it's pretty good.

101
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,200
From now on,

102
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,550
drink more tea

103
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
and less alcohol.

104
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,070
If you really feel like drinking,

105
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,510
give me a call.

106
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Why should I call you?

107
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,820
I'll bring some good wine.

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,440
We'll have a small drink, not get drunk.

109
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,630
Zhong Renxi is a good kid.

110
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,910
You are a good person.

111
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
So are you.

112
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,400
Sometimes,

113
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,320
I forget who I am.

114
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,510
It's okay.

115
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,150
I'll help you.

116
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,910
You can help me

117
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,360
by staying out of my way.

118
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,850
Dr. Liao.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Zhong Renxi and I owe you a
tremendous debt of gratitude.

120
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,170
We must repay it.

121
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,010
Fang Qinchun identified

122
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,170
Zhao Yinghong as the person
behind her actions.

123
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,480
I'll share with you some basic information

124
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
about Zhao Yinghong.

125
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,270
Zhao Yinghong is a renowned

126
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,910
entrepreneur and philanthropist
in Xinggang.

127
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,630
He started from scratch 20 years ago

128
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,910
and founded Lyuyun Group.

129
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,040
Over these 20 years,

130
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,750
Lyuyun Group has rapidly expanded

131
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,720
and become a key enterprise
in Xinggang City.

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,960
Over a year ago,

133
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,940
Zhao Yinghong became paralyzed
due to a stroke

134
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,000
and handed over the company to
his daughter, Zhao Qian.

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,060
Since then, he has been recuperating
at home.

136
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,370
[Zhao Yinghong
Gender: Male]

137
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,560
Any questions or thoughts?

138
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,480
Please share.

139
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,750
How did someone like Zhao Yinghong

140
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,790
get involved with Fang Qinchun?

141
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,340
Also, he's Zhao Qian's father.

142
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,030
Could he really be

143
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,360
the killer in the adrenaline murder case?

144
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,670
Would a father

145
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,150
do something like this to his
own daughter?

146
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,270
That's why there are many things

147
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,420
we need to verify with Zhao Yinghong
himself.

148
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,790
But he has limited mobility,

149
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,600
and

150
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,360
it might cause too much of a stir
if we just bring him in like this.

151
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
What do you think?

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,330
Then let's go to his house to
question him.

153
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,230
Please come in.

154
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,530
Captain Zheng.

155
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,490
Don't you find this room creepy?

156
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,740
Every photo here

157
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,510
seems to be

158
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,290
staring intently at anyone
who enters the room.

159
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,100
Are you saying this is Mr. Zhao's bedroom?

160
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,360
Yes, this is Mr. Zhao's bedroom.

161
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,030
He sleeps here every day?

162
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,320
Yes, he sleeps here every day.

163
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,380
Who arranged this?

164
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,920
It was Ms. Zhao.

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Ms. Zhao arranged it?

166
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,660
Go to Fang Qinchun's house again.

167
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,080
We must find the thing Zhao Qian wants.

168
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,260
Keep it down, Xiang.

169
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,970
Mr. Zhong, Qian Dong left a note

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,620
and sneaked back home.

171
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,900
How could he just run around like that?

172
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,450
Don't worry.

173
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,910
I guess Dong just wanted

174
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,260
to go back and play with his
neighborhood friends.

175
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,860
That must be why he went back.

176
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,200
And he remembered to leave you a note.

177
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,130
I'm worried something might happen to him.

178
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,750
Pack some personal belongings later.

179
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,240

-Water! Water!
-Water's here! Water's here!

184
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Whose house is on fire?

185
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
It's too big!

186
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,780
Hurry, hurry! Water!

Mom!

197
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,060
Where did you go?

198
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,270
I told you not to run around!

199
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,770
Where did you run off to?

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,980
Just now, there was a person who said...

201
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,980
Go back and tell your mom that

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,230
if there's a next time, you
won't see her ever again.

203
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,860
Do you understand!

I'm just a tripe seller.

Please, I beg you, stop coming after me.

208
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,720
I just want to raise my child in peace.

209
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,210
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

210
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,160
I can't afford to, either.

There are no ghosts in this world.

213
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,170
I'm talking about the kind of ghost

214
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
that can stand in broad daylight.

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,720
Fang Qinchun's house is in
an old neighborhood.

216
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
The surveillance cameras have gaps.

with all kinds of people mixed in.

219
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,640
To find someone without any
distinctive features,

220
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,310
it's somewhat challenging.

221
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,480
So after all that, you're basically saying
there were no eyewitnesses, right?

222
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,720
It was too dark.

223
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,920
I asked a few neighbors who
first discovered the fire,

224
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,569
but they all said they didn't see anyone.

225
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,200
Oh, right.

226
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,690
Advisor Zhong did spot a
suspicious person.

227
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,400
But the environment was complex,

228
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,330
and he couldn't make out that
person's face clearly.

229
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,380
Then we can only focus on
the physical evidence.

230
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,740
He saw someone he thought was suspicious?

231
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,260
Yes.

232
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,270
This arson case,

233
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,790

234
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay.

235
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,880
We really need to pay attention
to safety issues.

236
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,140
The fire was quite big.

What do you think?

240
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,410
It's more comfortable staying
at home, isn't it?

241
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,270
No, it's not.

242
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,230
I'm just worried the police might
suddenly show up again

243
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,730
and scare my son.

244
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,100
Don't give me that look.

245
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,010

246
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,130

In this world,

248
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,880
how many men

249
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,210
are willing to be honest with their wives?

250
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,410
Right?

251
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Boss. Madam.

252
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,950
Guess what I found.

253

Boss, look.

257
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,240
With all eyes on us, why did you risk it

258
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,300
by going to Fang Qinchun's house
and setting it on fire?

259
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,560
If anyone's taking the risk,
it should be Zhao Qian.

260
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,340
We're just starting a fire first.

261
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,720
We'll lay our cards on the table
with her later.

262
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,150
When it comes to putting out the fire,

263
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,620
she'll have to agree to whatever we say.

264

265
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,390
Good work.

266

267
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,930
Ms. Fang. This is Zhong Ning.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Why are you here again? What do you want?

269
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,310
I'm carrying something in my hands.

270
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,960
It's not convenient out here.

271
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,620
Please let me in so we can talk.

272

273
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,160
This is a backpack for you.

274
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,030
Once this period is over,

275
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,110
you can go to school with
your new backpack.

276
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,440
Thank you, Uncle.

277
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,090
Open it and take a look.

278
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,620
There's a surprise inside.

279
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,940

280

for a while.

We'll chat with your mom for a bit, okay?

286
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,990
Go ahead.

287
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,880

Are you getting used to living here?

293
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,070
It's much better than the place I rented.

deliver food to my doorstep.

298

It's very nice.

299
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,680
It's been a long time since I've
had this kind of

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,810
feeling of not having to struggle
for a living every day.

301
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,160
Everything will get better.

302
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,030
What brings you here, Mr. Zhong?

303
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,920
We found a picture frame at
the fire scene.

304
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Judging from the groove on the back,

305
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,940
there should have been a key hidden here.

306
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,000
Do you remember anything about it?

307
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Qian Cheng had a key.

308
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,990
He carried it with him every day,
hiding it secretively.

309
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,830
I always thought

310
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,420
it was the key to some mistress's house.

311
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,240
After he died,

312
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,380
I searched for it,

313
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,660
but I never found the key again.

314
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,800
So it was hidden behind the
picture frame all along.

315
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,610
Do you remember any specific features
of the key?

316
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,890
There was a tag attached to
the back of the key.

317
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,400
It had some patterns on it.

318
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,660
What kind of patterns?

319
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,650
Is this key so important?

320
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,570
Yes, it is.

321
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,010
This could be an important clue

322
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
for the police to find the arsonist.

323
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,060

338
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,690
I don't think so.

committing the crime.

She was too young at the time,

439

this was a form of tough love education,

but Zhao Qian clearly didn't
see it that way.

457

Because after she came to power,

00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,670
Zhao Qian!

553
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,360
Tell me,

554
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,890
what's the deal with the
donated ambulances?

556
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,560
Qian Cheng said

557
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,460
it has something to do with you.

558
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,350
Qian.

559
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,510
If you lie to Dad,

560
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,840
you'll be punished.

561
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,480
Alright,

562
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,380
let's call Qian Cheng here for
a face-to-face confrontation.

563
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,670
I'm afraid you won't be able to
see him anymore.

564
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,040
What do you mean?

565
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,230
By now,

566
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,860
he should be about to commit suicide.

567
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,810
Since the truth can't be hidden anymore,

568
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,930
he's only fit to be a little rabbit.

569
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,240
Did you...

570
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,720
I didn't do anything to him.

571
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,430
Dad.

572
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,420
Qian Cheng took his own life.

573
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,280
This is what you taught me,

574
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,030
to be the survival of the fittest.

575
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,350
Medicine.

576
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,740
Give me the medicine.

577
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,860
Medicine.

578
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,630
Medicine.

579
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,320
Is this what you want?

580
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,670
If you want something,

581
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,130
you have to fight for it yourself.

582
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,760
This is what you taught me

583
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,400
when I was little.

584
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,570
It's time for the underdog to rise.
