362
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,270
this audio after applying
special processing.

363
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,440
Can the technical department identify
this piece of music?

364
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,830
The audio features are too vague

365
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,890
to be matched using audio
fingerprinting technology.

366
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,510
This piece of music was probably played

367
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,570
deliberately for Yang Youmo to hear.

368
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,110
How much time passed

369
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,550
between Yang Youmo
climbing onto the platform

370
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,950
and receiving this call?

371
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
Nine seconds.

372
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,480
He hadn't even caught his breath

373
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,140
before the call came through.

374
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,750
That means

375
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,680
the person who called Yang Youmo
with a black SIM card

376
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,750
could accurately monitor

377
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,280
everything Yang Youmo did
on the tower crane.

378
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,070
He had to make sure that Yang Youmo
picked up the call

379
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,240
only after climbing onto the platform,

380
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,640
and then heard the music.

381
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,940
Observation points around the tower crane.

382
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,210
Those who came in this car,

383
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,960
come upstairs with me.

384
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,150
Er Ding, lead the team downstairs.

385
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,810
Roger that.

386
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,510
Don't come in.

387
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,240
-Okay.
-Okay.

388
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,000
JiangX 3975Z. It's Zhong Ning.

389
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,310
Keran, Ma, collect the traces.

390
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,110
Dajun, come with me. Hurry!

391
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,640
Yes, Sir!

392
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,010
He's gotten on the highway.

393
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,830
Gang.

394
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,370
It's a bit too fast.

395
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,510
The speed is over 150 km/h.

396
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,680
Yang Youmo also drove to over 150 km/h.

397
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,680
What exactly did he want to do
by driving so fast?

398
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,750
I want to know too.

399
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,400
It's him again.

400
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,030
Is Zhong Ning imitating Yang Youmo?

401
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,200
That psycho.

402
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,000
Zhong Ning!

403
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,480
Zhong Ning!

404
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,790
Zhong Ning!

405
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,750
Go wait for him by his car.

406
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,130
What about you?

407
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,440
I need to go up and get him.

408
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,570
It's too dangerous.

409
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,480
Go up?

410
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,310
You'll be in danger too if you go up.

411
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,160
Don't climb!

412
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,510
That psycho.

413
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,880
Should he fall to his death,

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
I'd take care of Xi.

415
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,590
Go wait for him!

416
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,030
You...

417
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,370
Are you planning to climb up there?

418
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,790
You didn't go up?

419
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,410
There's an elevator here.

[Always Bear in Mind: Safety First]

421
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,790
I'm going up first.

422
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,840
Wait for me! I'll take the elevator too!

423
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,070
I'll go up first. Take your time to climb.

424
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,510
Why did he climb so high?

425
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,200
Why did you come to the crime scene?

426
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,110
Are you trying to make me treat you as

427
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,410
a suspect and detain you?

428
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,030
You know I'm not a suspect.

429
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,420
Arresting me is pointless.

430
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,150
Why do you care about this case?

431
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,450
What does it have to do with you?

432
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,310
First, the mother died.

433
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
Then, both of the kids died.

434
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
In the end, the father died too.

435
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,480
So miserable and so odd.

436
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,350
Everyone in Xinggang, even those
completely unrelated,

437
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,150
will pay attention to this case,

438
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,720
let alone...

439
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,200
Let alone what?

440
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,500
Captain Zheng.

441
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,480
