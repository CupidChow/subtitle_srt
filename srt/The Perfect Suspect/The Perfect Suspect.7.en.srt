00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,030
Mom, I'm afraid.

566
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,550
It's okay.

567
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,230
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

568
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,510
I'll protect you.

569
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,110
Does she really want to wipe us out?

570
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,960
Thank you.

571
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,970
You're welcome.

572
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,110
I know you.

573
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,070
You're Fang Qinchun.

574
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,940
Your husband, Qian Cheng, was a senior
executive at Lyuyun Pharmaceuticals.

575
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,070
He hanged himself a year ago.

576
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,230
How could you know about my family?

577
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,000
I also know Qian Cheng
didn't kill himself.

578
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,150
Yes.

579
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,270
He didn't.

580
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,600
My husband was
definitely killed by Zhao Qian.

581
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,060
When he lost his mind over her,

582
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,960
I even hired a private detective

583
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,590
to investigate Zhao Qian,

584
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,540
but nothing came of it.

585
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,930
Private detective?

586
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,280
Later, he...

587
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,550
he died.

588
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,800
Even fewer people
would believe what I say.

589
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,490
They all said it was suicide.

590
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Zhao Qian

591
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,320
even sent people to threaten me,

592
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,720
telling me to keep quiet.

593
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,980
For my son's sake, I...

594
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,450
I could only...

595
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,740
Qian Cheng did hang himself,

596
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,380
but the one who
put the rope around his neck

597
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,900
was someone else.

598
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,000
I know.

599
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,920
But I have no evidence.

600
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,320
This is what makes
Zhao Qian so formidable.

601
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,470
She never does the dirty work herself.

602
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,180
Instead, she coerces and controls others.

603
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,260
That's how Qian Cheng died.

604
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,880
It's okay.

605
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,570
Your son's very sensible.

606
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,140
I wish he wasn't.

607
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,470
He's just a child,

608
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,960
and Zhao Qian still went after him.

609
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,710
I wish I could kill her.

610
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,230
If you really mean that,

611
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,190
I can help you.

612
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,640
If Zhao Qian doesn't die,

613
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,650
more people will suffer,

614
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,800
not just you and your son.

615
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,120
I don't... I don't know how to kill her.

616
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,930
You don't have to do it.

617
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,150
Just call Zhao Qian

618
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,380
and ask her to meet.

619
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,190
She won't come.

620
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,080
She will.

621
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,150
Why?

622
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,820
Because she has a guilty conscience.

do you want to play Hide and Seek?]

637
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,750
I need to take a call.

00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,360
Who is this?

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,760
I sell beef offal.

I'm Qian Cheng's wife.

641
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,450
Ms. Fang,

642
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,200
what's the matter?

643
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,890
Today I finally confirmed

644
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,720
it was really you who killed Qian Cheng.

645
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,630
Confirmed?

646
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,640
What do you mean?

647
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,640
Nothing stays hidden forever.

648
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,320
Fortunately, Qian Cheng
left something behind,

649
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,380
otherwise he would have died in vain.

650
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,280
What did he leave behind?

651
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,500
Zhao Qian,

652
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,060
you're finished.

653
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,280
What exactly do you want?

654
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,530
Tonight at 8 o'clock,

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,000
I'll be waiting for you at Xinggang Park.
