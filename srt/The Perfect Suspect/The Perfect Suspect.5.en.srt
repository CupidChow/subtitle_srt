That's called a mistress!

186
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,780
I admit that

187
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,870
I did lay a hand on Xie Wuqiang that day.

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
That was because he owed me
a lot of money.

189
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,410
I'd tried to collect it several times,
but never succeeded.

190
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,840

191
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,170
No, not a gambling debt.

192
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,150
He borrowed some money from me.

193
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,880
I don't know what he used it for.

194
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,600
You used violence to collect the debt

195
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,750
and ended up beating him to death?

196
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,960
Why would I kill him?

197
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,730
Who'd pay me back if he died?

198
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,870
Think about it,  who's the one person

199
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,400
in the entire world who'd
least want him dead?

200
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,310

202
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,260
I have this type of chip. And?

203
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,710
Your fingerprints were found on this chip,

204
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,790
and it was found near the place

205
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,510
where Xie Wuqiang was killed.

206
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,420
Explain it to me.

207
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,840
I gave him this chip.

208

Sometimes, when we friends
make small bets,

209
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,790
we'd use these chips to keep track.

210

the others to dinner.

Why?

214
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,840

trying to frame me!

215
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,960
Then tell me, who would frame you?

216

Master.

221
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,650
He does have an alibi.

222
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,960
The night before last,

223
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
he was having dinner with his mistress,
Xu Lina, at a restaurant.

224
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,670
They got completely drunk

225
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,750
and left very late.

226
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,870
He had no window to commit the crime.

227
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,550
Ms. Zhao, someone's onto us.

228
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,120
Someone tried to frame me for
Xie Wuqiang's death.

229
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,970
There's definitely something
wrong with Liu Renkai.

230
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,260
So is their marital relationship.

231
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
How can you tell?

232
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,610
Only half the bed was used,

233
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,640
while the other half was nearly
covered in dust,

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,700
which shows Liu Renkai didn't
come home to sleep often.

235
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,080
Also, Sun Ting wasn't nice to their child.

236
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,480
She probably took out the resentment

237
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,760
between her and her husband on the child.

238
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,820
You're truly cut out to make money
as a divorce lawyer.

239
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,860
Let's go to Xie Wuqiang's house.

240
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,840
Now, Wu Ping is our only hope.

241
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,350
Hopefully, we can find a breakthrough.

242
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,600
No wonder she's so hostile.

243
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,130
I think something was burnt here.

244
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,890
Has Xie Wuqiang done anything
abnormal recently?

245
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,430
He's abnormal every day.

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,910
He's either gambling

247
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,480
or selling those prohibited drugs of his.

248
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,750

249
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
you've known all along that

250
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,250
he's been doing these illegal things?

251
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,940
I dared not say.

252
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,030
If I had told anyone,

253
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,610
he would have killed me and Xiaohua.

Does Xie Wuqiang really treat his
son so badly?

256
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,550
Then why did he agree to

257
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,750
go through kidney matching for his son?

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
It was a lie.

259
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,040
He was lying, Officer.
