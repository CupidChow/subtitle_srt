Zhong.

190
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,240
I want to ask you about someone.

191
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,910
Liao Boyan, your student.

192
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,550
Seven years ago,

193
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,960
he performed brain glioma surgery
on my daughter.

194
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,290
What do you want to know?

195
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,150
Ask away.

196
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,510
Do you know how Dr. Liao is doing now?

197
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,390
Roughly, yes.

198
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,600
How did he end up like this?

199
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,120
You know he had been working abroad.

200
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,200
Five years ago, I persuaded him
to return to China.

201
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
He was tempted.

202
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,120
He agreed to come back
with his wife and daughter.

203
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,480
A few well-known hospitals in China

204
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,870
extended offers to him.

205
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,780
But unexpectedly,

206
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,540
his daughter, Liao Yifan,

207
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,050
was hit and killed by a car
right in front of him and his wife.

208
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,820
The driver fled the scene.

209
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,600
It's been five years,
and they still haven't caught the person.

210
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
After that incident,

211
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,770
Liao Boyan's life fell apart.

212
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,220
He developed severe psychological issues.

213
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,530
His wife divorced him.

214
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,860
And he was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease.

215
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,770
Back then, I made a vow.

216
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,510
Once Zhong Renxi's surgery was a success,

217
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,360
I would go vegetarian.

218
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,160
You ordered so many dishes.

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,980
Do you need something from me?

220
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,120
Let's finish this drink first.

221
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,380
Everyone else tells me to drink less.

222
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,510
Only you tell me to down it all.

223
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,070
Because I consider you a friend.

224
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,320
I know what you truly want.

225
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,240
What?

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,060
You want to forget.

227
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,510
I already have Alzheimer's.

228
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,440
I don't need alcohol to forget things.

229
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,829
But I want you

230
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,819
to remember the past.

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
And what good would that do?

232
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm not a doctor anymore.

233
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
I can't help you.

234
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,720
And I'm no longer a cop.

But that doesn't stop me
from investigating cases.

236

In a recent case,

237
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,750
the victim died

238
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,640
from an overdose of adrenaline.

239
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,070
The killer timed the death perfectly.

240
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
That means

241
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,510
the murderer had to control the dosage
and the technique precisely.

242
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,510
In other words,

243
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
the killer

244
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,790
had medical training.

245
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
Any doctor could

246
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,720
tell you that.

247
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,450
Why did you come to me, a washed-up man?

248
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,070
Dr. Liao,

249
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,160
I hope this case

250
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,550

Because this was clearly premeditated.

Why was the killer so twisted?

378

The killer forced Yang Youmo
into a deadly game

379

into a garbage pit.

The purpose

385
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,830

psychological torture on the victims.
