he said something about...

373
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,880
she might suffer a temporary hit
to her reputation,

374
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
but in the end,
no one can do anything to her.

375
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,090
It's not because the law is unjust,

376
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,130
or the police aren't doing their job.

377
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,860
It's because Zhao Qian
has lost all her humanity.

378
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,200
She's too vicious.

379
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,310
And the PR power of Lyuyun Group

380
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,440
is beyond your imagination.

381
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,030
What should I do then?

382
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,770
Give this to me.

383
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,250
Now that Liu Renkai has been arrested,

384
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,010
all the suspicion will slowly
start pointing toward Zhao Qian.

385
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,020
This

386
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,030
could be the last straw

387
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,590
that breaks her.

388
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,620
But didn't you just say
it would only hurt her reputation?

389
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,320
Yes. Legally, this evidence

390
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,480
isn't enough to convict her.

391
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,260
But if

392
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,960
we can get her to admit
everything Yang Youmo said is true,

393
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,820
it'll be a whole different story.

394
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,360
Intentional homicide means either
a death sentence or life imprisonment.

395
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,710
So what should we do?

396
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,360
I'll tell you.

397
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,830
What are you thinking about?

398
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,030
Lawsuits?

399
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,830
Nothing.

400
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,320
It's been a while
since we worked a case together.

401
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,740
Worried I've lost my edge, huh?

402
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,110
A little.

403
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,050
I just miss the old days.

404
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,200
We used to be in perfect sync.

405
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,920
No matter who we were up against,

406
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,200
we could always handle it with ease.

407
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
That's true.

408
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,270
Officers,

409
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,440
Ms. Zhao has been waiting for you
in the office.

410
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
Okay.

411
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,750
Ms. Zhao.

412
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,610
Director Zhang.

413
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Ms. Zhao.

414
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,750
You could've just asked me

415
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,160
to go to the station.

416
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,640
Why make a special trip here?

417
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,840
I didn't want to come,

418
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,260
but he said he had some questions for you.

419
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,590
I was worried he'd mess things up,

420
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,050
so I came to supervise him.

421
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,470
Ms. Zhao, sorry to bother you.

422
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,160
I have a few questions for you.

423
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,680
Ask what should be asked.

424
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Don't ask anything unnecessary.

425
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,030
Ms. Zhao's time is valuable.

426
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,830
Got it.

427
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,270
Lin Mei, make some tea for the officers.

428
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,510
-Okay.
-Right, Ms. Zhao.

429
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,070
The tea last time was good.

430
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,240
Do you still have any left?

431
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,310
Yes. Let Lin Mei make some for you.

432
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,130
I'm a professional in making tea.

433
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,290
Let's go.

434
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,360
Have a seat, Advisor Zhong.

435
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,470
Don't use that water.

436
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,350
The machine doesn't heat it hot enough.

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,720
It would be a waste of good tea leaves.

438
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,160
I'll boil a fresh pot then.

439
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,880
Okay.

440
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,250
How long have you worked here?

441
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,510
Three years.

442
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
How's the salary?

443
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Pretty good. Ms. Zhao treats us well—

444
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,310
like family.

445
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,750
Like family?

446
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,400
Then...

447
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,130
does she treat Liu Renkai the same way?

448
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,960
The last call Liu Renkai made was to you.

449
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,680
What did you talk about?

450
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,090
He wanted to borrow money from me.

451
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:53,890
How much?

452
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,310
One million yuan.

453
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,530
One million yuan?

454
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,160
Did he tell you what it was for?

455
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,960
He didn't tell me, and I didn't ask.

456
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
It's a large sum,

457
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,310
and you didn't ask?

458
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,300
What proper use could he have?

459
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,790
So I refused immediately.

460
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,590
Looks like you know him well.

461
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,570
Did he borrow money from you before that?

462
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
Indeed, that was the first time.

463
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,390
Do you think

464
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,350
Liu Renkai would
borrow money from Ms. Zhao?

465
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,510
Why would he?

466
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,350
Someone like Mr. Liu

467
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,410
wouldn't be short of a million or two.

468
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,860
Looks like you're familiar with him.

469
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,030
Did he come to the company often?

470
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,460
Not much before,

471
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,640
but lately, I saw him frequently.

472
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,720
Did Ms. Zhao

473
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
assign a task to him?

474
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,790
I don't know.

It's been a while
since Lin Mei went to make tea.

I don't want to keep you waiting.

are having a good chat.

483
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680

they're having a good chat?

485

I've got nothing to worry about.

Yes.

Do you know Liao Boyan?

I have an impression.

Your daughter's "My Superhero" essay

492
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,350
is about Liao Boyan, right?

Yes.

494
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,030
Why did you send Liu Renkai
to Liao Boyan's house?

495
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,440
That was his personal behavior.

496
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,290
Personal behavior?

497
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,570
Could you explain that?

00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,960
After the car accident,

499
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,480
I sent someone to investigate

if there was a witness.

501
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,120
It was to protect myself.

502

Who would have thought
that he went to his house?

503
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,730
And he made his house a mess.

504
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,350

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
What's there to be scared of?

559
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,970
Anyway, we need to put an end to it.

560
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,920
Fine, let's end it.

561
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,710
Show me the evidence you have.

562
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,200
What's in it

563
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,990
is enough to ruin your reputation.

564
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,060
You're trying to threaten me

565
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,810
with that illegally recorded stuff?

566
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,890
You know clearly if it can do that.

567
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,770
Kneel and kowtow.

568
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,130
Then I'll give it to you.

569
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,540
What?

570
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,400
I said kneel.

571
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,130
And kowtow to my son!

572
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,350
Why did you do that?

573
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,900
Why did you manipulate Yang Youmo
into killing people?

574
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,210
You turned my son into a monster!

575
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,070
Have you lost your mind out of anger?

576
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,550
You're more stupid than Fang Qinchun.

577
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,570
Honestly, I'm not afraid
of your so-called evidence.

578
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,920
What could it possibly do to me?

579
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,210
What could it do?

580
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,330
Let me tell you,
I have another piece of evidence.

581
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,440
Another piece?

582
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,910
It's right in front of you.

583
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,360
I am the evidence.

584
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,510
I want everyone to see

585
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,980
your true colors.

586
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,440
I want everyone to know

587
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,130
Lyuyun Pharmaceuticals
sells drugs that kill.

588
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,350
You think you can do it?

589
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,030
I'm not even afraid of death.

590
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,050
There's nothing I can't do.

591
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,840
As long as I'm alive,

592
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,430
I'll haunt you forever.

593
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,930
I will always curse you

594
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,420
and make sure you die a horrible death.

595
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,590
I want you to rot in hell

596
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,550
and kowtow to my Tong and Yan!

597
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,230
Okay.

598
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,770
Let me give you some extra evidence.

599
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,060
I made Yang Youmo
drive Luo Lijuan to death.

600
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,370
And your grandson, Tong.

601
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,660
He was unlucky.

602
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,320
Oh, right.

603
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,230
And Yang Yan.

604
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,030
I picked the location in advance.

605
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,550
I taught him to use the flood discharge
during the rainy season

606
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,350
to make it look like an accident.

607
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,510
Why could I
manipulate Yang Youmo into killing?

608
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,190
Because your son was a monster!

609
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,100
You're right.

610
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,330
Lyuyun's drugs can indeed kill people.

611
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,540
How else do you think Yang Youmo died?

612
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,860
What are you doing?

613
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,510
I told you.

614
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,230
I am the evidence.

615
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,360
Don't do anything stupid.

616
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,980
My life is...

617
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,140
the evidence.

618
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,890
This crazy woman wants to die here.

619
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
This is a trap.

620
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,840
Call an ambulance.

621
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,710
Now!

622
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,790
Okay, Ms. Zhao.

623
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,590
We just received a call.

624
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,620
Zhang Qiaoyun may have been attacked.

625
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,860
She's being treated.

626
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,820
How did she get attacked?

627
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,880
Adrenaline.

628
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,400
Aunt Zhang, how are you feeling?

629
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,320
Zhao Qian tried to kill me.

630
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,000
I have evidence.

631
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,190
Zhang Qiaoyun provided evidence.

632
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,590
We can take Zhao Qian in
for investigation.

633
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
Ms. Zhao, they are here again.

634
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,780
Ms. Zhao, please come with us.

635
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,730
Let's go.

636
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,720
[The Perfect Suspect]
