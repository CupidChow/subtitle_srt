191
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,790
You should be proud of me.

192
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,000
Really.

193
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,760
You trained me to become like this.

194
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,110
I learned it from you.

195
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,220
You even told me, "Qian,

196
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,280
you are a princess.

197
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,390
And beneath a princess's feet

198
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,970
are slaves."

199
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,150
Since you're so curious,

200
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll tell you a story.

201
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,110
A fairy tale about a princess.

202
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,680
Let me think about

203
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,160
where I should start.

204
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,240
Once upon a time,

205
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,620
there was a naive little girl.

206
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,950
How naive?

207
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,260
So naive that she thought

208
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,890
everyone in this world

209
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,410
loved little bunnies like she did.

210
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,350
But the little girl
had a domineering father,

211
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,830
who forced her to face
the truth of the world.

212
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,880
He said

213
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,590
this world is about

214
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,170
the survival of the fittest.

215
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,740
There are many bad people.

216
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,850
Only the strong can survive.

217
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,880
And bunnies were born to be eaten.

218
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,290
Yes.

219
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,720
That's right.

220
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,010
So the whole world
grew hostile to the princess.

221
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,750
They saw themselves as poor little bunnies

222
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,340
and believed the princess

223
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,960
was the evil one who'd eat them.

224
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,730
You're a bitch!

225
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,460
Are the rest of men dead?

226
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,070
Why do you have to take someone else's?

227
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,640
You're a murderer!

228
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,030
You're not a philanthropist!

229
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,080
You're a murderer!

230
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Don't go.

231
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,330
I'm willing to do anything for you.

232
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,970
The little princess was hurt.

233
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,440
Dad.

234
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,400
Is the story nice?

235
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,010
I made it up!

236
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,340
The princess is still the same princess.

237
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,510
The bunnies are still the same bunnies.

238
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,130
But the difference is

239
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,750
every fairy tale has a dark side.

240
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,270
Just like every princess gown is red.

241
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,860
Only when it's stained with blood
does one deserve to be a princess.

242
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,250
That is

243
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,580
what you taught me.

244
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,830
But I didn't teach you to kill people.

245
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
What did you say?

246
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,440
I didn't teach you to kill people!

247
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,200
Sorry, I've been hearing things lately.

248
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,220
You're right.
You didn't teach me to kill people,

249
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,710
but you taught me

250
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,300
that those bunnies all deserve to die.

251
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,150
Find a way to calm her down.

252
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,030
Don't let her cause me trouble again.

253
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,270
Calm her down? You mean...

254
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,130
She's old.

255
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,260
So we should...

256
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,030
reason with her.

257
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,760

258
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,550

259

264
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,640
Right,

266
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,860

267

in the neighborhood.

269
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,850

it'll hurt her business.

271
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,940
Okay. Add some.

you're involved in a homicide case.

You have to come with us.

285

Don't worry. Someone will pick him up.

to the Zhao family's old house last night.

this is your only chance

302
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,130
to seek justice for your husband.

303

You have a home, but you won't go back.

Instead, you stay in a hotel

305
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,960

310
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,400
and what we uncover. Do you understand?

You and Zhao Qian showed up
at her old house at the same time.

Over a year ago,

was Zhao Qian.

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,580
that he committed suicide

your husband's death
has something to do with her?

343

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,580
[Exit]

377
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,770
Excuse me. Thank you.

378
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,090
Dad, what took you so long?

379
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,280
It's all your uncle's fault.

380
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,630
Don't use him as an excuse every time.

381
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,290
Alright, I'm sorry.

382
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,840
But it doesn't matter if you came or not.

383
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,510
The award has nothing
to do with me anyway.

384
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,510
Not necessarily.

385
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,480
The students awarded the Star of Progress

386
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,930
include Zhong Renxi from Class 2, Grade 4.

387
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,040
Her winning essay
is titled "My Superhero."

388
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,110
Let's welcome her to the stage!

389
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,280
Dad! Dad! Run!

390
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,070
Go. Just go.

391
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,150
No. They must be mistaken.

392
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,360
They'll cancel it after I go there.

393
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,970
How could they be mistaken?

394
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,430
-Really.
-Just go.

395
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,480
No.

396
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,740
They're not mistaken.

397
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,410
Let's give a big round of applause

398
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,190
to our sponsor, Lyuyun Pharmaceuticals,

399
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,230
for donating a library to our school

400
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,390
and establishing the Lyuyun Scholarship.

401
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,350
[Zhong Renxi achieved excellent results
in the school-wide essay competition]

402
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:17,940
[and was honored as the Star of Progress.]

403
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,270
Let's applaud for them.

404
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,190
[Xinggang Yucai Experimental School]

405
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,280
Here.

406
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,920
Okay. Three, two.

407
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,840
Are you happy?

408
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Yes.

409
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,290
Where did you get these peonies?

410
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,110
They're from my hometown, Heze.

411
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,500
What kind of flower is this?

412
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,160
Chinese herbaceous peonies.

413
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,500
People say children
are the flowers of the country.

414
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,360
We need to protect them with care.

415
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,070
Right?

416
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,860
Let's go, Xi.

417
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,870
Dad.

418
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,070
Come. Say goodbye to the principal.

419
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,030
Goodbye.

420
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,960
Goodbye.

421
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,690
I like her so much.

422
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,930
She's so pretty.

423
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,990
Dad, do you know her?

424
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,440
What's wrong with you?

425
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,550
Today was the first time
I went on stage to get an award,

426
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,320
but you haven't praised me.

427
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,910
Xi.

428
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,630
Can you give me the certificate?

429
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,220
I'll return it to her.

430
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,350
Why?

431
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,080
We can't accept it.

432
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,120
I earned it with my own effort.

433
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,590
Why can't I accept it?

434
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,840
Just listen to me, okay?

435
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,420
No!

436
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
My Superhero.

437
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,880
[Death once closed the door of life
and the window of health on me.]

438
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
[I spent those days in fear and anxiety.]

439
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,380
Hello, have you found her?

440
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,580
I searched everywhere,
but still couldn't find her.

441
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,700
Times have changed.

442
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,480
Even a beef offal vendor
had the guts to fool me.

443
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,030
What exactly does she have?

444
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,120
Are you curious?

445
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,800
Kai, being too curious isn't good.

446
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,800
No matter what she has,

447
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,280
find it and destroy it.

448
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,140
Please come in.

449
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,400
Mr. Zhong,

450
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,540
Ms. Zhao is on her way back.

451
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,070
Please have a seat and wait for her.

452
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,070
I need to get back to work.

453
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,070
Okay. Thank you.

454
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,110
You must be Mr. Zhao.

455
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,070
I'm a friend of your daughter's.

456
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,610
I've heard a lot about you.

457
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,270
Sorry.

458
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,010
I've long heard of your reputation
as an outstanding entrepreneur.

459
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,800
You established Lyuyun.

460
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,530
More importantly,

461
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,150
you raised a more outstanding daughter

462
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,230
as your successor.

463
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,430
Zhao Qian is very impressive now.

464
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:32,360
She can do
whatever she wants in Xinggang City.

465
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,140
I'm wondering if Zhao Qian

466
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,880
is what you expected her to be.

467
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,500
Advisor Zhong.

468
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,000
Ms. Zhao.

469
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,550
I'm having a chat with your dad.

470
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,070
Advisor Zhong,

471
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,130
you specially came here at this hour.

472
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,890
What's the matter?

473
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,070
-I'm not an advisor today.
-Have a seat.

474
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,550
Today, I'm just a parent.

475
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,960
I'm returning
the certificate and scholarship to you.

476
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,320
[Scholarship: Zhong Renxi]

477
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,590
Why?

478
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,440
Though Xi's essay is well-written,

479
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,610
it just felt strange to receive

480
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,550
the certificate from you.

481
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,550
I thank you on her behalf.

482
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,920
You think

483
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,960
your daughter won the award

484
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,620
because of our relationship?

485
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,630
You're overthinking it, Advisor Zhong.

486
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,480
Or

487
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,230
you don't believe
your daughter is this capable?

488
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,090
I have great faith in my daughter.

489
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,570
She is outstanding.

490
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,920
But excellence has nothing
to do with grades—

491
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,110
just like being a successor has nothing
to do with character.

492
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,320
I was once a little girl too.

493
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,320
Since my childhood, my dad has taught me

494
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,780
I should do my best to get what I want.

495
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,920
Advisor Zhong, people of good character

496
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,930
tend to suffer losses.

497
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,550
So,

498
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,280
Fang Qinchun suffered losses.

499
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,070
Fang Qinchun?

500
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,280
That beef offal vendor?

501
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,190
Yes.

502
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,400
Someone just poured gasoline in her house.

503
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,470
Gasoline?

504
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,070
That's horrible.

505
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,560
It has nothing to do with me.

506
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,670
Really?

507
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,150
She said her husband, Qian Cheng,
died because of you.

508
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,920
Since she said that,

509
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,190
I suppose Qian Cheng's death

510
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,670
does have something to do with me.

511
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,000
About two years ago,

512
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,110
I found out Qian Cheng embezzled funds.

513
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,050
He begged me to cover it up for him.

514
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,110
I refused.

515
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,880
Later, I reported everything

516
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,670
to the group.

517
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,550
Not long after that,

518
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,360
he committed suicide.

519
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,320
That's why Ms. Fang has been pestering me.

520
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,400
Goodbye, Advisor Zhong.

521
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,070
Goodbye.

522
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,880
The police came to me.

523
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,810
He mentioned Fang Qinchun.

524
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,960
Fang Qinchun
is definitely on their radar now.

525
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,030
Don't act rashly for the time being.

526
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,820
Do you understand?

527
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,360
Yes.

528
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,360
So?

529
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,630
Dajun and his men have investigated.

530
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,920
The bodyguards around Zhao Qian

531
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
never went to Fang Qinchun's place.

532
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,640
Looks like Zhao Qian wasn't lying.

533
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,500
She really wasn't the one
who poured gasoline.

534
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,590
If it wasn't Zhao Qian,

535
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,720
who else could it be?

536
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,890
Do you still remember Wu Ping?

537
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,920
Is lying really worth it?

538
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,160
Think about your son.

539
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
He said the same thing.

540
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,950
Fang Qinchun and Wu Ping

541
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,760
were both instigated by someone.

542
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,160
And maybe
it's the same person behind them.

543
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,110
Then who

544
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,310
can control two people at the same time?

545
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,950
We've confirmed

546
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,860
you have nothing to do
with the current case.

547
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,760
Can I leave now?

548
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,850
But there's still one thing

549
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,710
we hope you'll cooperate with us on.

550
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,280
What is it?

551
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,920
Who told you to ask Zhao Qian out?

552
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

553
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,820
You know clearly.

554
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,840
From yesterday until now,

555
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,230
every move you made

556
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,030
was under someone's direction.

557
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,880
You probably don't know

558
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,490
what kind of person the one behind you is.

559
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
He's extremely dangerous.

560
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,240
He is directly linked
to a few homicide cases.

561
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,550
We hope you'll cooperate with us

562
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,760
and help us find him.

563
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,880
You told us before

564
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,270
Zhao Qian was a good person.

565
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,780
It's only been a few days.

566
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,110
Why the sudden change?

567
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,550
Zhao Qian went too far.

568
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,970
She tried to scare me by pouring gasoline.

569
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,440
Besides, I didn't do anything.

570
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,240
What if Zhao Qian
didn't do anything either?

571
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:33,800
We've looked into it.

572
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,060
Zhao Qian wasn't the one
who poured gasoline in your house.

573
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,000
The one who did it

574
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,710
is the person behind you.

575
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,190
The goal was to sow discord
between you and Zhao Qian

576
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,320
and then use you.

577
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,150
We can't let ourselves
be used like that, right?

578
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,300
Tell us.

579
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,730
Who is that person?

580
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:16,470
[The Perfect Suspect]
