then we have no time to lose.

188
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,390
Because we might not be the only ones
looking for them.

189
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,750
Right.

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,360
And Zhao Qian must be sent to the
detention center as soon as possible.

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,030
Okay.

192
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,870
[Xinggang Detention Center]

193
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,990
I don't care what method you use

194
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,080
or how much it costs.

195
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,390
Get me out of here as soon as possible.

196
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,420
Ms. Zhao, listen to me.

197
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,890
Please calm down first.

198
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,200
You need to tell me first

199
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,000
whether you participated in...

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,620
I didn't participate in anything.

201
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,840
They set me up.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
It was all part of their plan.

203
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,630
I'll say it again,

204
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,600
get me out of here.

205
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,320
I don't belong in a place like this.

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,390
Do you understand?

207
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,920
Okay, I understand.

208
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,800
Ms. Zhao said it's unbearable in there.

209
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,270
Mr. Zhao, you've got to do something.

210
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,080
Even if you don't care about Ms. Zhao,

211
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,120
Lyuyun can't afford this kind of turmoil.

212
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,200
If this goes on,

213
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,860
our group will collapse.

214
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,400
You've got to be the backbone of Lyuyun.

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,070
Mr. Zhao.

216
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,080
I just got back from a police questioning.

217
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,340
There's something...

218
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,060
Ms. Shen, take Mr. Wang away for a while.

219
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,760
Okay.

220
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,990
Mr. Zhao, I'm leaving then.

221
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,990
Mr. Wang, please.

222
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,070
One day,

223
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,850
when Ms. Zhao and Liu Renkai were talking,

224
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,870
I overheard Liu Renkai say

225
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,510
he got something left behind
by Qian Cheng.

226
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,340
Something that could destroy Lyuyun.

227
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
It was Zhao Qian.

228
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
She wanted to win me over.

229
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,000
Mr. Zhao, I'm telling the truth.

230
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,570
Mr. Zhao, I have evidence!

231
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,560
By the way, Ms. Zhao said before

232
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,030
that we must find

233
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,960
Liu Renkai's mistress and son.

234
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,800
Could it be that the thing is
hidden on them?

235
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,400
Liu Renkai has hidden
his mistress and son.

236
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,210
Do you think he's only hiding those
two people?

237
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,470
There must be something more important.

238
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,210
Ms. Zhao probably thinks the same way.

239
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,320
What do you want to say?

240
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,060
Mr. Zhao.

241
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,840
Don't you hold any grudge
against Ms. Zhao at all?

242
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

243
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,500
I spoke out of turn.

244
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,520
Captain Zheng.

245
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,840
We've located

246
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,690
where Xu Lina and her son are hiding.

247
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,480
Okay, find them and bring them to
the police station.

248
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,120
Yes, Sir.

249
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,560
Good boy.

250
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,390
How is it?

251
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,520
I just asked the neighbors.

252
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,320
That woman and the child left in a car.

253
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,190
How long have they been gone?

254
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,250
They left just now.

255
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,090
Do you know who this is?

256
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,320
He's Ms. Zhao's father,

257
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,430
chairman of Lyuyun, Zhao Yinghong.

258
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,210
Mr. Zhao.

259
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,990
Why do you want to see me?

260
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,970
Don't be afraid.

261
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,200
Mr. Zhao knows that

262
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Liu Renkai left something with you.

263
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,090
That thing is harmful to you and
brings no benefit.

264
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,900
He...

265
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,480
He didn't leave me anything.

266
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,340
Tell me.

267
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,750
How much money do you want?

268
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,310
He didn't leave me anything.

269
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,360
I don't know.

270
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,470
It doesn't matter how much money
you give me.

271
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,280
Xu Lina.

272
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,850
Do you still not understand?

273
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,360
Your backer has fallen.

274
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,720
If you're willing to tell the truth,

275
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
Lyuyun Group can be your backer.

276
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,870
As long as you tell us

277
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,570
where Liu Renkai put that thing,

278
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,100
Lyuyun can ensure wealth and prosperity
for you and your child.

279
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,540
How old is this child?

280
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,310
Less than two months old.

281
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,650
Do you hope

282
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,910
to see him grow up safely?

283
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,460
There's a police car.

284
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,470
Police. Turn off the engine.

285
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:23,930
[Police]

286
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,010
Criminal Investigation Division
of Nanying District.

287
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,310
Are you Xu Lina?

288
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,580
Did they force you to do anything?

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,430
No. I got in the car voluntarily.

290
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,120
I wanted to beg them to
save Liu Renkai for me.

291
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,700
We need you to come with us

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,660
to assist with the investigation.

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,000
Liu Renkai, do you recognize us?

294
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,200
Who the hell are you?

295
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,140
You're already in custody.
Still talking so arrogantly?

296
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,510
The two of us lost everything at your
casino, and our families were ruined.

297
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,110
They say it was a setup by you.

298
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,090
If entering the casino could
ruin your family,

299
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,520
did I even have to set anything up?

300
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,430
Ms. Zhao, did you sleep well?

301
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,230
Do you even have to ask?

302
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,010
Try sleeping in the large dorm yourself.

303
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,720
This is how the conditions in the
detention center are.

304
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,100
The days ahead are long.

305
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,590
You have to adapt.

306
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,400
Days ahead?

307
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,610
Clear up the matter about Zhang Qiaoyun.

308
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,920
Again?

309
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,320
I'll say it one more time.

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
She framed me.

311
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,940
That place belongs to you.

312
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Zhang Qiaoyun also identified you.

313
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,830
Tell us.

314
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,110
How did she frame you?

315
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,030
She's setting me up.

316
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,610
Do you understand?

317
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,130
I won't admit it.

318
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,510
Go ahead.

319
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,480
Okay.

320
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,590
What is it?

321
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,920
The location where Zhao Qian and
Zhang Qiaoyun had the conflict

322
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,510
was a blind spot for the
surveillance cameras.

323
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,680
But there was a car nearby.

324
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
The dashcam in the car

325
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,980
recorded the entire process of
what happened between them.

326
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,240
Zhao Qian isn't lying.

327
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,490
She didn't kill Zhang Qiaoyun.

328
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,550
Zhao Qian didn't try to kill you.

329
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,480
You wanted to die, didn't you?

330
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,000
Tell me.

331
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,650
What's the point of me staying alive?

332
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,210
I gave birth to such a beast
as Yang Youmo.

333
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Should I stay alive just to be cursed at?

334
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,920
To be shamed and ridiculed?

335
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,540
If my death could bring about

336
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,090
evidence that can make the bad guys
get their comeuppance,

337
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,680
it'd be worth it.

338
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,970
Aunt Zhang.

339
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
Who taught you

340
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,440
to do those things?

341
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,240
No one.

342
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
It did it myself.

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,790
How did you know how to use
the invisible headset

344
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,200
and install remote recording equipment
at home?

345
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Xiao Dade is a livestreamer.

346
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,240
He taught me before.

347
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
Aunt Zhang wasn't telling the truth.

348
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,500
There must be someone behind her.

349
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,070
There's someone behind Fang Qinchun too.

350
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,000
And both their target is Zhao Qian.

351
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Evidence.

352
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,900
The most important thing now is
solid evidence.

353
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,590
Liu Renkai got beaten up in
the detention center

354
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,440
by his enemy.

355
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,270
Xu Lina...

356
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270
Xu Lina said

357
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,600
Liu Renkai didn't leave her any evidence.

358
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,070
When they found Xu Lina,

359
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,410
she was in Zhao Yinghong's car?

360
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,200
Yes.

361
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,310
Mr. Zhao.

362
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,080
Lin Mei and others are coming
to pick you up.

363
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,240
The Lyuyun shareholders' meeting today
requires your presence.

364
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,790
All they care about is money.

365
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,850
You must take care of yourself.

366
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,250
Mr. Zhao.

367
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,280
We've shown you the documents.

368
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,870
We came to see you today

369
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,680
to verify some matters with you.

370
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,640
Why did you bring people

371
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,510
to find Xu Lina?

372
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,420
Is that question funny?

373
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,610
Go ask her.

374
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,590
Ask her?

375
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,440
She got into your car, and you're the
chairman of Lyuyun Group.

376
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,900
What would she dare to say?

377
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,720
But we know what you want.

378
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,670
It was because of what
Qian Cheng left behind, right?

379
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,220
Mr. Zhao.

380
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,090
You know very well what
Zhao Qian has done.

381
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,110
You can't possibly save her.

382
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,400
Actually,

383
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,480
you're the one

384
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
who made her this way.

385
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,470
I asked her childhood classmates
and teachers.

386
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,310
Before her mother passed away...

387
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,880
Get out!

388
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,720
The kind of soil and seed

389
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,660
determines the kind of fruit it bears.

390
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,750
What happened in the Zhao family's
old house

391
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,080
was the soil you provided for Zhao Qian.

392
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,270
And the seed

393
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,490
was you.

394
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,600
If you still harbor foolish thoughts

395
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,920
of helping Zhao Qian by illegal means,

396
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,980
it'll only add to Zhao Qian's crimes.

397
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,940
In the end,

398
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,810
you won't walk away unharmed either.

399
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,610
Who changed its collar?

400
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,610
And when?

401
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,540
Has Liu Renkai been here recently?

402
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,870
I guess

403
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,250
this is the evidence Qian Cheng
left behind.

404
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,750
How did you find it?

405
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,310
You changed the collar.

406
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,510
I have a pretty good memory.

407
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,380
Impressive.

408
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,710
The dog you kept at the casino

409
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,240
is that old dog, isn't it?

410
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,060
Yes.

411
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,110
It was a gift from Zhao Yinghong.

412
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,440
What were you thinking,

413
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,570
hiding the evidence in the dog's collar?

414
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,410
Because they'd always treated me
like a dog.

415
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,570
When I hid it in there, I thought

416
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,580
if this thing were to be exposed one day,

417
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,480
the one that could bite her to death

418
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,980
would be the most obedient dog around her.

419
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,750
Exciting.

420
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,440
This is Zhao Qian's fate.

421
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,590
I'll ensure that none of you ever

422
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,650
get the chance to turn things around.

423
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,620
You're abusing your power

424
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,970
and twisting the law for your own ends.

425
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,070
Because of that, I had to sleep
in a large dorm

426
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,870
with 20 other women every night.

427
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,000
You've found out the truth
about Zhang Qiaoyun's matter.

428
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,510
Why am I still being detained?

429
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,910
Take a look. What is this?

430
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,680
How would I know?

431
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,720
There's quite a lot of stuff stored
on this SD card,

432
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,110
and we printed some out.

433
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,970
Look.

434
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,350
This is a part of it.

435
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,130
Internal bribery,

436
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
manipulation of equity,

437
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,110
and the full story behind that batch of
problematic ambulances.

438
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,830
You don't know?

440
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,090
Let me remind you then.

441
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,270
Liu Renkai threatened you with these.

442
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Do you know now?

443
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,030
Can his words be trusted?

444
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,540
It's forged. I won't admit to it.

445
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,470
You can deny everything,

446
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,960
But I'm telling you,

447
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,790
the complete chain of evidence

448
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,480
will reveal everything you, Zhao Qian,

449
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,510
have done.

450
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,790
Before Qian Cheng committed suicide,

451
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,790
he got drunk and went to your office.

452
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,530
Aren't you worried

453
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
I'll expose everything from before?

454
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,290
Embezzlement and internal bribery.

455
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,880
You're the one responsible for all of it.

456
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,880
You set me up?

457
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,770
I'm just protecting myself.

458
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,360
Just with these photos?

459
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,820
Zhao Qian.

460
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,790
If these things are exposed,

461
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,900
you won't get away with it.

462
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,410
Just you wait to go to hell with me.

463
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,730
While controlling Qian Cheng,

464
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,480
you used the same methods
to control Yang Youmo.

465
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,830
I was in a normal relationship with him.

466
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,640
It didn't concern the issue of control.

467
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,900
Normal relationship?

468
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,970
Because of your so-called
normal relationship,

469
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,960
he killed his wife and child.

470
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,330
Isn't this just your imagination?

471
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,700
Zhao Qian,

472
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,520
this is Luo Lijuan's diary.

473
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,390
[Mom's Diary]

474
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,050
The last entry of this diary was torn out.

475
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,540
But through technical means,

476
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,040
we restored the contents of
the last entry.

477
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,030
[Tong cried a lot today. Even playing his
favorite "Hide and Seek" didn't help.]

478
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,040
[It's sunny outside. Only Tong and I
are crying. I carried him out for a walk.]

479
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,990
[We didn't expect to meet a female ghost
under the sun, singing "Hide and Seek" for us.]

480
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,050
[Why do I have to live in such pain?
Why not end it?]

481
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,050
[I cried with Tong to that song. I
suddenly remembered what that ghost said.]

482
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,690
It's been proved to be
Luo Lijuan's handwriting.

483
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,680
This is the last entry Luo Lijuan wrote

484
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,070
while she was in a clear state of mind.

485
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,490
She said in the diary that

486
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
you and Yang Youmo were trying to
push her to her death.

487
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:26,350
What makes you think what
she wrote is true?

488
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Fang Qinchun hired a private detective
to follow you

489
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,720
in order to investigate Qian Cheng's
infidelity,

490
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,850
and filmed a video of

491
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,150
you and Yang Youmo forcing Luo Lijuan.

492
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,710
This video confirms that

493
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,700
the contents of the diary are true.

494
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,020
You knew from the very beginning that

495
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,140
Yang Youmo had a wife.

496
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,090
He used to have a happy family.

497
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,350
Thank you all for coming

498
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,180
and for your attention.

499
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,350
I want to thank one more person,

500
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,730
my wife.

501
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,890
She's the most important person to me.

502
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,730
The happiness of Yang Youmo's family

503
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,990
was something you'd never experienced.

504
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,530
So you believed Yang Youmo's
love was fake.

505
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,000
That's why

506
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,960
you wanted to expose him.

507
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,880
Because in your world,

508
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,940
everything can be manipulated.

509
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,110
And you

510
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,850
particularly enjoy the excitement

511
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,720
of controlling others’ fate.

512
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,290
So you used the resources around you

513
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,150
to erode Yang Youmo's will,

514
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,920
and made him lose himself

515
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,960
in the Eden Garden you created for him

516
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,610
step by step.

517
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,600
I hope you can give him plenty of support
for his art exhibition.

518
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,920
Hello.

519
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,740
Hello.

520
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,480
So you manipulated Yang Youmo
step by step,

521
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,460
until you had complete control over him.

522
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,550
Then you gradually alienated him,

523
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,480
making him feel at a loss.

524
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,180
You made him think that

525
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,710
Luo Lijuan and Yang Yan were standing
in the way between you two.

526
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,550
In the end,

527
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,280
you manipulated Yang Youmo

528
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,750
to kill his wife and child.

529
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,100
I merely peeled off the layer of skin
he already had on him.

530
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,960
What kind of skin?

531
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,200
Why don't you guess?

532
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,810
Since your life is so miserable,

533
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,440
why not just end it?

534
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,510
What happened?

535
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,200
Look over there.

536
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,310
Why is someone lying face down?

537
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,920
Step back.

538
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,440
Stop filming. There's nothing to see here.

539
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,570
-Back off.
-Something happened here.

540
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,160
Actually, I've always felt sorry for her.

541
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,220
Her mother is gone.

542
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
Sometimes when I look at her,

543
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,310
I feel like I'm her mother.

544
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
But I don't know how to raise a child.

545
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,070
Youmo.

546
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,840
Do you think I look like someone

547
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,720
who can raise a child?

548
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,750
Look.

549
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,040
Doesn't Yang Yan

550
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,030
look like a rabbit?

551
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,510
Doesn't she?

552
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,640
Yes, she does.

553
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,790
Do you want to raise a rabbit?

554
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,000
Yes.

555
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,030
Do you want to raise a rabbit?

556
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,070
Are you happy?

557
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,630
You think Yang Youmo has a layer
of skin on him.

558
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,700
And what about you?

559
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,980
You obviously have more than one
layer of skin on you, right?

560
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,510
After manipulating Yang Youmo to
drive Luo Lijuan to her death,

561
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,450
you further controlled his
thoughts and emotions.

562
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,630
You even participated in the planning and
execution of the flood discharge incident.

563
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,960
You killed Yang Yan!

564
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,810
Because you enjoy the process

565
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,100
of completely owning and controlling
a person's soul.

566
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,540
You're really good at making up stories.

567
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,070
What gives you the right to
make up stories like this?

568
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,510
Your imagination?

569
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,860
It's what Yang Youmo said to Xiao Dade.

570
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,060
If she hadn't hinted me

571
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,380
that as long as Luo Li Juan,

572
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,199
Tong, and Yang Yan

573
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,909
were still around,

574
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,300
she wouldn't marry me.

575
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,730
If she hadn't said that,

576
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,449
how could I have done those things?

577
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,150
How could I?

578
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,560
Xiao Dade originally planned to
make some money through video.

579
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,570
But what he didn't expect was that

580
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,270
it would cost him his life.

581
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,400
Liu Renkai has already confessed.

582
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,110
It was you who ordered him to
kill Xiao Dade.

583
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,160
That's just Liu Renkai's side of story.

584
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,840
To clear his own name,

585
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,760
of course he could make up anything.

586
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,020
I can say anything too.

587
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,590
Will you believe me?

588
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,400
Zhao Qian.

589
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,140
Your only option now is to
make a full confession

590
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,630
and strive for leniency.

591
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,420
What am I supposed to confess?

592
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,710
I've said everything I should.

593
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,070
There's no point in denying it
any further.

594
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,710
The law will give a fair judgment.

595
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,170
But before the verdict comes out,
you'd better

596
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,320
do something about your obsession
with cleanliness.

597
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Don't expect any special treatment

598
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
in the detention center.

599
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,590
Zhao...

600
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,990
Ms. Zhao is very busy today.

601
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,450
You can schedule a time with her
another day.

602
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,710
I've been waiting for her for so long.

603
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,840
I didn't even dare to go to the toilet.

604
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,280
Let me see Ms. Zhao, please.

605
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
You could have chosen not to wait.

606
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,440
You want to see me? Of course I have time.

607
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,060
Ms. Zhao.

608
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,670
Ms. Zhao.

609
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm Liu Renkai from the
Security Department.

610
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,070
I used to work under Mr. Zhao.

611
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,920
Mr. Zhao is in the hospital.

612
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,590
You can go to the hospital
to keep him company.

613
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,390
I've been there, but they refused to
let me see him.

614
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,630
They?

615
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,070
Who are they?

616
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,560
I don't know either.

617
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,830
Ms. Zhao.

618
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,820
This is a folk remedy I got from some
old Chinese medicine doctor.

619
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,620
It's said to be especially effective
for strokes.

620
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,280
A folk remedy for my father?

621
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,170
You came to Lyuyun Pharmaceuticals

622
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
to deliver a folk remedy?

623
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,290
Ms. Zhao, you're right.

624
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,450
This outdated stuff is no good.

625
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,870
It should be thrown away.

626
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,940
What's your name?

627
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,240
Liu Renkai.

628
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,030
Remember,

629
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,510
as long as I'm here,

630
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,420
you'll always have a place in
Lyuyun Group.

631
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,850
My father always said you're loyal.

632
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,610
You would speak up whenever
something happened.

633
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
Concerned?

634
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,890
Can you afford to be concerned?

635
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,960
If you still want to eat meat at my table,

636
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,890
then be a good hound

637
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,930
and find the prey for me.

638
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,130
Toy dogs are indeed better.

639
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,950
At least they don't bite.

640
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,900
Evidence can be backed up,

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,230
but people can't.

642
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,290
I want to see Zhong Ning.

643
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,820
You miss us so soon?

644
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,420
What's the matter?

645
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,800
I killed someone.

646
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,610
Qian Cheng?

647
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,120
I always thought

648
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,030
I wasn't anyone's puppet.

649
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,950
But now I realize

650
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,690
I'm no different from a puppet.

651
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,190
It was Zhao Qian

652
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,010
who asked me to kill Qian Cheng.

653
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,080
I have evidence.

654
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,150
Where's the evidence?

655
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,890
In Xu Lina's house.

656
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,700
So made a stop at her house
before you ran away

657
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,360
to get the evidence?

658
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,840
This evidence is the poison

659
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,000
that will bring Zhao Qian and me
down together.

660
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
If I reveal it, Zhao Qian won't get away.

661
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,370
If I take on one more death, it's still
a capital crime.

662
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,970
I don't care.

663
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
So

664
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,560
what is it that

665
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,200
made you suddenly come to your senses?

666
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,930
My son.

667
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,020
I want my son to be safe.

668
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,950
If Zhao Qian isn't convicted,

669
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,710
my son will be in danger.

670
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,520
This is the only thing I can do
for my son.

671
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,310
How is it? Anything in there?

672
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
This should be it.

673
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,110
We asked you

674
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,880
how Qian Cheng

675
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,960
died.

676
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,670
You told us he committed suicide,

677
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,760
right?

678
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,490
I'll ask you again,

679
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,020
did Qian Cheng commit suicide?

680
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,800
Yes, he did.

681
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,130
Last time I saw you,

682
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,660
I thought you were a sensible person.

683
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,620
Ms. Zhao, I am sensible.

684
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,280
Is that so?

685
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,010
Show me your loyalty first.

686
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,540
Ms. Zhao.

687
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,010
You're not planning to kill someone,
are you?

688
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,140
Murder's illegal if you get caught.

689
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,720
But what if you don't?

690
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,960
Do you think someone like Qian Cheng
would commit suicide?

691
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,400
Suicide?

692
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,160
People can do anything

693
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,190
when they’re cornered.

694
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,270
Find his weakness,

695
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,830
push him a bit,

696
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,610
and force him to kill himself.

697
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,680
Is it hard?

698
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,750
It's not.

699
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,840
So tomorrow night,

700
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,420
will Qian Cheng commit suicide?

701
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,830
Yes, he will.

702
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,700
It's fake.

703
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
This is fake.

704
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,110
I didn't. I have nothing to do with them.

705
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,880
Qian Cheng died because

706
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,010
Liu Renkai forced him to hang himself.

707
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,690
Liu Renkai forced Qian Cheng
to hang himself?

708
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,110
Did he tell you that himself?

709
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,430
My hands are clean.

710
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,800
I didn't do anything.

711
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,000
These hands have never been stained
with a single drop of blood.

712
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,230
You can't do this to me!

713
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,480
I didn't do anything.

714
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,920
You can't do this to me!

715
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,190
Zhong Ning.

716
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,400
I want to make a deal with you.

717
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
What kind of deal?

718
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,570
You've been investigating for so long

719
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,960
just to find out

720
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,020
who the killer in the
adrenaline murder case is, right?

721
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,400
Destroy this,

722
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,440
and I'll tell you his name.

723
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,760
It's Liao Boyan.

724
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,670
You've known?

725
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,230
Since you've known, why didn't you
arrest him,

726
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,400
and had to arrest me instead?

727
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,190
Why did you have to arrest me?

728
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,130
Would things have come to this if you
had caught him earlier?

729
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,190
Playing me.

730
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,030
I get it now.

731
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,720
You want to cover for Liao Boyan,

732
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,200
because he once saved your
daughter's life.

733
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,150
I read Zhong Renxi's essay.

734
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,630
Superhero, huh?

735
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,390
What an accomplice.

736
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,730
He's an accomplice.

737
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,430
He's an accomplice!

738
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,430
You all want to play me, huh?

739
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,480
I have one more request.

740
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:45,990
Could you

741
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
help me get a change of environment?

742
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,140
I don't want to eat in the
detention center anymore,

743
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,390
and I don't want to share a large dorm
with 20 women.

744
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,490
Because I'm Zhao Qian.

745
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,990
I'm Zhao Qian.

746
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,550
Zhao Qian.

747
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,840
Compared to everything that you've done,

748
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,960
what you're experiencing now
can't even be considered punishment.

749
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,980
[Liao Boyan] [Yang Youmo] [Zhao Qian]

750
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,070
After all this thinking,

751
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,730
you have no second suspect for

752
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,610
the mastermind behind it all, right?

753
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,500
Mr. Zhong, I investigated as
you instructed.

754
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,550
Liao Yifan's death

755
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,610
had nothing to do with the ambulance.

756
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,160
Tell us more.

757
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,110
I went to see

758
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,170
the nurse in the ambulance back then,

759
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,480
and it's confirmed that the ambulance
Liao Yifan was in

760
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,020
wasn't donated by Lyuyun Group.

761
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,590
Because it was an old ambulance.

762
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,440
Also, Liao Yifan didn't die in
the ambulance.

763
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,250
He died in an operating room.

764
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,770
If that's the case,

765
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,760
Liao Boyan would have no motive
to kill Zhao Qian.

766
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,370
Did we get it all wrong?

767
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,070
Liao Boyan has nothing to do with
the adrenaline murder case.

768
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,020
And he has Alzheimer's disease.

769
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,540
Are we sure about that?

770
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,520
