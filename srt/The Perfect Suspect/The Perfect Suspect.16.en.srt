Don't tell anyone about my illness.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,430
I don't want people we know to look at me

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,920
with pity in their eyes.

5
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,240
Don't worry.

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,410
President Cao won't find out either.

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,680
Here, take it.

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,680
Thank you.

9
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,680
Is it good?

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Mom, you eat.

11
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,800
It's delicious.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,950
Try some.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,680
Okay.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,230
It's really good.

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,789
Uncle Liao, thank you for picking me up.

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,590
Actually, I've always wanted
to ask you a question.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,229
What is it?

18
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,310
Why are you so nice to me?

19
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,070
Because you remind me of my daughter.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,950
Do we look alike?

21
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,950
You're alike deep down.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,430
Where is your daughter?

23
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,120
Uncle Liao,

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,190
I think... Aunt Tan is weird sometimes.

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,310
She's ill.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
What kind of illness?

27
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,590
She's forgotten a lot of things.

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,710
Aunt Tan is back.

29
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,190
Get in. Let's go home.

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,020
I'm not going home.

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,079
Where's Yifan?

32
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,170
I don't want to go home.

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,310
I want to find Yifan.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,470
Yifan.

35
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,190
Yifan.

36
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,000
I miss you so much.

I really miss you.

38
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,430
I miss you so much.

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,680
I finally know

43
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,540
how you persuaded Zhang Qiaoyun.

44
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,560
You must have told her
Yang Yan is still alive.

45
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,790
Wang Ya controlled Liu Zixuan

46
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,430
because you and Yang Yan

47
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,220
were in that warehouse back then.

That story about a father—

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,270
half of it is true.

51
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,159
Let me tell

52
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,650
the other half of the story.

53
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,030
The day Yang Yan disappeared,
you did go to the reservoir.

54
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,510
Fortunately, she didn't die.

55
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,800
She was swept downstream.

56
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400

Why did he hurt me?

66
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,870

You tore out the last page

74
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,800
of Mom's Diary, didn't you?

75
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,960
Because you were worried that if Yang Yan

76
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
saw it and learned the truth one day,

77
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,650
she would fall deeper into despair

78
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,920
and hatred, right?

79
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,900
Your real motive for killing Yang Youmo

80
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,140
and going after Zhao Qian

81
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,530
was to protect Yang Yan.

82
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,230
Back when Yang Yan was likely still alive,

83
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I couldn't understand
why you insisted on hiding her.

84
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,270
Not until I met Tan Qing.

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,880
thank you.

94

As long as she is happy.

95
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,720
Eat.

96
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,190
Yifan.

97
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,840
Thank you.

98

Why do I have to go abroad?

100
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,430
I don't want this.

101

I want the three of us to be together.

102
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,790
I want to be with our daughter.

103
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,700
Because someone
wants to harm our daughter.

104
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,000
The divorce and going abroad
are just temporary.

105
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,980
They're to protect our daughter.

106
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,410
That's the only way
I can carry out the plan

107
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,020
without worries.

108
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,030
What plan?

109
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,650
Don't worry about that.

110
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,500
If the police ever ask you about me,

111
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,730
just tell them

112
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,740
I had an affair.

113
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,680
You hate me.

114
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,250
You hate Liao Boyan.

115
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,810
But I don't hate you.

116
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,000

I love our daughter.

119
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,440
Why?

120
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,240
Why?

121
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,520
Don't ask why.

122
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,450
You just need to know

123
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,650
we're doing this for our daughter.

124
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,920
When our daughter is safe,

125
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,280
you can come back.

126
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,940
And when that time comes,

127
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,020
the three of us will be together again,

128
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,830
and we'll never be apart, right?

129
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,440
We'll never be apart.

130
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,670
You think our daughter is still alive,

131
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,080
so you won't suffer like I do.

132
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,930
I truly hope you'll never remember.

133
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,190
Take the medicine.

134
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,510
No.

135
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,560
How can you get better
if you don't take the medicine?

136
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,870
Do you know how hard it was to get this?

137
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Who asked you to do those things?

138
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,020
Who told you to help me like this?

139
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,720
Have you ever thought about yourself?

140
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,450
I will grow up.

141
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,690
I'll take revenge on the bad guys myself.

142
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,440
This is the last time I come to see you.

143
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,160
Take the medicine first.

144
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,200
It's getting more dangerous.

145
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll find a safe place

146
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,750
to hide you.

147
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,140
Uncle Liao.

148
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,440
Don't leave me.

149
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,650
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

150
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,750
Do you want to get yourself killed?

151
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,310
No more crying.

152
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,850
Listen to me carefully.

153
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,520
From now on,

154
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,790
you must log in once a day

155
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,480
to Yifan's memorial space.

156
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,490
Why?

157
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,450
Because I'll log in every day
to present flowers.

158
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,590
If one day,

159
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,140
you notice I haven't logged in
to present flowers,

160
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,000
that means

161
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,920
everything is over.

162
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,850
You can call Aunt Tan

163
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,660
and ask her to come back.

164
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
You can go pick her up at the airport.

165

166
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,510
Aunt Tan has forgotten many things,

167
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,990
but she truly sees you as her daughter.

168
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,880
I know.

169
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,590
I know.

170
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,280
Promise me.

171
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,880
If I get caught,

172
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,690
just pretend you don't know me.

173
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,140

174
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,480
When the bad guys are all gone,

175
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,170
you must return to the sunlight.

Some was fake.

183

You fooled all of us.

184
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,550
But the report you gave President Cao

185
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,640
was Tan Qing's.
