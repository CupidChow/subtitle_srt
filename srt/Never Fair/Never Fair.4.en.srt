00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,860
Was I really drunk yesterday?

00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,032
You seemed like it?

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,918
Do you remember everything?

4
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,510
I completely blacked out

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,599
I didn't do anything weird, did I?

6
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,978
You did

7
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,856
To me

8
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,570

Pointing fingers and speaking casually to me

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,492
Such a troublemaker, really such a troublemaker

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,289
I did that?

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,751
Sorry

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,670
Don't go get drunk somewhere

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,797
Next time really...

15
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,132
I won't let it slide

16
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:46,356
Are you okay with the hangover?

17
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:48,567
Yes

18
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,987
But the hangover isn't the problem

19
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,615
Why? Is something wrong?

20
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:58,994
No

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,954
Let's just pretend nothing happened...

22
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,414
Nothing happened, nothing at all

23
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,416
Usually when you're drunk

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,168
You make mistakes and stuff

25
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,253
What are you saying?

26
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,213
You didn't really make any mistakes

27
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,548
yesterday

28
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,135
Did you by any chance...

29
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,471
Get scolded by hyung yesterday?

30
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,016
It wasn't getting scolded

31
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,896
What curfew?

32
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,773
Let's hang out next time too

33
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,233
Alright then

34
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,985
Next time let's go to a club

35
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,530
When is the announcement for that thing?

39
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,541
The announcement is today

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,501
I probably didn't get in

41
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,128
It's such a big place

42
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,547

Huh?

00:02:58,594 --> 00:02:59,971
Huh what's this?

46
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:01,139
You got accepted?

47
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,432
I got accepted

Yes

50
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,396
Oh that's great

You're quitting the cafe?

Should I hope this goes well?

56
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,576
Or should I hope you don't get in?

57
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,563
That's enough

Of course

80

Since he's a close friend of Writer Kang

81
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,311

Did you make this because I went to the interview?

101
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,282
You made this for me?

102
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,617
No

Yes

195
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,194
Right

196
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,198
What am I going to explain?

197
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,574
What I understood is correct

198
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,911
Why are you doing this to me?

199
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,871
With some unnecessary note you threw away

200
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,288
Making me suffer

201
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,416
Shoving me in with connections

202
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,210
And trampling on my pride

203
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,336
It's not like that

204
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,046
Do I still seem like a kid

205
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,296
following behind you?

206
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,007
Does it feel good having me under your feet?

207
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,676
It's not like that

208
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,636
Ah so that's why...

209
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,264
You told me not to pay rent

210
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,100
And acting like a housekeeper and all

211
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,559
You didn't like me getting along

212
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,769
with hyung Dohan either?

213
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,189
You know you seem like a perverted psycho bastard?

214
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,399
Watch your language

215
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,484
Then why are you doing this to me!

216
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,820
Because I didn't know what to do!

217
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,907
What?

218
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,743
I like you so much

219
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,204
And since this is my first time feeling like this

220
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,582
I had no idea what to do or how to act!

221
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,712
I knew it was wrong but I did it anyway

222
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,716
So...

223
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,802
You pretended not to remember that day too?

224
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,101
Do...

225
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,563
you remember?

226
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,860
How we ended up like this...

227
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,613
Forgive me one more time

228
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,043
You can hit me if you want

229
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,463
Even if you say you'll pack and leave today

230
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,131
I won't stop you

231
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,135
I also...

232
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,221
I must be like that too

233
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,224
What?
