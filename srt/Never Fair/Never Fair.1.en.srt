1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,673
I'm sorry

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,304
After bumping into someone

3
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,347
Is saying "sorry" all it takes?

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:15,891
What?

5
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,440
I'm disappointed

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,775
You don't even recognize me

7
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,197
You've grown a lot

8
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,115
Ji Woo-hyuk

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,827
Hyung Onyu?

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,998
It's been 15 years

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,670
I was curious, but suddenly reaching out

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,172
You were someone who existed only in old memories

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,048
The reunion with Hyung Onyu happened because

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,010
Onyu said it was okay

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,429
What are you worried about?

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,347
When you were young, you two played well together

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,184
It's been too long since we've seen each other

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,728
He has a spare room

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,646
He said you can stay as long as you want

20
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,898
Go and listen to your hyung

21
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,068
Don't disturb him while he's writing his book

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,402
Prepare well for your job search

23
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,697
Okay, I'm hanging up

24
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,619
To get a job in Seoul

25
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,371
I ended up living at the house of my mom's friend's son, a successful writer

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,373
And that's how it all began

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,170
You've grown a lot

28
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,088
Ji Woo-hyuk

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,300
Hyung Onyu?

30
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,469
Yeah, it's me

31
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:41,309
Why have you become so handsome, hyung?

32
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,686
Why the sudden formality?

33
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,396
Come in

34
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,858
The hyung I reunited with

35
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,527
Was even more handsome than I remembered

36
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,492
Thank you, hyung

37
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,288
There's a room available

38
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,789
I was bored, so this works out perfectly

39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,543
Publishing company?

40
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,501
You're going to work there?

41
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah, that's what I want

42
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,548
Once I get a job, I'll move out right away

43
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,300
Housing in Seoul is expensive

44
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,427
You can stay for a long time

45
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,597
Is the housekeeper doing well?

46
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:20,891
Yes

47
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,559
The soybean paste stew she made

48
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,644
Was really delicious

49
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:27,230
Remember that day when you beat up that kid

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,231
who was bullying me?

51
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,110
The soybean paste stew I ate at your house that day

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,527
Is number one in my life

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,280
Right

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,655
That's how it was

55
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,327
That's your room over there

56
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,621
Unpack your things

57
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,621
And look around the house

58
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
Okay

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Although I was worried it might be awkward

60
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,088
It was nice and comforting

61
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,349
So you write here?

62
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,519
That's cool

63
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,313
It's nothing special

64
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,282
The ideas that come to you

65
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,407
You write them down here?

66
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,623
Don't touch my workspace

67
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,501
Ah...

68
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,210
I'm sorry

69
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,724
Indeed, living with another person

70
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,726
Is not easy

71
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,137
This is my whiskey glass

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,264
If you want to drink water

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,347
Use something else

74
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,934
S-sorry

75
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,697
I thought I should make an effort

76
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,907
not to inconvenience hyung

77
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,661
Leave it

78
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,038
I'll clean it up

79
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,041
Okay

80
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,416
Sure

81
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,418
And hyung

82
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,172
How much should I pay monthly for rent?

83
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,340
Forget it

84
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,800
I'll look for a part-time job

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,302
I saw there's an opening at the café across the street

86
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:05,054
Use that money for your expenses

87
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,432
But I should contribute to the living expenses

88
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,686
Ah...

89
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,396
Then

90
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,195
Pay with your body

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:22,947
What?

92
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,827
Clean, do laundry

93
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,121
Something like...

94
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,539
A kind of housekeeper?

95
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,588
Why?

96
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,423
Don't you like it?

97
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,387
I'm extremely grateful!

98
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:05,907
Are you busy?

99
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,824
Ji Woo-hyuk

100
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,909
No

101
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,958
Want me to help you with your cover letter?

102
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,628
It's okay, you must be tired

103
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:21,798
But, do you need me to do something?

104
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,717
No, nothing special

105
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,471
It's recycling day

106
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,557
Should I take out the trash?

107
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,478
That can wait

108
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,356
Pour me a drink instead

109
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,235
Sure?

110
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,405
After all, alcohol tastes better when someone else pours it

111
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,617
Does the housekeeper pour drinks too?

112
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,164
You

113
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,750
How far are you willing to go with what I ask?

114
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,378
I'll do anything

115
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,639
Anything?

116
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,565
Won't you regret it?

117
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,735
Then give me a bath

118
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,612
Huh?

119
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,407
Thoroughly

120
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,077
Every part of my body

121
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,918
I'm joking

122
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,882
You're so gullible

123
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,896
Living with a stranger

124
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,731
Is dangerous
