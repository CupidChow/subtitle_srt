1
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,643
What are you doing?

2
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,063
Ah, well...

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,440
I was trying to find your sticky note, bro

4
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,153
Never mind, just come in

5
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:30,655
Just a moment

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,239
I think I can find it

7
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,407
I said forget it!

8
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,077
Your hands are freezing

9
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:35,786
You know that?

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,704
Wait a bit

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,041
I don't need that thing

12
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,418
But you said it was important!

13
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,505
It's not important!

14
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,887
You're lying

15
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:59,643
Why would you lie like that...

16
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,726
I don't like

17
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,228
you wandering around outside

18
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,898
And it also annoys me

19
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:08,068
that you're getting close with that manager or whatever

20
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,409
Am I really your housekeeper or something?

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,786
What's wrong with that anyway?

22
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,621
It's not wrong, it's just that I...

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,505
I was jealous

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,215
What?

25
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,300
What do you mean?

26
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,682
Sorry

27
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,978
I was being childish, wasn't I?

28
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,777
I won't do it again

29
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,407
It's cold

30
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,074
Let's go inside

31
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:01,829
My brother is such a strange person

32
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,166
What's even stranger is

33
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,045
that I let myself be swayed by him

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,215
Where should we go?

35
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,056
I'm hungry, want to get chicken?

36
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:19,972
Sure

37
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,516
After chicken, let's keep the party going?

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,606
Oh, what now

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,231
Your brother is here again

40
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,532
Bro, why are you here again?

41
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,992
To have coffee

42
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,036
Ah...

43
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,246
What would you like to have?

44
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,501
An iced Americano

45
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,001
Oh, and

46
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,795
Let's order chicken for dinner later

47
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,757
Bro, tonight I...

48
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,673
Chicken!

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,719
I was planning to eat with Uhyeok

50
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:05,143
Ah...

51
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,355
Really?

52
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,322
I said it's fine, you didn't have to

53
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,907
follow us here

54
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,577
How much does a café manager even make?

55
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,204
I'll pay

56
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,333
I actually make quite a lot

57
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,210
I do modeling jobs sometimes too

58
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,213
Ah, I used to be a trainee idol

59
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,132
I see

60
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,800
I save a lot of that money

61
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,094
And what about you, sir,

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,179
what do you do for a living?

63
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,597
Ah...

64
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,934
You didn't know what I do?

65
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,186
How would I know?

66
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,773
My brother is a writer

67
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,483
A bestselling author

68
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,068
His book is called "Serial Murders"

69
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,987
You've probably seen it in bookstores, right?

70
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,782
Wow, so you're quite impressive

71
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,786
You don't look that different in age

72
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,623
Why do you keep adding "sir" at the end?

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,501
He's much older~

74
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,420
Aren't you my senior?

75
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,507
My brother Onyu is 31

76
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,300
And the manager is 28

77
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,721
Did you think he was much older?

78
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,431
You speak so casually for a first meeting

79
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,974
You do the same to me, sir...

80
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,932
Uhyeok

81
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,684
Just call me "bro"

82
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,396
That "sir" stuff is making me cringe

83
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,606
In professional relationships,

84
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,233
isn't formal address important?

85
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,871
Uhyeok, after we finish this

86
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,623
I've thought of a place for us to go next

87
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,081
Where?

88
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,918
What next place?

89
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,378
Ah, you should go home, sir

90
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,798
You're not planning to join us, are you?

91
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,675
I am going

92
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,552
Ji Uhyeok

93
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,802
You're coming too, right?

94
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:04,846
Huh?

95
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,349
Isn't tomorrow the last day to apply to Yeolim Publishing?

96
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,434
Aren't you working on your cover letter?

97
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,103
Ah...

98
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,231
Manager

99
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,525
I have something important to submit tomorrow

100
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,985
Let's hang out another time with advance notice

101
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,987
Well, can't be helped then

102
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,338
Lee Dohan...

103
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,134
I don't like him

104
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,471
Even though he might seem like a punk at first

105
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,264
he's a good person

106
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,231
Bro

107
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,400
Can you look at my cover letter?

108
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah

109
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,322
Edit it and bring it to my room

110
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,742
You're really all I've got

111
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,623
I've already finished it

112
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,041
Ah, you startled me!

113
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
Hey

114
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,295
Are you going to keep coming in without knocking?

115
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,505
Ah... sorry

116
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,181
It's fine

117
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,891
You're already in, so what's the point?

118
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,313
Why?

119
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,606
Do you find it exciting?

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,987
Bring it here

121
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:02,838
From now on, by 12 o'clock

122
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,257
you need to be home

123
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,344
All of a sudden?

124
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,137
Curfew

125
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,393
Why, am I a child?

126
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,561
I'm a light sleeper

127
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,646
If I can't sleep, I get irritable

128
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,813
And if I'm irritable, I can't write

129
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:20,815
So

130
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,485
come home early

131
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,405
But 12 is a bit...

132
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,032
12 o'clock

133
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,867
What am I, Cinderella?

134
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,704
It should be at least 1 or 2 to feel like I've had fun...

135
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,289
What will happen for each minute you're late?

136
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,291
What...

137
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,501
Want to get hit once for each minute?

138
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,710
Bro

139
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,797
Then that's what we'll do

140
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,217
Now look here

141
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,135
This first paragraph...

142
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,315
Bro, you were home?

143
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:03,983
Yeah

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,860
I had some time left

145
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,570
I'll be late tonight

146
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,240
Hmm...

147
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,537
That's a bit provocative

148
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,163
The clothes?

149
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,336
What about them?

150
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,796
You should button up

151
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,922
The buttons?

152
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,092
No, this outfit is originally...

153
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,567
I'm heading out

154
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,403
Alright

155
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,661
Well, well

156
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,247
You're perfectly ready to enjoy your Friday night

157
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,582
Planning to party until sunrise?

158
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,045
But I have to be back by 12

159
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:07,630
Huh?

160
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,591
You have a curfew too?

161
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,426
A 25-year-old guy

162
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,969
with a curfew?

163
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,139
Well, my brother...

164
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,224
Sigh...

165
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,016
Uhyeok

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,351
What are you, your brother's daughter?

167
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,439
Even if you're living off him

168
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,940
this is too much, don't you think?

169
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,944
Yeah, you're right

170
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,655
I already do all the housework

171
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,365
I'm not his slave

172
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,202
This really isn't right

173
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,287
That's true

174
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,581
Cleaning and doing laundry should be enough

175
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,291
What curfew nonsense?

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,376
The curfew...

177
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,587
Tell him to f*ck off

178
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,588
Let's have fun

179
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:51,673
Yes

180
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:52,550
Got it?

181
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,426
Yes

182
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,980
There were many tables

183
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,814
that asked to hang out with us

184
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,025
Today I really wanted to avoid guys

185
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,194
and just drink

186
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,488
But why did they come over

187
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,948
and ask to join us?

188
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,412
Because you're the most handsome guy here?

189
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,332
Thank you

190
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,626
And also...

191
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,545
This guy is cute too

192
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,715
Seriously, what the heck?

193
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,925
Sorry, sorry

194
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,177
Should we move somewhere else and have another drink?

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,596
Yeah, one more drink?

196
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,225
Sorry

197
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,725
Actually

198
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,311
we came to hang out just among ourselves today

199
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,730
So let's end it here and say goodbye

200
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,358
It was fun

201
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,777
No, but one more drink...

202
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,320
Let's just go

203
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,324
It was fun

204
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,409
Yes

205
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,287
I had fun too

206
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,170
Take care

207
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,007
Bro, why?

208
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,592
Weren't they your type?

209
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,344
They were fine

210
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,597
Girls like that are so predictable

211
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,225
I think hanging out with you

212
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,269
would be more fun

213
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,042
Bro

214
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,418
You weren't sleeping?

215
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,796
Were you waiting for me?

216
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,631
I told you to come home early

217
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,548
What time is it now?

218
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:58,801
And why weren't you answering your phone?

219
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,511
Are you mad?

220
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,512
Of course I am, I was worried!

221
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:04,097
Hey! Kang Onyu

222
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,810
Listen to me

223
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:11,189
I'm not that little kid you used to

224
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,774
hit around when I was young

225
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,318
I'm all grown up now!

226
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,738
So stop treating me like a child

227
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,033
I always feel small in front of you

228
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,408
I feel intimidated...

229
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,912
I hate that

230
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,497
I can dress like this

231
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,667
and stay out late

232
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,126
because I'm an adult man

233
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,765
Did it hurt your feelings that I treated you like a child?

234
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,850
I understand

235
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,185
I understand, so...

236
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,733
Uhyeok

237
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,569
Uhyeok

238
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,822
Uhyeok, wake up

239
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,684
What are you doing?

240
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,020
Ah... no, well...
