1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:02,543
Here...

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:03,295
My resume.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,806
I'm preparing for a job, but...

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,016
Until I get employed...

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,974
You're hired!

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,728
Excuse me?

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,396
I like you.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,481
You're hired.

9
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,025
Hired, you say?

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,860
You're cute.

11
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm three years older than you.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,280
I'll speak casually to you, okay?

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,492
I'm Do-han Lee.

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,659
I'm the manager of this cafe.

15
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:36,661
Nice to meet you.

16
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,626
I met a strange guy.

17
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,923
I'm home.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,760
What about the part-time job?

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,135
How was it?

20
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,681
They want me to start tomorrow.

21
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,974
But the manager is kind of funny.

22
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:59,601
Funny how?

23
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,981
He didn't even look at my resume, just at my face.

24
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,025
It's a bit weird.

25
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,034
So, next month...

26
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,704
Will publication be possible? Author.

27
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:19,996
Yes.

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,164
I think so.

29
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:24,001
I'll contact you when the manuscript is done.

30
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,543
Yes, thank you.

31
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,503
Sure.

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,173
You're late.

33
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,382
They were selling fish-shaped pastries out front.

34
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,217
I ate some with the manager.

35
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,179
Fish-shaped pastries?

36
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,764
I should have brought you one too.

37
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,974
Do you like red bean or custard filling?

38
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,518
I'll buy you one next time.

39
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,436
That's not necessary. You...

40
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,735
Should come home earlier from now on.

41
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,487
Huh?

42
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,157
You've been neglecting housework because of your job.

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,076
That's not true.

44
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,494
You haven't taken out the trash.

45
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,244
And the dishes are still unwashed.

46
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,748
I was going to do it now.

47
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,583
Should I clean your room too?

48
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,335
Yes.

49
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,713
But don't touch anything on the desk.

50
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,507
Okay.

51
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,307
I'm living here for free.

52
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:05,018
I should at least do this much.

53
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,262
I'm getting really good at it now.

54
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,639
You're more efficient than you look.

55
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,101
One iced Americano, here you go.

56
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,478
Thank you.

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,106
Excuse me...

58
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,358
Could I...?

59
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,570
We can't have personal contact with customers.

60
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,030
I'll just accept your kind thoughts.

61
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,409
No.

62
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,452
Not you.

63
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,664
This guy.

64
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,085
He's totally my type.

65
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,005
Please contact me.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,967
Ah, I'm jealous.

67
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,385
Did you hear that?

68
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,344
Personal contact with customers...

69
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:22,929
Is not allowed.

70
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:24,431
Why not?

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,557
I don't know anyone in Seoul.

72
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,809
I could make friends.

73
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,853
Be friends with me.

74
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,230
With you, manager?

75
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:33,106
Why?

76
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,231
Don't you want to?

77
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,860
It would be really fun to hang out with me.

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,862
After closing today, how about...

79
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,280
Having a drink?

80
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,489
Why not?

81
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:44,701
Hyung?

82
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,998
Where have you been?

83
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,958
Just a quick meeting.

84
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,378
You live together?

85
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,255
Hello.

86
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,298
I'm Do-han Lee.

87
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,552
I didn't come for coffee...

88
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,641
You.

89
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:11,644
Did you touch the sticky notes in my room?

90
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,563
No.

91
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,106
I never touch your desk, hyung.

92
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,317
The sticky notes.

93
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,652
Did you throw any away?

94
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,572
Ah, that...

95
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,989
The one that was on the floor.

96
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,367
I thought you wanted to throw it away.

97
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,206
I see.

98
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,791
Was it important?

99
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,833
Yes.

100
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:42,592
It's fine.

101
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,552
I'll see you at home.

102
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,891
What's with him? He's so grumpy.

103
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,601
He seems to have a bad temper.

104
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:53,394
Manager.

105
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,311
Manager.

106
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:54,980
Yes?

107
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,773
Let's have that drink another time.

108
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,483
Why?

109
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,318
I think I need to go now.

110
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:03,862
Alright.

111
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm really sorry.

112
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,382
Why was that note on the floor?

113
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,302
Let's be more careful from now on.

114
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,101
If you're really sorry...

115
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,688
You could make something to eat.

116
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm hungry.

117
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,159
How is it?

118
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,036
Is it good?

119
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:55,873
Not bad.

120
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,088
I'm sorry, hyung.

121
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,842
It's okay, don't worry.

122
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,344
It's already in the past.

123
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,597
Let's have a drink.

124
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,900
You...

125
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,985
How much can you drink?

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,072
Me?

127
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
Well, I can drink quite a bit.

128
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,786
Don't come home drunk from anywhere.

129
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,871
I don't want to deal with the aftermath.

130
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,375
I'm quite tame when drunk.

131
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:44,380
What are you like when drunk?

132
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,175
I just fall asleep or...

133
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,719
I get a bit more affectionate?

134
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,306
Ah...

135
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,601
I'm curious.

136
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,976
About seeing you drunk too.

137
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,271
What about you?

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,440
I stay the same.

139
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:03,983
Come on!

140
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,275
I'm curious too.

141
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,402
About seeing you drunk.

142
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,697
I don't think I'll get drunk...

143
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,907
Before you do.

144
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,157
Huh?

145
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,588
What's that?

146
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,382
You finished it all.

147
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,429
Is there no more?

148
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,639
No.

149
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,349
Let's stop drinking for today.

150
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,351
It's a shame to end here.

151
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,314
Wait, hyung.

152
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,774
I'll quickly go to the store and buy more.

153
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,568
No, no, it's fine.

154
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,609
Let's just stop for today...

155
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:50,238
Ah, wait.

156
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,905
Don't fall asleep.

157
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:22,228
Why is he taking so long?
