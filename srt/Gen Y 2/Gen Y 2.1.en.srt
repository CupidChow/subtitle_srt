[Gen Y The Series Season 2]

2
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,579
Ahem, hello everyone.

3
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,170
Welcome to

4
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,500
the Love Battle for N'Wayu!

5
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,620
With me, N'Mark,

6
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,260
your authentic host for today.

7
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,100
But today,

8
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,220
I have a little assistant with me.

9
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,260
This is P'Kit,

10
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,860
a Junior student from
the Faculty of Medicine.

11
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,820
You can say

12
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,090
that he is my boyfriend.

13
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,540
What are you doing?

14
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,100
Just go with the flow, okay?

15
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,180
Today, both of us will bring
a special episode to you guys.

16
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,340
For today's special episode,

17
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,540
the news my informant

18
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,620
had told me

19
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,060
was that the contestants

20
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,300
have to find a partner for
the school hunk and beau trial rehearsal.

21
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,180
Let me tell you guys something.

22
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,260
If you wish to become
N'Wayu's partner,

23
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,220
you will face tough competitions.

24
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,940
So, both of us

25
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,260
are going to interview the challengers.

26
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,500
Enough. Let's not waste any time.

27
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,100
Let's welcome our first challenger.

28
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm Jack. I'm a senior student from
the Faculty of Engineering.

29
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,610
So, for N'Wayu's partner,

30
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,660
there's no one else but...

31
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm Ko, a junior student from
the Faculty of Dentistry.

32
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm the only one

33
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,580
who will win N'Wayu's heart.

34
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,030
Hey!

35
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,900
P'Jack,

36
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm showing them my charm.

37
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,590
Why did you interrupt me?

38
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Ko, you were the one
who interrupted me first.

39
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,910
What do you want?

40
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,180
You took the words right out of my mouth!

41
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,740
Hmm...

42
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,930
You're pretty good
at talking back right now

43
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,580
What do you want?

44
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,050
Why don't we have a contest?

45
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,900
Erm...

46
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,770
Those are our first two challengers.

47
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,890
Currently, the situation
is getting very intense.

48
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,020
I'm not sure

49
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,409
if they will expend all of their energy

50
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,220
before they win N'Wayu's heart.

51
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,540
Hey, P'Jack...

52
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,380
I think we should forget about them.

53
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,460
It's because we have
one last challenger with us.

54
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,700
He is...

55
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,460
P'Thanu!

56
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,060
He isn't someone ordinary!

57
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,100
He's the

58
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,620
school hunk of
2018's Faculty of Dentistry.

59
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,330
This is P'Thanu!

60
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,140
[Ahem...]

61
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,780
[There's no need]

62
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,140
[to say much about this guy.]

63
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,340
[It feels as if his victory is assured]

64
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,140
[with him just standing there.]

65
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,650
[Am I right, P'Kit?]

66
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,530
Alright.

67
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,820
Let's take a look at the comments.

68
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,980
Let's see who our viewers are supporting.

69
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Hmm.

70
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,780
P'Jack, Ko,

71
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,700
Ko Jack.

72
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,260
This.

73
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,420
I don't know either.

74
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,940
Wow, many people are
rooting for P'Thanu.

75
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,060
[N'Wayu, please
give your old flame another chance]

76
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,190
[N'Wayu, please
give your old flame another chance]

77
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,659
P'Pa?

78
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,860
[Wayu]

79
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,020
[Did you see that comment?]

80
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,410
Yeah, I saw it.

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,170
[Wayu, how are you?]

82
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,780
[Let's break up.]

83
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,620
[He doesn't wish to see me.]

84
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,340
[Has he stopped loving me?]

85
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,420
[Why is he doing this to me?]

86
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,860
I'm fine.

87
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,380
P'Pa, I have no feelings for you now.

88
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,180
There are more important things
for me to do right now.

89
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
[Stop crying,]

90
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,220
[my baby boy.]

91
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,690
P'Thanu,

92
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,820
let's have lunch together today.

93
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,020
I need to speak with you.

94
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,500
Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?

95
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,980
I'll tell you about it during lunchtime.

96
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,550
Erm,

97
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,820
has anyone read the comments
in P'Mark's live stream?

98
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,620
Is P'Parawee

99
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,980
P'Wayu's ex-boyfriend?

100
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,810
Hey!

101
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,660
Lower your volume.

102
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,740
I wonder if P'Wayu knows about this.

103
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,420
And, we don't know

104
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,260
if P'Pa wrote the comment himself.

105
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
P'Kit said

106
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,860
he's trying to contact P'Pa,

107
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
but he couldn't reach him.

108
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,940
So, we don't know the truth for now.

109
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,020
If that person wasn't P'Pa,

110
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,300
why would he pretend to be him,
P'Sab?

111
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,940
I don't know either.

112
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
But I can confirm

113
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,780
that this person has an ulterior motive.

114
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
But...

115
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,460
If it were really P'Pa,

116
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,220
I think the situation

117
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,610
would be more chaotic than
if we were to face an impostor.

118
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,340
I think we should
avoid this matter for now.

119
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,340
I'm really worried about P'Wayu.

120
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,910
Alright then.

121
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,380
Let's go.

122
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,230
Let's go and help them out.

123
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,340
Everyone, if you're ready,

124
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,820
please clap

125
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,300
for our dashing representatives today.

126
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,340
Please get on the stage.

127
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,570
Be careful.

128
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,060
Okay. Now,

129
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,780
volunteers, please get on stage.

130
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,930
Welcome.

131
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,140
Go on.

132
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,140
Sorry about this.

133
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,860
I pick this candidate.

134
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,250
[P'Kit, do you like livers?]

135
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,350
[I'm fine with anything.]

136
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,860
[This is my own matter.]

137
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,490
[It's good that you're not a picky eater.]

138
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,420
[If so, I shall]

139
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,660
[give you my heart.]

140
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,730
[Does P'Kit know about this?]

141
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,380
[You are]

142
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,780
[super cute.]

143
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,380
[Don't ever appear in front of me again.]

144
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,810
[You brat!]

145
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,700
[You have such a strong punch.]

146
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,140
[P'Kit, you won't get a boyfriend
if you act like that.]

147
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,820
[P'Kit, you're mine now.]

148
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,980
[I won't allow anyone
to steal you away from me.]

149
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,220
[Are you ready to be in
a relationship with me?]

150
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,210
[I was ready for that long ago.]

151
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,020
[Thank you.]

152
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,660
[Let's synchronize our time forever.]

153
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,890
What are you laughing at?

154
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,900
Hmm.

155
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,340
I'm your partner.

156
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,220
Hello, partner.

157
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,870
Phai!

158
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,940
I pick this candidate.

159
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,860
[If you do this]

160
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,740
[and you can remember it,]

161
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,300
[you'll surely pass the exam.]

162
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,740
[Hey!]

163
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,980
[Stop being angry.]

164
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,700
[Stay here.]

165
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,370
[I want us to be together.]

166
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
[If you want me
to stay together with you,]

167
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,700
[you shouldn't
chase me away in the future.]

168
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
[Deal.]

169
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,210
[You won't hear that from me ever again.]

170
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,420
Don't forget.

171
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,380
If you don't take good care
of your partner,

172
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,050
I might swap you out at any time.

173
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,810
Try it then.

174
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay.

175
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,370
Let's shift the mood.
It's the senior team's turn now.

176
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,380
Let's welcome N'Wayu.

177
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,970
Nice!

178
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,460
Be careful.

179
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,460
And,

180
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,820
volunteers, stop dilly-dallying.

181
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,700
Get on the stage.

182
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,780
Hurry.

183
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,860
Oh.

184
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,780
Hey, calm down.

185
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,740
P'Thanu, hurry up.

186
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
Pick your candidate.

187
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,340
Is that so? Is he the one?

188
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,810
No.

189
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,500
Not yet.

190
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,700
Oh!

191
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,010
P'Pa...

192
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,290
I'm back,

193
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,860
Wayu.

194
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,860
Pa.

195
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,060
Thank you for taking care of Wayu.

196
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
P'Pa?

197
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,900
So...

198
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,050
What should we do now?

199
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,820
This is a huge mess.

200
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,540
Oh, everyone,

201
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,610
please calm down for now.

202
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,900
So, who will P'Wayu pick

203
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,940
in the end?

204
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,030
Huh?

205
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,620
I meant your partner.

206
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,180
P'Wayu hasn't picked his partner yet.

207
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,250
-Wayu.
-Wayu.

208
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,980
I have something to do.

209
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Wayu!

210
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,500
Wayu!

211
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,620
Mark, go and stop him.

212
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,670
Hey!

213
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,910
P'Wayu!

214
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
Everyone!

215
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,340
Please return to your seats!

216
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,940
Our event isn't over yet!

217
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,980
-Come back for now.
-Come back.

218
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,430
Wayu.

219
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,410
I'm here today

220
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,100
because I have something to tell you.

221
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,260
P'Pa, there's nothing for us
to talk about.

222
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,820
Wayu.

223
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,380
Wayu, can you please listen to me first?

224
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,730
I have something I must tell you.

225
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,900
What else do you want to tell me,
P'Pa?

226
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,740
Let's not head over there for now.

227
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,820
If you wish to tell me why you abandoned
me and why you left without a reason,

228
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I don't wish to know.

229
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,980
It's because I've moved on.

230
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,220
Do you know how painful it was

231
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,180
for me to move on?

232
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,990
And now,

233
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,020
your apologies

234
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,900
mean nothing to me.

235
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,430
I know that.

236
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,940
I know that my apologies don't matter

237
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,820
when it comes to this.

238
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,140
Regarding what had happened in the past,

239
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,780
it was all my fault.

240
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,740
That's why I'll do my best
to be responsible for this.

241
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,660
That's why I requested
P'Thanu to take care of you.

242
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,420
If that was your true intention,

243
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,380
why did you beg me
to give you another chance

244
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,060
on P'Mark's live stream, P'Pa?

245
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,630
Sigh.

246
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,300
That's the reason why I'm here today.

247
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,460
Listen carefully, Wayu.

248
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,410
I didn't send that comment.

249
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,260
P'Pa, it wasn't you?

250
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,250
I'm not sure

251
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,420
if anyone is trying to impersonate me.

252
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,850
That's why I need to confirm this
with you personally.

253
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,010
So, who is he?

254
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,300
And why is he doing this?

255
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,220
I think it's someone

256
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,900
who wants to stop you from developing
your relationship with P'Thanu.

257
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,620
I know

258
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,580
that P'Thanu will be able
to take good care of you.

259
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,650
He won't hurt you like I did.

260
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,140
To me,

261
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,180
P'Pa, you're in the past.

262
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,540
For P'Thanu...

263
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,780
He's the one I wish to spend my life with.

264
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,900
Wayu,

265
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,660
you shouldn't forget about the person
who had hurt you.

266
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,620
Mark...

267
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,370
P'Thanu,

268
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,900
I'll return Wayu to you.

269
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,780
Take good care of him on my behalf.

270
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,380
Pa, I cannot shoulder
your responsibility for you.

271
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Taking care of Wayu

272
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,740
was my own will.

273
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,580
You need to love him more.

274
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,060
You need to love him for my sake as well.

275
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,350
Hey, Pa!

276
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,980
P'Kit.

277
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,580
P'Thanu, Sab,

278
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,860
I'll leave Wayu to you two.

279
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,100
Understood, P'Mark.

280
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,300
Are you okay?

281
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,150
Wayu.

282
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,500
Pa!

283
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,630
Pa!

284
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,460
Hey!

285
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,890
Hey!

286
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,740
Pa!

287
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,940
What are you doing?

288
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,470
What are you laughing at?

289
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,170
It's already been one year,

290
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,700
yet you're still as petite
and cute as ever.

291
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,860
Cute? My foot!

292
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,890
Is this the time for you to joke around?

293
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,820
Hurry up.

294
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,260
Pa!

295
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,860
Hey!

296
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,830
Pa!

297
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,860
Hey! What's wrong? Are you okay?

298
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,860
Hey!

299
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,910
Kit,

300
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,460
can you promise me something?

301
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,730
Hey, Pa!

302
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,580
Hey!

303
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,020
Pa!

304
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,790
[Begin Again - Thanu]

305
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,580
P'Wayu.

306
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,700
Sigh.

307
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,580
It was such a mess just now.

308
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,290
I wonder how everyone is doing right now.

309
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,580
Hey, partner.

310
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,860
What?

311
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
If my partner doesn't
take good care of me,

312
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,940
I can swap him out at any time, right?

313
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,620
So, what if that's the case?

314
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
Do you wish to swap your partner already?

315
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,900
That's not it.

316
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,540
If that's the case,

317
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
I'll take good care of my partner.

318
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,180
Let's have a meal together

319
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,580
after this is over.

320
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,540
Come on.

321
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,380
Erm...

322
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,510
Fine.

323
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,740
How is it?

324
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,770
How was the situation up there?

325
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,139
I don't really understand what happened,

326
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,580
but I'm sure it's not good.

327
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,100
P'Wayu.

328
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,530
Are you okay?

329
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,790
Sab,

330
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,500
can you please

331
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,540
send me to my dormitory later?

332
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,940
Sure, P'Wayu.

333
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,620
Erm,

334
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,470
P'Wayu.

335
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,460
I couldn't find my car keys.

336
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Oh, that's right.

337
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,900
I left them in my bag.

338
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,050
I left my bag at the contest venue.

339
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,890
What should I do?

340
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,690
Oh, I see P'Thanu.

341
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,370
P'Thanu, please send
P'Wayu back.

342
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,230
I'll send him back.

343
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,940
Thank you so much, P'Thanu.

344
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,300
P'Wayu,

345
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,170
I'll leave first.

346
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,730
Let's go.

347
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,580
Let me send you back.

348
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
P'Thanu,

349
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,620
I don't wish to go home for now.

350
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,740
I have something to tell you.

351
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,690
This shop looks pretty fancy, right?

352
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,460
Yeah.

353
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,620
I thought we were going to have noodles
at the roadside stall.

354
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,250
Hello, P'Pok.

355
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,780
-Hey, Danew.
-Hello.

356
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,380
Long time no see. How have you been doing?

357
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm doing great.

358
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,490
So,

359
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,340
did you come alone?

360
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,180
I came with my parents.

361
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,140
Are you still in the
school's swimming team?

362
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,770
That's right.

363
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,660
I wish to enter university
with a scholarship, just like you guys.

364
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,860
I see.

365
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,620
Good luck.

366
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,260
Please tell me
if you have any suggestions.

367
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,700
Can I have your contact number then?

Just forget it.

Let's go and have a seat.

Hmm.

386
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,180
What should we order?

387
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,420
You can order for me.

388
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,020
You can order something

that you think I will like.

390

So, what do you like to eat?

391
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,100
I'll take one set of fried chicken wings.

392
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,140
Okay.

393
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,810
You can have fried chicken
wings, but you can't leave me.

394
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,660
(The word "fried" in Thai
has another meaning, "leaving")

395
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,340
Let me get a set of this then.

396
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,820
This name is pretty strange.

397

Thai has same pronunciation as "turmeric")

398
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,700
We don't serve this today.

399

Sorry about that.

If so,

give me a set of matsaman curry then.

I want something hot.

Do you want some salad (Yum)?

405
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,450
Assorted cold salad?

406
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,950
No.

407
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,620
I don't want to be beaten up.
("Yum" is a word pun of beaten up.)

408
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,930
Do you want tom yum soup?

409
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,060
I want a bowl of tom yum soup.

410
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,260
Is the soup as hot as me?

411
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,770
Do you want steamed fish with curry?

412
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,860
What?

413
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm referring to this.

414
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,790
Steamed fish with curry.

415
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,180
It looks great.

416
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,900
I want steamed fish with curry.

417
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,660
They serve cocktails as well?

418
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,740
Give me a cup of "Sex on the Beach".

419
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,830

420
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,300
Forget about that.

421
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,580
Give us two cups of water.

422
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,610
Okay.

423
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
That's all for now.

424
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,860
Let me keep the menu away.

425
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,980
Why didn't you let me order the cocktail?

426
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,260
Are you worried that I might get drunk?

427
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,780
If I get drunk this time,

428
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,500
I might...

429
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,350
That's enough.

430
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,780
I need to use the washroom.

431
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,650
Here you go.

432
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,500
Chicken.

433
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,660
Do you want some potatoes?

434
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,090
Is it nice?

435
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,830
Yeah.

436
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,140
Which one is nicer?

437
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,060
The dish or me?

438
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,750
Pok,

439
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,260
you don't need to publicise it often

440
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,060
if it's truly nice.

441
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,650
I'm being very serious here.

442
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,700
Am I hot?

443
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,250
Will you still take hot food

444
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,740
if I'm not hot?

Wayu,

471
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,660
you said that
you have something to tell me.

472
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,900
You were referring
to today's incident, right?

473
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,380
Or did I do anything to
make you feel uncomfortable?

474
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,300
P'Thanu, do you still
remember that day?

475
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,580
When we treated Saensab and his friends
to a meal for getting into university.

476
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,380
You didn't board the ship that day.

477
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,580
Of course I remember that.

478
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,820
But there was another person
who didn't board the ship.

479
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,340
It was Phai.

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,260
Can you tell me about that?

491
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,740
I wish to know what happened
between you and Phai.

492
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,910
Sure.

493
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,580
I'll tell you everything.

494
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,500
Regarding Phai and I,

495
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,780
just like what I had told you,

496
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,980
nothing actually happened, except for...

497
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,980
It was just a coincidence.

498
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,820
If so, why didn't you tell me about it
from the start?

499
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,940
Because that was the only thing
between Phai and I.

500
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,740
Everything else is over, Wayu.

Maybe I'm the third wheel here.

00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,460
I believe in the person I love.

508
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,300
I believe in the person
I want to look after.

509
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,390
I wish to make him happy every day.

510
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,260
And that person is you, Wayu.

511
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,210
I don't think Phai
was thinking of the same thing.

512
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,100
If not, he wouldn't have sent me
the portrait you drew for him to me.

513
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,020
I have never thought of
being in a relationship with Phai.

514
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,100
And, you were the only person
I had set my sights on.

515
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,970
It's because the only person I love

516
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,900
is you, Wayu.

517
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,700
P'Thanu, I'm sorry.

518
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:27,710
[Next Episode]

519
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,620
Wayu.

520
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,060
He doesn't know

521
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,140
why P'Pa broke up with him.

522
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,550
I couldn't care less about that.

523
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,020
Anyway, I must tell him about it.

524
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,620
If you do tell him, can you bear
responsibility for their breakup?

525
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,100
I don't want P'Thanu to go back.

526
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,260
If I could reverse time,

527
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,460
even if that means I have to
go through my exams again,

528
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,180
I'm willing to do so.

529
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,530
How do you feel about P'Thanu?
