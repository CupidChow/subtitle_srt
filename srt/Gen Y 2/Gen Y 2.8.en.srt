1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,580
I heard from many people

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,690
that you and N'Wayu have become distant

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,380
because he is taking care
of Pharawee who is sick.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,220
If I must guess,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,060
I'm sure a male lead like you

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,910
will sacrifice yourself
and withdraw from the relationship.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,980
What else do you think I should do then?

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,940
Life isn't like an exam.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,180
There's more than one correct answer.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,370
Take this matter for example.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,620
If Jack were in your shoes,

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,970
he would've stood by Wayu's side long ago.

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,420
He'd be afraid that people
might steal Wayu away from him.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,260
But if it's Padbok,

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,220
I think he will let Wayu

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,540
choose the person he wants to be with

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,810
between the two guys.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,290
If I were you,

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,620
I would sympathize with Pharawee as well.

21
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,340
He is sick,

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,500
and he has a slim chance
of recovering from it.

23
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,850
But I think I wouldn't
give someone false hope

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,220
or pour salt over someone's wound.

25
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,900
I understand.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,220
You will never let N'Wayu go

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,130
after Pharawee
recovers from his illness,

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,580
am I right?

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,260
By then, it might be too late.

30
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,940
But now, you can still make it in time

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,660
as long as you stand up and follow me
to the Faculty of Media.

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,490
Right now.

33
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,740
Actually, you don't need to help me out.

34
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,500
I can ask someone else
to take my measurements for me.

35
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,060
Wayu, don't move.

36
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,300
Raise your arms.

37
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,570
Chest, 34.

38
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,960
Your waist is...

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,800
♫ Can you come back? ♫

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,500
♫ I'm afraid I can't afford

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,320
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

42
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,580
P'Thanu.

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,610
♫ Because I had always loved you ♫

44
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,940
The measuring tape is stuck.

45
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,810
You don't need to be afraid.

46
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,450
♫ Can you come back? ♫

47
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,540

♫ I don't want you to

50
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,659
Do you need my help?

51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
No.

52
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,620
Waist, 32.

53
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,290
Neck, 15.

♫ Can you come back? ♫

65

72
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,310
♫ I won't let you be upset ♫

73
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,380
♫ I know how good you are ♫

74
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,460
P'Thanu.

75
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,659
The bow they had prepared for me

76
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,420
is different from the bow you used
when you taught me archery.

77
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
I'm scared.

78
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,620
The bow you saw in my house that day

79
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,810
and the bow you're seeing right now,

80
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,930
they're the same bow.

81
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,540
And I am still me.

82
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,580
P'Thanu.

83
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,180
I'm sure you still remember

84
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,170
those moments, right?

85
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,020
Here.

86
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,380
Straighten your arm.

87
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,620
Draw the bow slowly. I'll help you out.

88
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,420
Like this.

89
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,370
Okay, everyone.

90
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,100
Today, let's talk about the issues

91
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,260
that had occurred within our club.

92
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,820
There were many issues
with the club lately.

93
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,220
Some of the team members
were thrown out of the club

94
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,299
due to improper behaviours.

95
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,340
Our club was ordered
to cancel all club activities.

96
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,720
At the same time, our rights to attend
the national swimming competition

97
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,660
were revoked as well.

98
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,450
But

99
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
I've spoken with the school

100
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,780
and the people in charge.

101
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,140
Their conclusion is

102
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,620
that we can resume our normal training.

103
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,020
The school thinks that this mistake
is attributed to an individual.

104
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,020
It's good enough if they punish
the individual alone.

105
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,910
I would like to apologise
to you guys sincerely

106
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,060
for my negligence.

107
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,800
That's why these issues occurred
within our club.

108
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,180
Of course,

109
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,460
regarding the empty slots
for the swimming club,

110
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,430
everyone here has a chance to showcase
their swimming skills

111
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,430
and become a member of the swimming team.

112
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,780
I truly hope everyone

113
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,580
can treat our training seriously.

114
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,460
Okay, you guys are dismissed.

115
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,340
Pok.

116
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,100
Yes, Coach?

117
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,700
Stay here.

118
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,300
You need to give it your all.

119
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,620
Now, you have another opportunity
to join the national swimming competition.

120
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,180
Okay.

121
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,740
I will do my best, Coach.

122
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,170
And, don't forget to thank your friend.

123
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,700
He reported the incident to the school.

124
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,500
If he didn't do so,

125
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,460
the wrongdoer wouldn't have been
punished in the first place.

126
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,130
And, our club would've never made
such huge improvements.

127
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,610
Okay.

128
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,180
Go and train now.

129
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,330
P'Kit, I'm back.

130
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,420
Have you eaten?

131
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,900
I've just eaten with my friends.

132
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,730
The result for the scholarship

133
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,700
will be announced soon.

134
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,500
Are you nervous?

135
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,980
A little.

136
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,340
It's been a long time
since I had such excitement.

137
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,660
Before we got into university,

138
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,540
you said

139
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,130
that the result didn't matter

140
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,250
as long as we gave it our best.

141
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,990
So, are you lecturing me right now?

142
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,020
You still haven't told me

143
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,100
what kind of exam you're taking.

144
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,220
Yeah.

145
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,900
Actually, this is just
the first round of exams.

146
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,180
I just need to hand in
my thesis, application,

147
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,020
and state the reason I wanted
to get the scholarship.

148
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,020
And, you have the recommendation letter
for this research project as well.

149
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,140
Seems like

150
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,260
you'll be able to pass it for sure.

151
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,740
I didn't hand in
the recommendation letter.

152
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:16,980
Huh?

153
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,100
But why?

154
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,460
Indeed, I'll have an edge over the others

155
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,010
as long as I hand in
the recommendation letter.

156
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,770
But I wish to get the scholarship
through my own knowledge and effort.

157
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,420
This way, I can feel prouder of myself.

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,010
Wow.

159
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,130
You're exceptional indeed.

160
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,380
Do you wish to learn from me?

161
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,180
P'Kit, I still have a long way to go.

162
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,900
We still don't know the result yet.

163
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,020
P'Kit.

164
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,780
I need to go downstairs for a second.

165
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,580
My friend is here to pass me some stuff.

166
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,580
Is it you, Phai?

167
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,180
Who are you looking for?

168
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,260
Did you knock on the wrong door?

169
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,540
I'm here to take my things.

170
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,300
Huh?

171
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Is that Phai's friend?

172
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Hey, stop knocking.

173
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,260
It's late now.

174
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,100
Stop knocking.

175
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,860
Did you knock on the wrong door?

176
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,820
This isn't the wrong door.

177
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm here to take back

178
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,420
the uniform someone stole from my house.

179
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,180
Even so, no one can compare with you
when it comes to stealing.

180
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,850
Where did you get the mask?

181
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,680
I got it when I went to the Faculty
of Media to try out my costume.

182
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,220
P'Kit,

183
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,340
you can punish me however you like.

184
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,260
Because

185
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,300
I can't bear to live another second
without seeing you.

186
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,140
What?

187
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,700
Did my face change or something?

188
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,940
That's right.

189
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,340
P'Kit.

190
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,660
You became more adorable.

191
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,820
It's been a month
since we last saw each other.

192
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,430
Come.

193
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,380
Let me hug you.

194
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,370
You're going against the rules.

195
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,540
Wait here. I'll pass the things to you.

196
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,860
Hmm.

197
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,740
What's with the displeasing expression?

198
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,490
You can keep it.

199
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,100
I...

200
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,780
I'm just finding excuses to see you.

201
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,820
P'Kit.

202
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,980
You should return
since you've taken back your stuff.

203
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,380
Can't I just see you for a second longer?

204
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,420
Please.

205
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,700
Give me five minutes.

206
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,020
Three minutes is enough.

207
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,060
P'Kit, just two minutes.

208
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,100
Go back.

209
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,300

P'Wayu, are you still not allowed
to visit P'Pa?

247
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,900
You've been here several times.

248
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,180
Aren't you tired of it?

249

I don't know

250
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
what's wrong with P'Pa either.

251
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,140
You're giving him false hope
by doing this.

252
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
You're actually hurting him

253

by doing so.

254
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,420
What should I do then, Sab?

255
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,100
I don't want P'Pa to be upset.

256

Do you have any suggestions?

257
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,380
If you're afraid that he might be upset,

258
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,980
can you choose

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,010
to give up on P'Thanu
and fall for P'Pa again?

Sab.

261
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,340

I can't do so.

I've stopped loving P'Pa.

264
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,260
If so, you need to face the reality.

265
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,660
P'Pa won't let you visit him

266
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,460
until he can accept the reality.

267
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,660
As for now, you should lead your own life.

you had always taken good care of P'Pa.

272

You shouldn't blame yourself
for this, P'Wayu.

Don't worry, P'Wayu.

290

I'll ask P'Thanu to visit us more often

I didn't know that
you would be coming today.

333
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,420
It's fine.

334
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,340
I can wait for you.

335
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,180
So,

336
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,580
were you here for a long time?

337
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
Why didn't you wake me up?

338
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,290
You were asleep just now.

339
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,330
I didn't dare to wake you up.

340
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,820
So,

341
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,940
shall we start our practice?

342
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,340
Let's begin.

343
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,740
I truly wish to know

344
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,900
why you're here to
practise archery with me.

345
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,970
Because this is the only way

346
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,610
we can spend time together.

347
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,060
What a sincere answer.

348
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,730
I don't care about archery at all.

349
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,060
You said that yourself.

350
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,340
I'll report this to P'Yuki later.

351
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,300
We made a promise to each other.

352
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,380
No matter what happens,

353
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,660
we won't let go of each other's hands.

354
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,700
Do you still remember that?

355
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,170
I do.

356
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,170
If so,

357
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,900
is our promise still intact now?

358
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,020
You know this, right?

359
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,780
The reason I've been taking care of P'Pa.

360
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,340
Wayu,

361
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,500
can you not mention
other people's names for now?

362
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,730
I just wish to be in the moment.

363
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,060
Now,

364
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,820
there are only two of us.

365
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,380
Your heart

366
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,860
is still mine, right?

367
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,100
♫ Can you come back? ♫

368
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,770
♫ I'm afraid I can't afford
to forget you ♫

369
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,770
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

370
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,730
♫ Because I had always loved you ♫

371
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,810
♫ Can you come back? ♫

372
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,030
♫ Let us start anew ♫

373
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,730
♫ I love you with all my heart ♫

374
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,660
P'Thanu.

375
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,260
P'Thanu!

376
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,960
♫ I don't want you to
be together with him ♫

377
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,690
P'Thanu, are you there?

378
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh.

379
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,180
What's the matter, Sab?

380
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,770
P'Mark said he would be late.

381
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,570
They need to change some of
their positions urgently.

382
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,620
That's why they hope that you can

383
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,700
join the practice for the gangster drama,
is that okay with you?

384
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Sure.

385
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,730
Should I head over there right now?

386
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,130
Pee, follow me.

387
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,530
Come on.

388
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,980
I've brought P'Thanu here.

389
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,220
I'll resume my work now.

390
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,620
Good luck, my seniors.

391
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,500
Thanu,

392
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,140
stand over here.

393
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,270
Come, over here.

394
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,080
Come here.

395
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,740
Here.

396
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,860
Stand here.

397
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,620
This is how it goes.

398
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,460
Your character

399
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,940
needs to save his gangster friend
from their enemies

400
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,730
and resolve the misunderstanding
between them,

401
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,220
okay?

402
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,190
Later, you need to push Pok to the ground.

403
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,460
He'll fall to the ground.

404
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,180
When he pushes you,

405
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,980
you should fall to the ground.

406
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,690
After that,

407
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,380
you need to raise your head
and look at him in a surprised manner.

408
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,150
"How could my friend treat me like this?"

409
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,460
That's about it.

410
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,330
Jew,

411
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,060
have you read the script

412
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,140
before our practice?

413
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,180
You know how much Pok hates Thanu.

414
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,460
He's been away for so long.

415
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,550
Even so, he's still pulling a long face
after he returned here.

416
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,660
It'll be fine.

417
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,650
He won't cause any trouble.

418
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,660
Are you sure about that?

419
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,860
Later, you'll hear a gunshot.

420
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,460
Pok will know that someone
is trying to hurt you.

421
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,100
Okay.

422
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
Thanu, you'll turn around.

423
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,500
You'll kneel with one knee on the ground.

424
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,740
You'll get into your position

425
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,180
and shoot the crooks.

426
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,210
After that, you'll run to here
and hide from the bullets.

427
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,970
-Over here.
-Over here, right?

428
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,800
Let's give this a try.

429
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,330
-Bang.
-Okay.

430
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,050
Hide over here.

431
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,380
Go there.

432
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,300
That's right.

433
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,410
Erm.

434
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,620
Pok, approach him.

435
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,500
Extend your hand towards him.

436
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,620
Pull him up.

437
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
After that, you two will
stare at each other.

438
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,770
Make it as if you two
understand each other's feelings.

439
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,180
Pok,

440
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,020
according to the script,

441
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,940
you should make
an understanding expression.

442
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,380
But you look like
you're trying to kill him.

443
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,090
That's right.

444
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,060
I quit.

445
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,180
I can't pretend to understand

446
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,940
a friend who had betrayed me before.

447
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,730
Pok!

448
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:13,060
[I wish to apologize to you.]

449
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,210
Tong.

450
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,260
I need to tell you something.

451
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,690
Sorry. I've been quite busy lately.

452
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,780
So,

453
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,420
how's your health?

454
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,820
I see.

455
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,140
It's good as long as
you're healthier than before.

456
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,540
After I'm done with everything,

457
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
I think I'll be able to visit you
every day, just like before.

458
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,860
Okay.

459
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,780
Rest well.

460
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,970
[Hello, P'Kit?]

461
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,140
It's not time for our call yet.

462
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,540
Why did you call me so early today?

463
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,540
I wish to chat with you.

464
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,260
I miss you.

465
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,860
[I don't believe you.]

466
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,020
[I'm sure you're just excited
because of the meteor.]

467
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,500
You're right,

468
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,220
P'Kit.

469
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
You always read my mind.

470
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,340
It's because I'm worried that we might not
be able to watch the meteor together.

471
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,260
You'll miss it

472
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,180
if I call you later.

473
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,100
Hurry and come to the balcony.

474
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,900
Actually, if we had stayed together,

475
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,580
you wouldn't have come up
with all these plans.

476
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,340
[Don't say that.]

477
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,350
[At least now, we still have a chance]

478
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,350
[to watch the meteor together.]

479
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,100
Okay.

480
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,290
P'Kit, do you believe this?

481
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,100
So,

482
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,650
apparently, if we make a wish together

483
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,660
before the meteor disappears,

484
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,130
our wish will come true.

485
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,260
I often hear that from other people.

486
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,860
But I haven't tried it for myself.

487
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,260
I don't know if it's true.

488
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,100
Everyone said

489
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,900
that if we make our wishes

490
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,860
from the bottom of our hearts,

491
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,780
they will come true.

492
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,780
For example...

493
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,020
Erm...

494
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,219
If I make a wish for you and me to...

495
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,179
Mark, wait.

496
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,620
Our wishes won't come true

497
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,139
if we tell other people about them, right?

498
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,900
You actually knew that?

499
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,690

Okay.

506

When my wish comes true,

507
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,980
I promise I'll tell you first.

Did you manage
to make a wish in time, P'Kit?

513
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,540
I almost couldn't make it in time.

514
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,580
My wish took a little longer
to make than I thought.

515

But luckily, you told me to come here
before the meteor had descended.

Mark,

518
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,060
I thought it was a special meteor.

519
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,660
So, it's just a piece of meteorite.

520
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,900
It doesn't even have a name.

521
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,900
It's just that it's clear for us to see.

I hope we can love each other
like this forever.

533

You didn't make this wish just now, right?

534

Why are you asking that?

535

You see,

536

your wish won't come true

537

538

Don't worry.

539
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,380
I didn't make this wish just now.

540
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,930
It's because I think

541
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,780

00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,420
because I didn't want any new rivals.

668
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:23,290
I don't want other people
to get close to you.

669
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,410
I don't want them to be closer to you
than me.

670
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,740
I won't care no matter who approaches me.

671
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,770
It's because this bow

672
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,100
is the only thing I care about right now.

673
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,660
That's all.

674
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,290
I'm very scared, P'Thanu.

675
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,780
I'm scared that I might mess up the event.

676
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,700
I believe

677
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,620
that you can surely do it.

678
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,140
Come.

679
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,220
Let me put it over here.

680
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,210
Try and close your eyes.

681
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,700
Take a deep breath.

682
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,050
Do you feel relaxed?

683
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,260
P'Thanu.

684
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,500
Why is your heart beating faster
than before?

685
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,460
I can't react in time

686
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,780
when you're doing this.

687
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,100
Is my heart beating rapidly?

688
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,780
You're the only person

689
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,260
who can make my heart beat rapidly.

690
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,820
Try and close your eyes again.

691
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,700
Take a deep breath.

692
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,690
Relax.

693
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,380
Try and synchronise

694
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,940
our heartbeats.

695
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,980
Can you forget everything?

696
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,950
I've forgotten everything.

697
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:05,660
You just need

698
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:08,960
to remember that we love each other.

699
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,970
Remember,

700
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,560
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

701
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,500
you're the only one I love.

702
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,170
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

703
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,560
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

704
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,660
♫ I don't know why ♫

705
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,950
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

706
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:29,240
♫ Just let it be ♫

707
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,730
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

708
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,890
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

709
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:56,370
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

710
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:59,450
♫ It was an accident ♫

711
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,380
♫ The closer I am to you ♫

712
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,900
♫ The closer I can see your eyes ♫

713
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,890
♫ The more satisfied I'll be ♫

714
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,220
♫ The only thing I know ♫

715
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,740
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

716
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,750
♫ Just like that ♫

717
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,190
♫ Because it's you ♫

718
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,330
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

719
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,560
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

720
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,120
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

721
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,640
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

722
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,600
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

723
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,740
♫ I feel happy ♫

724
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,050
♫ When I can see you ♫

725
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,940
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

726
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:46,360
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

727
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,080
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

728
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,390
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

729
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,570
♫ I don't know why ♫

730
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,780
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

731
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,960
♫ Just let it be ♫

732
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,410
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

733
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,250
♫ I don't know why ♫

734
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,540
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

735
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,660
♫ Just let it be ♫

736
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,670
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫
