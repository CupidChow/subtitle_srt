00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,120
[Alarm 7:00]

2
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,450
[Mark: Will you return late tonight too?
Wake me up when you're back.]

3
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
[Mark: I miss you so much.]

4
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,700
[Mark: What time did you leave
this morning? You didn't tell me at all.]

5
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:57,760
Here you go.

6
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,470
Take a look.

7
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,160
I searched for some information.

8
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,160
I kept a copy with me.

9
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,940
So, I...

10
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,960
I...

11
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,280
P'Kit?

12
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,180
You're back?

13
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,340
Have you had dinner?

14
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,250
Yes, I have.

15
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,840
Sorry that you have to watch
the drama by yourself.

16
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,540
Let's watch it together again.

17
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,260
Sure. I'll spoil the plot for you.

18
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
What? Must you make me punch you
before you can sleep well?

19
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,750
Yeah.

20
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,280
It's because you punch hard.

21
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,640
Your punches are so hard

22
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,490
that I have fainted.

23
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,500
You're very heavy.

24
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,080
I'm not heavy at all.

25
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,740
You're very heavy.

26
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,030
Okay then.

27
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,300
I'm not heavy in this position, right?

28
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,820
How long has it been

29
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,870
since we have been together like this?

30
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,710
I don't wish to part with you,
even for a single minute.

31
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,760
You're doing it again.

32
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:31,890
[In The Previous Episode]

33
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,360
I really don't want you to go back.

34
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,150
If I can reverse time,

35
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,160
I'll do so even if it means

36
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,300
that I have to do these exercises again.

37
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,260
So, what's your relationship
with P'Thanu then?

38
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,070
Every time I see him,
he only mentions you.

39
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,870
I don't dare to love a person
who will never be in love with me.

40
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,929
I just sent you a text message
to ask you to join me for lunch.

41
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,770
But, I didn't expect you to appear.

42
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,600
You,

43
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,530
you always eat sushi or offal.

44
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,100
You eat both liver and heart too.

45
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,420
Aren't you sick of them?

46
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,900
Of course not. I like them.

47
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,430
Besides,

48
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,010
whenever I eat them, I'm reminded of

49
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,620
the first time I had a meal
together with P'Kit.

50
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,880
This.

51
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,740
This was the dish I ordered on that day.
Do you still remember?

52
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,170
I'll leave my heart to you then.

53
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,360
If you don't eat it,

54
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,410
I'm going to give you a kiss.

55
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,140
I mean, the heart in your plate.

56
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,680
By the way, how's P'Kit doing lately?

57
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,780
I haven't seen him at all.

58
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,840
The students of the Faculty of Medicine
have a heavy workload.

59
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,410
Just like your P'Thanu.

60
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,770
You'll be able to see him very soon.

61
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,060
You'll be able to see him
during tonight's dancing activity.

62
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,430
So, what should I do for that activity?

63
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,150
I didn't understand it either. Must I go?

64
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,870
The seniors of the Faculty of Media
are the organisers.

65
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,650
The university authorised them to do so.

66
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,950
That's why they held
this dancing activity.

67
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,160
And they'd like for as many people
as possible to attend.

68
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,860
It can help us with our academic credit.

69
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,760
But, I don't know how to dance.

70
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,650
It's fine. Just treat it as if
we're doing them a favour.

71
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,010
P'Jew told me

72
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,410
to invite more people to this event.

73
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,270
P'Jew?

74
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,730
Yeah.

75
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,550
Isn't he from the Faculty of Engineering?

76
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,900
What has he got to do with
the Faculty of Media?

77
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,910
You knew it as well.

78
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,400
He's trying to court P'Yuki.

79
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,920
So, are you going?

80
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,770
I think the event will be fine without me.

81
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,210
Hey.

82
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,220
Isn't Sab from
the Faculty of Media as well?

83
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,990
Just think of this as helping him out.

84
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,400
Mark,

85
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,070
I'll embarrass myself if I dance.

86
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,300
Embarrass what? All of us are friends.

87
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,070
And, the main point is,

88
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,280
your P'Thanu will attend it as well.

89
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,960
You act strangely
whenever I mention P'Thanu.

90
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,380
Be honest with me.

91
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,410
So I won't have to waste time asking.

92
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,860
So, why did you argue with P'Thanu?

93
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,000
Hey.

94
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,760
I think you should talk it out
with P'Thanu.

95
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,940
[Registration desk]

96
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,640
It's going to start soon.

97
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,510
There are more participants
than I had imagined.

98
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,730
Jew, thank you so much.

99
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,920
Thank you for inviting so many people.

100
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,010
It's nothing when I'm doing it for you.

101
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,170
So, I guess that
troublesome friend of yours

102
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,910
won't be coming, right?

103
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,650
You mean Padbok?

104
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,500
You won't get to see him for a long time.

105
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,950
Something happened to his project
after he completed it.

106
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,730
He needs to spend a long time
to deal with it.

107
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,960
I don't even know if he can graduate
successfully after five years.

108
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,450
A lot of people turned up.

109
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,270
Yeah.

110
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,500
Eh?

111
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,550
Where's P'Thanu?

112
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,230
He's over there.

113
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,780
Hello, everyone.

114
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,960
Welcome

115
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,670
to International Standard 101.

116
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,210
Let us give a big hand
to our dance mentor.

117
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,480
Okay.

118
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,700
The International Standard Dance
needs two dancers

119
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,300
to be one while dancing.

120
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,910
So, it's more than just swaying your body.

121
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,730
You have to express your emotions
through the rhythm.

122
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,470
Alright. Before we start our activity,

123
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,720
please form a pair with
someone in your mind.

124
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
Please.

125
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,450
You look beautiful today.

126
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,740
Thank you.

127
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,560
Mark.

128
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,490
What?

129
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,270
Let's be a pair.

130
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,920
I already have a partner.

131
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,390
Who's your partner?

132
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,360
Over there!

133
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,300
-Over there!
 -Isn't your partner here yet?

134
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,020
-This, this as well.
 -Mark.

135
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
What?

136
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,840
Act normally.

137
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,820
-Go and pair up with P'Thanu then.
 -Which year are you in?

138
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,250
Don't tell me you wish to pair up with...

139
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,490
N'Wayu!

140
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,500
N'Wayu!

141
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,730
Ko, what's the matter with you?

142
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,290
You're here as well?

143
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,040
So, who summoned you here?

144
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,370
If you continue to speak in this manner,

145
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,020
you'll pass away at an early age.

146
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,080
Ko, what are you trying to do?

147
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
Are you cursing me?

148
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,380
That's not it.

149
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm just worried about you.

150
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,700
Ko, are you sure
this is how you show concern?

151
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,230
What?

152
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,210
Ko, you're such a nuisance.

153
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,290
They're arguing again.

154
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,450
Why are they...

155
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,570
Wayu.

156
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,620
Pair up with me.

157
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,920
I'll leave him to you, P'Thanu.

158
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,570
Wayu,

159
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,830
you better not step on his foot
when you dance with him.

160
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,590
Wayu, when you dance with the prince,

161
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,290
you should remember to leave
before midnight.

162
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,430
Or else your carriage
will turn into a pumpkin.

163
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,150
See you.

164
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,630
Mark!

165
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,270
N'Mark, would you like to dance with me?

166
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,800
Okay.

167
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,610
Not only am I willing to dance with you,

168
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,110
but my body is also very honest about it.

169
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,770
Just wait.

170
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,570
Hurry up.

171
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,140
Fine then.

172
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,060
Pair up with me.

173
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,860
Pee, this is my honour!

174
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,680
Was it like this?

175
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,190
Put your hand on my waist.

176
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,090
Put it on your waist?
That makes me look like a girl.

177
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,180
If so, I'll put my hand
on your waist then.

178
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,810
Okay, fine.

179
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,280
-What should I do?
-Like this?

180
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,210
N'Alice, pair up with me.

181
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
I already have a partner.

182
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,470
That's right.

183
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,090
Who has no partner?

184
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,970
-Me.
-Me.

185
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,590
You two can form a pair then.

186
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,790
Can we dance alone?

187
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,450
This is a dance, not an aerobic exercise.

188
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,849
I'm really curious

189
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,710
as to which of them will put their hand

190
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,020
on the other's shoulder and which of them

191
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,869
will put their hand on the other's waist.

192
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,349
I'll put my hand on your waist.

193
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,770
-Put it on my shoulder.
-I'll put it on your waist.

194
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:21,980
No!

195
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,010
Put it on my shoulder.

196
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,550
No!

197
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,960
Put it on my shoulder!

198
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,530
I'm your senior.
I want to put it on your waist.

199
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,680
So what if you're my senior?
Put it on my waist.

200
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,220
No, put it on my shoulder.

201
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,500
No.

202
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,200
Alright, everyone.

203
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,810
Let's start with the basic dance steps.

204
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,160
Music, please.

205
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,960
Let's continue.

206
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,410
Ko!

207
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,040
It's your fault.

208
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,410
What's wrong with you?

209
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,220
You were the one who didn't
look at our surroundings closely.

210
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,920
How can I see when they're behind me?

211
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,710
Come on, let's continue.

212
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,620
Let's go.

213
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,300
Sorry about that.

214
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,590
Wayu.

215
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,200
P'Thanu, I think I'm almost forgetting
the rhythm.

216
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,860
Everyone, prepare to make a spin.

217
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,580
One, two,

218
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,940
spin.

219
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,810
Sorry about that.

220
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,150
It's fine.

221
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,410
Pa.

222
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,670
I think I found some research information

223
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,010
that could be of use to you.

224
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,720
Yeah.

225
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,350
I'm searching for them on the Internet.

226
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,790
I'll tell you about the details
when I visit you.

227
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,140
Okay.

228
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,320
Hello, P'Kit.

229
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,190
Sandee?

230
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,540
Didn't you join the event that was
organised by the Faculty of Media?

231
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,290
I didn't.

232
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,760
I have a report to do.

233
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,300
See you then.

234
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,550
What are you up to?

235
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,480
What have I done?

236
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,950
There are so many computers here.

237
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,610
Why must you use the computer
that was used by P'Kit?

238
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,250
That monitor is broken.

239
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,270
This mouse is broken as well.

240
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,600
This is the only computer left.

241
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,660
Is that so?

242
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,320
What's your problem?

243
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,940
Kit, are you too free?

244
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,970
You always come to visit me.

245
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,060
As if I would disappear.

246
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,430
The research that I told you about

247
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,680
was a research held in a university.

248
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,780
They're researching a new technology

249
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,280
that could be used to treat brain tumours.

250
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,990
Now, they're receiving volunteers
who have Stage 3 cancer.

251
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,650
I've sent them your medical profile.

252
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,300
Where is it?

253
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,520
It's in the US.

254
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,660
I think you still have hope.

255
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,550
Thank you.

256
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,290
But, I'm mentally prepared.

257
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,240
If that day does come,

258
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,450
I'll be just sleeping.

259
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,630
I won't let you sleep.

260
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,410
You must recover from this.

261
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,340
You must come back to school.

262
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,250
And be the doctor you always wanted to be.

263
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,630
Kit, I'll be counting on you for that.

264
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,330
Do it for my sake.

265
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,190
Please realise my dream for me.

266
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,940
I know you can do it.

267
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,990
And, you'll do a better job than me.

268
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,810
I won't promise you that.

269
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,020
You need to realise your own dream.

270
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,770
I'm getting bored

271
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,000
from talking about me all the time.

272
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,730
Let's talk about you.

273
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,050
What's there to talk about?

274
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,270
I think I remember someone

275
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,730
said that he has a flirtatious junior
called Mark

276
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,170
from the Faculty of Engineering.

277
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,470
He always makes people angry

278
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,630
and is always asking for a beating.

279
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,010
He can court anyone in the school,

280
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,590
except for me.

281
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,320
I remember what I said.

282
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,690
There's one more thing

283
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,800
that I want you to realise for me.

284
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,140
Be together with the person we love.

285
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,970
Spend every day meaningfully.

286
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,950
Take care of each other.

287
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,090
I think I won't have the chance
to do that again.

288
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,500
I wish to see you and Mark

289
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,000
become the couple in my mind.

290
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,680
Mark doesn't know how much I love him.

291
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,400
You know

292
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,870
that I don't like to express myself much.

293
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,320
You can tell me.

294
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,540
I'm willing to listen to your heartfelt
words on your partner's behalf.

295
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,510
I love him very much.

296
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,870
It's impossible for me to love
another person in the same way.

297
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,690
If he does abandon me one day,

298
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
I think I might need to spend
an entire lifetime

299
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
to forget about him.

300
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,230
Mark doesn't dare to abandon you.

301
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,330
If he does abandon you,

302
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,930
I will drag him back personally
and make him love you.

303
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,970
As if you would do so.

304
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,140
Of course.

305
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,940
I feel embarrassed talking about this.

306
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,160
Is this the place?

307
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,560
Phai!

308
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,910
Phai, have you been waiting
for a long time?

309
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,410
You came here alone
without waiting for us.

310
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,990
Where's Tong?

311
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,810
Over there.

312
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,640
Oh.

313
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,780
When will he come?

314
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,720
Pok is over there.

315
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,510
Pok!

316
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,790
Good luck!

317
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,320
That's Pok, the School's Moon.

318
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,490
I will cheer for you.

319
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,320
He's so dashing.

320
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,090
Tong, great timing.

321
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,910
Look over there. Pok is ready.

322
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,170
Long time no see, Tong.

323
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,530
Tong.

324
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,670
I thought you said you wouldn't come?

325
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,330
You're wearing my shirt.

326
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,990
Are you wearing it to cheer for me?

327
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,230
Erm.

328
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,090
No matter what,

329
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,060
you must be selected
for the school's swimming team.

330
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,780
Okay.

331
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,700
Pok.

332
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,370
Do your best. We will cheer for you.

333
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,460
Thank you.

334
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,480
Sorry about that. I didn't see you there.

335
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,900
It's fine.

336
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,470
Pok, are you okay?

337
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Pok, are you okay?

338
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,290
Are you worried about me?

339
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,110
No matter what,

340
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,080
I will surely be selected for
the school's swimming team today.

341
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,350
Show them how good you are.

342
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,430
No way.

343
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,580
Wayu,

344
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,550
have you spoken with P'Thanu?

345
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
I don't dare to do so.

346
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,600
Tell me then.

347
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,210
What exactly is going on?

348
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,840
You're really something else.

349
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,620
What?

350
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,030
P'Thanu.

351
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,520
Is something wrong?

352
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,730
It's...

353
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll leave first.

354
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,380
Wayu?

355
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,110
Where is he going?

356
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:01,820
[Pok: I was selected yesterday.
Let's celebrate my success tonight.]

357
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,310
[Tong: Not bad at all, old pal.]

358
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,760
What? Are you shy?

359
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,040
We're in the school.

360
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,420
The entire school
knows that we're together.

361
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,199
You always come here.

362
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,030
Hello.

363
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,060
Hello.

364
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,250
Are you okay?

365
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,190
P'Wayu!

366
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,520
P'Wayu, open the door.

367
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,490
P'Wayu.

368
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,800
What's wrong, Sab?

369
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,390
I bought lunch for you.

370
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,370
Why did you buy lunch for me?

371
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,470
Sab.

372
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,860
P'Wayu, what are you hiding?

373
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,080
It's something personal.

374
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,410
Fine then.

375
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,590
Have you met anything strange

376
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,240
in the dormitory lately?

377
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,960
What do you mean?

378
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,330
Do you still remember the live stream
called "The Love Battle for N'Wayu"

379
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:30,910
did by P'Mark

380
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,280
when we were choosing our partners?

381
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,500
P'Jack, P'Ko, and P'Thanu were all there.

382
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,460
What's wrong with that?

383
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,310
P'Thanu looked so dashing on that day.

384
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,700
All of his friends from the
Faculty of Media were envious of him.

385
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,370
Such a handsome guy but he's already taken.
What a shame.

386
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,490
Stop beating around the bush.

387
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,610
P'Wayu, it's like this.

388
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,110
When we were watching the live stream
on that day,

389
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,490
an account named "Pharawee" suddenly
commented on the live stream.

390
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,870
Do you know who he is?

391
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,670
He's someone close to us.

392
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,190
No one expected it.

393
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,620
I don't know either why he did it.

394
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,790
If Tong didn't tell us about it,

395
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,780
we would've never known it was him.

396
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,900
Was he your friend?

397
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,480
That's right.

398
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,950
That person is...

399
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,050
P'Wayu!

400
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,530
-P'Wayu!
-Sandee.

401
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,200
-Open the door!
-Wait, P'Wayu!

402
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,860
What's wrong, Sandee?

403
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,720
I have a stomachache.

404
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,620
Can you please take me to the hospital?

405
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,390
Sure.

406
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,800
Sab is here as well.

407
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,300
Let's use Sab's car.

408
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,840
Okay.

409
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,990
Let's go to the school's infirmary.

410
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,110
There's a hospital I frequent.

411
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,340
Let's head there.

412
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,190
I think the doctors there
must be exceptional, huh?

413
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,770
You actually have the strength
to choose the hospital you want to visit

414
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,220
when you're in such pain?

415
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,120
By the way,

416
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,250
are there any designated doctors or nurses
you would like to see?

417
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,100
Sandee?

418
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,430
Sandee, are you okay?

419
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,230
Can you withstand it?

420
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,570
Oh, it's P'Mark.

421
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,760
P'Mark.

422
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,230
Mark.

423
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,230
Let's postpone our gathering.

424
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,160
I need to send him to the hospital.

425
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,980
Oh.

426
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,040
Sandee, is it serious?

427
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,540
My goodness!

428
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,080
P'Mark, Sandee has a stomachache.

429
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,910
I was planning to
take him to the hospital.

430
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,020
Great timing.

431
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
Hurry and take him there.

432
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,750
Only then, we can
get rid of it completely.

433
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,800
He won't have a random stomachache again.

434
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,290
No problem, P'Mark.

435
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,050
Sandee even has a hospital in mind.

436
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,080
I'm sure he will be cured completely,
P'Mark.

437
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,140
That's great to hear.

438
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,800
Wayu,

439
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,820
you can follow me then.

440
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,300
Let Sab take care of Sandee.

441
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,340
Wait!

442
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,790
Who will help Sab then?

443
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,080
It's fine, P'Wayu.

444
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,670
I can send him there myself.

445
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,900
You can leave with P'Mark.

446
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,340
We need to believe in him.

447
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,350
Let's go.

448
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,860
See you in the hospital, P'Wayu.

449
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,710
Sandee, what's the matter?

450
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,770
Why did you ask me to stop?

451
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,590
I'm getting off here.

452
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,580
Oh?

453
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,420
Are you okay now?

454
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,810
I thought you were having
a stomachache just now?

455
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,770
Seems like you can control it at will.

456
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,330
Since you're so good at acting,

457
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,200
you should've taken arts and performance
as your major, Sandee.

458
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,610
Since when did you know about it?

459
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,500
Sab, you're something else.

460
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,950
What are you up to, Sandee?

461
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,340
You created a fake account

462
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,840
and created trouble in the live stream
by pretending to be Pa.

463
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,140
You even pretended to be sick
in front of me and P'Wayu.

464
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,010
What exactly are you up to?

465
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,270
Is there something hidden in the hospital?

466
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,590
Why don't you ask Tong about it?

467
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,750
Hey, don't drag Tong into this mess.

468
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,170
He didn't tell me anything.

469
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,310
You're here to ask me about the truth,

470
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,690
yet you're lying yourself?

471
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,970
Don't try to shift the topic.

472
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,140
And, you always wished to speak
with Phai in private.

473
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,290
Don't tell me Phai
is involved with this as well?

474
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,180
It has nothing to do with Phai.

475
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,630
What? I can't even mention him now?

476
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,020
Seems like he's really
important to you, huh?

477
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,500
Don't tell me this truly
has something to do with him?

478
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,880
Sandee! Come back and explain yourself!

479
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,160
If not, I'll tell everyone about this.

480
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,520
Suit yourself.

481
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,190
That's all.

482
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,090
That's all I know about Sandee.

483
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,050
Mark, I'm confused.

484
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,100
Why?

485
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,120
Why must Sandee meddle
with mine and P'Thanu's relationship?

486
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,100
And why did he want
to get me into the hospital?

487
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,170
Is there a reason behind that?

488
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,510
It doesn't matter

489
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,080
what his reasons are.

490
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,960
You just need to have conviction.

491
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,080
You need to stand strong.

492
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,450
This way, no one will be able

493
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,320
to ruin your relationship with P'Thanu.

494
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,770
Hey, let me ask you something.

495
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,970
What did P'Thanu do wrong?

496
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,810
There are plenty of things
that you don't know.

497
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,310
I know

498
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,040
I don't know everything that had happened
between you two,

499
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,880
but, you can't even answer my question

500
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,990
even when it's so simple.

501
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,240
So, what did P'Thanu do to make you angry?

502
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,540
Let me put it like this.

503
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,270
If P'Kit dated someone before you,

504
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,420
but he didn't tell you about it,

505
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,280
and you had to find out about it yourself,

506
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,440
would you be angry at him?

507
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,830
I've checked his background before.

508
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,790
P'Thanu wasn't in a relationship before.

509
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,470
This is just a hypothesis.

510
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,970
P'Kit wasn't in a relationship
before either.

511
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,340
The past is in the past.

512
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,770
It's already over.

513
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,530
If you're still dwelling on the past,

514
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,470
that means you're the one
who's unwilling to let it go.

515
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,870
I know that, Mark.

516
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,760
I would've said the same thing

517
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,900
if this happened to another person.

518
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,110
But, this is what I'm experiencing
right now.

519
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,610
There's no way for me
to not think about it.

520
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,180
Especially when I see them
having contact with each other.

521
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,710
I know I'm being unreasonable,

522
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,710
but this is how I feel.

523
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,430
How about this?

524
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,060
Let me apologise to you first.

525
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,680
But, I wish to give you an example.

526
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,280
Don't be angry at me for this.

527
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,360
Okay.

528
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,330
If P'Thanu had the same mindset as you,

529
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,160
if he told you

530
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,630
that he could never fully love you

531
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,790
because you were in a relationship

532
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,180
with P'Pa before dating him,

533
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,870
would you be able to accept that?

534
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,270
Thank you for reminding me, Mark.

535
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,140
I wish to apologise to him.

536
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,050
You should go and explain yourself
to him then.

537
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Get off the car.

538
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,470
Why are you still in a daze?

539
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,010
Whose house is this?

540
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,220
You'll be frequenting this place soon.

541
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,660
I had spent a lot of effort

542
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,640
to find this place, you know?

543
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,450
I had to get information from P'Jack
and P'Jew before I could find this place.

544
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,830
Don't tell me it's...

545
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,670
Yeah, it's that person.

546
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,350
Go now!

547
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,230
Go!

548
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,070
Hurry!

549
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,510
Hey.

550
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,250
I'll return the mission of escorting Wayu

551
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,550
back to you.

552
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,210
Even if you wish to spend the night here,

553
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,750
I won't say anything about it.

554
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,600
Mark, you're so indecent.

555
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,300
Hello.

556
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,090
Hello.

557
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,250
I'm P'Thanu's friend.

558
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,080
Oh, please come in.

559
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,440
Okay.

560
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,800
Please come in.

561
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,530
Mr. Thanu is in the backyard.

562
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,550
Please come this way.

563
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,300
Please come this way.

564
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,850
Even though your name is Thanu,
you're actually poor at archery?

565
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,300
Wayu.

566
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:06,730
Sorry.

567
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,630
I came without notifying you.

568
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,870
I didn't bring my phone.

569
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,560
How did you manage to enter then?

570
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,390
By scanning my face.

571
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,870
At first, I told your housekeeper
that I was a friend of yours.

572
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,840
The housekeeper was confused as well.

573
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,800
But, she brought me here

574
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,230
after staring at me for a few seconds.

575
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,750
Did I interrupt you?

576
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,450
If you're busy,

577
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,180
we can meet up some other day.

578
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,050
You came all the way here to find me.

579
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,340
I won't let you leave.

580
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,110
But,

581
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,170
do you have anything to tell me?

582
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,690
Can I hold this bow for a second?

583
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,140
Sure.

584
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,180
How do I use this?

585
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,570
Straighten your arm.

586
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,440
And,

587
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,190
draw the bow.

588
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,160
I'll help you out.

589
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,150
You need to draw it to this position.

590
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,530
Don't move.

591
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,800
If not, it won't look nice.

592
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,420
I don't know what had happened,

593
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,030
but, please don't forget

594
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,020
that you still have me.

595
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,140
Can you accept

596
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,360
our first kiss?

597
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,230
Are you here to have a cup of coffee?

598
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,410
I'm not here for the coffee.

599
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,410
I'm here because the person
who makes the coffee is adorable.

600
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,730
That's why I wanted to come here.

601
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,030
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

602
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,710
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,790
