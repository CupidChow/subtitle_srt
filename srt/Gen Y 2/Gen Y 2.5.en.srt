1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,260
Tong.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,180
Why aren't you packing your clothes?

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,020
You're acting as if you're on a trip.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,350
Do you want me to hang the clothes
on the closet?

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,690
I'll help you to pack your luggage.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,690
No need. Just leave it.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,700
I don't need to waste my time packing them

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,140
if someone were to chase me out.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,070
Who is chasing you out?

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,970
I won't chase you out.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,450
I don't trust you.

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,890
You'll forget the promise you made soon.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,480
You'll break your promise

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,380
as time goes on.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,700
Tong.

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,220
Tong, I'm your friend.

18
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm Kalae.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,810
Sorry, I was distracted just now.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,890
I'll unpack your luggage now.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,620
Hey, is this your shirt?

22
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,110
This isn't mine.

23
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,190
Please return it to its owner for me.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,790
Pok.

25
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,750
If you can do it,

26
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll walk around the school
with your shirt on.

27
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,640
Okay then.

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,090
That's a promise.

29
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah.

30
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,770
Tong,

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,450
just leave.

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,630
During competitions,

33
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,290
do you know what feels worse

34
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,280
than losing the competition?

35
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,120
That is to think that we have won.

36
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,470
But actually, we won by cheating!

37
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,200
It's because I didn't obey the rules.

38
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,210
Let's begin a new relationship.

39
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,590
Okay, P'Thanu.

40
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,380
Pharawee.

41
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,070
P'Thanu?

42
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,020
P'Thanu said he wanted to visit you.

43
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,210
Did you tell me to take care of Wayu

44
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,060
because of this?

45
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,560
Why didn't you tell Wayu about this?

46
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,100
I didn't want Wayu

47
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,070
to see me in this state.

48
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,540
I hope that he can remember
that his relationship with me

49
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,960
was filled with happy memories

50
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,790
even if we aren't together anymore.

51
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,490
Now,

52
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,940
you're Wayu's Mr. Right.

53
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,159
I wasn't his Mr. Right from the start.

54
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,030
But I think...

55
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,240
P'Thanu,

56
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,970
I wish to leave this world in silence.

57
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,510
I don't want anyone
to shed any tears for me.

58
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,070
Pa,

59
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,220
let me ask you this.

60
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,820
Do you think

61
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Wayu won't be upset

62
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,380
when he learns about the truth
in the future?

63
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,050
If that moment does arrive,

64
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,770
please explain the situation to him.

65
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,780
Kit,

66
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,270
can I speak with P'Thanu alone?

67
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
Sandee.

68
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,520
It's not too late for you to turn back.

69
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,060
I have something to return to you as well.

70
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,540
What is it?

71
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,070
P'Thanu.

72
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,550
P'Thanu?

73
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,500
I think P'Thanu will choose you today.

74
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,010
Everything is predestined.

75
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,850
We cannot change anything.

76
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,180
I promised that I'd help you out.

77
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Your family's cooking is amazing.

78
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,300
Don't you feel lonely staying at home
alone all the time?

79
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,460
Sometimes.

80
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,540
If so,

81
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,860
will you often invite someone over
to have meals together with you?

82
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,910
What's wrong?

83
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,050
I have something to tell you
after our meal.

84
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,680
Okay.

85
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,730
P'Thanu,

86
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,210
let me feed you.

87
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,390
If not, your hands will get dirty.

88
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,160
Once the arrow leaves the string,

89
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,660
it won't be able to stop.

90
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,790
It will travel along with the wind

91
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,310
until it runs out of energy.

92
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,810
No matter if it can hit the target or not,

93
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,050
we have to accept the result.

94
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,930
Just now, you said
you have something to tell me.

95
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,960
Wayu.

96
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,950
Kit, I won't thank you for this.

97
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,920
It's because words can't
express my gratitude

98
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,800
for the things

99
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,840
you had done for me.

100
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,720
Don't be so sentimental.

101
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,790
You need to live and make it up to me.

102
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,700
By the way,

103
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,280
what did you talk about
with P'Thanu this morning?

104
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,230
I won't tell you that.

105
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,940
It's a secret

106
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,930
between me and P'Thanu.

107
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,540
I'm asking this

108
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,850
because P'Thanu wants to visit you again.

109
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,740
But he didn't tell me about it
this morning.

110
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,170
So, when is he coming?

111
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,040
Right now.

112
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,330
Oh.

113
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,900
Kit, why did you stop?

114
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,820
P'Thanu is waiting for us.

115
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,600
Why didn't you tell me

116
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,460
that your vision is blurry?

117
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,830
Sorry, Kit.

118
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,390
My vision has been getting worse

119
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,430
for the past few days.

120
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,710
I didn't know how to break it to you.

121
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,370
I thought it would get better
after a few days.

122
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,870
But I don't think

123
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,040
it'll recover that easily.

124
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,460
Is that P'Thanu?

125
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,300
I can vaguely see him.

126
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,220
I just can't see him clearly.

127
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,090
P'Thanu.

128
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,290
My vision isn't too good.

129
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,750
How's Wayu doing?

130
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,130
You must take good care of him,

131
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,520
just like what you had promised me.

132
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,760
P'Pa,

133
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,780
I'm Wayu.

134
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,150
Wayu?

135
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,000
Is this really you?

136
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,599
No!

137
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,880
I didn't want you to see me in this state.

138
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,900
Kit!

139
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,250
Why did you bring him to me?

140
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,060
Don't blame Kit for this.

141
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,160
I was the one who brought Wayu here.

142
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,770
Moments spent together
with your loved ones

143
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,420
are the most meaningful.

144
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,030
Pa, you must cherish this.

145
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,730
Why did you do so?

146
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,100
You knew how much he had done

147
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,840
so that you could take care
of Wayu for him.

148
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,580
It's precisely because

149
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,480
I know how much Pa loves Wayu.

150
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,520
And, my love for Wayu
isn't any lesser than him.

151
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,140
Both of us have done our best.

152
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,950
No matter what happens,
don't blame yourself for this.

153
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,760
If miracles do exist,

154
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,900
if Pa can recover from this illness

155
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,420
and live an ordinary life like the past,

156
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,620
I'm prepared to accept Wayu's decision.

157
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,140
P'Pa, rest well.

158
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,510
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

159
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,600
I'll be here after afternoon's lesson.

160
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,620
Are you going back? Let me send you back.

161
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,480
No need.

162
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm going to Mark's place as well.

163
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,220
P'Kit,

164
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,430
can I follow you back?

165
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,390
Sure, Wayu.

166
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,190
P'Thanu, you can return first.

167
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,510
Thank you.

168
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,300
P'Kit, what should I do?

169
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,130
If you want me to answer your question

170
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,950
as Pa's best friend,

171
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,920
I would like you to
give him another chance.

172
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,900
But as P'Thanu's junior,

173
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,960
I should tell you not to abandon him.

174
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,300
He has been staying by your side
when you were alone.

175
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,660
I understand.

176
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,890
This is a dilemma for you.

177
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,810
No matter what decision I make,

178
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,540
one of them will be upset.

179
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,420
I don't wish to let any of them down.

180
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,810
Right or wrong isn't the
most important thing right now.

181
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,840
Your heart is more important.

182
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,300
So, who do you think has your heart?

183
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,430
But I really can't abandon P'Pa.

184
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,260
If my encouragements

185
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,440
can help him recover from this illness,

186
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,140
I'm willing to do so.

187
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,880
I might be able to
save someone else's life.

188
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,160
Kit, maybe these pieces of information
can help.

189
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,960
Thank you.

190
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,830
How's Wayu?

191
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,640
I haven't spoken to him since yesterday.

192
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,460
Wayu will visit Pa today.

193
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,070
Do you want to tag along

194
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,130
since I'm bringing these to Pa anyway?

195
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,380
It's better if I don't.

196
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,450
Please tell Pa

197
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,450
that I'll visit him whenever I'm free.

198
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,830
Wayu, pass me the bag.

199
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,620
P'Kit.

200
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,650
You're finally back?

201
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,420
Sorry about that.

202
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,160
You had to eat alone
for the past few days.

203
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,960
It's fine.

204
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,170
I know you're trying your best
to help P'Pa.

205
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,310
Thank you.

206
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,840
Have you eaten?
Let me heat them up for you.

207
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,190
It's fine. I can do it myself.

208
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,060
Are you going to sleep soon?

209
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,990
That's right.

210
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,170
I have a presentation tomorrow morning.

211
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,170
Go to sleep then. Good night.

212
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,540
No.

213
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,020
Why don't you send me to the bed?

214
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,680
Stop acting like a spoiled child.

215
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,820
Let's go. I'll send you to the bed.

216
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,280
Is it okay now?

217
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,370
Yeah.

218
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,280
Over here as well.

219
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,840
Over here.

220
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,670
Over here.

221
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,340
Come.

222
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,000
Over here.

223
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,360
That's enough. Go to sleep.

224
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,800
Go to sleep now.

225
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,740
Fine.

226
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,940
This is on the house.

227
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,750
Can't you give me another kiss?

228
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,600
That's enough. Go to sleep.

229
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,310
Don't sleep too late, okay?

230
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:30,870
Hmm.

231
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,870
Don't "hmm" me.

232
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,410
It's not cute at all.

233
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,240
Okay, my baby Mark.

234
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,200
Can't you give me another kiss?

235
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,840
That's enough of you. Just go to sleep.

236
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,110
Okay.

237
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,140
Mark!

238
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,790
Wake up!

239
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,480
What's wrong, P'Kit?

240
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,230
There's hope for Pa!

241
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,280
Look!

242
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,030
They said they would reconsider his case.

243
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,850
You're amazing. Let me see.

244
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,970
What did they say?

245
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,240
Translate it for me. This is too long.

246
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,820
Over here, he says

247
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,030
that he has received the information
I had sent to him.

248
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,380
He agrees with my perspective as well.

249
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,920
He thanked me for the information.

250
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,170
Over here is...

251
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,270
What is it?

252
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,710
This has nothing to do with Pa's illness.

253
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,230
If so, let's tell P'Pa

254
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,730
about this good news tomorrow.

255
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,740
P'Kit, you're the most amazing person
there is.

256
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,530
Let me give you a hug.

257
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,200
He had sent the email to Pa as well.

258
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,580
I'll discuss it with him later.

259
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,200
Thank you for sending me here.

260
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,810
You have a minor test this morning.

261
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,850
Good luck.

262
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,960
Thank you, P'Wayu.

263
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,970
See you then.

264
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,530
P'Wayu?

265
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,800
P'Wayu?

266
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,020
What's wrong?

267
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,210
You look very pale.

268
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,110
Hello, P'Thanu?

269
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,090
Where are you?

270
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,500
Can you come and take a look at P'Wayu?

271
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,870
I think he fainted.

272
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,370
Okay.

273
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,280
Okay.

274
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,610
[University of
The Thai Chamber of Commerce]

275
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,060
Wayu.

276
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,110
How do you feel?

277
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,670
Do you feel better?

278
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,790
Oh.

279
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,630
Jack.

280
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,680
What's wrong with you?

281
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,020
Did you have a stomachache?

282
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah.

283
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,110
I had some cold dishes yesterday.

284
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,640
I have a stomachache since then.

285
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,820
Buddy, I hope you recover soon.

286
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,130
Thanks.

287
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,740
Koh?

288
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,560
Do you have a stomachache as well?

289
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,300
I had some cold dishes yesterday.

290
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,880
I have a stomachache since then, P'Thanu.

291
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,220
Cold dishes?

292
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,380
That's right.

293
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,600
Did you guys go to the same restaurant?

294
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,260
That's not it.

295
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,880
It has nothing to do with him.

296
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,880
I think Koh went there with other girls.

297
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,160
I didn't go there together with him.

298
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm not out of my mind.

299
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,460
How could we go there together?

300
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,440
Yeah.

301
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,060
We didn't go there together.

302
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,700
I think we went to different restaurants.

303
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,470
I went there with other girls.

304
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,500
I see.

305
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,100
If so,

306
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,900
I'll leave first.

307
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
I need to see a doctor.

308
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,880
Okay.

309
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,950
See you next time.

310
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,060
Okay.

311
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,850
Koh Jack.

312
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,730
Hey.

313
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,830
it's Jack Koh.

314
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,170
Okay.

315
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,040
See you, Thanu.

316
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,250
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

317
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,110
Goodbye, P'Thanu.

318
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,500
I told you it would be better
if we had porridge yesterday.

319
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,300
Look at us now.

320
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,490
It's all thanks to your cold dishes.

321
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,950
Who was the one who said the cold dishes

322
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,440
were spicy and sour enough
when we were having them last night?

323
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,490
We're having a stomachache
because of that.

324
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,720
I'll choose the location next time.

325
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,560
Next time?

326
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,980
There's no more next time.

327
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,360
We'll be on our separate paths.

328
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,050
We'll have our own meals.

329
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,630
Don't ask me out in the future.

330
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,070
Koh, you were the one who asked me out.

331
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,530
It was you.

332
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,330
You sent me a text message.

333
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,389
I sent it to the wrong person.

334
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,600
I intended to send it to Alice.

335
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,750
I'm sure you did it on purpose.

336
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,210
I'll delete you from my chat right now,
okay?

337
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,639
Come on, delete it then.

338
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,710
Do you need me to delete it for you?

339
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,050
Are you provoking me?

340
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,630
Yeah, delete it.

341
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,370
Delete it then!

342
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,690
Fine, I'll delete it.

343
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,320
Hello.

344
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,139
P'Koh, P'Jack.

345
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,190
It's P'Jack and P'Koh.

346
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,929
Hey.

347
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,690
Don't confuse our juniors.

348
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,170
Koh Jack

349
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,820
is the correct way.

350
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,370
It's Jack Koh.

351
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,190
Don't listen to him.

352
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,290
Koh Jack

353
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,340
will never be wrong.

354
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,300
How do you feel?

355
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,110
I don't care how you feel.

356
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,449
I'll go in now.

357
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,300
Pee, wait for me.

358
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,340
We still need to take our medicine.

359
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,659
So, P'Pa went missing

360
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,920
because he was seeking treatment
in secret,

361
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,710
am I right, P'Sab?

362
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,560
That's right.

363
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,540
P'Wayu is taking care of him right now.

364
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,380
No wonder.

365
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,230
P'Wayu looks upset whenever

366
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,410
I see him in school.

367
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,530
He even fainted this morning.

368
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,900
Luckily, I told P'Thanu to look after him.

369
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,280
You're right.

370
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,640
Our seniors from our faculty told me

371
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,740
that P'Wayu fainted this morning.

372
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,810
We were so mean to P'Pa before this.

373
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,210
If there's a chance,

374
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,390
I would like to apologise to him.

375
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,900
P'Sab, do I need to make a call
and order a fruit basket?

376
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,690
Yeah.

377
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,430
So,

378
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,450
did Sandee do all of that

379
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,050
in front of P'Thanu and P'Wayu

380
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,600
because he knew what happened

381
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,490
to P'Pa long ago?

382
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,470
I don't think so, right?

383
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,130
We still need to thank Tong for this.

384
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,950
If not, we will never know

385
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,930
what Sandee will resort to.

386
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,110
I'll leave first.

387
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,700
Hey.

388
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,450
Where are you going?

389
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,260
Aren't you having lunch together with us?

390
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,960
Yeah.

391
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,100
Tong, wait.

392
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,640
Tong?

393
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,780
I'm leaving as well.

394
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm heading to my club.

395
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,630
He's leaving as well?

396
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,560
Where are you rushing to?

397
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,100
What's with the two of them?

398
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,610
Let's have lunch together then.

399
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm starving.

400
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,050
Let's go.

401
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,730
Let's go.

402
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,100
How is it? Are we going or not?

403
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,250
I'll leave together with him first.

404
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,700
Hurry.

405
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,530
Phai, Kalae.

406
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,290
The place will be full if we're late.

407
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,220
Come on.

408
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,030
Let's go. I'm starving.

409
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,520
Let's go.

410
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,120
Phai, hurry.

411
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,400
Is anyone there?

412
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,240
Someone is stuck in here.

413
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,170
Is anyone there?

414
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,850
[Is anyone there? I'm at the indoor pool.]

415
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:58,080
[The gate is locked. I'm stuck.]

416
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,470
[Kalae: What should we do?]

417
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:11,180
[Sab: I'm returning home to take my stuff.
It'll be very late if you wait for me.]

418
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,940
[Pok: Is anyone else around?]

419
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,350
Thank you, Pee.

420
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,730
How did you know I was stuck here?

421
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,010
Your friend told me.

422
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,340
That's why I'm here to unlock the gate.

423
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,000
When the last group of people
left the pool,

424
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,590
they said there was no one else here.

425
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,610
That's why I locked the gate.

426
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,040
Thank you.

427
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,950
[Pok: I'm out. Thank you.]

428
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,790
[Pok: Who told the security guard
about this?]

429
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,820
[Sab: It wasn't me. Was it Klui?]

430
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,250
[Klui: No, it wasn't me.]

431
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,150
[Phai: I'm sure it's Kalae.]

432
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,480
[Kalae: It wasn't me either.]

433
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,670
[Was it Tong?]

434
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,020
How do you feel, P'Pa?

435
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,870
I feel

436
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,490
much better

437
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,190
compared with yesterday.

438
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,290
That means the medicine is very effective.

439
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,170
I'm very worried about you.

440
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,800
P'Kit pulls a long face

441
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,270
whenever he comes to visit you.

442
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,860
I think he's worried about something else.

443
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,220
I wasn't the cause of his worries.

444
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,890
That's good to hear.

445
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,930
I have something to ask you.

446
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,350
As Mark's friend, you need
to answer me honestly.

447
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,000
If Kit and Mark

448
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,950
split up because of some matters,

449
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,950
do you think they still love each other?

450
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,390
It's impossible for them to split apart.

451
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,070
No matter what,

452
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,170
Mark will come up with a way
to be together with P'Kit.

453
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,280
My friend loves your friend very much.

454
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,410
I can promise that.

455
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,360
But if you don't believe me,

456
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,450
you should recover as soon as possible

457
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,500
and come back to school.

458
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,070
That way, you'll be able to see

459
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,630
how annoying Mark is personally.

460
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,310
Wayu,

461
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,330
sing a song for me.

462
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,360
I thought you used to listen to songs

463
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,530
only before you sleep?

464
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,170
But you just woke up.

465
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,390
I long for your singing

466
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,870
no matter the time.

467
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,050
♫ Who can understand? ♫

468
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,670
Mark!

469
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,460
♫ That person ♫

470
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,090
♫ Is deep within my heart ♫

471
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,600
This is the hospital, you know?

472
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,610
Erm.

473
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,450
That's pretty nice. I like it.

474
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,640
You see?

475
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,800
P'Kit,

476
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,140
seems like P'Pa's medicine was effective.

477
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,730
Oh.

478
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,690
Seems like you can be discharged soon.

479
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:16,990
P'Kit.

480
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,690
Hmm?

481
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,770
Why didn't P'Pa take this medicine
from the start?

482
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,320
This medicine has huge side effects.

483
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,920
If it's ineffective,

484
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,470
it will worsen his condition.

485
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,200
The most important thing

486
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,710
is that we can only order
this medicine from other countries.

487
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,440
That means

488
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,140
we mustn't let down our guard yet,

489
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,010
am I right?

490
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,800
We need to continue
to observe his condition.

491
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,920
We can't say for sure yet.

492
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,280
Wayu, don't listen to Kit.

493
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,460
He worries about everything.

494
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,340
I'm just taking the worst situation
into account.

495
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,290
P'Pa, you're right.

496
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,170
I wish to prove my love for P'Kit.

497
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,610
I'll make him believe

498
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,500
that I've spent all of my energy
in order to court him.

499
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,150
Hmm.

500
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,430
I know.

501
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,370
Kit will push away anyone

502
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,830
who's trying to court him.

503
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,360
He only got a boyfriend during Year 2.

504
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,710
Are you trying to rake up the past?

505
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,040
P'Pa,

506
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,520
don't say that about P'Kit.

507
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,450
Mark, you too.

508
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,470
Don't talk so much.

509
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,000
If not, I'll take back P'Kit from you.

510
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,400
P'Pa,

511
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,200
look at this lunatic.

512
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,990
What do you mean by taking him back?

513
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,310
P'Kit only belongs to me.

514
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,570
Actually,

515
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,300
he had a crush on you

516
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,660
when you tried to court him.

517
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,040
Pee, are you speaking the truth?

518
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,050
Pa.

519
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,920
P'Kit.

520
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,590
What?

521
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,450
Was that true?

522
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,940
-Was that true?
-He made that up.

523
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,490
Really?

524
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,030
Mark.

525
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,390
-Is that true?
-Go over there.

526
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,960
Go now.

527
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,250
-Is that true?
-Leave the guitar over there.

528
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,220
Hurry.

529
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,950
You should tell me if it was true.

530
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:57,590
Answer him.

531
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:00,800
It's all your fault.

532
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,920
You had to buy lunch for everyone.

533
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,580
You just had to drag me down with you.

534
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,270
P'Kit looks especially cute when he's shy.

535
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,460
Where do you buy your lunch usually?

536
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,300
I buy them at the hospital's cafeteria.

537
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,220
Hmm.

538
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,060
Let's go outside today.

539
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,710
There's a shop that sells
delicious kuey teow.

540
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,420
Okay.

541
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,510
By the way, Mark,

542
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,190
have you heard from P'Thanu?

543
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,820
Haven't you spoken with P'Thanu yet?

544
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,600
I don't dare to.

545
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,450
I don't know what I should do.

546
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,820
I haven't contacted P'Thanu

547
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,770
ever since I heard about
what happened to P'Pa.

548
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,940
Wayu,

549
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,800
I understand your feelings.

550
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,850
I know you're very worried about P'Pa.

551
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,920
But does P'Pa know about this?

552
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,040
Are you taking care of him

553
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,890
because of love?

554
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,010
Or because of sympathy?

555
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,810
If you don't know who to choose,

556
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,800
it'll be unfair to both of them,

557
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:21,070
no matter if it's P'Pa or P'Thanu.

558
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,470
Let's go. Time to buy lunch.

559
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,430
I forgot the parking ticket.

560
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,130
I'll go and get it.

561
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,150
Wait for me in the car.

562
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:37,690
Okay.

563
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,540
Come back quickly.

564
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,620
Are you making your own decision

565
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,230
without discussing it with Mark?

566
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:05,720
Just like you.

567
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,110
You broke up with Wayu

568
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,880
and kept yourself hidden away
to seek treatment.

569
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,950
Pa, I'm sorry.

570
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,610
I shouldn't have said that.

571
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:24,960
Kit,

572
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,450
I've committed this mistake once.

573
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,130
I don't want you to repeat my mistake.

574
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,820
If I could reverse time,

575
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,300
I would tell Wayu everything.

576
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,800
I won't let him fall for anyone else

577
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,840
other than me.

578
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,130
Actually, I want to obtain
this scholarship badly.

579
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,500
But I'm afraid

580
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,790
that if something happens

581
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,940
when I return here,

582
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,640
my relationship with Mark

583
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,510
will never be the same again.

584
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,030
Kit,

585
00:47:58,410 --> 00:47:59,930
how many times have I told you already?

586
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,860
Don't overthink it.

587
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,890
You need to trust Mark.

588
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,580
If he truly loves you,

589
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,640
no matter how far apart you guys are,

590
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,410
you'll be the only person he loves.

591
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,190
Pa, let's drop this topic.

592
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,000
Let's act as if this conversation
never took place.

593
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,080
Mark, go and take a shower.

594
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,790
I'll pack up our things.

595
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,610
P'Kit,

596
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:15,410
if you still think that
I'm important to you,

597
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,100
can you tell me about the things
you're hiding from me?

598
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,770
There's a great opportunity for me
right now.

599
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,770
Someone recommended me

600
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,350
for a scholarship programme in the US.

601
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,150
Have you applied for it then?

602
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,720
Mark,

603
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,420
if I do get the scholarship,

604
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,710
I have to leave the country.

605
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,120
I have to leave you and
go to the other side of the planet.

606
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,410
Do you wish for it to be like this?

607
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,600
But this concerns your future.

608
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,320
Even if we're far apart in distance,

609
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,810
we can still love each other.

610
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,370
Do you think this will be easy?

611
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,090
Maybe

612
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,550
we'll only get to meet each other
a few times per year.

613
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,800
I know

614
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,750
this will be tough.

615
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,730
But I think I can do it.

616
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,950
Our technology is very advanced right now.

617
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,490
We can give each other video calls.

618
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,600
We can make everything
just like the same as it was.

619
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,560
Why don't we pretend

620
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,940
to be in different countries, okay?

621
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,660
Mark,

622
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:44,440
do you know what you're saying?

623
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,310
I know.

624
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,210
You'll only be gone for a moment.

625
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,860
Do you wish for us to be apart?

626
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,680
It'll only be for a moment.

627
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,850
You must believe that I can do it.

628
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,350
P'Kit, I love you.

629
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,030
I want you to have the best.

630
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,400
Please don't sacrifice your future

631
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,730
because of me.

632
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,570
I should be the one working harder instead

633
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,990
so that I can reach your side.

634
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,070
If this is truly what you want,

635
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,180
suit yourself.

636
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:58,770
Okay.

637
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,070
You should hurry and apply for it then.

638
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,300
Do you need any documents?

639
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,650
Can I be of any help to you?

640
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,390
You should say yes to the offer.

641
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,630
What do you need to prepare
before you go to the US?

642
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,960
The most important document is in my dorm.

643
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,420
Do we need to prepare them by tonight?

644
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,670
Of course.

645
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,390
What should we do

646
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,470
if the deadline is tonight?

647
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,580
What are you doing?

648
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,180
Why are you packing your clothes?

649
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,270
I need to head back to my dorm
to prepare the documents.

650
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:03,180
You said you wanted to try
being apart from me, right?

651
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,510
I'll move back tonight.

652
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,150
We don't need to travel
back and forth then.

653
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,990
I didn't think of that.

654
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,920
You're amazing indeed.
You're really attentive.

655
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,970
We're just splitting up momentarily.

656
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,140
No matter what happens,

657
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,810
no matter where you go,

658
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,920
I will follow you.

659
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:27,420

00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,190
♫ Just like the love I had given you ♫

675
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:44,540
♫ I love you because of you ♫

676
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,490
Are these snacks and coffee

677
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,610
meant for Pa?

678
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,950
You can pass them to whomever you see.

679
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,600
[Love]

680
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,830
Someone bought them for you.

681
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,330
Have you ever thought of
what you would change in the past

682
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,040
if you could reverse time?

683
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,950
I've never thought about it.

684
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,550
Everything that had happened is great.

685
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,230
Have you ever heard of that?

686
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:49,260
♫ We don't need a reason to be in love ♫

687
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,340
♫ No conditions are needed ♫

688
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,330
♫ Love isn't complicated ♫

689
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:59,860
♫ There's no need to choose ♫

690
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,420
♫ As long as two hearts
approach each other ♫

691
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,640
♫ Try and think of ♫

692
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,830
♫ The touching feeling you felt ♫

693
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,640
♫ When you were together
with that person ♫

694
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,410
♫ There's no need to ask what love is ♫

695
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,620
♫ It happens naturally ♫

696
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:32,670
♫ There's no need to look for
the definition of love ♫

697
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:38,490
♫ You just need to let your heart
follow your feelings ♫

698
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,820
♫ You don't need to
ask anyone else for love ♫

699
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,700
♫ Love exists in your heart ♫

700
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:52,420
♫ Just like the love I had given you ♫

701
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:58,310
♫ Because I know in my heart ♫

702
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:02,910
♫ That you're the right one for me ♫

703
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,680
♫ No matter if you're good or bad ♫

704
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,270
♫ No matter who you are ♫

705
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,800
♫ That is love ♫

706
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:17,730
♫ There's no need to define love ♫

707
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:23,580
♫ You just need to let your heart
follow your feelings ♫

708
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:27,930
♫ You don't need to
ask anyone else for love ♫

709
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,270
♫ Love exists in your heart ♫
