1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,090
Very good, Pok.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,400
Your record has been improving
for every lap.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,280
Thank you, coach.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,210
If you can keep this up,

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,070
you'll be able to attend
the contest before long.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,370
Okay.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,910
Coach, I will continue to work hard.

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,560
Very good.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,830
Swim another lap, okay?

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,310
Okay.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,600
Coach, aren't you giving him false hope

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,460
by telling him that?

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,780
You better be careful.
Your records are ordinary.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,750
If you're not careful, the newbie
might overtake you.

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,090
Who's there?

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,740
This punch is a reminder for you.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,110
Remember, don't pretend to be tough.

19
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,390
If miracles do exist,

20
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
if Pa can recover from this illness

21
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,090
and live an ordinary life like the past,

22
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,010
I'm prepared to accept Wayu's decision.

23
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,270
Wayu,

24
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,570
how do you feel?

25
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,820
Do you feel better?

26
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,580
But I'm afraid

27
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,900
that if something happens

28
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,130
when I return here,

29
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:12,740
my relationship with Mark

30
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,670
will never be the same again.

31
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,110
P'Thanu,

32
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,909
let me feed you.

33
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,020
If not, your hands will get dirty.

34
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,340
I understand your feelings.

35
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,760
I know you're very worried about P'Pa.

36
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,210
But does P'Pa know about this?

37
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,100
Are you taking care of him

38
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,020
because of love?

39
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,400
Or because of sympathy?

40
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,150
Wayu.

41
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,730
Wayu?

42
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,690
Sorry, P'Pa.

43
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,300
I was thinking about something just now.

44
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,630
Do you feel bored?

45
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,880
You can visit me when you're free.

46
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,890
You can go out with your friends
during holidays.

47
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,420
Or, you can do whatever
you feel like doing.

48
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,240
Speak for yourself. You should recover
as soon as possible.

49
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,190
Let's go out and play together.

50
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,370
We can call Mark, P'Kit,

51
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,610
and P'Thanu to join us.

52
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,830
Okay, let's go out together in the future.

53
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,060
Sorry, P'Pa.

54
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,870
Sorry for interrupting.

55
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,170
How's Pharawee doing today?

56
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,030
He's doing pretty good.
He has a good appetite.

57
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,980
Okay, please take care of him.

58
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,100
No problem. We'll do our best.

59
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,750
Thank you.

60
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,169
Draw it back. Let me help you.

61
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
Use some strength.

62
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,520
It's exhausting, you know?

63
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,559
Come.

64
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,310
Again.

65
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,690
One, two, three.

66
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,310
Ka-cha!

67
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
That's not right.

68
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,730
It's like this.

69
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,940
That's wrong.

70
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,410
Like this. Do it again.

71
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,100
Thank you.

72
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,980
Over here, Mark!

73
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,320
Nice!

74
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,930
Good job, Mark!

75
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,480
You're amazing!

76
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,060
[P'Kit, calling]

77
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,790
Hello, P'Kit.

78
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,370
Sorry for the late answer.

79
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,010
I'm here.

80
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,960
Where are you? It's so noisy out there.

81
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,800
[I'm at the basketball field.]

82
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,460
[I'm playing basketball with
P'Jack and P'Jew.]

83
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,060
P'Jack, P'Jew!

84
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,800
How many points are you
behind the other team?

85
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,580
You're belittling me.

86
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,390
Look, we're behind by 40 points.

87
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,890
And, they gave us ten points for free.

88
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,390
I knew it.

89
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,670
You've never gone for training before.
How could you compete with them?

90
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,620
Hey, P'Kit,

91
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,020
they're the school's representative.

92
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,830
[And they're preparing]

93
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,060
[for the national basketball tournament.]

94
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,950
You know how good our school's
basketball team is.

95
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,740
But if I continue to train myself,

96
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,800
I think my skill will improve as well.

97
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,030
By then, I'll show you my shot. Like this.

98
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,790
Yeah!

99
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,070
I don't know
if you will score your shot or not,

100
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,780
but I know you're good at boasting.

101
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,370
[Today is Wednesday.]

102
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,200
Are you going to read until midnight?

103
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,460
You do remember it clearly, huh?

104
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,360
You shouldn't return too late as well.

105
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
I know you stay up all night
just to play video games.

106
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,610
I'll go and study now.

107
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,010
Mark, let's chat next time.

108
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,430
Okay, chat with you next time.

109
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,770
-P'Kit.
-Hmm?

110
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,410
What's that on your face?

111
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,750
Which side?

112
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,570
Your left cheek.

113
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,890
Over here?

114
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,330
[P'Kit, come closer.]

115
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,190
[Closer.]

116
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,880
Are you out of your mind?

117
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,020
I'll hang up for real now.

118
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,290
[I miss you.]

119
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:55,930
Goodbye.

120
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,320
Goodbye.

121
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,570
Mark, are you still playing or not?

122
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,940
You only care about
chatting with your partner.

123
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,380
Pee, I'll stop for today.

124
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,170
I'll return first.

125
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,370
Goodbye, Pee.

126
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,490
Goodbye.

127
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,190
Goodbye, Pee.

128
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,710
What's wrong with him?

129
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,670
Jack!

130
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,480
You...

131
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,410
Jack?

132
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,200
Blood!

133
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,190
Was your nose broken?

134
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,790
Pee!

135
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,770
Are there any doctors around?

136
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,180
Any of you studying medicine?

137
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,360
Me!

138
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,680
I'm studying medicine.

139
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,900
Koh?

140
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,260
I thought you were studying dentistry?

141
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,240
Is there anyone else?

142
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,250
Pee, stop being stubborn.

143
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,020
Turn over.

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,410
Let me stop the bleeding for now.

145
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,970
It's just a normal nosebleed.

146
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,540
Even a fortune-teller can cure you.

147
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,360
Stop moving. Lower your head.

148
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,590
It hurts! Be gentle!

149
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,130
Does it really hurt?

150
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,320
Or are you trying to
gain the dentist's attention?

151
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,060
What nonsense are you saying?

152
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,350
I guess someone can't play
video games tonight.

153
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,390
You're too much. I'm already much better.

154
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,060
You're a great doctor. Thanks.

155
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,470
Your handkerchief is dirty.
Let me wash it for you.

156
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,720
It's fine. You can keep it.

157
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,540
By doing so, you'll remember

158
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,540
that you once bleed for me.

159
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,730
What nonsense are you spouting?

160
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,920
Come.

161
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,850
Sab, where are you?

162
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,240
[I'm in the toilet. Where are you?]

163
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,310
I'm right beside your car.

164
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,620
[Wait for me. I'll be there in a second.]

165
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay, hurry up.

166
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,440
P'Thanu, I miss you.

167
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,190
Wayu, I miss you.

168
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,700
Are you thinking of the same thing as me?

169
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,200
You still have me in your heart, right?

170
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,810
[Thanu]

171
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,690
[Wayu]

172
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
Sorry, P'Kit.

173
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,970
I didn't mean to wake you up.

174
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,110
It's fine.

175
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,510
I wasn't asleep.
I was thinking about something.

176
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,100
P'Kit,

177
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,880
will you be angry

178
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,690
if I ask you about it directly?

179
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,640
Just ask me.

180
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,080
Why are you only video calling P'Mark?

181
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,340
You guys have never been like this.

182
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,790
Why did you

183
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,230
move out from P'Mark's dorm

184
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,240
and move to my place?

185
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,430
I argued with him because of something.

186
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,750
We decided not to see each other
for the time being.

187
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
If so,

188
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,080
won't you miss him?

189
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,930
I do. I miss him very much.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,370
This is difficult to understand.

191
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,480
When will you guys
see each other again then?

192
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,420
I don't know either.

193
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,530
I guess the stalemate will be broken

194
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,240
when one of us can't stand it anymore.

195
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,590
I think that person will surely be P'Mark.

196
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,630
It might be me as well.

197
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,070
It seemed like he had adapted
to the new situation quickly.

198
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,930
He was happy when I called him just now.

199
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,520
It's my first time seeing you so down.

200
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,130
Let me record a video for you then.

201
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,110
If I send this to P'Mark,

202
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,230
he'll rush over here

203
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,420
to coax you in just a second.

204
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,070
So even you dare to tease me now?

205
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,680
I'll record the video now.

206
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,770
Hey, give it to me.

207
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,940
No!

208
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,370
Phai!

209
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,390
P'Kit.

210
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,640
This must be the scar

211
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,090
you got when you saved P'Thanu.

212
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,650
How did it end up like this?

213
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,810
I went to get a tattoo as I was afraid
it might leave a scar.

214
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,720
Let me see.

215
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,820
When did you get a tattoo in secret?

216
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,970
Give it to me!

217
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,330
P'Kit!

218
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,360
What?

219
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,960
P'Kit!

220
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,430
-That's mine.
-P'Kit!

221
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,240
What's wrong?

222
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,030
P'Kit!

223
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,880
You want to take a picture?

224
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,260
Let's take it then.

225
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,030
-Let's take a picture together.
-No!

226
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,980
No, P'Kit!

board game shop or not?]

230
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,230
[Kalae: My class is almost over.
I'll tell you guys when it's over.]

231
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,360
[Klui: P'Sab, I'm fine with any time.]

232
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:17,990
[Phai: I'm studying in the library.
Tell me when you guys are going.]

[Sab: Okay. Where did Pok go?]

234
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,680
[Pok: I may not be able to make it.
Sorry.]

235

[Sab: What happened?]

236
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,490
[Klui: Yeah, Pok. We had a promise.]

237
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,760
[Klui: P'Sab, can I call Sandee
to join us? He can split the bill.]

238

[Sab: Okay, call him to join us.]

239

[Sab: But I won't go then.
I don't want to be involved with him.]

[Klui: Me too. I think
I won't call him to join us.]

Sandee.

245
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,090
Haven't you severed your ties with me?

246
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
Do you still wish to persuade me?

247
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,770
I have something important to tell you.

248
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,040
I will surely convince you

249
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,920
to change your mind no matter what.

250
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,210
So, that means you're not giving up,

251
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,630
right?

252
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,050
Does this look familiar to you?

253
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,430
This is P'Wayu's room.

254
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,220
I inserted your portrait

255
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,430
into the door gap.

256
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,380
What do you want to tell me?

257
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,790
What should I do in order
to change your mind?

258
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,930
Are you still dwelling over that?

259
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,540
You're wasting your time.

260
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,160
Sandee, that's enough.

261
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,640
Do you know many people
are suffering because of you?

262
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
I feel sad to hear that.

263
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,000
I did so in order to help you.

264
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,700
If you plan to let P'Thanu and P'Wayu
be together,

265
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,910
you'll be the one crying alone.

266
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,200
Why should I cry over it?

267
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,400
I don't like P'Thanu as much as you think.

268
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,670
But what about the things
you had told me?

269
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,280
Are you going to deny

270
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,960
your feelings for P'Thanu?

271
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,520
A lot of coincidences happened back then.

272
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,330
I was confused.

273
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,820
But now, I'm very sure

274
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,380
that I don't like P'Thanu.

275
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,260
P'Thanu doesn't like me as well.

276
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,180
I've been trying my best

277
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,790
to solve this problem.

278
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,820
I don't want anyone else
to be upset over this again.

279
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,730
Phai, that's enough.

280
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,580
Stop talking.

281
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,650
I'm going

282
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,190
to put you back on the right track.

283
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,830
What are you doing?

284
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,550
Do you still remember the scar I got

285
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,330
from saving P'Thanu?

286
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,960
I told you it would become an arrow.

287
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,350
I chose this tattoo myself.

288
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,070
Do you know what this means?

289
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,770
Have you already resorted to this?

290
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,890
I can do more than this.

291
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,920
I was the one who wanted to leave P'Thanu.

292
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,430
This has nothing to do with fate
or anything else.

293
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,640
It's all because P'Thanu
already has someone he loves.

294
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,610
Do you understand, Sandee?

295
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,780
I understand now.

296
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,030
I truly understand now.

297
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,590
If you do understand,

298
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,990
are you ready

299
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,620
to apologise to P'Thanu and P'Wayu?

300
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,560
You don't need to do this.

301
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,690
I did nothing.

302
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,750
I know.

303
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,180
You wish that they can still
treat me as their friend, right?

304
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,980
Am I right?

305
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,340
How about this?

306
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,040
I'll tell you

307
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,980
when I'm meeting

308
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,360
P'Thanu and P'Wayu.

309
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,730
Phai.

310
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,490
Thank you for your concern.

311
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,280
Yeah.

312
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,030
Sorry for telling you everything.

313
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,480
Back then, I said

314
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,080
we might not be able to stay as friends.

315
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,070
Actually,

316
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,230
I didn't want that to happen.

317
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,000
So do you mean

318
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,770
that we're friends again?

319
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,450
Yeah, of course.

320
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,900
I'll leave first.

321
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,800
Goodbye.

322
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Hello, Wayu?

323
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,550
My class is over.

324
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,520
Where are we meeting up?

325
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,430
Okay, I'll wait for you at the faculty.

326
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,750
Okay.

327
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,660
-Kit.
-Hey.

328
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,730
Are you going to visit Pa?

329
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,490
That's right.

330
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,850
Do you want to join me?

331
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,340
No thanks.

332
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,580
Pass these things to Pa for me.

333
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,750
Here.

334
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,340
Are these snacks and coffee

335
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,480
meant for Pa?

336
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,020
You can pass them to whomever you see.

337
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,730
Okay, I'll tell Wayu

338
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,970
that you prepared these for him.

339
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,010
You don't need to say that.

340
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,670
Just ask him to take it.

341
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,680
He doesn't need to know that, Kit.

342
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,650
Okay.

343
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,970
-I'll leave first.
-Okay.

344
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,050
-P'Kit.
-Hey.

345
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,510
Are we departing now?

346
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,810
Before we depart,

347
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,340
I have something for you.

348
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,450
Someone prepared them for you.

349
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,760
[Love]

350
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,860
Let's go.

351
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,730
Let's go.

352
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,480
My car is over there.

353
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,520
Let's go.

354
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,770
Sandee.

355
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,640
Hello, P'Thanu.

356
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,290
I have something to announce today.

357
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,080
Pok, please come in front.

358
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,940
From now on,

359
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,970
Pok will become an official member
of the swimming team.

360
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,530
He will replace Bang

361
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,930
and participate in
the national swimming competition.

362
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,490
Hey, why are you doing this to me?

363
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,540
How is this useless fool better than me?

364
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,300
If you think you're better than him,

365
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,280
you should swim faster than him next time.

366
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,150
That's all.

367
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,400
And that's it.

368
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,310
Meeting dismissed. Resume your training.

369
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,860
Go now.

370
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,050
[Pok]

371
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,170
Have you seen my keys?

372
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,580
This is mine.

373
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,710
Nonsense.

374
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,060
Where did my keys go then?

375
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,890
It's not in the room either.

376
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,410
You mean this?

377
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,410
Come here.

378
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,600
I'll write down your name on top of it

379
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,870
so that you won't take my keys next time.

380
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,500
I'll draw a pig face on it as well.

381
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,210
Done.

382
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,820
Here you go.

383
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,630
This is yours, right?
I'll write it down for you.

384
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,680
Write what?

385
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,730
What?

386
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,640
Hmm.

[has it been a while
since you returned home?]

392
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,330
Yeah.

393
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,550
Wayu has something to do.

394
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,950
That's why we rushed back.

395
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,160
But you? You were two minutes late
in calling me.

396
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,580
Oh, is your clock faulty?

397
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,600
I call you precisely at 7 pm.

398
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,300
Look.

399
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,510
I'm just kidding.

400
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,900
Ever since you promised to be my partner,

401
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,630
we have the same time.

402
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,070
P'Kit,

403
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,780
how long do I have to wait

404
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,510
before we can be together again?

405
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,790
Until I receive news
regarding the scholarship.

406
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,370
Sometimes,

407
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,230
people love to complain that time
passes in a flash when they're in love.

408
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,080
A month will pass by
in just the blink of an eye.

409

[But now,]

[time is passing by so slowly.]

[P'Kit, am I right?]

412
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,440
I really wish I could speed things up

413
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,160
to the day we can see each other again.

414
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,970
Mark,

415
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,790
have you ever thought of
what you would change in the past

416
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,670
if you could reverse time?

417
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,240
I've never thought about it.

418
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,660
Everything that had happened is great.

419
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,280
Have you ever heard of that?

420
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,330
Yeah.

421
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,340
Everything that had happened in our lives

422
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,780
made us who we are today.

423

[Every person we meet in our lives,]

[or deep scars.]

00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,520
I was being serious just now.

433
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,640
How could you say
I was only two years old?

434
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,060
Tell me.

435
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,300
Will you forget about our relationship

436
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,150
after a long time?

437
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,080
I will never forget it.

438
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,170
I will remember everything
that had happened.

439
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,430
I won't forget anything.

440

Thank you, Mark.

441

If I did forget some of
our experiences together,

I would like to apologise to you.

I miss you, Mark.

I'm no match for you when it comes
to exaggerating.

Hey, P'Kit.

456
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,760
Don't turn off the camera

when you take your shower later.

458
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,360
I won't take a peek.

459
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,930
You're so indecent.

460
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,460
Don't study until too late, okay?

461
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,450
I will be worried, you know?

462
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,840
Remember to send me a message
before you sleep.

463
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,610
Okay, N'Mark.

P'Wayu.

467
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,560
Sorry for being late.

468
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,530
It's fine.

469
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,640
So why did you call me here

470
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,600
today?

471
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,570
Let me return this to you first.

472
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,560
I'm afraid that I'll forget about it.

473

You and P'Thanu

475
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,800
misunderstood each other because of me.

476
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,810
It has nothing to do with you.

477
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,880
I know Sandee was behind it.

478
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,580
Maybe he did the right thing.

479
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,210
Whenever I get close to P'Thanu,

480
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,210
some things will tear us apart.

481
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,360
But no matter how difficult
the situation is,

482
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,230
you two still get back together
in the end.

483
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,290
I believe that you and P'Thanu

484
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,840
can reconcile with each other.

485
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,020
Thank you, Phai.

486
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,880
I'm very happy

487
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,230
that you're my direct junior.

488
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,630
I'm happy

489
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,520
that you're my direct senior as well.

490
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,790
P'Wayu,

491
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,290
I need you to do me a favour.

492
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,200
What is it?

493
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,530
I wish you could give the culprit a chance

494
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,030
to apologise to you,

495
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,620
okay?

496
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,450
You mean...

497
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,800
I had apologised to P'Thanu
at the Faculty of Medicine.

498
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,010
But I wish to come here

499
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,690
to apologise to you two.

500
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,960
I'm sorry.

501
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:44,640
Sorry

502
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,290
for all the terrible things I had done.

503
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,350
Sorry for causing a misunderstanding
between you two.

504
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,350
And,

505
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,050
sorry for ruining your relationship.

506
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,040
I'm really sorry.

507
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,010
That's fine, Sandee.

508
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,500
But promise me this.

509
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,880
From now on,

510
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,650
don't try to ruin other people's
relationships again.

511
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,620
Okay, P'Wayu.

512
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,480
Now, I finally understand.

513
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,060
Love has nothing to do with destiny

514
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,970
and fate.

515
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,650
It has nothing to do with someone else.

516
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:41,110
Only those who are in the relationship
have the right to decide.

517
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,120
Sandee, I'm glad that you know your fault.

518
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,710
I've already forgiven you.

519
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,550
I hope

520
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,010
you guys can handle
this messy situation well

521
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,480
and open your heart to each other again.

522
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh yeah, I have something to do later.

523
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,690
I need to leave first.

524
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,440
P'Thanu, hurry and chase after him.

525
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,330
If not, it'll be too late.

526
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,010
I've decided.

527
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,430
I will give him time

528
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,060
until he's ready for our relationship.

529
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,960
I don't wish to make things
difficult for him.

530
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,200
But to me, that isn't the case.

531
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,850
P'Thanu,

532
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,340
P'Wayu needs you.

533
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,690
How did you know?

534
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,530
Trust me.

535
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,380
If you let him go just like this,

536
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,350
both of you

537
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,540
will be heartbroken in the future.

538
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,230
Do you not love P'Wayu anymore?

539
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,790
Phai, what's wrong with you?

540
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:57,740
It feels like

541
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,590
the first time I encountered P'Wayu.

542
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,420
Did you see a vision again?

543
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,690
No.

544
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,770
I saw nothing this time.

545
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
You mean...

546
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,930
That's right, Sandee.

547
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:15,950
My relationship with P'Thanu

548
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,170
is over now.

549
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,250
No, I should put it like this.

550
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,000
Our relationship

551
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,140
should have been like this from the start.

552
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,450
Wayu.

553
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,030
P'Thanu.

554
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,370
How are you?

555
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:56,940
It's been some time
since I've spoken to you.

556
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,320
I'm doing fine.

557
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,430
How about you?

558
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,930
Me too.

559
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,440
Everything is the same.

560
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,800
I think you look different.

561
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,360
Your hair is longer.

562
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,300
Your dark eye circles are darker as well.

563
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
Seems like you didn't have enough sleep.

564
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,720
You studied until late night, right?

565
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,430
I knew studying medicine is hard.

566
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,450
Mark told me

567
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,170
that P'Kit also studied until late night.

568
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,880
He almost looked like a panda.

569
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,710
I've already decided.

570
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,430
No matter how tough or tiring it is,

571
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,220
I won't change my mind
and I won't give up.

572
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,820
I'll leave first.

573
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,730
I'm in a hurry to go back.

574
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,910
My car is right here.

575
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:03,800
Do you need me to send you back?

576
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,000
It's okay.

577
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,750
I'm meeting Sab later.

578
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,550
Thanks.

579
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,570
I just want to tell you

580
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,270
that I'll be waiting here for you.

581
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,380
P'Thanu, you should stop waiting for me.

582
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,310
Because I don't know

583
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,640
when I'll return to find you.

584
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,510
It's fine.

585
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,000
No matter if you return here or not,

586
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,660
I'll always be waiting for you.

587
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,570
I will wait for you,

588
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,050
Wayu.

589
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,020
Is this okay,

590
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,170
P'Wayu?

591
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,720
P'Thanu, wait for me.

592
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,920
Pee.

593
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,080
♫ I understand ♫

594
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,200
Someone gave this to you.

595

♫ The day you chose to leave me ♫

596

Who?

597

P'Kit!

598
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:45,550
♫ Maybe it's because
I did something wrong ♫

599
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,240
I just wish to see you!

600

Can't I do so?

601
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,650
♫ Or you had a change of heart ♫

602
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:57,680
♫ Today, our love is over ♫
