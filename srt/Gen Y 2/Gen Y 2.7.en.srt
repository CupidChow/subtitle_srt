[Principal's Office]

4
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,780
Everyone,

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,420
listen up.

6
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,140
Our school has received reports

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,830
regarding the intimidation

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,820
and assault of our team members.

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,660
So,

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,500
from today onwards,

11
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,370
the school has requested all clubs

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,540
to stop holding activities,

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,540
including

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,780
the participation

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,860
of all national competitions.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,420
What exactly happened?

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,539
Hey.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,700
I heard

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,020
that the one who reported this
to the school

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,620
was Tong from the Faculty of Medicine.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,490
Do you mean the guy
who often came to cheer for Pok?

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,860
Yeah, that's him.

23
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,340
I will wait for you,

24
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,740
Wayu.

25
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,579
What's wrong, P'Pa?

26
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,540
Wayu.

27
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,180
What's the matter?

28
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,980
Regarding the trip
we discussed last time,

29
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,100
do you have any place you wish to go?

30
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,060
Places I wish to go?

31
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,940
I think it's the seaside.

32
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,020
It's been a long time since I had visited
the seaside as well.

33
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,140
You like the sea, right?

34
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,740
That's right.

35
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,340
I like its atmosphere.

36
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,180
I love the sound of the waves
hitting the shore.

37
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,740
It's very relaxing.

38
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,580
I don't need to think about anything
when I'm at the seaside.

39
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,010
I think it's great.

40
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,300
Sorry, Wayu.

41
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,820
I can't bring you there.

42
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,090
I can't bring you happiness.

43
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,580
That's fine, P'Pa.

44
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,020
You took great care of me

45
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,410
since the first day we met each other.

46
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,740
You had never made me upset,

47
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,340
until the day we broke up.

48
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,620
Back then, I thought
I made the right decision.

49
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,540
But now, I finally realised that
I was wrong.

50
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,860
I don't think I can't be forgiven

51
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,740
for my mistake.

52
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,980
Although it was excruciating back then,

53
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,060
when I knew about

54
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,630
the reason you did so,

55
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,220
I couldn't bring myself
to be angry at you.

56
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,130
It's because you were worried about me.

57
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,460
You were worried that I couldn't
live on without you.

58
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,340
But you need to think for yourself.

59
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,860
You need to be more concerned
about yourself.

60
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,060
Now,

61
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
it's my turn to take care of you.

62
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,220
Wayu.

63
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,020
P'Pa.

64
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,020
Don't do this.

65
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,140
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,220
Now, my feelings for you have changed.

67
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,820
I'm not the Wayu who had
once loved you anymore.

68
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,740
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,650
You should return first.

70
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,020
You should return and rest.

71
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,580
P'Pa, you should rest as well.

72
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,660
I'll visit you again next time.

73
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,100
I will wait for you,

74
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,660
Wayu.

75
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,270
♫ Can you come back? ♫

76
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,830
♫ I'm afraid I can't afford
to forget you ♫

77
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,860
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

78
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,140
♫ Because I had always loved you ♫

79
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,930
♫ Can you come back? ♫

80
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,840
♫ Let us start anew ♫

81
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,850
♫ I love you with all my heart ♫

82
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,420
♫ I don't want you to
be together with him ♫

83
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,500
Get me some ice.

84
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,460
Good grief.

85
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,540
Is ordering me around
the only thing you know?

86
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,080
I'm so far away from your seat.

87
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,890
Why don't you order the person beside you
to do so?

88
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,460
Come.

89
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,540
Come on.

90
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,460
Come on.

91
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,940
Come on.

92
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,060
Cheers.

93
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,780
Hey!

94
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,140
Pee, what's wrong?

95
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,740
Oh.

96
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,140
I'm only drinking

97
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,220
plain water today.

98
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,970
I don't wish to get drunk like last time.

99
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,860
That won't do.

100
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,660
You're drinking plain water in a bar?

101
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,460
Yeah.

102
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,620
We can have fun too
even if I'm only drinking plain water.

103
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,730
And

104
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,940
if P'Kit hears about this,

105
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,620
he'll lecture me.

106
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,260
P'Kit

107
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,260
doesn't like it when I drink.

108
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
Fine then. Suit yourself.

109
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,220
The two of us can drink.

110
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,900
Come.

111
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,100
Come on, what about me?

112
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,700
Let's show him some sympathy.

113
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,340
Poor guy.

114
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,330
I think this drink is pretty good.

115
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,890
I'll return in a minute.

116
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,260
Hey, Mark.

117
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,020
Where are you going?

118
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,380
Hey!

119
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,690
Where are you going?

120
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,660
Are you going to leave me here by myself?

121
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,910
So, do you think
Mark is better than me now?

122
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,140
Of course not.

123
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,940
That's not it.

124
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,500
I thought you wanted to have some fun?

125
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,650
That's not it.

126
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,820
P'Kit,

127
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
where are you?

128
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,500
Why is it so dark

129
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
over there?

130
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,770
I'm in my room.

131
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,460
How did your exam go?

132
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,740
[Although I'm not as good as you,]

133
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,060
I've never failed

134
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,940
my subjects before.

135
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,700
Are you at our usual place?

136
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,010
[Yeah.]

137
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,180
I'm with P'Jack and P'Jew.

138
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,300
[Don't get yourself drunk.]

139
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,500
I won't go and pick you up like last time.

140
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,340
I won't.

141
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,020
Because

142
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,460
I'm not drinking any liquor.

143
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,730
But why?

144
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:29,820
Because

145
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm afraid

146
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,700
you might lecture me.

147
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,500
And

148
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,940
I don't want you to be worried about me.

149
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,100
P'Kit,

150
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,420
can you turn on the lights?

151
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,300
I've been waiting to see you
the entire day.

152
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,620
I wish to see your face clearly.

153
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,060
[Are you in my room?]

154
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,850
If so,

155
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,380
wait for me.

156
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,690
I'll return immediately!

157
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,700
I'll be there in a second!

158
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,060
[No need for that.]

159
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,930
I'll be gone

160
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,580
by the time you reach here.

161
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,700
P'Kit,

162
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,660
just let me see you in person.

163
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,780
I'll be there in a second.

164
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,340
I wish to see you,

165
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,420
even if I only have five minutes,

166
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,900
okay?

167
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,940
I beg you.

168
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,300
No.

169
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,020
I wish to see you too.

170
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,250
I wish to see you very badly.

171
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,970
But if we do so,

172
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,840
that means everything we had done
thus far will be in vain.

173
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
Fine then.

174
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,460
P'Kit,

175
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
why are you using my pillow

176
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,260
and blanket?

177
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,650
[And I thought]

178
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,330
[you like to sleep
on the other side usually?]

179
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,130
When you do this,

180
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,450
it's just like the times when we hugged
and slept until morning.

181
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,020
[They can't replace]

182
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,580
the real deal.

183
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm warmer,

184
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,820
and I can give you a tight hug.

185
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,780
That blanket

186
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,820
can never replace me.

187
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,580
I'm happy that I have them by my side.

188
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,460
[I truly wish to stay by your side.]

189
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,580
P'Kit,

190
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,540
do you miss me?

191
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,220
I do.

192
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,740
[Do you miss me a lot?]

193
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,620
That's right.

194
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,700
Look.

195
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,100
I only knew that you could

196
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,340
also act like a spoiled child

197
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,660
after we were separated.

198
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,580
What are you saying?

199
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,580
I'm speaking in a normal tone.

200
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,460
I'll return in a minute.

201
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,380
Okay.

202
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,730
Don't be too late.

203
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,780
Don't get yourself drunk.

204
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,820
Keep your neck safe from any kiss marks.

205
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,220
I will keep my fair neck

206
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,780
for you to leave your mark on it.

207
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,900
You're so indecent.

208
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,980
[No Visitation]

209
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Excuse me,

210
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,820
why am I not allowed to visit Pharawee?

211
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,900
The patient requested it himself.

212
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,819
Okay.

213
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,940
Thank you.

214
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,820
Tong,

215
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,620
I need to speak with you.

216
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,980
Tong.

217
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,100
Were you the one who reported

218
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,940
the bullying incident to the principal?

219
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,250
That's right.

220
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,740
I am the one.

221
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,300
If I didn't do so,
they'd keep bullying you.

222
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,290
I told you already.

223
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,180
You should stop meddling with my affairs!

224
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,900
If I don't do that,

225
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,210
they will keep bullying you.

226
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
What if one day,

227
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,700
they try to harm you?

228
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,540
Don't be so conceited.

229
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,140
Do you know something?

230
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,100
The worst

231
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,660
had already happened!

232
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,940
After the school
heard about this incident,

233
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,090
they had ordered

234
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,050
the swimming team

235
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,860
to stop all of their activities,

236
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,360
including the national swimming
competition I was supposed to join.

237
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,140
I'm not allowed to join it now.

238
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,420
It was the same situation last time.

239
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,800
Must you hinder me
from realising my dream?

240
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,250
You should know

241
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,850
the importance

242
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,300
of this swimming competition to me.

243
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,380
Pok.

244
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,540
I didn't mean for things
to turn out like this.

245
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,460
I just wanted to help.

246
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,700
You just wanted to help?

247
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,260
How many times has it been?

248
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,330
Your so-called "help"

249
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,290
had ruined everything for me!

250
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,740
You tried to "help" me
to pass the exam

251
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,220
and the national
swimming competition, right?

252
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,660
What else do you want
to help me with next time?

253
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,300
Pok.

254
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,220
Tong, I'm begging you.

255
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Please stop meddling with my life!

256
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,180
Don't make my life worse!

257
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,180
If you had never appeared in my life,

258
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,060
I'm sure my life would've been way better!

259
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,010
♫ I understand ♫

260
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,010
♫ The day you chose to leave me ♫

261
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,830
♫ Maybe it's because
I did something wrong ♫

262
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,430
♫ Or you had a change of heart ♫

263
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:56,390
♫ Today, our love is over ♫

264
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,540
♫ No matter how long it has been ♫

265
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,320
♫ I will always keep it in my heart ♫

266
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,870
♫ I'm afraid I can't afford to forget it ♫

267
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,680
♫ Can you come back? ♫

268
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,490
So, the hospital doesn't allow us
to visit Pa now?

269
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,900
That's right.

270
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,380
The nurse told me

271
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,050
that P'Pa requested it himself.

272
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,940
Let me try to contact his family members

273
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,980
and see what's going on.

274
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,860
Okay.

275
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,980
[Even if I can't see you, seeing your car
is great. I miss you, I wish to see you.]

276
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,450
My P'Kit

277
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,820
is the best.

278
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,140
Let me hug you.

279
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,380
I miss you, Mark.

280
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,700
I miss you a hundred times

281
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,580
more than you miss me.

282
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,220
I'm no match for you when it comes
to exaggerating.

283
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,570
[Even if I can't see you, seeing your car
is great. I miss you, I wish to see you.]

284
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,700
Is your car okay?

285
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,500
Sorry about that.

286
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,020
I'll call the insurance company right now.

287
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Sorry about that.

288
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,580
Kit,

289
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,370
are you okay?

290
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm fine.

291
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,380
Luckily, I fastened my seat belt.

292
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,020
Do you need our help?

293
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,220
No.

294
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,900
Thanks for that.

295
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,740
My phone ran out of battery.

296
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,020
Nong,

297
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,980
can you pass this coffee to P'Thanu?

298
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,740
And

299
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,340
don't tell him that
I bought this coffee for him.

300
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,940
Okay.

301
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,920
Okay.

302
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,650
The connected aorta...

303
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,890
Pee.

304
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
What's the matter?

305
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,580
Someone told me to pass this to you.

306
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,940
Who is it?

307
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,460
He told me to keep his identity a secret.

308
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,620
Okay, thank you.

309
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,190
Okay.

310
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,480
Let's continue.

311
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,330
P'Kit, you're pretty late today.

312
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,340
P'Mark had called me several times.

313
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,940
Phai,

314
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,220
lend me your phone.

315
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,660
My battery was flat.

316
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,770
Here you go.

317
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,540
P'Kit.

318
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,220
P'Kit.

319
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,460
Open the door!

320
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
It's me!

321
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,740
Can I go in?

322
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,340
P'Kit!

323
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,980
P'Jack and P'Jew told me everything!

324
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,220
You were caught in a car accident, right?

325
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,860
Are you okay?

326
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,980
Why couldn't I reach you the entire day?

327
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,530
P'Kit!

328
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,380
P'Kit!

329
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,500
I'm fine.

330
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,820
It's just a minor accident.

331
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,460
Coincidentally,

332
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
my phone ran out of battery
in the evening.

333
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,500
P'Kit,

334
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,620
I was very worried about you!

335
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,100
Can you let me see you in person?

336
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,220
I need to make sure that you're fine!

337
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,420
P'Kit!

338
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,060
No.

339
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,780
If something like this happens to me
when I'm overseas,

340
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,860
you won't be able to see me
no matter how much you wish to.

341
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,380
P'Kit, this is not the time
to talk about the experiment!

342
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm really worried about you!

343
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,460
How can I know

344
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
if you're fine

345
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,100
or if you're not hurt

346
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,260
when we're talking like this?

347
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,140
Mark,

348
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,700
you should return for now.

349
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,020
If I do study abroad,

350
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,860
this problem will exist for
the next few years.

351
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,930
P'Kit,

352
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,740
can you stop doing this?

353
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,650
I just wish to see you.

354
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,740
I just wish to make sure that you're fine.

355
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,820
That's all I want.

356
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,860
Can't you even grant me that wish?

357
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,460
Fine.

358
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,090
Let's end everything then.

359
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,180
I will give up on the scholarship.

360
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,860
I will stay with you here.
I won't go anywhere.

361
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,500
About the scholarship,

362
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,320
let's just forget it, okay, Mark?

363
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,290
Don't give up on your scholarship.

364
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,620
I'm begging you!

365
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,020
The result will be announced
in a few days.

366
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,580
I will wait patiently until that day.

367
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,810
You were so ruthless just now.

So, are we not allowed

372
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,980
The patient requested it himself.

You'll know it later.

Hello.

384

Thank you for participating
in this activity.

385
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,620
Let me explain our "One Night Activity"

386
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,460
just in case someone doesn't know
what's going on.

387
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,020
"One Night Activity"

388
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,740
is an activity we hold

389
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,220
to showcase our products, designs,

390
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,460
and the capability of our faculty.

391
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,590
There will be a different concept

392
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,570
for every year.

393
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,820
This year's concept

394
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,580
is Best Scene Forever.

395
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,090
We will present the concept with the
three most unique stories.

396
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,720
In this activity,

397
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,420
we will try to recreate all kinds
of classic scenes,

398
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,260
no matter if they're from movies,

399
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,380
drama,

400
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,090
or from our memories.

401
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,100
There's another highlight for this event.

402
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,530
We will invite hunks from every faculty

403
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,580
to wear groom dresses
of different countries.

404
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,060
Every country is included. For example,

405
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,860
Thailand,

406
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,660

All corners of the world
will be represented.

410
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,060
During the activity, people can choose
to take pictures with you guys.

411
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,420
And, just like what everyone knows,

412

the three special programmes.

didn't you say I was only here
to help out?

418
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,530
Oh.

419
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,540
I'm sure you wouldn't come
if I had told you the truth.

420
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,300
Join us, P'Wayu.

421
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,739
Everyone wants to see you act.

Let's divide you guys into groups then.

427
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,219
For the first programme,

428
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,219
the first group will be performing
"The Land of Dispute".

429
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:32,210
This is a classic scene
from a gangster movie.

430
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,860
The plot revolves around
the gangster's pride,

friendship,

432

This is a classic scene from a fairy tale.

It's about the story of
a handsome spirit prince

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,140
One, two, three.

513
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,420
That's not right.

514
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,220
It's like this.

515
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,410
This is wrong.

516
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,690
How about this? Let's try it again.

517
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,130
Sab,

518
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,300
can I do something else?

519
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,730
No, Wayu.

520
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,900
The handsome spirit

521
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,300
needs to attract the audience's attention.

522
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,650
When you're on the stage,

523
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,260
they will focus on you.

524
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,820
Everyone will fall for you
when they see you.

525
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,690
You are the only one who can do it.

526
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,620
At first, I wanted to
take the role myself.

527
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,500
But

528
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,860
Yuki didn't agree.

529
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
And regarding the archery performance,

530
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,050
we've already prepared everything for you.

531
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,380
Ah.

532
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,980
Speak of the devil.

533
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,500
He's very punctual.

534
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,410
Oh,

535
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,220
Sandee,

536
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,170
why are you here?

537
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,860
Now, you're the only person

538
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,540
who treats me as a friend.

539
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,300
Pok,

540
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,580
how's your relationship with Tong?

541
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,220
Pok.

542
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,860
What are you up to again?

543
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,540
Why did you ask me that?

544
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,210
Pok, that's enough.

545
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,220
Go now.

546
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,500
Hmm.

547
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,450
Thank you, Jew,

548
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,300
for inviting Thanu,

549
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,980
Mark and Jack here.

550
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,020
Don't mention it.

551
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,860
I'm glad to help.

552
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,620
I heard that you need another person
to play the gangster role, right?

553
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,530
I'll find someone for you.

554
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,140
Thank you.

555
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,260
I'll check out the other groups first.

556
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,380
Okay.

557
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:44,980
Go in.

558
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,170
It's your turn.

559
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,130
Eh.

560
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Mark.

561
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,780
Eh.

562
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,860
Alice.

563
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,580
Alice.

564
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,930
Is it heavy? Let me help you out.

565
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,530
Erm.

566
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,260
Let me help you out.

567
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,980
You can take a break.

568
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,020
Ko,

569
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,260
you won't be able to carry it.

570
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,460
Oh.

571
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,940
Do you think I'm not strong enough?

572
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,500
I can easily lift a heavy person

573
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,820
like you.

574
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,490
Erm.

575
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,820
Try it if you dare!

576
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,780
Let go of your hands!

577
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,900
I'll lift you after that.

578
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
You should let go of your hands.

579
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,060
You can lift me after I lie down.

580
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,090
Sure.

581
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,180
Erm.

582
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,660
P'Jack, P'Ko.

583
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,820
Alice, it must be P'Ko-P'Jack.

584
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,340
Alice, P'Jack-P'Ko is the way to go.

585
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,330
What do you want?

586
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,900
You took the words out of my mouth, Ko!

587
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,330
What do you want?

588
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,420
Let go!

589
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,370
You let go! I can carry it.

590
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,180
Excuse me,

591
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,140
but there's glue on both sides of the box.

592
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,100
But I think the glue has dried off

593
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,400
when the two of you were arguing.

594
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,300
Ko, don't move!

595
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,690
It's all because of you, Ko!

596
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,500
Don't move!

597
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
Ko, you shouldn't move!

598
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,380
Don't move!

599
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,300
My hands are stuck! Can't you see that?

600
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,900
Hey!

601
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,100
Ko, what's wrong with you?

602
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,140
Your knee!

603
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,260
Ko,

604
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,980
I'm sorry.

605
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,060
Are you okay?

606
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,740
My little friend is very sturdy, okay?

607
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,620
What are you doing?

608
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,100
Where did Alice go?

609
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,340
You should be more concerned
about yourself right now.

610
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,780
P'Thanu.

611
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:52,420
Hello.

612
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,450
Hello.

613
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,580
The person who's supposed to take
your measurements isn't here.

614
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,060
He's unreliable.

615
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,380
He doesn't have
any sense of responsibility.

616
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,140
I'm going to report this to P'Yuki.

617
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,980
P'Thanu!

618
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,170
Please come and help me out.

619
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,050
Sab.

620
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,580
What's the matter, Sab?

621
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,060
P'Thanu,

622
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,180
can you take P'Wayu's measurements for me?

623
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,420
Where did Klui go?

624
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,100
Didn't he say he'd
take my measurements for me?

625
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,340
He went to buy beverages for the crew.

626
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,420
You can take my measurements for me then.

627
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,130
But I don't know how to.

628
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,900
Look.

629
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,610
I don't even know

630
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,120
how to use a measuring tape.

631
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,970
Where's Mark?

632
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,180
Mark,

633
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,580
come and take my measurements for me.

634
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,660
I don't know how to.

635
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,100
And

636
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,620
I need to listen to P'Yuki
when she's explaining the programme.

637
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,820
See you.

638
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,900
See you, P'Thanu.

639
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,340
Mark, follow me.

640
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,460
Yuki is waiting for you.

641
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,180
Let me help you out.

642
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,420
Erm.

643
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,660
Sab, how do I take his measurements?

644
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,100
It's easy, P'Thanu.

645
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,890
You just need to measure
the size of his shoulder,

646
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,940
chest,

647
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,740
and waist.

648
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,540
One step at a time.

649
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,570
And that's it, P'Thanu.

650
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,060
Didn't you say you don't know
how to take measurements?

651
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,450
That's right.

652
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,660
Okay, leave it to me.

653
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,500
If so,

654
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,210
you can write down the measurements here

655
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,500
when you're done.

656
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,410
I'll head over there for now.

657
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,500
Sab.

658
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,340
Sorry, P'Thanu.

659
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,780
Sab was being impolite just now.

660
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,130
Actually, you don't need to help me.

661
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,900
I can ask someone else
to take my measurements for me.

662
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,180
Wayu, don't move.

663
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,860
Write down the measurements for me.

664
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,380
Here you go.

665
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,500
Okay.

666
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,020
Raise your arms.

667
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,860
Chest, 34.

668
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,220
Your waist is...

669
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,020
P'Thanu.

670
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:05,090
This is different from
what you had taught me before.

671
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,180
I'm scared.

672
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,010
The bow you saw in my house that day

673
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,460
and the bow you're seeing right now,

674
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,620
they're the same bow.

675
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,780
And I am still me.

676
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,880
Your heart

677
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,900
is still mine, right?

678
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,960
♫ We don't need a reason to be in love ♫

679
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,040
♫ No conditions are needed ♫

680
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,040
♫ Love isn't complicated ♫

681
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,560
♫ There's no need to choose ♫

682
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,120
♫ As long as two hearts
approach each other ♫

683
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,350
♫ Try and think of ♫

684
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,540
♫ The touching feeling you felt ♫

685
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,340
♫ When you were together
with that person ♫

686
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,110
♫ There's no need to ask what love is ♫

687
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,320
♫ It happens naturally ♫

688
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:31,370
♫ There's no need to look for
the definition of love ♫

689
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:37,190
♫ You just need to let your heart
follow your feelings ♫

690
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:41,520
♫ You don't need to
ask anyone else for love ♫

691
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,400
♫ Love exists in your heart ♫

692
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,120
♫ Just like the love I had given you ♫

693
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,020
♫ I love you because of you ♫

694
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,620
♫ That you're the right one for me ♫

695
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,380
♫ No matter if you're good or bad ♫

696
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,980
♫ No matter who you are ♫

697
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,500
♫ That is love ♫

698
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:16,430
♫ There's no need to define love ♫

699
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:22,290
♫ You just need to let your heart
follow your feelings ♫

700
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,630

ask anyone else for love ♫
