1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,540
Can you tell me

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,910
why you didn't bail out P'Padbok that day?

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,320
He was creating trouble
just like usual on that day.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,300
But it was so serious
that the cops were alerted.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,600
That's why I confessed to the cops
on Padbok's behalf.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,300
If he had been convicted
of another crime again,

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,590
the school would have kicked him out.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,840
But why?

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,720
He already had several
major demerits under his name.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,080
Did you have to do that?

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,500
There are only four of us.

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,520
Jack, Jew, me, and Padbok.

14
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,230
We promised each other

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,230
that we wouldn't abandon each other.

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,780
That means you were
at the police station on that day.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,080
But P'Padbok didn't know that.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,850
Was that why he thought
you were ignoring him?

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,670
Why didn't you tell him the truth then?

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,610
Why did you take the blame for him?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,010
Because if he knew about it,

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,490
he would have never let me do it.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,539
And he would have
been kicked out of school too.

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,080
At most, I was only suspended for one year
after I took the blame for him.

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,160
Luckily, the person forgave us
after the incident.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,720
He even rescinded his charges against us.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,560
P'Thanu.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,710
I don't want his future to be ruined.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,030
And I didn't want him to feel guilty
that I was suspended because of him.

30
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,360
Go and take a shower.

31
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,350
If you're not willing to wake up,

32
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,010
I'll carry you to the bathroom
and take a shower with you.

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,570
Last year,

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,650
I came up here and
sang a song for someone.

35
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,610
This year,

36
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,310
that person is still by my side.

37
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,200
Thank you.

38
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,060
What are you looking at?

39
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,490
P'Kit, you're awake?

40
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,159
You and I have gone through a lot

41
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,860
to reach this stage, huh?

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,720
Who would've thought a silly brat like you

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,270
could win my heart?

44
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,690
Thank you.

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,159
Thank you for allowing me
to take care of you.

46
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,840
Thank you for entering my life too.

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,150
-P'Kit.
-What?

48
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,580
Other couples

49
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,650
have their own definitions of love.

50
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,990
What about us?

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,270
What's our definition of love?

52
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,510
You shouldn't waste time
to find out the definition of love.

53
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,270
Love is love.

54
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,400
You're right. Love is love.

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,430
That may sound simple,

56
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,460
but you showed me what it truly meant.

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,930
I love you.

58
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,150
I love you too.

59
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,770
Darling.

60
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,790
What?

61
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,570
What did you call me just now?

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,980
Darling.

63
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,980
You don't want to call me Mark anymore?

64
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,640
I'll call you Darling

65
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,900
if you're this cute every day.

66
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,650
Your darling will love his darling

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,970
with all his heart.

68
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,580
Darling.

69
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,810
But now,

70
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,480
I'm going to take my relationship
with my darling to the next level.

71
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,030
-It's more than what you need, Darling.
-You're so talkative.

72
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,320
-Come on, Darling.
-You're so talkative.

73
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,820
Hey!

74
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,670
Mark!

75
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,520
Mark!

76
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,570
What do you want to eat?

77
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,630
Anything is fine.

78
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,520
Anything is fine except for cold food.

79
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm tired of it.

80
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,920
How about some porridge?

81
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,250
That's fine.

82
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,090
[Faculty of Engineering]

83
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,380
We've arrived.

84
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,480
What?

85
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,150
I'll carry them for you.

86
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,050
No.

87
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,630
They're just books about dentistry.

88
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,190
They're just books about dentistry.

89
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,680
I thought P'Kit was the only one
sending his favourite N'Mark

90
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,760
to the Faculty of Engineering.

91
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,300
I'm so envious.

92
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,640
Who would've thought

93
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,159
Dr. Koh would send
P'Jack to the faculty too?

94
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, he's even holding
his textbooks for him.

95
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,570
Take them back!

96
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,010
Wait, these are mine.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,990
What nonsense are you saying, Mark?

98
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,480
No one sent him here.

99
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,900
You better mind your words.

100
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,690
I can carry the books myself.

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,970
I don't need other people to help me out.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,450
I just remembered that
I have something else to do.

103
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,380
Goodbye for now.

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,179
Guys, I'll make a move first.

105
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,960
Goodbye.

106
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,890
Goodbye.

107
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,180
I'll head to class now.

108
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,110
Are you heading to the library?

109
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,500
Yeah. I'm meeting my friends there.

110
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,200
-Be attentive in class, okay?
-Okay.

111
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,880
Mark.

112
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,960
P'Kit, what did you call me?

113
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,600
You're not calling me Darling anymore?

114
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,620
Yeah, Darling.

115
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,690
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

116
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,580
Nope.

117
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,540
I'm going to bring my boyfriend
to have something nice.

118
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,250
By night, we have to...

119
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,460
You're crazy.

120
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,660
That means you're free.

121
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,200
If so, let's go and
do some stuff tomorrow.

122
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,980
What kind of stuff?

123
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,410
Stop asking. Head to your class.

124
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,350
Head to your class, Darling.

125
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:40,920
What?

126
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,100
Head to your class, Darling.

127
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,600
Head to your class, Darling.

128
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,700
Okay, Darling.

129
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,510
Goodbye.

130
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,300
Goodbye.

131
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,790
Can I sit here?

132
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,540
Sandee.

133
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,090
What book are you reading?

134
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,930
It's the textbook of our
fundamental professional course.

135
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,200
Regarding the high school
score incident I told you last time,

136
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,160
actually, I didn't tell you
the whole thing.

137
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,250
Actually,

138
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,490
even if Tong had swapped our marks,

139
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,160
we still had the same grade.

140
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,870
Although your marks did become higher,

141
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,730
your grade didn't change.

142
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,980
You still scored high enough to
fulfil the university's criteria.

143
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,540
So, that means...

144
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:54,980
That's right.

145
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,170
No matter if our marks
were swapped or not,

146
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,460
we had the same grade.

147
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,430
That means you got into university

148
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,240
through your own effort.

149
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,170
If so, Tong and I

150
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,740
have to apologise to you
for what happened back then.

151
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,440
I need to apologise to you two.

152
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,000
Just tell me

153
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,230
if there's anything I can do

154
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,190
for you and Tong.

155
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,430
Unless,

156
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,630
you're afraid that
I might make things worse.

157
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,720
Sure.

158
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,280
Of course you can do something for us.

159
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,110
Have a seat.
Just get straight to the point.

160
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,960
I wish you can speak to P'Thanu.

161
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,640
I thought it was about something else.

162
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,020
So, it's regarding Thanu.

163
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,230
I have something to tell you.

164
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,810
I think

165
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,540
you wanted to know the truth too.

166
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,960
Jew!

167
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,560
We're in trouble!

168
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,710
Padbok and Thanu squared off
in front of the shop's entrance!

169

179

Was it true?

180
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,870
Was Thanu suspended
because he took on the blame for me?

181

That's right.

183

Because Thanu knew

184
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,340
that if you were convicted of that crime,

185
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,100
not only will you be suspended,

186
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,900
but the school will also kick you out.

187

Why did you do that?

188

What were you thinking?

189
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
It's because I knew

190
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,440
that if I told you about my plan,

191
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,890
you would never let me do so.

192
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,870
I was just suspended for one year.

193

But you actually didn't tell me
about such an important matter.

202
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,930
My imagination ran wild because of you.

203

to shoulder this alone.

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,930
Tong.

339
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,720
Do you remember the first time we met?

340
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,690
We met each other in the swimming pool.

341
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,260
They brought you here
so that you could tutor me.

342
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,670
I do remember.

343
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,130
I still remember the answer

344
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,950
to the first question
you told me to memorise.

345
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,160
The answer to the question was 25.

346
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,520
From that day until now,

347
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,370
I never expected us

348
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,180
to become this close.

349
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,710
I didn't expect us

350
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,100
to argue often too.

351
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,620
I wish we can return to the past.

352
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,860
To the days when I made you angry

353
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,090
and coaxed you.

354
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,670
I wish to see you beside me

355
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,720
when I wake up.

356
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,510
Just the two of us.

357
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,360
Pok,

358
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,140
I have something to ask you.

359
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,500
You can choose not to answer them.

360
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,090
But if you can

361
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,440
answer all five questions correctly,

362
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,450
you can make a request.

363
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,120
What questions?

364
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,750
You can choose to stay out of it
if you're scared.

365
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,010
You're good at frightening people now.

366
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,280
If I answer all five questions correctly,

367
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,500
I can make any kind of request,

368
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,050
right?

369
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,700
That's right.

370
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,930
Ask me then.

371
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,170
I'm ready.

372
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,410
First,

373
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,760
what's the happiest thing
you've encountered in life?

374
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,180
My encounter with you.

375
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,230
If so,

376
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,100
what was the thing
that had made you most angry?

377
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,770
When I found out that you were

378
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,910
doing all those things behind my back.

379
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,550
I was like a fool.

380
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,610
I was very angry.

381
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,220
That's why I did a lot of
unmentionable things to you.

382
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm sorry, Tong.

383
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:07,950
Next question.

384
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,840
You hated me because of that incident,

385
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,340
right?

386
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,410
Although I was angry at you,

387
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,920
you should know

388
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,720
that I have never hated you.

389
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,220
If so,

390
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,240
what's the saddest thing
you've encountered in life?

391
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,820
The day when you first kissed me.

392
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,690
If I could be more open-minded
and accept everything earlier,

393
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,760
that wouldn't be

394
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,870
our last kiss.

395
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,100
From now on,

396
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,170
I won't make you upset again.

397
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
I've already learned my lesson.

398
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,930
Aren't you going to
ask me the last question?

399
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,080
Who's the person you love the most?

400
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,460
Tongtrai.

401
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,750
He's the person I love the most.

402
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,130
He's my first and only love.

403
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:50,080
♫ Ever since we parted ways ♫

404
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:57,650
♫ I couldn't stop thinking about you ♫

405
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,560
♫ At that moment, I understand ♫

406
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,620
♫ How important you are to me ♫

407
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,220
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

408
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,170
♫ Can you return to me? ♫

409
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,230
♫ I hope we will be there
for each other in the future ♫

410
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,550
I've answered your questions.

411
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,580
♫ We won't be lonely or sad anymore ♫

412
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,550
Now, I can make any kind of request,

413
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,090
right?

414
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,960
♫ I wish to let you know ♫

415
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,420
♫ How important you are to me ♫

416
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,360
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

417
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,980
♫ Can you return to me? ♫

418
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,250
Will you be my date?

419
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:55,990
Okay.

420
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,400
Do you remember?

421
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,730
You said we should keep our first kiss
for the person we love the most.

422
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,930
To me,

423
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,480
I won't kiss anyone else

424
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,240
besides you.

425
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,360
You'll be the last person I kiss.

426
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,640
P'Pa, I'm here to visit you.

427
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,500
P'Thanu is here too.

428
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,820
[Pharawee]

429
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,460
[Pharawee]

430
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,730
P'Pa, I've returned it to you.

431
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,800
[In memory of Pharawee]

432
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:11,929
[I will become your......]

433
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,570
What are you smiling at?

434
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,280
Hmm.

435
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,230
It feels good to take a walk outside.

436
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,850
But for some reason, I feel warm inside

437
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,199
after I returned here.

438
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,480
I think this has nothing to do
with our environment.

439
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,870
It depends on

440
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,550
who you met after you returned here.

441
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,880
You're right.

442
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,929
No matter where I am,

443
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,600
as long as you're around,

444
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,620
as long as I can see you
whenever I'm back,

445
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,780
I feel happy.

446
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,850
No matter where you are,

447
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,070
I will always stay by your side.

448
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,000
We made a promise to each other before.

449
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,360
We'll be together forever.

450
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,300
I will never go against my words.

451
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,900
Me too.

452
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,110
I love you, Mark.

453
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,450
I know.

454
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaking of which,

455
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,580
aren't you going to call me "Darling"?

456
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,910
Hey, I'm being serious here.

457
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,830
Wayu, what's on your mind?

458
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,850
Nothing.

459
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,170
I just feel relieved.

460
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,520
I have something to do too.

461
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,830
You should tag along.

462
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,520
Okay.

463
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,000
Why did you bring me here?

464
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,840
I thought this floor was closed off?

465
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,710
Someone will see us later.

466
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,540
It's fine.

467
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,080
Believe me.

468
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,530
You're as naughty as usual.

469
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,420
Do you still remember this place?

470
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,330
I do.

471
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,410
This is the place where we first met,

472
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,610
even though we had
some misunderstandings back then.

473
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,730
It was such a pity.

474
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,550
I think I couldn't get you
out of my mind after that.

475
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,130
The freshman who came to hug me

476
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,460
and the junior
who fell from the cheerleading stand

477
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,140
was actually the same person.

478
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,620
From now on,

479
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,150
we won't miss out on each other anymore.

480
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,830
P'Thanu.

481
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,820
Now, the wind and bow are together.

482
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,710
They won't lose each other anymore.

483
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
P'Thanu.

484
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,340
Don't hug the wrong person again.

485
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,930
Who said I hugged the wrong person?

486
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,430
I had hugged the right person
since that day.

487
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,190
No matter what happens,

488
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,060
I swear I won't lose you again.

489
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,350
Wayu.

490
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,400
[Be my date]

491
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,550
Be my date.

492
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,020
Okay, P'Thanu.

493
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:21,840
Sorry about that, Phai.

494
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,600
Have you been waiting for a long time?

495
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,740
Not at all. Make your order.

496
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,340
Can I take your order?

497
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,260
One cup of latte.

498
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,300
He's one of our juniors.

499
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,260
I recognise his face.

500
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,130
Maybe he's just like us.

501
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,300
I guess he's doing his internship here
for his course.

502
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,040
He reminds me of the time
when we used to work here.

503
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
Yeah, he does.

504
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,290
If only we could return to the past
together with our friends.

505
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,390
Actually,

506
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,450
I was happy back then.

507
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,040
A lot of things had happened here.

508
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,920
I still remember your definition of love.

509
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,050
The "definitions of love" that
the customers kept in a bottle

510
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,400
made this shop famous.

511
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,250
You wanted to collect all those
definitions of love back then.

512
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,840
Did you make a summary out of them?

513
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,460
You still remember that?

514
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,130
They're gone.

515
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,060
In the past,

516
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,440
the love which I used to know

517
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,550
had hurt a lot of people.

518
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,860
It had made me understand

519
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,780
that I need to reflect upon
the past constantly.

520
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,970
When I look at the definitions of love
I had collected before,

521
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,570
actually, I could come up
with a definition for it myself.

522
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,940
I think

523
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,490
everyone has a
different definition of love.

524
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,060
When time passes and
when we experience changes in life,

525
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,560
our definition of love might change too.

526
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,860
But some people

527
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,420
will still believe in
their definition of love

528
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,270
and never change.

529
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,830
If so, do you believe in fate or destiny?

530
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,850
No matter if it's fate or destiny,

531
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,400
I'll hold on to the answer for now.

532
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,320
Eat up.

533
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,710
It tastes just as good as before.

534
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,360
This isn't the rainy season.

535
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,380
But it rained suddenly
and we were drenched.

536
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,430
That's why people

537
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,640
say life is unpredictable.

538
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,170
We just need to prepare ourselves

539
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,400
for the things that might happen.

540
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,580
That's all.

541
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,250
Just like

542
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,990
how we got drenched
and embraced the coldness,

543
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:45,610
am I right?

544
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,380
I guess so.

545
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,110
Do you want to change your shirt

546
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,260
and wipe yourself dry?

547
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,170
You'll fall sick if you go out wet.

548
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,120
Okay.

549
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,230
Come in then.

550
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,430
It's so cold.

551
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,740
Here you go. A towel.

552
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,620
What should I do? I'm completely drenched.

553
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,050
Come.

554
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,780
I didn't notice it,
but it started raining again.

555
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,590
I'm afraid I have to spend the night here

556
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,110
to avoid the rain.

557

[Three Years Later]

558
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,280
[Congratulations]

559
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,600
Thank you.

560
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,200
Thank you.

561
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,250
Thank you.

562
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,870
Ta-da!

563
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,610
Why were you so late?

564
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,030
Didn't you say you would be here
first thing in the morning?

565
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,890
I had to head to the office.

566
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,700
I was thinking of skipping work
as I thought I couldn't make it in time.

567
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,940
Congratulations, P'Kit.

568
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,090
No.

569
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,570
I should call you Dr. Kit now, right?

570
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:47,830
Doctor.

571
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,170
Doctor.

572
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,880
Can you hold another one?

573
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,740
You look dashing today.

574
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,390
I look ordinary.

575
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:59,820
Let's take a picture together.

576

Take a picture for us.

578
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,450
P'Kit, let's take a picture together.

579
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,460
Come on.

580
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,140
Hello.

581
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,070
Hello, P'Kit.

582
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,340
Hello, P'Mark.

583
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,130
Smile brightly.

584
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,530
-Smile brightly.
-Come on, smile for us.

585
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,480
Tong.

586
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,150
Hello.

587
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,880
Congratulations, everyone.

588
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,350
I'm the only one who hasn't graduated yet.

589
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,940
Fine.

590
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,720
All of us will attend
your graduation ceremony

591
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,620
when you graduate, okay?

592
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,870
Is that a promise?

593
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,680
Yeah.

594
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,440
Come and take a picture with us.

595
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,040

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,880
Come and take a picture with us.

598
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,630

00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

601
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,780
Thank you.

602
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,720
Let's take a picture together. Hurry.

603
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,270
-Smile brightly.
-Let's say "We graduated" together.

604
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,330
Say "We graduated".

605
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:55,740
Okay.

606
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,630
Everyone, say "We graduated".

607
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,230
Do the count.

608
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,990
One, two, three.

609
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,450
We graduated!

610
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,380
We graduated!

611
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,430
Someone is staring at us.

612
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,420
This is fun.

613
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,540
Congratulations, P'Thanu.

614
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,400
And this. It's a small bear.

615
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,070
Oh.

616
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,630
You even prepared this for me?

617
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,150
Thank you.

618
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,620
Thanu, we're here.

619
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,680
Hey, friend.

620
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,720
Congratulations, my friend.

621
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,630
Congratulations.

622
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,760
This is from Padbok.

623
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,950
He has to work today.
He's too busy to be here.

624
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:43,550
Let's take a picture together.

625
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,030
I need to show him that
you've received his flowers.

626
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,430
Come.

627
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,550
Come.

628
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,260
Get ready. One, two...

629
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,210
One, two...

630
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,450
I think you need to edit it.

631
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,600
The lighting isn't too great.

632
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:04,790
P'Jack.

633
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,350
Is this for me?

634
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,070
I found this on the ground.

635
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,740
I want you to dispose of it for me.

636
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:18,880
You can dispose of it over there.
There's the rubbish bin.

637
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,490
Do you want it or not?

638
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,130
Of course I do.

639
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,090
Thank you.

640
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,040
Pee, let's take a picture together.

641
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,830
My phone is stuck in my pocket.

642
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:35,850
Can we use yours?

643
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,960
It's inside my robe.

644
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,900
Here you go.

645
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,370
Done.

646
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,710
Remember to send it to me.

647
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,090
P'Jack.

648
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:56,910
Hmm?

649
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,060
Is the flower the only thing
you prepared for me?

650
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,850
Where's my graduation gift?

651
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,060
What do you want?

652
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,670
Hmm.

653
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,200
Can I get a kiss?

654
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,810
What are you doing?

655
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:18,860
Here you go.

656
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,740
What is it?

657
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
It's your gift.

658
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,750
What is this?

659
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,660
Is this my gift?

660
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,730
There are a lot of people here, you know?

661
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,820
I'll take it off if it doesn't look good.

662
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,480
You look pretty cute.

663
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,070
Is that so?

664
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,350
Which camera?

665
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,650
-Which camera?
-Are you guys ready?

666
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,630
This camera.

667
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,130
Okay.

668
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,870
Okay, get ready.

669
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

670
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,860
Yeah!

671
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:03,020
♫ I don't know what made me fall in love ♫

672
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,630
♫ I don't know why,
but my heart is shaking ♫

673
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,010
♫ Even though I saw your silhouette ♫

674
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,480
One, two, three.

675
