[1st March, announcement of
scholarship name list]

3
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,269
Mark, let's look forward
to the result together.

4
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,990
No matter what the result is,

5
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,590
I will make sure you won't let go of me.

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,930
Understood?

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,229
The bow and the wind?

8
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,759
Do you know

9
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,880
what the wind means to the bow?

10
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,910
Without the wind to carry the arrows,

11
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,979
the arrows might head
towards the wrong direction.

12
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,550
Now, I belong to you.

13
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,980
It's...

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,140
You see,

15
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,510
can I spend the night
in your room tonight?

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,890
What did you say?

17
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,329
So,

18
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,150
can I spend the night
in your room tonight?

19
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,410
The bed light in my room keeps flickering.

20
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,800
I heard the lizards as well.

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,829
They're very loud. I'm scared.

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,770
Of course.

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,800
You can spend the night
in my room tonight.

24
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,770
Thank you.

25
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,720
Come in then.

26
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,680
You can sleep on the bed.
I'll sleep on the sofa.

27
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,250
Thank you.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,570
Do you need anything, Wayu?

29
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,150
I'm fine.

30
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
Are you cold, Wayu?

31
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,930
You can use the blanket then.
Don't worry about me.

32
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,420
Aren't you cold?

33
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,440
It's fine. I can stand the cold.

34
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,470
Do you wish to sleep on the same bed?

35
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,950
Come, P'Thanu.

36
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,270
If we want to stand the cold together,

37
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,450
we should share the warmth together too.

38
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,720
-Okay then.
-Come.

39
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,620
I don't stay still when I sleep.

40
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm afraid I might interrupt your sleep.

41
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,380
Let me use the pillow as a barrier.

42
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't stay still when I sleep too.

43
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,710
I wonder if this tiny pillow

44
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,600
can hold me off?

45
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,120
Good night.

46
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,100
Good night, P'Thanu.

47
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,050
[Hello, P'Kit?]

48
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,960
[Sorry about that.
I just finished my project.]

49
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,659
It's fine. I can wait for you.

50
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,000
Have you finished your homework?

51
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,640
I have.

52
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,700
[The other faculties were already done
with their mid-semester exams,]

53
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,470
yet, the Faculty of Engineering spent
an entire year to complete their project.

54
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,350
The Faculty of Medicine has
a never-ending supply of exams as well.

55
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
I always see you with a book.

56
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,410
Mark,

57
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,060
there's one more week before
the result will be announced.

58
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,790
I remember that.

59
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,930
I cross out the date
day by day with a pen.

60
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,230
I've already used up two pens
by just doing so.

61
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,530
[You exaggerate everything
just like usual.]

62
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,890
Besides exaggerating facts,

63
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm very loyal in love as well.

64
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah, Mark. You're the best.

65
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,790
Should we view

66
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,330
the result together
on the day of its announcement?

67
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,780
Okay.

68
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,230
No matter what the result is,

69
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,570
at least we'll be together on that day.

70
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,190
That's right, P'Kit.

71
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,660
[P'Kit, you should go to sleep now.]

72
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,930
It's very late.

73
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,910
Yeah, I feel sleepy too.

74
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,360
Good night, P'Kit.

75
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:17,750
Good night.

76
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,600
[Wait, P'Kit.]

77
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,340
What's wrong?

78
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,410
Can you keep the camera on tonight?

79
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,000
Fine. But you aren't allowed to
let your imagination run wild.

80
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,780
Oh, P'Kit.

81
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,530
What kind of person do you think I am?

82
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,950
You're that type of person.

83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,910
[P'Kit, what are you wearing?]

84
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,660
Where did you place your hand?

85
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,020
Mark, be serious.

86
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,870
Who did you chat with on the phone

87
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,410
when I wasn't around?

88
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,520
[Hey, P'Kit,]

89
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,800
[I was just joking.]

90
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,390
[Are you jealous?]

91
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,540
Let's stop chatting. I need to sleep now.

92
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,450
Good night, P'Kit.

93
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,480
P'Kit, don't sleep
with your back facing me.

94
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
Turn over.

95
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,780
[P'Kit!]

96
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,860
How could I sleep

97
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,700
when you're doing this?

98
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,120
Hello, Mark?

99
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,040
What's the matter?

100
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,280
[Hey.]

101
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,740
[You rarely contacted me]

102
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,190
[after you went on a trip with P'Thanu.]

103
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,280
Why did you call me
this early in the morning?

104
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,420
[I was worried about you.
I didn't see you for some time.]

105
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm isolating myself from the world
as I'm on a relaxing trip.

106
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,500
[Fine, you can isolate
yourself from the world.]

107
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,660
[But you shouldn't isolate yourself
from your friends too.]

108
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,220
[By the way, I dreamt of you last night.]

109
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,490
[I dreamt that you were
pestered by a snake.]

110
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,110
Is that so? That's a strange dream.

111
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,050
[By the way, is P'Thanu awake yet?]

112
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,560
How should I know?

113
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,730
He's in his own room.

114
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,750
[Oh, are you guys
sleeping in different rooms?]

115
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,790
Let's cut it short. I'm still sleepy.

116
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,870
I need to continue my sleep.

117
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,700
[Wait, whose sound was that?]

118
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,290
What sound? There's no sound.

119
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,190
Why would there be a sound here?

120
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,250
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

121
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,350
[Wait, Wayu!]

122
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,390
He actually dreamt of that?

123
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,500
But the difference is

124
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,010
that a person is beside me
instead of a snake.

125
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,040
P'Thanu.

126
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,230
Are you sure you slept alone last night?

127
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,350
If so, who was the person
sleeping beside me last night?

128
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,830
Do you want me to tell him that
I was sleeping beside you then?

129
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,220
The entire school will know about it
in a matter of seconds.

130
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,090
Didn't you say you were sleepy?

131
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,750
I don't want to wake up yet.

132
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,640
Come, let's continue our sleep.

133
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,450
You're such a lazy bum. Time to wake up.

134
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,250
You'll get a headache
if you sleep too much.

135
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,990
Go and take a shower.

136
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,700
If you're not willing to wake up,

137
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,420
I'll carry you to the bathroom
and take a shower with you.

138
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,060
Let's go.

139
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,460
My salmon rice bowl is finally here.

140
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,890
Mine was here long ago.

141
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,590
[It's like we're having a meal
at the same restaurant.]

142
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,960
It's been a long time since
we visited that restaurant.

143
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,040
It was the restaurant
where I first kissed you on the cheek.

144
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,740
[Hey.]

145
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,730
[You do remember
those incidents clearly, huh?]

146
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,150
We'll be in different time zones
when you go to the US in the future.

147
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,350
We might not be able to
have our meals together like this.

148
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,110
Yeah.

149
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,580
But as long as I know that
you're having your meals on time

150
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,330
and enough sleep, I'll be happy.

151
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,540
If you're leading a happy
and satisfying life over there,

152
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,060
I'll be satisfied.

153
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,270
Me too, Mark.

154
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,510
Come, let me feed you.

155
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,380
Let's do it.

156
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,490
Ah.

157
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:23,870
[Oh.]

158
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,200
[Just you wait.]

159
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,700
[You want to tease me like this?]

160
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,490
P'Kit.

161
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,920
Come, let's dig in.

162
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,670
Did you have fun?

163
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,530
I did.

164
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,190
Let's go on another trip in the future.

165
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,140
Sure.

166
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,360
Thank you for bringing me on a trip.

167
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,040
It was relaxing.

168
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,250
I want to thank you too.

169
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,150
Thank you for joining me on my trip.

170
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,570
I've been looking forward to
our Chiangmai trip

171
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,190
since today.

172
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,890
Did you pick up Mark's bad habit from him?

173
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,590
I'll return first.

174
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,400
I'll fetch you to class tomorrow.

175
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,820
I'll head inside first. Goodbye.

176
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,640
Focus on the class, okay?

177
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,440
Okay.

178
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
I'll pick you up in the evening.

179
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,170
Okay.

180
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,220
Thank you for sending me to my class.

181
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,470
See you.

182
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,850
Hello.

183
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,720
Hello, N'Wayu.

184
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,110
Are you having lunch alone today?

185
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,490
What's the matter? Why are you smiling?

186
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,610
Hey.

187
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,890
Everyone in the school
is talking about it.

188
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,780
Your relationship with P'Thanu
is so sweet

189
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,500
that you've attracted
a nest of ants to the school.

190
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,000
You're exaggerating it.

191
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,710
Hey, which progress have you guys reached?

192
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,880
Why didn't you tell
your good friend, Mark, about it?

193
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,970
It's progressing naturally.
There's nothing special about it.

194
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,470
Oh.

195
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,230
Don't lie to me. I know what happened.

196
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,740
You two slept in the same room
during your trip.

197
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,360
Mark, lower your voice!

198
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,990
Did something else happen?

199
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,820
Don't act like that.

200
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,170
Mark.

201
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,370
Hello.

202
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,130
Here you go.

203
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,500
My goodness!

204
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,290
P'Thanu, how did you know

205
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,080
that rice with stir-fried pork and
minced garlic is my favourite?

206
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,910
Mark, P'Thanu bought it for me.

207
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,470
Thank you, P'Thanu.

208
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,020
My blood sugar level has gone
through the roof because of you, friend.

209
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,640
I think I should leave first.
I'm so envious and jealous of you.

210
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,430
And, I'm afraid
I'll get diabetes from this.

211
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,310
I'll hit you with my spoon.

212
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,460
I'll make a move now. Goodbye.

213
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,410
He was so funny.

214
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,920
Let's dig in.

215
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,520
Have you stretched your legs?

216
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:52,540
[Pok: I wish to apologise to you.]
[Pok: ......]

217
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:59,470
[Pok: I will train hard and be selected
for the national swimming competition.]

218
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,450
[Read]

219
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,760
Pok, come and get ready.

220
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,490
-Coming, Coach.
-Hurry up.

221
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,020
Stop skiving! Hurry up!

222
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,580
Hurry!

223
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,280
Hurry!

224
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,930
Be serious!

225
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,600
Over here, it's like this.

226
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,300
Everyone, we're here.

227
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,490
Have you guys been
waiting for a long time?

228
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,720
We're here.

229
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,640
Replenish your energy with these.

230
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,950
Thank you.

231
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,760
Thank you, P'Wayu.

232
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,680
Thank you for tutoring us.

233
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,670
Do you guys know something?

234
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,000
Next week, they'll be holding
the "Cold Moon Warm Star" event.

235
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,730
It's the school's annual music festival,

236
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,170
right?

237
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,650
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,770
Let me say this first.

239
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,110
I won't miss out on this event
no matter what.

240
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,590
Last year,

241
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,290
P'Mark and P'Wayu sang on stage.

242
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,370
Is that so?

243
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,340
That's right.

244
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,200
P'Mark dedicated a song to P'Kit,

245
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,540
and P'Wayu dedicated a song to P'Thanu.

246
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,270
They were so sweet!

247
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,790
Yeah, right?

248
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,390
Sab.

249
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,620
Will you sing on stage this year?

250
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,830
I think it'll be 100 times sweeter
than last year's performance.

251
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,480
Yeah.

252
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,220
Please sing on stage this year, P'Wayu.

253
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,860
Let everyone there experience

254
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,980
the warmness of love once again.

255
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:18,980
He's right.

256
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,660
That's a great idea, P'Wayu.

257
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,800
Let's make this a surprise.

258
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,190
P'Thanu should only know
about this at the very last second.

259
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,230
A surprise?

260
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,780
What kind of surprise?

261
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,660
You heard wrongly, P'Thanu.

262
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,820
We were talking about lemongrass.

263
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,880
We want to get rid of the mosquitoes
by using lemongrass,

264
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,940
am I right?

265
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,400
That's right.

266
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,420
We'll get rid of the mosquitoes
by using lemongrass.

267
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,130
Let's go, P'Thanu.

268
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,900
We'll be stuck in the traffic
if we depart later.

269
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,180
See you guys.

270
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,740
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

271
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,370
-Goodbye, P'Thanu.
-Goodbye.

272
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,070
See you.

273
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,260
Goodbye, P'Wayu.

274
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,020
Goodbye.

275
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:04,890
Let's go.

276
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,130
Lemongrass?

277
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,510
He almost found out.

278
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,660
We were lucky just now.

279
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,390
The surprise was almost ruined.

280
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,000
What should we do then?

281
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,950
What should we do?

282
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,880
[Hey, P'Kit.]

283
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,460
Sorry about that. My class finished late.

284
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,110
It's fine. Have you eaten?

285
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,180
[Not yet. I plan to
call for food delivery.]

286
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,870
[Have you eaten?]

287
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,400
I have.

288
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,010
By the way, P'Kit.

289
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,600
Have you heard about this year's
"Cold Moon Warm Star" event?

290
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,080
They said they would hold it
earlier than usual this year.

291
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,440
Yeah, I've heard about it.

292
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,890
They will hold it on the same day
as the scholarship result announcement.

293
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,430
That's right.

294
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,440
If that's the case,
we can't attend the event.

295
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,380
I can wait for the result myself.

296
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,650
You can attend the event.

297
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,530
No way. We promised that
we would view the result together.

298
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,950
If so, let's follow
the original plan then.

299
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,880
[P'Kit,]

300
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,380
do you still remember
what song I sang for you

301
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,940
during last year's event?

302
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,350
Stars.

303
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,360
The song's name was "Stars".

304
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,140
I still remember it.

305
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,450
-[P'Kit.]
-Hmm?

306
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,370
Since we won't be able

307
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,840
to attend this year's
"Cold Moon Warm Star" event,

308
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,470
why don't you sing for me?

309
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,640
[Please?]

310
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,430
[Come on, P'Kit.]

311
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,760
[Let's celebrate the event in advance.]

312
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,980
Any song is fine.

313
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,910
Please?

314
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,050
You need to promise me
that you won't record this.

315
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,130
I promise.

316
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,450
Why don't you sing this song?
I know that you know this song.

317
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,210
♫ I will take care of you forever ♫

318
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:48,260
♫ I will stay by your side
no matter where you are ♫

319
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,980
♫ I will stay with you until the end ♫

320
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,730
♫ Please trust me ♫

321
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:06,350
♫ I promise I will only love you alone ♫

322
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:13,410
♫ Because time cannot change my mind ♫

323
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,310
♫ You don't need to be afraid ♫

324
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:22,760
♫ We will spend the rest
of our lives together ♫

325
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,420
♫ I will take care of you forever ♫

326
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,480
♫ I will stay by your side
no matter where you are ♫

327
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,110
♫ I will stay with you until the end ♫

328
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:48,890
♫ Please trust me ♫

welcome to our annual
"Cold Moon Warm Star" event.

353
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,880
That's right. I feel as if
the event was just held not long ago.

358
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,940
let us welcome our principal,

Dr. Tanawaak Phrumvichai,

360

Our school's "Cold Moon Warm Star" event

is held on the same date every year.

366

It's because we believe

367
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,470
that an auditory feast
filled with wonderful songs

368

can express one's emotions

let's try to open our ears and hearts

I came up here and
sang a song for someone.

Let me ask you this.

477
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,870
Why would you
be together with a guy like him?

478

Don't tell me he hasn't
shown you his true colours yet?

You didn't even clean up your room.

493
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,600
Did you stop watching it

494
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,670
ever since I moved out of your room?

495
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,240
Only by doing so

496
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,540
will you know that
everything is still the same.

497
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,290
I was just waiting for your return.

498
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,730
I can't breathe.

499
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,690
You can't breathe?

500
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,030
I'll do CPR for you then.

501
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,740
I'll do mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation for you.

502
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,320
Who gave you permission to kiss me?

503
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,080
If you do get the scholarship,

504
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,300
our physical distance might grow.

505
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,580
But I will work hard and
do my best to head there too.

506
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,550
You don't need to worry.

507
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,470
I won't let you be lonely for long.

508
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:41,740
Mark,

509
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,490
no matter what the result is,

510
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,690
there's one thing
I wish to tell you for a long time.

511
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,670
During the period when we were separated,

512
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,000
I've learned a lot of things.

513
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,180
It made me realised

514
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,180
that I didn't want to lead a happy life
without you by my side.

515
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,100
You don't know

516
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,420
how important you are to me.

517
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,940
Can't you tell?

518
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,850
I was never happy

519
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,240
when you weren't by my side.

520
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,900
No matter what the result is,
I've made up my mind.

521
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,080
We will never be apart again.

522
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,500
Because we had promised each other

523
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,470
that we would stay together forever.

524
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,170
Let's keep the promise we had made.

525
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,940
Hey.

526
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,550
What?

527
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,720
[Account, password]

528
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,040
It's almost time. Are you ready?

529
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,070
I'm ready.

530
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:39,430
P'Kit.

531
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,140
What's the result?

532
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,840
Just tell me already.

533
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,200
I'm so nervous.

534
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,960
P'Kit.

535
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,270
I didn't get the scholarship.

536
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,420
What?

537
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,860
It said I didn't pass.

538
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,930
I didn't get the scholarship.

539
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,780
Aren't you sad then?

540
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,240
Look at me. I'm so sad.

541
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:19,680
Didn't you see?

542
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,790
P'Kit,

543
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,070
that was so fake.

544
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,370
Who told me to apply
for this stupid scholarship?

545
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,670
Who was the one who said
he wanted to get the scholarship?

546
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,210
I just didn't want to hold you back.

547
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,980
Were you worried?

548
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:48,650
Do you know

549
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,150
that this is a stupid plan?

550
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,320
Do you know how much this stupid plan
had caused me to miss you?

551
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,280
I missed you even more.

552
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,240
I'm going to become the pirate king!

553
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,630
Hmm.

554
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,320
The TV is so far away now.

555
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,210
Look, this is Charlotte Linlin.

556
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,510
Look, Luffy's eyes are gigantic.

557
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,280
Look at my eyes.

558
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,700
Are my eyes as huge as Luffy's?

559
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,830
P'Kit,

560
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:39,540
do you wish to do it here?
Or do you wish to do it on the bed?

561
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,290
Aren't you stating the obvious?

562
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,720
Finally,

563
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,980
you long for me as much as I long for you.

564
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,750
Do you love me?

565
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,110
I do.

566
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,220
And I love you very much.

567
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,490
I love you too.

568
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,510
Don't hug the wrong person again.

569
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,920
Who said I hugged the wrong person?

570
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,340
♫ I don't know what made me fall in love ♫

571
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,170
I had hugged the right person
since that day.

572
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,190
Why did you do so?

573
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,090
♫ I don't know why,
but my heart is shaking ♫

574
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,470
What are you thinking?

575
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,380
♫ Even though I saw your silhouette ♫

576
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:44,910
♫ I couldn't see clearly who was
walking towards me ♫

577
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,140
I'm afraid I have to spend the night here

578
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,910
to avoid the rain.

579
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,900
♫ The only thing I know ♫

580
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,440
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

581
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,940
♫ Just like that ♫

582
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,860
♫ Because it's you ♫

583
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,070
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

584
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,330
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

585
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,800
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

586
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,270
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

587
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:10,230
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

588
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,470
♫ I feel happy ♫

589
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,720
♫ When I can see you ♫

590
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,600
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

591
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,040
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

592
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,780
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

593
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,040
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

594
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,280
♫ I don't know why ♫

595
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,500
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

596
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,710
♫ Just let it be ♫

597
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,290
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

598
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:00,290
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

599
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,940
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

600
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,990
♫ It was an accident ♫

601
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:07,180
♫ The closer I am to you ♫

602
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,830
♫ The closer I can see your eyes ♫
