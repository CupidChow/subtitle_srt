to live on happily.

14

Pa's departure has taught us many things.

Only then, we won't have any regrets.

It's because we have
lived every day to the fullest.

That's a good idea.

35

Wait, Tong!

178
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,760
I have a training to attend.
I need to attend the national qualifiers.

179

Can you please speak to me?

182
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,340
I have told you everything I need to.

have mookata with us tonight?]

What are you looking for?

187
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,180
I'm thinking about

the things I need to prepare for our trip.

189
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,050
I'm afraid I might forget something.

190
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,550
I was wondering what
you were worried about.

191
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,060
So, you're just as excited as a kid
because we're going on a trip,

192
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,560
right?

193
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,540
If you forgot to bring something,

194
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,820
I can take you out to buy it.

195
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,730
We're just going on a one-day trip.

196
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,680
P'Thanu,

197
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,690
do you have a favourite colour?

198
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,900
Sky blue.

199
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,910
But, I like pink too.

200
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,900
Green is pretty good as well.

201
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
Just choose one colour.

202
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,260
If you mean the colour
I prefer on someone else,

203
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll choose pink.

204
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,460
But, if it's for myself,

205
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,470
whatever colour is fine.

206
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,230
Okay.

207
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,830
Mark,

208
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,230
I thought the mid-semester exam was over.

209
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,460
Why are you still studying?

210
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,700
This is unlike you at all.

211
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,440
[Huh?]

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,480

Oh, P'Kit.

216
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,130
I'm trying my best to learn English.

217
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,680
But why?

218
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,130
Are you going to retake
your English subject?

219
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,620
I'm searching for information
regarding universities in the US.

220
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,910
I've checked quite a few of them.

221
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,830
I want you to help me choose one.

223
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,220
I will study hard and focus

to do well in the exams,

225
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,090
and apply for scholarships

226

so that I can join you in the US.

227

[But, it's fine even if]

228

[I don't get the scholarships.]

229

[I've asked my family members about this.]

230

They're very supportive of me.

231
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,710
They're fully supportive of me

232
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,370
when it comes to my study,

233
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,860
as long as there's a university
that's willing to accept me.

234
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,330
Speaking of which,
which city are you heading to?

235

We can talk about that
after the result is out.

236

I'm sure it's no problem

for an exceptional student like you.

238
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,980
As for me, I need to
start preparing it right now.

239
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,870
If not, you'll be lonely

240

241
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,880
You'd better not to skive.

242
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm serious about this, P'Kit.

243
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,450
You can do it.

244
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,480
I will do my best.

245
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,330
I promise.

246
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,460
Work hard, okay?

247
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,460
I'm happy that you came, Tong.

248
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,070
I hope you can relax together
with your friends.

249
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,350
Have you spoken to Pok lately?

250
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,830
Do you plan to let
this situation continue?

251
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,910
Why don't you try to
clarify things with him?

252
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,840
It's really strange, Pai.

253
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,030
I thought I had already
done my best for him.

254
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,240
But to him, it's never good enough.

255
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,100
He never appreciates my kind intentions.

256
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,530
Your kind intentions
will only be meaningful

257
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
at the right time, right place,

258
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,090
and when you do the right thing, Tong.

259
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,030
Sometimes, we think to ourselves

260
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,770
that he might want this or that.

261
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,810
But, we never asked him for
his opinions or feelings regarding it.

262
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,020
Am I right, Tong?

263
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,450
We can become a part of each other,

264
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,010
but we also need to respect
the part that belongs to him.

265
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,230
Indeed.

266
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,360
I always used
my kind intentions as excuses

267
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,540
to arrange Pok's life for him.

268
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,510
I understand why you're angry at him.

269
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,990
And I understand why he's angry at you.

270
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,920
But I think

271
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,840
you guys should stop this.

272
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,920
Try giving yourself a chance

273
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,570
and speak to your inner self.

274
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
As for other things,
we'll see how it goes.

All of the meat is on his plate.

279

Pass it to me.

00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,220
Yes?

339
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,080
The bow and the wind?

340
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,380
It's just like me and you.

341
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,610
Do you know

342
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,950
what the wind means to the bow?

343
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,320
What does it mean?

344
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,650
Without the wind to carry the arrows,

345
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,720
the arrows might head
towards the wrong direction.

346
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,300
Now, I belong to you.

347
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,760
We will take care of each other
and accompany each other.

348
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,710
Just like how a bow
cannot function without the wind.

349
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,110
♫ I can't afford to lose you ♫

350
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,190
Do you like it?

351
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,690
The bow and the wind.

352
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,580
I finally understand the meaning now.

353
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,510
Even if we're apart from one another,

354
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,250
no matter what,

355
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,750
the wind will take me back to your side.

356
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,400
Thank you for being the wind to my bow.

357
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,380
From now on,

358
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,020
we will move forward together.

359
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,900
Is it nice?

360
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,160
There are some people over there.

361
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,170
One, two, three.

362
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,980
One, two, three.

363
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,190
How's my hair?

364
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,460
P'Thanu!

365
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,280
Take this!

366
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,360
Take this!

367
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,510
No!

368
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,480
I admit defeat!

369
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,590
-Do you admit defeat?
-I do.

370
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,590
I admit defeat, P'Thanu!

371
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,390
I admit defeat!

372
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,680
I don't feel like eating
when someone is staring at me.

373
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,050
Fine. I won't stare at you then.

374
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,580
Hello?

375
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,370
There's a parcel for me?

376
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay, I'll head downstairs immediately.

377
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,180
I'll be back in a second, Mark.

378
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:52,770
[Okay.]

379
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,380
Hello.

380
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,640
Please sign here.

381
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,540
Thank you.

382
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,120
Wait, this is Mark's name.

383
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,610
What did you send to me, Mark?

384
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,800
[Surprise!]

385
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,620
What is this?

386
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,990
It's a scarf, Pee.

387
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,120
[I made this myself.]

388
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,620
[It's made by yours truly.]

389
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,960
It's the one and only one in the world.

390
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,080
You can't get it from anywhere else.

391
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,390
Do you like it?

392
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,970
Hmm, I don't.

393
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,700
Oh, but why?

394
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,640
[Just look at it.]

395
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,850
[Do you really want me to wear it?]

396
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,050
I know.

397
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,170
It may not look good,

398
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,670
but I did put in a lot
of effort in making it.

399
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,040
I'll make another one for you

400
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,490
when my skills have improved.

401
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,540
Thank you, Mark.

402
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,860
Although it's not perfect,

403
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,010
you had put in a lot of effort
to try and make it perfect.

404
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,210
It's just like our relationship.

405
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,660
Thank you for always working hard
for our relationship.

406
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,820
My effort doesn't matter at all.

407
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,550
I feel happy whenever I do something

408
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,320
for you.

409
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,310
[Only by doing so will I not]

410
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,800
[regret my actions for not doing
enough for you when I look back on it.]

411
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,310
That way, I don't need to wish
for the power to reverse time

412
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,290
and change the past.

413
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,790
I think I have a parcel.
I'll be back in a second.

414
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,190
I think it's the skateboard I had bought.

415
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,300
Hello.

416
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,950
Did you send this to me?

417
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,690
What did you send?
You're trying to seduce me again.

418
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,460
It's a surprise as well.

419
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,240
Did you make this yourself?

420
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,720
Yeah. Do you like it?

421
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,240
I made it according to
the online instructions.

422
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,280
I like it.

423
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,040
Thank you, P'Kit.

424
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:12,580
Look.

425
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,210
I have one too.

426
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,470
[Markit.]

427
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,230
P'Kit.

428
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,910
Did you misspell our names?

429
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,150
It's missing one K.

430
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,240
It's correct.

431
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,390
Because from now on,

432
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,830
both of us will use this name together.

433
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,420
We have the same name now.

434
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,090
If we're separated,

435
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,350
you wouldn't be Mark,
and I wouldn't be Kit again.

436
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,950
I'll wear it then.

437
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:01,870
[Markit]

438
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,630
I once thought about

439
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,750
holding a road trip without any plans.

440
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,830
I could go wherever I want to go.

441
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,460
I could go wherever I feel like going.

442
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,350
After that, I just need to
find a place to spend the night.

443
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,970
I think it should be pretty interesting.

444
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,190
So, was I included

445
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,420
in your plan?

446
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,430
I don't know how to drive.

447
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,560
I think you should be the driver.

448
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,990
So, to you,

449
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm just a driver?

450
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,400
No.

451
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,830
You're just like my guide.

452
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,030
With you around, I'll never be lost.

453
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,980
Why don't we do that on our next holiday?

454
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,100
Where should we start?

455
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:12,940
What about Chiang Mai?

456
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,060
We can take it slow

457
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,070
and enjoy the natural scenery
along the way.

458
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,640
I think it should be pretty interesting.

459
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,960
I think it should be fun.

460
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,880
Eh?

461
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,940
What's wrong, Wayu?

462
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,900
My necklace.

463
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,830
I'll go and look for it.

464
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,900
It's not here.

465
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,830
It's fine.

466
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,450
We'll look for it somewhere else.

467
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,410
We'll find it eventually,

468
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,000
okay?

469
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,260
Have you found it, P'Thanu?

470
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:51,650
I haven't.

471
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,180
Where did it go?

472
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,340
We still can't find it in the end.

473
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,540
I think I've lost it.

474
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,660
It's fine, Wayu.

475
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,030
I'm terrible.

476
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,190
I can't even protect my necklace.

477
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,410
To me,

478
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,290
the person we gave the gift to

479
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,450
is more important

480
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,470
than the gift itself.

481
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,760
Even though the gift is gone,

482
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,960
but I still remember

483
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,750
that I once gave it to you.

484
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,790
And, you remember

485
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,920
that you lost it once.

486
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,820
To me, that's enough.

487
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,080
It's better than you
forgetting about what happened

488
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,330
with the gift still around.

489
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,980
But, I still think that it's a pity.

490
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,420

491
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:50,950
Eh?

What are you doing?

Look, I'm drenched.

496

How will you get lost
when the wind is carrying you?

497
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:49,570
Just treat it

498
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,470
as if you were the one
who led me to the necklace.

when I haven't resolved
my personal issues yet.

507
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,460
What about the national
swimming competition?

508
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,730
How can I move forward

509
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,990
when my heart is still confused?

510
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,080
Tong, I'm sorry

511
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,660
for everything that
had happened in the past.

512
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,090
You're trying to blame me for the
national swimming competition again,

513
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:36,710
right?

514
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,010
Didn't you say you want to prove yourself?

515
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,860
Return to your training.

516
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,650
You must achieve your goal.

517
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,050
We can talk after you have been selected

518
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,850
for the national swimming competition.

519
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,590
Okay, I will surely be selected.

520
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,940
I'm not only doing this

521
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,550
for the national swimming competition.

522
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,700
I'm also doing this for you
to speak with me once again.

523
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,120
Do you need anything, Wayu?

524
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,530
Look,

525
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,400
the bedside lamp keeps flickering.

526
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,900
If I turn it off, I think I can't sleep.

527
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,760
I'm sure I can't sleep if I leave it on.

528
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,060
I'll ask someone to repair it for you.

529
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,050
P'Thanu,

530
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,200
I don't think anyone
will come at this hour.

531
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,320
Let me take a look then.

532
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,000
Maybe the wiring is just loose.

533
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,510
And,

534
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,880
I heard the lizards as well.

535
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,840
They're very loud. I'm scared.

536
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,710
I'll take a look. Are they on the balcony?

537
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,580
How about this?

538
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,200
I'll tell the management about it.

539
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,040
P'Thanu!

540
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,860
Look,

541
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,260
can I spend the night
in your room tonight?

542
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,370
P'Thanu.

543
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:58,660
P'Kit.

544
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:01,420
What did you write?

545
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,160
Please tell me!

546
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,480
I'm so nervous!

547
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,650
Last year,

548
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,590
I came up here and
sang a song for someone.

549
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:16,530
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

550
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,710
This year,

551
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,320
that person is still by my side.

552
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:21,240
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

553
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,490
♫ I feel happy ♫

554
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:25,710
♫ When I can see you ♫

555
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,650
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

556
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,070
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

557
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:35,800
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

558
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,560
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

559
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,270
♫ I don't know why ♫

560
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:43,500
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

561
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,740
♫ Just let it be ♫

562
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,490
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

563
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:11,250
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

564
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,960
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

565
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,990
♫ It was an accident ♫

566
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,880
♫ The closer I am to you ♫

567
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,430
♫ The closer I can see your eyes ♫

568
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,700
♫ The more satisfied I'll be ♫

569
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,770
♫ The only thing I know ♫

570
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,320
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

571
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,850
♫ Just like that ♫

572
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,750
♫ Because it's you ♫

573
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,870
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

574
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,210
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

575
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:40,840
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

576
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,140
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

577
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:50,050
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

578
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,390
♫ I feel happy ♫

579
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,610
♫ When I can see you ♫

580
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,470
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

581
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,920
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

582
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,670
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

583
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,930
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

584
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,180
♫ I don't know why ♫

585
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,430
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

586
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,610
♫ Just let it be ♫

587
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,600
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫
