1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,380
Honestly speaking, Kit,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,140
you shouldn't stay with me all the time.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,980
It's fine, since I'm very free.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,860
Today is your rest day.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,700
You should at least

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,460
spend some time with Mark.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,140
Now,

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,900
I'm afraid his heart is broken
from missing you too much.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,660
[Mark: P'Kit, I don't know
what's wrong with me.]

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,180
Oh.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,380
What's wrong with him again?

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,420
What?

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,980
Oh.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,500
Erm.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,420
It's nothing.

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,980
[Mark: I miss you so much suddenly.]

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,940
[Kit: You're so dramatic.]

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,020
You should go back and accompany Mark.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,500
You come to accompany me
after school every time.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Mark will be angry at me

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,820
for stealing you away.

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,660
We need to spend some time
with the people we love.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,100
Sometimes,

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,100
the most meaningful moments

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,539
might not be the most important moments.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,620
Instead, they are the ordinary days

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,380
we spend together with our loved ones.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,539
Kit.

30
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,100
Be my partner.

31
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,820
Hey.

32
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,340
Where did you bring me to?

33
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,140
It's that person you're thinking of.

34
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,420
Even though your name is Thanu,

35
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,810
you actually suck at archery?

36
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,500
Wayu.

37
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,530
Remember, when you draw the bow,

38
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,580
you need to draw it slowly.

39
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,820
Place your hand under your chin.

40
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,220
Pull the bowstring towards your nose.

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,020
Are you still angry at me?

42
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,450
Actually,

43
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,580
I should be the one asking that question.

44
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,020
I'm sorry, P'Thanu.

45
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,460
Even though

46
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,140
you had told me everything

47
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,540
and explained yourself to me,

48
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,100
I still didn't believe in you.

49
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,900
I was still worried about
the unknown future.

50
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,770
What else did I do wrong?

51
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,780
Why can't I hit the target?

52
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,900
Sometimes,

53
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,460
we're right in every step we take.

54
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,580
But oftentimes,

55
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,960
we will be influenced by factors
that are out of our control

56
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,020
and fail to hit the target.

57
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,260
Wayu, it's fine.

58
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,700
Let's try again.

59
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,130
If you hit the target this time,

60
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,220
let's begin a new relationship.

61
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,900
Try and get the feel.

62
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,100
Are you ready?

63
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,980
I am.

64
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,570
Let's begin a new relationship.

65
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,340
Okay, P'Thanu.

66
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,780
If you want to know why I was hurt,

67
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,660
you can ask Tongtrai yourself.

68
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
I'll leave first.

69
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:15,860
Wa!

70
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,300
Bleh!

71
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Mark?

72
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,100
What are you doing?

73
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
How old are you this year?

74
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,700
Two years old.

75
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,410
Hmm.

76
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,420
Two years old, huh?

77
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,620
Hmm?

78
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Why are you here?

79
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,340
This.

80
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,460
You forgot your wallet.

81
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,820
That's why I brought it here for you.

82
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,700
I was planning to take it and visit Pa
after this.

83
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,970
Thanks.

84
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,620
P'Kit,

85
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,970
you're so forgetful.

86
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,340
You haven't eaten, right?

87
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,820
Great.

88
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,700
I brought you some food.

89
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,100
Thanks.

90
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,410
All of them are delicious.

91
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,220
P'Kit,

92
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,060
I'll leave first.

93
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,220
I have a test to take before the lesson.

94
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,740
Can we kiss

95
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,180
in the classroom?

96
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,340
Hmm?

97
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,220
No.

98
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,580
If so,

99
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,100
let me kiss you like this.

100
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,700
Hmm!

101
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,340
Go now.

102
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,060
Go and attend your lesson.

103
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,500
See you.

104
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Eat up, okay?

105
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,340
Don't forget to eat, P'Kit.

106
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay.

107
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,740
Goodbye.

108
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,220
Okay.

109
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,340
So, just like what we had thought,

110
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Sandee was the one
who pretended to be P'Pa.

111
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
I don't know what to do

112
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,060
to stop him from meddling with
P'Thanu's and P'Wayu's relationship.

113
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,820
So,

114
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,980
P'Sansab, why is Sandee doing this?

115
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,180
Who knows?

116
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,180
He didn't tell me why.

117
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,970
Luckily,

118
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,740
Tong had exposed Sandee's plan.

119
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,220
If not,

120
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,930
who knows what he will resort to?

121
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
It was just a coincidence.

122
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,100
Many things happened at the same time.

123
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,180
And, all of them are related to Sandee.

124
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,860
That's why I associated them together.

125
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,100
You and Sandee didn't get along

126
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,580
even when we were in high school.

127
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,100
Even until now,

128
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
we don't know what had happened
between you two.

129
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,340
It's nothing.

130
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,970
It's all in the past now.

131
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,220
Just forget about it.

132
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,740
Okay.

133
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,460
Later,

134
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,980
you guys can have lunch without me.

135
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,810
You guys don't need to wait for me.

136
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,500
I have something else to do.

137
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,820
What is it?

138
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,420
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

139
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,220
Must I tell you everything I do?

140
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,190
You don't need to know

141
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
since it has nothing to do with you.

142
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,220
Tong, how could you speak in that manner?

143
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,870
So, will you stop telling me

144
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,750
what you will do in the future?

145
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,580
What?

146
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,060
Are you upset?

147
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,190
Do you want to find someone else
to beat me up again?

148
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,330
Where are you going?

149
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,060
This conversation isn't over yet.

150
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,860
Pok!

151
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,860
Do you still bear a grudge
over what happened on that day?

152
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,620
It's been so long.

153
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,620
I just want to know
why he did so back then.

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,860
I couldn't attend the competition
because of him.

155
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,460
Sit down for now.

156
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,860
I have suspected

157
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,450
something for a long time.

158
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,740
What did you suspect?

159
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,100
But

160
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,940
maybe, I misunderstood the situation.

161
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,540
Sandee has been

162
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,860
chatting with Tong lately.

163
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,580
But I don't know

164
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,820
if that is connected to this matter.

165
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,940
This matter?

166
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,580
What matter do you mean?

167
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,220
You must calm down after hearing this.

168
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,820
I think

169
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,210
Sandee is threatening Tong.

170
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,620
He's threatening him?

171
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,420
What do you mean?

172
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,700
I don't know the ins and outs as well.

173
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,100
But I think

174
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,460
all of this

175
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,460
are related to you.

176
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Long time no see,

177
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,340
Tong.

178
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,340
Pok.

179
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,820
Hey!

180
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,220
Pok!

181
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,940
Pok!

182
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,980
Sandee.

183
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,700
What's wrong?

184
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,220
Let's hurry!

185
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,740
Sandee!

186
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,220
What did you use to threaten Tong?

187
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,300
Hurry and tell me!

188
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,860
You knew that Tong hired some thugs
to beat me up, right?

189
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
What are you up to?

190
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,580
Yeah.

191
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,100
I know that.

192
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,460
Be honest with me!

193
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,700
What exactly happened?

194
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,100
Are you sure you can accept the truth
after I tell you?

195
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,180
Just tell me!

196
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,860
I can only say this.

197
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,420
Actually,

198
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,460
Tong wasn't the mastermind
behind the incident.

199
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,980
I didn't tell them to be harsh on you.

200
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,460
It was merely a coincidence.

201
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,700
So, you were the mastermind.

202
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,220
Because of you,

203
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,740
I couldn't attend the competition!

204
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,820
I even misunderstood Tong because of you!

205
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,030
Pok, stop!

206
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,900
Stop it!

207
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,460
Pok!

208
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,430
-Calm down!
-Calm down!

209
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,300
What happened?

210
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,720
Pok, calm down!

211
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,860
You can continue your assault.

212
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,570
Treat this as my compensation to you.

213
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,930
Why did you do that?

214
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,740
What did Tong and I do to offend you?

215
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,180
Tell me!

216
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,340
For some things,

217
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,940
it's better for you to stay ignorant.

218
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,980
That way, you'll only hate me alone.

219
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,740
Fine.

220
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,060
Pok!

221
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,980
Pok.

222
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,300
Pok.

223
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,980
Calm down.

224
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,210
Phai.

225
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,100
Phai.

226
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,220
Do you really wish to know the truth?

227
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,820
Fine.

228
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,300
Let me tell you.

229
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,300
Don't you think it's strange

230
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,620
that your results got better

231
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,100
and you could enrol in a university?

232
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,580
It's not because you were capable.

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,760
It's because Tong
altered your marks for you.

234
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,580
He swapped my marks with yours.

235
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,220
That's impossible!

236
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,610
You're lying!

237
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,220
You can ask Tong yourself then.

238
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,340
See if I was speaking the truth

239
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,460
or I was lying to you.

240
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,580
Sandee, is that true?

241
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,180
Sandee, wait!

242
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,980
Sandee.

243
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,220
Did you speak the truth?

244
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,540
Did Tong alter Pok's marks?

245
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,740
That's right.

246
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,900
It's true.

247
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,460
Tong swapped our marks
for the semester-end exam.

248
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,700
He was afraid that Pok's result
wasn't good enough.

249
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,660
But I've counted his marks.

250
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,380
Even if he didn't cheat,

251
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,540
Pok's result was good enough.

252
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,270
Actually, my grades didn't change at all.

253
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,610
The grades were the same.

254
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,220
But Tong did something

255
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,500
he shouldn't have.

256
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,620
I know Tong committed a mistake.

257
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
You can understand his feelings, right?

258
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,700
Tong did the wrong thing.

259
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,700
And, he should pay for it.

260
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,300
Pok should pay for it as well.

261
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,420
Even so, you were still too much.

262
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,940
They misunderstood each other
because of you.

263
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,300
Sandee,

264
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,140
you need to apologise to everyone

265
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,380
for what had happened.

266
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,690
Apologise?

267
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,260
You're making it as if I'm the only person
who did wrong here.

268
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,460
That's not it, Sandee.

269
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,260
Forget it.

270
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,300
I don't care about that.

271
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:28,940
Farewell.

272
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,500
Sandee,

273
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,140
stop ruining other people's relationships.

274
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,700
You should stop now.

275
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,950
No matter if it's Pok and Tong

276
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,640
or P'Thanu and P'Wayu.

277
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,300
Have they offended you before?

278
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,860
P'Thanu?

279
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,740
You're right.

280
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
There's still P'Thanu.

281
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,220
Sandee, what do you plan to do?

282
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,460
If you wish to continue

283
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,050
to meddle with P'Thanu's
and P'Wayu's relationship,

284
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,420
let's stop contacting each other.

285
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,260
I'm begging you.

286
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,540
If not,

287
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm afraid we will cease to be friends.

288
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,760
We will cease to be friends?

289
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,300
Sorry,

290
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,510
but you won't be able to stop me.

291
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm doing everything

292
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,480
for you.

293
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,140
Wayu.

294
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,180
P'Koh? Why are you here?

295
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,660
Great timing.

296
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,460
My informant told me
that you're free tonight.

297
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,020
Is that so?

298
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,900
Your informant is pretty unreliable.

299
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,210
Are you busy tonight?

300
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,780
I've booked two movie tickets.

301
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,450
Comfortable couple seats,

302
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,300
meal services, and...

303
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,700
Hey!

304
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
Koh, move aside.

305
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,500
Move aside.

306
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,260
What's with you, P'Jack?

307
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,420
Wayu is busy today.

308
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,620
It's because

309
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,980
he's going to have dinner with me tonight.

310
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Am I right?

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,740
Wayu,

312
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,140
a new shop is opening today.

313
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,500
I've already booked two spots for us.

314
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,780
It's a sky restaurant with great scenery.

315
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,180
P'Jack,

316
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,700
how could you steal him in front of me?

317
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,260
So what?

318
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm stealing him in front of you.

319
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,660
But

320
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,380
my schedule is already occupied.

321
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,060
Who are you meeting?

322
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,460
He's here.

323
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,660
See you guys.

324
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,220
Seniors,

325
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,370
you two can go on a date as well.

326
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,460
You two can catch a movie first.

327
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,580
After that, you two can enjoy a candlelit
dinner at the sky restaurant.

328
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,300
So,

329
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,500
can we go now?

330
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:49,740
Goodbye.

331
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,060
Koh Jack.

332
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,540
It should be Jack Koh.

333
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,460
Goodbye.

334
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,900
The tickets I booked
were meant for a couple.

335
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,180
Sigh.

336
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,340
I booked this restaurant
since the start of the year.

337
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,330
It's done.

338
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,860
How is it, Kit?

339
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,340
Do you have any happy news for me today?

340
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,060
It's bad news, right?

341
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,380
Can you read it for me?

342
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,420
Now, I need to hold it
very close to my eyes

343
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,100
before I can see.

344
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,500
Pa,

345
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,500
your eyes are...

346
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
Sometimes, I can see. Sometimes, I can't.

347
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,220
Regarding the research project
I've mentioned to you before,

348
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,980
they rejected my application.

349
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,700
They said

350
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,420
the risk is too high.

351
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,100
They do not have enough information yet.

352
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,220
And,

353
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,300
complications outside of our expectations
might crop up.

354
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,500
Kit, let's leave it to fate.

355
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,620
Don't be sad.

356
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,220
This isn't your fault.

357
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,140
No.

358
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,780
If there's not enough information,

359
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,490
I'll continue to collect them

360
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,270
and I'll send them an email again.

361
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,820
Kit, that's enough.

362
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,220
I've tried many times.

363
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,180
But my body

364
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,420
can't stand it anymore.

365
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,180
No.

366
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,900
I won't give up.

367
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,540
I'll show you the information tomorrow.

368
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,330
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,060
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you out.

370
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,580
Kit, it's fine.

371
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,700
I just need to go for my treatments
according to the plan.

372
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,520
That will be enough.

373
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,730
I will do all I can

374
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,220
to help you out!

375
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
Nothing must happen to you!

376
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,530
P'Thanu,

377
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,020
can I ask you something?

378
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,540
Did your family members

379
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,610
recognise me on the first day

380
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,010
because of these paintings?

381
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,730
Sit properly, don't move.

382
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,850
If not, your portrait will not be nice.

383
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,180
I'll be done in a minute.

384
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,300
Okay.

385
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,970
No problem.

386
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,900
Let me adjust your pose.

387
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,580
Your arm needs to be here.

388
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,020
Okay.

389
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,740
Since I took a bite out of your apple,

390
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,690
I'll get you a new one.

391
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,860
Here you go.

392
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:43,940
[Kit: Where are you?
Why haven't you returned yet?]

393
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,060
P'Kit.

394
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,420
It's so dark in here.
Why are you sitting here alone?

395
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,460
Have you returned for a long time?

396
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,420
I don't know what had happened,

397
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,860
but please don't forget

398
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,540
that you still have me.

399
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,140
You don't return at this time usually.

400
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,300
That's why

401
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,500
I went to P'Jack's and P'Jew's
dorm to play some games.

402
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,170
That game was fun.

403
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,260
We should

404
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,580
buy the game console for ourselves.

405
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Let's buy it.

406
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,500
What?

407
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,980
When are we buying it?

408
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,730
Are you sure that I can buy it?

409
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,260
You used to tell me

410
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,460
to focus on my studies in the past.

411
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,820
You can buy the game console,

412
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,580
but I'll pick the games.

413
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,580
Oh.

414
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,980
No way.

415
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,180
You only love to play games
that challenge your brain.

416
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,520
I love to play exciting games,

417
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,180
like shooting games.

418
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,780
Tututututu.

419
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,740
Suit yourself.

420
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,980
Where should we put it after we buy it?

421
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,930
Let's clean up the things over there.

422
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,150
If you feel upset

423
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,400
because you're hiding something,

424
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,940
you can let it all out.

425
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,820
It's Pa.

426
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,980
I've tried my best to help him out.

427
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,740
But I couldn't do anything for him.

428
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,860
I know.

429
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,780
I know you're very worried about him.

430
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,620
I'm worried about him as well.

431
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,900
I know

432
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,060
that you've done everything you can

433
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,380
to help him out.

434
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,250
I want you to rest

435
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,740
and relax now,

436
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
even for a little moment. Just like this.

437
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,140
You should stop worrying

438
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,140
today.

439
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Let's think about it

440
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,050
tomorrow.

441
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,700
We'll figure out what to do tomorrow,

442
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,020
okay?

443
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,060
Let me help you relax.

444
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,900
Are we doing it here or on the bed?

445
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,140
Do what?

446
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,340
You can do whatever you want.

447
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,450
Do whatever I want?

448
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,290
You mean

449
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,460
I can really do whatever I want?

450
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,180
I can give you everything.

451
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,250
Don't tell me

452
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,440
you're doing this because
you're trying to satisfy me?

453
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,340
Who else can I satisfy

454
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,740
if not you?

455
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,020
But

456
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,690
what I want is more than that.

457
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,100
I...

458
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,890
What I meant was...

459
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,460
I...

460
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,220
I need you.

461
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,620
I need you very much.

462
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,260
And,

463
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,180
I hope you need me as well.

464
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,340
This is our first time.

465
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,980
Both of us should feel the same
towards each other.

466
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,900
Mark, if I knew you were
a person like this...

467
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,580
What are you trying to do?

468
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,050
I would have said yes

469
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,510
on the first day you tried to court me.

470
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,340
Thank you for sending me back, P'Thanu.

471
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,860
And,

472
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,260
thank you for everything today.

473
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,929
I would like to thank you

474
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,610
for being my drawing model.

475
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,060
But I haven't finished the portrait yet.

476
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,780
I'm afraid you would have to come again.

477
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,620
Sure.

478
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,340
No problem.

479
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,080
Okay.

480
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,900
It's late now.

481
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,460
You should return and rest.

482
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,060
Okay, P'Thanu.

483
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,260
See you tomorrow.

484
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,090
Goodbye.

485
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,020
Wayu,

486
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,860
may I borrow your washroom?

487
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,490
Sure.

488
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,220
It's been a long time
since I visited your room.

489
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,540
It looks the same.

490
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,420
Do you wish to have some coffee?

491
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,660
I'll make it for you.

492
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,780
I have a coffee machine now.

493
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,860
Sure.

494
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,740
Okay.

495
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,820
I'll make it for you right now.

496
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,180
Here you go.

497
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,780
Thanks.

498
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,900
It smells great.

499
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,220
But you don't drink
this type of coffee usually.

500
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,980
I saw that you liked it.

501
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,620
That's why I bought it.

502
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,460
Can I come here for coffee again?

503
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,500
Sure.

504
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,340
If you say so,

505
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,180
that makes me want to
come here every day, you know?

506
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,180
You're here for the coffee, right?

507
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,980
It's not because of the coffee.

508
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,940
It's because the person making the coffee
is adorable.

509
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,540
That's why I wanted to come.

510
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,570
It's getting late, P'Thanu.

511
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,140
Aren't you going home?

512
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,900
Alright then.

513
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,220
I'll go and wash the cup.

514
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,280
It's fine. Let me do it.

515
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,810
I can return after I'm done washing it.

516
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,740
-I said it's fine.
-Let me wash it.

517
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,700
P'Thanu,

518
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,420
it's fine.

519
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,980
P'Thanu, pass it to me.

520
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,900
P'Thanu.

521
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,980
Sorry, P'Thanu.

522
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,900
It's fine.

523
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:27,970
The shirt just got dirty.

524
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,380
But

525
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,660
you should hurry and wash your shirt
when it has coffee stain.

526
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,240
If not, it'll be hard to get rid of.

527
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,180
Let me wash it for you.

528
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,010
What will I wear then?

529
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,940
Erm,

530
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,100
I'll find a shirt for you.

531
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,340
Thanks.

532
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,380
Whose t-shirt is this?

533
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,540
Why is it so huge?

534
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,620
It's Sab's.

535
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,420
He always forgets to take his things
with him when he sleeps here.

536
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,140
P'Thanu,

537
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,460
I think you should change over there.

538
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm done.

539
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,780
Okay.

540
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,860
It's pretty fitting.

541
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,220
I'll return first then.

542
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,700
Here you go.

543
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,980
I'll leave my shirt to you.

544
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,420
Okay.

545
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,110
See you tomorrow.

546
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,520
Goodbye.

547
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,940
Pok, are you back?

548
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,340
Pok,

549
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,020
do you want to take a shower together?

550
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,140
What's wrong with you?

551
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,540
Is there something you want to tell me?

552
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,900
Are you sure you have nothing to tell me?

553
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,580
What are you referring to?

554
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,980
Pok,

555
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,180
you're hurting me.

556
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,460
Pok!

557
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:50,740
Pok!

558
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,340
What's wrong with you?

559
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,100
Pok!

560
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,340
Pok.

561
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,860
Are you okay?

562
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,460
Sandee told me everything about you today.

563
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,020
Was he speaking the truth?

564
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,060
Answer me.

565
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,420
You can continue to lie to me,

566
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
since

567
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,740
I'm easily fooled anyway.

568
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,340
I did swap your marks with Sandee's.

569
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,060
I was afraid that you couldn't
get into university

570
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,540
because of your grade.

571
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,980
Why didn't you ask me for my opinion?

572
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,940
Why didn't you ask me
if I wanted your help or not?

573
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,900
I'm sorry, Pok.

574
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,210
I was once very proud

575
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,970
because I won against myself.

576
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,860
I thought I obtained good grades
after I studied hard enough.

577
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,060
But the truth isn't like that.

578
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,180
It's precisely because I saw that you were
so hard-working

579
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,380
that I...

580
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,500
Tong, that's enough.

581
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,100
During competitions,

582
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,140
do you know what feels worse

583
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,670
than losing the competition?

584
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,660
That is to think that we have won.

585
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,900
But actually, we won by cheating!

586
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,220
It's because I didn't obey the rules.

587
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,660
You didn't do anything wrong.

588
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,540
It's all my fault.

589
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,300
What are you trying to get from me

590
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,620
by doing so?

591
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,500
Do you want me to say "thank you"?

592
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,580
Do you want me to be grateful to you?

593
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,860
Or do you want something else, Tong?

594
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,860
I just wanted you to lead a better life.

595
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,140
I just wanted you to be happy

596
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,740
and study here.

597
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,460
I wanted you to become the athlete
you always wanted to be.

598
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,100
Tong, so, what will happen to my life
from now onwards?

599
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,980
If someone found out

600
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,850
that I cheated...

601
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,900
The things I've always been proud of,

602
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,580
no matter if it's my studies

603
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,050
or sports,

604
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,860
I used my own effort
to achieve great results.

605
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,540
I've never cheated or taken advantage
of other people.

606
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,940
But

607
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,530
because of the things
you did to Sandee,

608
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,060
I don't feel proud of my achievement.

609
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,260
Pok.

610
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,580
I'm really sorry.

611
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,160
Tong,

612
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,530
just leave.

613
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,360
Pok.

614
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,420
Can you still accept

615
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,780
our first kiss?

616
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,380
If you did so because you love me,

617
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,780
you should stop loving me, Tong.

618
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,690
I hope this will be your first kiss

619
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,330
and your last.

620
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,410
It comes from a person
who loves you deeply.

621
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,460
♫ If you don't have any feelings for me ♫

622
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,510
♫ I'm willing to leave ♫

623

639
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,100
P'Thanu, are you looking for P'Wayu?

640
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,340
If anyone tries to hurt Wayu,

641
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,180
I won't let him off.

642
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,540
What are you saying?

643
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,850
I don't understand.

644
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,780
You used Pa's and Wayu's reconciliation
as an excuse.

645
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,290
You even gave the portrait
that Phai drew to Wayu

646
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,230
and made him misunderstood
our relationship.

647
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,580
What else do you want to do?

648
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,220
Do you want to ruin
other people's relationships?

649
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,050
Why do you still think that
you can start a new relationship with him?

650
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,370
You have been irrelevant ever since

651
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,230
P'Pa and P'Wayu fell in love
with each other.

652
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,460
Phai was hurt

653
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,530
because of your stubbornness.

654
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,220
You guys were the perfect couple.

655
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,620
What are you saying?

656
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,380
Phai and I knew

657
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,730
that it was merely a coincidence.

658
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,940
Do you still believe in the
so-called "lucky game"?

659
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,140
That's just a game used to deceive kids.

660
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,260
Phai did so to make you feel relieved.

661
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,700
The love definition
that you got on that day,

662
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,580
are you sure

663
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,940
that Phai didn't prepare it beforehand?

664
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,900
What do you mean?

665
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,460
No matter which paper strip

666
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,410
you take from the bottle,

667
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,940
they're all the same.

668
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,980
Phai showed it to you on purpose

669
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,500
in order to end the story between you two.

670
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,140
Now, you know the truth.

671
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,940
Are you shocked?

672
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,290
[For the sake of our loved ones,
I'm willing to withdraw.]

673
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,360
For the happiness of our loved ones,

674
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,290
I'm willing to withdraw.

675
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,490
Did you see?

676
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,820
What happened between us
was just a coincidence.

677
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,690
I was overthinking it.

678
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,020
So, you don't need to worry anymore.

679
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:06,500
Thank you, Phai.

680
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,980
[For the sake of our loved ones,
I'm willing to withdraw.]

681
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,700
[For the sake of our loved ones,
I'm willing to withdraw.]

682
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,740
Are you sure you want to do this?

683
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,260
Now, you know the truth.

684
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,700
Are you still trying to deny it?

685
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,140
Are you still trying to say that
it was merely a coincidence?

686
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,500
Shut up!

687
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,540
If that was the case,

688
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,100
that means I,

689
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,820
Phai,

690
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,900
and Wayu,

691
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,980
we can come up with
our own definition of love.

692
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,860
And, Wayu is the definition of my love.

693
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,700
Speaking of P'Wayu,

694
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,410
I remembered another thing.

695
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,100
I wonder if I should tell him about it.

696
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,440
I know

697
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,940
why P'Pa suddenly abandoned P'Wayu

698
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,340
and begged you to take care of him.

699
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,490
What do you mean?

700
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,700
If P'Wayu knows that P'Pa left him to you

701
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,780
because he is so ill

702
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,330
to the point that he might die,

703
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,100
what do you think P'Wayu will do?

704
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,340
You're lying.

705
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,580
This is impossible.

706
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,420
What nonsense are you saying?

707
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,700
If you wish to know
whether I'm lying or not,

708
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,660
why don't you ask Kit?

709
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,180
Um.

710
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,900
[P'Thanu]

711
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,900
Huh?

712
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,020
Who's knocking on the door
in the middle of the night?

713
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,820
Mark.

714
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
You can go to sleep.

715
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,820
I'll check it out.

716
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,340
Okay.

717
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,770
P'Thanu?

718
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,860
Kit, you're so early today.

719
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,260
Is something wrong?

720
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,060
Pa,

721
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,340
why didn't you tell me about it?

722
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,060
P'Thanu?

723
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,140
It's because I know
how much Pa loves Wayu.

724
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,740
How could I love him any lesser?

725
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,300
I'm afraid that if I leave,

726
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,940
and anything happens when I return,

727
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,700
my relationship with Mark

728
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,460
won't be able to stay the same.

729
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,940
Wayu.

730
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,740
How do you feel?

731
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,690
Do you feel better?

732
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,660
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

733
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,270
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

734
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,660
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

735
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,760
♫ I don't know why ♫

736
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,050
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

737
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,340
♫ Just let it be ♫

738
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,840
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

739
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,990
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

740
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,480
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

741
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,550
♫ It was an accident ♫

742
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,480
♫ The closer I am to you ♫

743
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,000
♫ The closer I can see your eyes ♫

744
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,990
♫ The more satisfied I'll be ♫

745
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,320
♫ The only thing I know ♫

746
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,840
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

747
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,860
♫ Just like that ♫

748
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,300
♫ Because it's you ♫

749
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,440
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

750
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,660
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

751
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,230
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

752
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,740
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

753
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:12,700
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

754
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,850
♫ I feel happy ♫

755
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,160
♫ When I can see you ♫

756
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,040
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

757
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,470
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

758
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,180
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

759
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,490
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

760
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,670
♫ I don't know why ♫

761
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,880
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

762
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,060
♫ Just let it be ♫

763
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,510
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫
