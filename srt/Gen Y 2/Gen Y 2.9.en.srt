1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,740
Try and close your eyes again.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,470
Take a deep breath.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,380
Relax.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,300
Try and synchronise

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,810
our heartbeats.

7
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,060
Is this the method you use
when you want to focus?

8
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,170
Who told you to open your eyes?

9
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,110
I won't close my eyes. You always tease me

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,360
and take advantage of me.

11
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,860
I'm not nervous now.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
Are you sure?

13
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,450
Yes.

14
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,900
I believe that you can surely do it.

15
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,120
There's still some time
before the performance starts.

16
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,750
Make yourself feel relaxed.

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,430
I'll watch your performance outside.

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,700
P'Thanu.

19
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,960
Yes?

20
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,110
Can you keep me company until
my performance starts?

21
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,230
[I won't care no matter
who approaches me.]

22
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,270
[It's because this bow]

23
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,280
[is the only thing
I care about right now.]

24
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,590
[That's all.]

25
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,700
And, don't forget to thank your friend.

26
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,510
He reported the incident to the school.

27
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,010
If he didn't do so,

28
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,260
the wrongdoer wouldn't have been
punished in the first place.

29
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,350
Tong.

30
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,950
I need to tell you something.

31
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,320
Pok? What are you doing here?

32
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,980
Have you seen Tong?

33
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,660
I need to speak to him.

34
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,800
He went to take a break.

35
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,000
If he's back,

36
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,460
please tell him

37
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,550
to stay here after the performance.

38
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,460
I have something important to tell him.

39
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,380
Okay, I'll pass the message to him.

40
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,730
Thanks.

41
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
Did you hear what Pok just said?

42
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,710
Alright.

43
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,500
Our photography session will end soon.

44
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
That's right. You guys
can still make it in time.

45
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,050
You need to hurry if you haven't
taken pictures with our actors yet.

46
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,600
That's right. Please make haste.

47
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,510
You guys can still make it in time.

48
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,890
Those who haven't taken their pictures,
please hurry.

49
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,070
You guys can take pictures 
with Jack first.

50
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,200
Okay.

51
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,290
Please take a picture with us.

52
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,610
Thank you.

53
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,160
Please hold on.

54
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,010
[Mark: You took a selfie with your fans.
Can you take one with your partner?]

55
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,720
[Kit: You mean this person?]

56
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,510
Oh, P'Jack.

57
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,460
Your performance just now was just like

58
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,320
a movie we can catch in an outdoor cinema
in the village.

59
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,520
Ko!

60
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,700
What's wrong with you?

61
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,130
Are you trying to be a Chinese ghost
with your get-up?

62
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,450
Have you ever seen a Chinese ghost
as handsome as me?

63
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,770
P'Jack,

64
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,240
it's rare for us
to look this dashing usually.

65
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,320
Don't you plan to take a picture
and keep it as a memento?

66
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,930
Hey!

67
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,550
You just want to
take a picture with me, right?

68
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,060
You must be out of your mind.
I was just passing by.

69
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,780
And I saw everyone taking pictures
with each other.

70
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,650
Just tell me if you want
to take a picture with me.

71
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,630
Stop hesitating. Take out your camera.

72
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,120
You wish to take a picture with me
that badly? Fine.

73
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,480
You're the one who wants
to take a picture with me.

74
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,740
Yeah, whatever you say.

75
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,720
Stop forcing me. Come on.

76
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,610
Hey!

77
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,180
Mark!

78
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,810
Hello.

79
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,480
P'Ko, P'Jack, what were you guys doing?

80
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,700
It's Jack-Ko.

81
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,910
Oh, okay.

82
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,110
I saw that you guys were
taking pictures together just now.

83
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,420
How about letting me be your photographer?

84
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,580
I'll make sure you guys
look great in the pictures.

85
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,930
It'll look sweet, okay?

86
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,700
Okay?

87
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,840
No one cares about that.

88
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,120
Precisely. Mark, are you out of your mind?

89
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,580
Who wants to take a picture with him?

90
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,580
If so,

91
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,190
suit yourself then. I'll make a move now.

92
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,560
Did you take the selfie just now?

93
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,020
I did.

94
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
Send it to me.

95
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,360
Okay.

96
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
Wayu, it's time to perform.

97
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,620
Are you ready?

98
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,440
For our next programme,

99
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,350
it's interesting,
and it's a huge production.

100
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,140
That's right. Let's not waste any time.

101
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,980
Please enjoy "The Land of Dreams".

102
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,080
This best scene comes from a fairy tale.

103
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,790
P'Thanu,

104
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,060
come here. We can enjoy the performance
best from this angle.

105
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,910
-P'Mark, let's take a picture together.
 -Come.

106
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,270
One, two....

107
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,130
Like this.

108
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,270
Oh.

109
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,010
Yee.

110
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,190
Oh.

111
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,710
One, two, three.

112
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,370
Another one.

113
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,410
Thumbs up.

114
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,110
Again. Like this.

115
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,980
One, two....

116
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,280
Smile.

117
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,880
Like this.

118
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,360
Okay.

119
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,440
Thank you.

120
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,740
Thank you.

121
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,590
P'Thanu, I did it.

122
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,830
Did you see that?

123
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,609
You were amazing.

124
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,250
Wayu, let's take a walk.

125
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,690
Okay.

126
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:13,900
Let's go.

127
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,180
Phai, we will be performing soon.

128
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm so nervous.

129
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,960
Yeah, I'm nervous too.

130
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,580
Pok, are you okay? It'll be our turn soon.

131
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,040
Three of you, come here and wait.

132
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
Okay.

133
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,710
Good luck.

134
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,740
Pok, it's time to go.

135
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,870
These are jasmine.

136
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,890
Yeah.

137
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,860
Can we take a picture with you?

138
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,840
Sure.

139
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,600
One, two, three.

140
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,370
Thanu, come and help us out.

141
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,680
We have encountered a problem backstage.

142
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,920
Erm.

143
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,890
Okay?

144
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,540
Hurry up. We're in a hurry.

145
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,670
Okay, thank you.

146
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,240
Thank you.

147
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,040
Thank you.

148
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,850
What's going on?

149
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,070
The lights were still working
during our final rehearsal.

150
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,500
Now, some of them are faulty.

151
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,490
We don't know what's wrong
with them either.

152
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,140
We're trying to solve this situation too.
Please give us some time.

153
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,250
Yuki,

154
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,200
what are you doing?

155
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm going to examine the circuits.

156
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,220
No need for that.

157
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,740
I asked a professional to help us out.
Just leave it to me.

158
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,640
You don't need to worry.

159
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,880
-Jew, I'll be counting on you.
-Okay.

160
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,620
I don't know where P'Thanu went.

161
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,050
You're amazing.

162
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,170
Both the spotlight and backlight
are working now.

163
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,270
This side should be fine now.

164
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,740
Thanu, what about your side?

165
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,920
This side should be fine as well.

166
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,270
Okay, this side is fine.

167
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,840
[Good, very good.]

168
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,430
[We still have one last side to check.]

169
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,160
[Thanu,]

[Ask him to check
if the circuits are working.]

172
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, my friend.

173
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,580
P'Thanu.

174
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,520
P'Thanu, are you here?

175
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,920
Yes, I'm here.

176
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,390
Be careful. Don't fall.

177
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,290
I was worried about you
when you went missing just now.

178
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,740
How did you manage to find me then?

179
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,710
P'Yuki told me about your location.

180
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,610
Are you done with this side?

181
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,480
This side is fine now.

182
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,770
I need to check the other sides as well.

183
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,690
The lights will be able to work
after I do so.

184
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,040
Let's head to another place.

185
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,460
This place is unsafe.

186
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,110
Okay.

187
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,650
Let's go. Follow me.

[One Night]

189
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,710
Thank you, P'Thanu.

190
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,960
Without you,

191
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,280
I wouldn't be able to
successfully fire the arrow.

192
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,870
I just boosted your confidence.

193
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,450
That's all I did.

194
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,950
Sorry for not keeping my words.

195
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,430
We promised each other before

196
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,360
that we won't let go of each other

197
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,960
no matter what happens.

198
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,180
Me too.

199
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,250
I also thought that I could
endure it and wait.

200
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,840
I thought I could wait until the day
when we could be together again.

201
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,370
But now, I know

202
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,450
that I was wrong.

203
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,110
I will never let go of you again.

204
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,590
Okay, P'Thanu.

205
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,000
I was an idiot.

206
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,310
I only cared for P'Pa's feelings,

207
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,910
even though I knew how I felt about you.

208
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,650
In the end, everyone was hurt
because of me.

209
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,650
I'm sorry.

210
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,250
Wayu,

211
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,260
don't blame yourself.

212
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,520
Just forget all of those, okay?

213
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,400
Just forget them.

214
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,980
You just need
to remember that we love each other.

215
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,190
Remember, you're the only one I love.

216
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,480
Very good.

217
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,260
Look over here.

218
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,480
I would like to thank you all
for helping us out.

219
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,660
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

220
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,630
Thank you, Jew.

221
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,230
It's not my credit alone.

222
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,920
This is the fruit of everyone's labour.

223
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,710
Hmm.

224
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,450
Where's Thanu?

225
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,280
I heard that he came to help out too.
I haven't thanked him yet.

226
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,010
Oh, he went back because 
he has something important to do.

227
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,290
Thank him for me.

228
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,250
Okay.

229
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,020
Wayu, P'Thanu.

230
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,310
What's with you two?

231
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,490
P'Kit.

232
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,710
I was wondering why P'Thanu
wasn't looking after the booth.

233
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,760
Sorry, Kit.

234
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,080
Please allow me to leave early tonight.

235
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,430
It's fine. I understand.

236
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,970
I'll return to the booth first.

237
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,980
Goodbye.

238
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,770
This is where they take pictures
with all the Inter.Groom participants.

239
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,660
I see.

240
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,500
Many people came here to take pictures
with the Thai groom.

241
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,220
But, I only wish to take pictures
with one person.

242
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,310
Haven't you thought of taking a picture
together with me?

243
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,820
I didn't bring any money with me.

244
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,250
If it's you, you can repay me
the money in another way.

245
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,680
I'll put this on your tab first.
I'll pay you next time.

246
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,010
Excuse me, Pee.

247
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,220
Can you take a picture for us?

248
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,500
Okay.

249
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,650
Show me a sweet pose.

250
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,800
How about hearts?

251
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,650
Arm in arm.

252
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,680
Let's take one with your arm
around his shoulder.

253
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,050
Can your face be closer to his?

254
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,090
Closer.

255
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,110
And then...

256
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,150
Pee, that's enough.

257
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,650
Thank you.

258
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,550
Thank you.

259
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,120
Let's take a walk.

260
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,840
Okay.

261
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,200
Tong,

262
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,470
can you listen to
what I have to say first?

263
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,540
I just wish to apologise to you.

264
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,400
I finally understand now.

265
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,940
Everything you did was for my sake.

266
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,440
I was a selfish idiot.

267
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,660
I'm really sorry.

268
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,890
Tong,

269
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,180
we've been through so much together.

270
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,590
If I beg you right now...

271
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,860
I'll make a move first.

272
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,370
Tong,

273
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,540
can you please give me another chance?

274
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,200
Tong.

275
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,160
How do you feel? Are you tired?

276
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,430
No. I just felt nervous.

277
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,110
My leg was shaking just now.

278
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,270
But, you did great.
I watched your performance.

279
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,140
Thank you, Sandee.

280
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,930
I wonder if Tong is willing
to speak with Pok?

281
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,240
I don't think this can be resolved
within a short period.

282
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,260
But, if they truly love each other,
they won't stay angry for long.

283
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah, that's what I thought.

284
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
Let's try and persuade Tong, okay?

285
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,790
Only then, he can understand
where Pok is coming from.

286
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,400
Are you a wizard or Cupid himself?

287
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,550
Wayu, let's go back.

288
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I'll send you back.

289
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,870
Okay.

290
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,940
Give me your bag.

291
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,770
Come.

all the time.]

[Mark: Many people
took pictures with you.]

294
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,250
[Kit: Are you worried or jealous?]

295
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,570
[Mark: Jealous.]

296
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,500
[Mark: And worried as well.]

297

298

[Mark: I'm resting backstage.
I'll get changed in a minute.]

299
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,610
[Kit: I'll head back first.]

300
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,429
[Mark: Okay.]

301
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,290
Thank you for everything today, P'Thanu.

302
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,790
So, see you tomorrow.

303
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,660
Do you wish to use the washroom
before you head back?

304
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,880
Okay.

305
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,450
I made you coffee, P'Thanu.

306
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,540
Thank you.

307
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,250
I'll go and remove my makeup first.

308
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,000
I can't even recognise myself
with such thick makeup.

309
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,420
I'll remove my makeup first.

310
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,050
Okay.

311
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,040
P'Thanu, can you bring me the white towel?

312
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,960
Thank you.

313
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,990
Is the music box broken?

314
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,470
That's right. It fell to the ground.

315
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,610
After that, there's no sound.

316
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,230
I'll send it for repair then.

317
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,440
By the way, P'Thanu,

318
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,320
don't forget to take back the
stained shirt you left here last time.

319
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,410
I washed it for you.

320
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,970
P'Thanu?

321
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,080
Seems like my shirt is dirty again.

322
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,970
I'm afraid you have to
wash it for me again.

323
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,510
It's getting late.
Do you need to head back?

324
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,060
Do you want me to head back?

325
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,500
I'll head back first.

326
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,990
Come to my house for a meal tomorrow.
I'll fetch you.

327
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,760
See you tomorrow.

328
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,590
You should head back now.

329
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,350
Drive safely, okay?

330
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,590

Hello, P'Kit.

333

Just now, I...

334
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,930
Is that true, P'Kit?

Okay.

336
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,130
I'll head there tomorrow morning.

337
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:43,960
P'Pa.

338
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,140
P'Kit.

339
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,310
How's P'Pa?

340
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,180
He has lost consciousness
since last night.

341
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,340
His blood pressure has been
constantly decreasing.

342
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,000
Wayu,

343
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,480
do you know this?

344
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,600
He chose to give up on his treatment.

345
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,590
What? He gave up on his treatment?

346
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,190
[I write this letter of agreement]

347
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,560
[while I am still conscious.]

348
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,380
[This is my will.]

349
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,640
[According to Act 12 of the
2007 National Public Health Act,]

350
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,290
[please let me pass away in peace,
in a natural state,]

351
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,790
[and with dignity.]

352
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:23,860
[During the last moment of my life,]

353
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,260
[there's no need to use any machines
or unnecessary treatments]

354
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,560
[to prolong my lifespan.]

355
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,600
Is that true, Kit?

356
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,450
I'm going to speak to him.

357
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,630
I won't allow him to do so.

358
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,740
P'Thanu, P'Kit,

359
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,820
let's cheer for him.

360
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,410
He mustn't give up just like this.

361
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,870
We can visit him when he's awake.

362
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,370
Pa is gone!

363
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,880
He has decided

364
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,730
to leave in peace.

365
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:08,390
Pa, I'm here.

366
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,600
I'm here to keep you company.

367
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,560
You don't need to worry anymore.

368
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,540
P'Pa.

369
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,620
Wayu.

370
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,020
P'Pa.

371
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,310
Wayu,

372
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,020
sing a song for me.

373
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:35,610
♫ Once, I met someone
who brought me happiness ♫

374
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:46,350
♫ Once, we were beside each other
all the time ♫

375
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:59,010
♫ But, our love didn't last forever ♫

376
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:09,510
♫ Once, life made us
took diverging paths ♫

377
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,260
P'Pa!

378
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,220
P'Pa!

379
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,960
P'Kit!

380
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,240
P'Pa!

381
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:34,890
P'Kit!

382
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:40,090
♫ You and I were never apart ♫

383
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:48,750
♫ Still standing in my memories,
cheering for you with a smile ♫

384
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,120
♫ If life is but a dream ♫

385
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:05,750
♫ I'm happy that we once met each other ♫

386
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,690
[Now, I'm yours.]

387
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,260
[We will stay beside each other
and take care of each other,]

388
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,740
[just like how an arrow needs the wind.]

389
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,350
♫ I don't know what made me fall in love ♫

390
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:34,840
♫ I don't know why,
but my heart is shaking ♫

391
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,050
♫ Even though I saw your silhouette ♫

392
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:44,230
♫ I couldn't see clearly who was
walking towards me ♫

393
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,680
♫ The only thing I know ♫

394
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,200
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

395
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,210
♫ Just like that ♫

396
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,650
♫ Because it's you ♫

397
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,790
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

398
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:57,020
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

399
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,580
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

400
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:04,100
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

401
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,060
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

402
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,200
♫ I feel happy ♫

403
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,510
♫ When I can see you ♫

404
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,390
♫ And listen to your voice ♫

405
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,820
♫ I miss you without any reason ♫

406
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,540
♫ Whenever I close my eyes ♫

407
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,840
♫ You appear in my heart clearly ♫

408
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,030
♫ I don't know why ♫

409
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,230
♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

410
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,420
♫ Just let it be ♫

411
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,870
♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

412
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:59,240
♫ No one ordered me to love you ♫

413
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,720
♫ I didn't fall for you on purpose ♫

414
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,800
♫ It was an accident ♫

415
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,730
♫ The closer I am to you ♫

416
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:08,250
♫ The closer I can see your eyes ♫

417
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,240
♫ The more satisfied I'll be ♫

418
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,560
♫ The only thing I know ♫

419
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,090
♫ Is that I fell for you ♫

420
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,100
♫ Just like that ♫

421
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,540
♫ Because it's you ♫

422
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,680
♫ What do you want to do? ♫

423
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,910
♫ What do you want from me? ♫

424
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,470
♫ Why did I fall for you? ♫

425
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,400
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫
