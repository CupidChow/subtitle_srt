1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,019
What's wrong, P'Kit?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,260
Is he seriously ill?

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,980
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,700
How could you hide this from me?

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,250
Sorry, Kit.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,980
I just

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,140
don't want others to worry about me,

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
including Wayu.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,610
I don't want him to know this.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,610
I don't want him

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,980
to see me in this state.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,660
Is this disease curable?

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,980
My family and I had
tried everything we could,

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,300
but my body

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,500
is resistant to the drugs now.

17
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,820
I don't know how long

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
I can survive against this disease.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,539
My family member

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,100
contracted the same disease before.

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,020
The doctor said this is
a hereditary disease.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,820
I know

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,380
what will happen next.

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,539
I don't expect myself
to recover from this, Kit.

25
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,620
Do you still remember that day?

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,820
The day when I begged you

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,820
to bring Wayu to see me?

28
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,820
I just want

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,020
to see him.

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,740
I wished to see him again
before I go for the operation.

31
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,260
P'Kit,

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
this isn't your fault.

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,860
Yeah, Kit.

34
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,500
Stop blaming yourself.

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm the culprit.

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,940
Before this,

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,579
I harboured hope as well.

38
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,860
If the operation is successful,

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,940
I'll be able to recover.

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,140
And, I'll beg Wayu
to give me another chance.

41
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,260
But now, it has come to this.

42
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,500
And I can't do anything about it.

43
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,490
I've already done my best!

44
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,340
Pa, it'll be fine.

45
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,660
You've already done a good job.

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,060
P'Kit.

47
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,220
P'Kit?

48
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,940
What's on your mind?

49
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,380
I was thinking about
what happened today.

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,250
I admit,

51
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,700
I'd misunderstood P'Pa.

52
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,090
But, I'm afraid I don't agree with him.

53
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,810
I think Wayu should know about this.

54
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,780
No.

55
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,460
He has already done a lot
to keep it from him.

56
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,580
Do you wish to waste his effort?

57
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,580
Pee, people who love each other

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,460
should share their wealth

59
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,360
and woe together.

60
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,460
Won't Wayu be sadder

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,260
if he hears about this in the future?

62
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,580
But, I'd promised Pa

63
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,460
that I'd never tell Wayu about this.

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,340
Do you still remember?

65
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,460
Back then, Pa only begged me
to bring him to Wayu.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,020
But, I was too stubborn to listen to him.

67
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
In the end?

68
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,210
Everything is ruined because of me.

69
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,580
P'Thanu said he wanted to
stay away from Wayu.

70
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,660
We respected his decision.

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,780
And, the issue
developed in a better direction.

72
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,020
We need to respect
other people's decisions, Mark.

73
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,900
But, I can't deceive my friend.

74
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,980
Wayu didn't even know

75
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
why P'Pa broke up with him.

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,900
I don't care. I must tell him.

77
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,340
If you tell him,

78
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,580
can you bear responsibility for the
relationship between P'Thanu and Wayu?

79
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,010
If Wayu knows that Pa will die soon,

80
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,820
they will break up
due to their sympathy for Pa.

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,020
If so, Pa's effort

82
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,820
will go down the drain.

83
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,210
Can you bear responsibility for that?

84
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,380
Okay.

85
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,220
P'Kit.

86
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,780
P'Kit?

87
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,780
Okay.

88
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,100
I won't tell Wayu about this.

89
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
But, don't behave like this.

90
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,140
I don't like it when you do this.

91
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,010
Okay?

92
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,580
Please?

93
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,460
Okay?

94
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,330
Okay?

95
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,900
Stop crying.

96
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,330
Mark.

97
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,340
Yes?

98
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,820
What would you do if the same thing

99
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,570
happened to us?

100
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,780
No matter what happens,

101
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,659
I will never leave you.

102
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,220
We made a promise to each other.

103
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,660
We will always hold hands

104
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,580
and stay by each other's side.

105
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,780
We will grow old together
and never be apart.

106
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,130
Come.

107
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,900
Stop crying.

108
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,850
P'Pa.

109
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,340
To me,

110
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,700
P'Pa is my past love.

111
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,340
And you,

112
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,220
you're my only true love.

113
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,300
Pa!

114
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,940
Pa!

115
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,740
Sorry, P'Thanu.

116
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,040
[Love, Love, Life]

117
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,460
Wayu, study hard.

118
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,300
I bought you your favourite snacks.

119
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,490
If you think the snacks alone are too dry,

120
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,300
please head to the front of the lift.

121
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,060
The front of the lift?

122
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,940
Ah!

123
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,980
P'Thanu?

124
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,620
Why are you here?

125
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,340
I saw that you were doing revisions
until late night

126
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,980
for the upcoming exam.

127
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,860
That's why

128
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,700
I've brought these here for you.

129
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,860
I bought two cups

130
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,820
because I don't know
which flavour you like.

131
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,220
Do you

132
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,740
want this,

133
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,580
this,

134
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,340
or

135
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,740
this?

136
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,820
P'Thanu, what are you doing?

137
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,220
The coffee is going to spill.

138
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,700
You've been reading the entire day.

139
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,860
I just wanted to help you relax.

140
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,940
Here, take this.

141
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,860
I know you like this.

142
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,420
[Love]

143
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,210
Thank you, P'Thanu.

144
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,500
Study hard, okay?

145
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,980
How is it?

146
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
Do you know how to solve it now?

147
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,100
I do.

148
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,210
At first, I couldn't understand this part.

149
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,420
But I understood it
once you explained it to me.

150
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,500
You'll be familiar with them
if you do more exercises.

151
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,580
This is great.

152
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,220
P'Thanu, I'm done with my revision.

153
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,580
Thank you for staying here with me
until this hour.

154
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,340
If you go back,

155
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,570
I will surely miss you.

156
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,690
I really don't want you to go back.

157
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,860
If I can reverse time,

158
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,580
I'll do so even if it means

159
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
that I have to do these exercises again.

160
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,460
How long have I been sleeping?

161
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,420
Just for a little while.

162
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,420
I'm done with my revision.

163
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,930
What's wrong with you?

164
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,100
It's...

165
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,690
Did you hear anything

166
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,980
just now?

167
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,860
I'll die of exhaustion

168
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,820
if you want me to teach you again.

169
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,460
So, you heard everything?

170
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,820
There are pros

171
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,220
missing someone, you know?

172
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,700
What do you mean?

173
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,340
It's because this can let us know

174
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,580
how much we wish to see each other.

175
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,220
There's nothing between me and Phai.

176
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,100
And, you were the only person
I had set my sights on.

177
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,220
It's because the only person I love

178
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,100
is you.

179
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,700
Sorry, P'Thanu.

180
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,340
P'Kit,

181
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,980
I thought your classes
were in the afternoon?

182
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,340
I'll visit Pa first.

183
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,940
Even if he has lost all hope,

184
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,220
I believe that there's a way to treat him.

185
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,300
I will surely think of something
to cure his disease.

186
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,500
I support you, P'Kit.

187
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,420
I'll leave first.

188
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,820

What's the matter?

191
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,740
Today is my last day as the School's Moon.

192
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,380
In the future, you can't brag
in front of others

193
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,740
that your partner
is the School's Moon anymore.

194
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,650
Ah!

195
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,740
Since when did I brag about you
in front of others?

196
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,900
I was just joking.

197
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Aren't you coming
to my retirement ceremony?

198
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,980
I think so.

199
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,900
Sorry about that, Mark.

200
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,740
It's fine.

201
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,900
I'll record a video for you.

202
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
By the way,

203
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,220
if you're returning early tonight,

204
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,060
let's watch some dramas together.

205

For the new episode,

206
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,860
the male lead

207
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,380
will...

208
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,690
Yeah, I wish to watch it as well.

209
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,060
You shouldn't watch it on your own.

210
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,500
See you.

211
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,940

212
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,980
What's the matter?

213
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,410
Aww!

214
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,460
What are you doing here?

215
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,900
What's the matter?

216
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,420
Are you going to mark your territory here

217
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,180
by peeing everywhere?

218
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,660
I saw you acting cool
in front of the mirror.

219
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,260
That's why I thought

220
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,850
we should only let freshmen join the
School's Star and School's Moon

221
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,940
trials instead of juniors like you.

222
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,300
Hey.

223
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,180
You're speaking as if you were a freshman

224
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,420
when you're a senior yourself.

225
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,740
Besides, I'm not here
to join the trials today.

226
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm here to find the person I love.

227
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,780
Well, that's a shame.

228

in this area.

230
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,700
But, I'm afraid

231
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,460
all of the female freshmen

232
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,460
will have their hands full from
holding my flowers.

233
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,140
I'm afraid they have no hands

234
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,860
to hold your wreath.

235
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,780

236
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,380

yours is wet garbage.

What do you want?

-Pee, stop fighting.

245

258
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
can you take a picture with me?

259
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,660
Alice, you should take a picture with me.

What are you doing?

261

So what?

She has no intention
of receiving your wreath.

Sure.

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,170
Hey!

344
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,700
Is this the foul smell of love?

345
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,540
All right.

346
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,940
The School's Star trial has ended.

347
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,700
That's right. Our female freshmen
are so beautiful.

348
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,660
Now, this is the moment
everyone has been waiting for.

349
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,300
That's right.

350
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,940
We'll stop beating around the bush.

351
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,380
Everyone, get ready

352
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,620
and witness the birth of this year's
School's Moon.

353
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,620
Okay.

354
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,660
Now, we have the final marks in our hands.

355
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,900
So, our winner for
this year's School's Moon

356
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,700
is...

357
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,070
Faculty of Science!

358
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
Faculty of Media!

359
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,520
It's N'Pok from the Faculty of Science!

360
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,030
Pok, you're so handsome!

361
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,460
Pok, you're so handsome!

362
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,260
Pok, you're the best!

363
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,500
Hello, P'Mark.

364
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,220
Congratulations.

365
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,860
That was expected.

366
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,700
-Both Pee and Nong are handsome.
-Yeah.

367
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,500
Nong, you look handsome.

368
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,900
Thanks for the compliment.

369
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,050
Give him a big hand!

370
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,940
Oh.

371
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,460
So, they are

372
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,780
this year's School's Star
and School's Moon.

373
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
Congratulations, Pok.

374
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,140
Let's take a picture together.

375
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,700
Okay.

376
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,220
-Me too!
-I'm going to send this to our teacher.

377
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,980
He wishes to see it.

378
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,180
Our friend actually won the contest.

379
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,300
Hurry!

380
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,860
Our teacher will be proud of you.

381
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,140
-Our faculty is the best.
-Our friend is the best.

382
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,660
My face looks huge when I'm in front.

383
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,700
Congratulations.

384
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,980
-Thank you.
-I'll hold the phone for you.

385
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,070
-Let me change my spot.
-Your bangs.

386
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,190
Hurry, let's take a picture together.

387
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,980
I will tag you on social media.

388
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,040
I will tag you on social media.

389
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,860
Pok, you're amazing!

390
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,220
-This is nice.
-This looks nice.

391
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,780
Why is the love between Jack and Zong Jek
of the Faculty of Engineering

392
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,730
like an arid land?

393
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,540
Even though the flowers are fresh,

394
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,900
my mood is the direct opposite of it.

395
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,220
Why is this happening?

396
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,700
Is it because I'm not charming enough?

397
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,220
Ko,

398
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,700
this is for you.

399
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,540
Do you think I want your stupid wreath

400
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,740
just because you're giving it to me?

401
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,420
So, do you want it or not?

402
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,300
Besides, these aren't wreaths.

403
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,170
These are flower rings.

404
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,300
This is my first time receiving flowers
from someone else.

405
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,500
What about yours?

406
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,700
Who will you give it to?

407
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,180
Just give it to me.

408
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,490
Do you want it?

409
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,700
I thought you said it was
wet garbage just now?

410
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,700
It's beautiful, right?

411
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,020
You want it, right?

412
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,860
I've already given you mine.

413
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,220
Are you so heartless that you won't
give me your bouquet?

414
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,780
All right, P'Jack.

415
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,900
Here you go.

416
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,970
Erm.

417
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,980
What were you guys doing?

418
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,300
P'Jack? P'Ko?

419
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,780
You should call us Ko and Jack.

420
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:52,980
Oh.

421
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,940
So, when will you two be together?

422
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,180
You mean me and Ko?

423
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,500
Dream on.

424
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Yeah.

425
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,620
Dream on.

426
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,380
I won't fall for you no matter what.

427
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,620
Even if only the two of us
were left in the world,

428
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,460
I would stay single until the day I die.

429
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,700
You want me to fall for a person like you?

430
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,780
That's unforgivable.

431
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,380
All right then.
I'll wait for your good news.

432
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,780
If you two become a couple,

433
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,300
remember to let me know, okay?

434
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,420
Is it Jack Ko?

435
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,180
Or is it Ko Jack?

436
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,170
Of course it's Jack Ko.

437
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,780
Mark.

438
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,860
No way.

439
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,460
It must be Ko Jack.

440
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,300
Jack Ko.

441
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,460
Ko Jack.

442
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,860
It must be Jack Ko.

443
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
It's Ko Jack.

444
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,660
I'm older than you.

445
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,740
It must be Jack Ko.

446
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,380
So what if you're older than me?

447
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,220
I'm younger than you.

448
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,900
It's precisely because
you're younger than me.

449
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,870
So what if I'm younger than you?

450
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,990
-I hope you guys get what you wish for.
-The younger one can attack as well.

451
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,980
But, I want it to be Jack Ko.

452
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,260
I want it to be Ko Jack.

453
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,460
You're so stubborn.

454
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
How am I stubborn?

455
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,260
Today was exhausting.

456
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,300
Congratulations

457
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,220
for being the School's Moon.

458
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,460
Who gave you that bouquet?

459
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,420
A senior of mine.

460
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,220
I don't know who he is either.

461
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,780
Do you like it?

462
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,890
Not at all.

463
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,180
What about you?

464
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,020
Plenty of people gave you flowers.

465
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,700
Plenty of them took pictures
with you as well.

466
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,620
You were smiling so happily.

467
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,260
What about you?

468
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,540
What will you give me

469
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,860
as my present for being the School's Moon?

470
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,300
You can tell me what you want.

471
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,860
I'll see

472
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,460
if I can afford the present.

473
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,340
You fell for me, right?

474
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,179
Why are you asking that?

475
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,659
Is that question important?

476
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,010
You said you'd reserve your first kiss
for the person you love.

477
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,139
Am I that person?

478
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,900
If I am,

479
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,659
kiss me.

480
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,780
Just you wait.

481
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,980
One day,

482
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,860
I'll make you admit

483
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,980
that you love me as well.

484
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,380
You will kiss me of your own accord.

485
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,140
[Will you choose me?]

486
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,950
[Wayu]

487
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:05,440
[P'Thanu]

488
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,610
What?

489
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,900
Stop messing around.

490
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,610
We're going to be late.

491
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,980
Pok,

492
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,420
stop messing around.

493
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,860
That's enough.

494
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,420
That's enough.

495
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,740
Stop it.

496
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,180
Look, my shirt is all wrinkled
because of you.

497
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,020
It does look wrinkled.

498
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,450
Do you want to wear mine then?

499
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,100
Mine isn't wrinkled.

500
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,460
No.

501
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,980
I don't want to wear your shirt.

502
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,140
I'll change into a new one.

503
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,380
Take this.

504
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,460
You can wear mine.

505
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,300
You'll feel as if I'm by your side
all the time.

506
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,660
No matter if you're having your meals,

507
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,460
attending lessons,

508
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,420
or going anywhere,

509
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,820
you'll feel as if I'm following you.

510
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,100
Are you sure

511
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,980
you'll follow me wherever I go?

512
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,020
Are you sure you can do that?

513
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,820
Of course.

514
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm a man of my words.

515
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,140
If so,

516
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,180
you can travel to
all corners of the school first.

517
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,780
What do you mean?

518
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:58,880
Didn't you say

519
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,320
that you'll follow me wherever I go?

520
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,680
If so, you should cover

521
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,440
every corner of the school by today.

522
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,060
By today?

523
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
That's right.

524
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,020
If you achieve that,

525
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,980
I'll wear your shirt to school.

526
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,420
Fine.

527
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,980
It's a promise, okay?

528
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,980
Okay.

529
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,980
Just you wait.

530
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,140
You'd better keep your words.

531
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,980
The photography club.

532
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,180
The drama club.

533
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,500
P'Sab.

534
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,980
-What's the matter?
-This is very interesting.

535
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,100
There are so many clubs here.

536
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,260
I don't know which to choose.

537
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,020
I'm sure we won't be able to
make up our mind by today

538
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,140
when there are so many clubs.

539
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,140
P'Kit, Tong.

540
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,820
Phai.

541
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,300
-Hello, P'Kit.
-Hello, P'Kit.

542
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,980
P'Kit, is your lesson over?

543
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,980
Yeah.

544
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,580
But I need to head to the library.

545
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,420
Wow!

546
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,730
You're so hard-working.

547
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,100
Do you even have time to date P'Mark?

548
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,580
Hey!

549
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,620
[Kit, how are you?]

550
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,620
Erm,

551
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,260
I'll head to the library first.

552
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,740
Goodbye, P'Kit.

553
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,540
Goodbye, P'Kit.

554
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,500
-Goodbye, P'Kit.
-Goodbye.

555
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,980
What should we do about the clubs?

556
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,250
I need to use the washroom.

557
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,100
Erm.

558
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,660
Phai,

559
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,460
Ga Lei,

560
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,300
don't forget about our gathering tonight.

561
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,380
Yeah, I didn't forget it.

562
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,780
Erm,

563
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,820
where were we going again?

564
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,900
It's a secret.

565
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,050
Pok and Tong,

566
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,780
seems like there's something going on
between you two.

567
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,580
What do you mean?

568
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,460
This is our situation right now.

569
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,820
Oh!

570
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,970
Sandee, where are you going?

571
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,940
Phai?

572
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,060
I thought you were planning
to join a club?

573
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,980
What are you doing here?

574
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,300
There's a washroom over there.

575
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,460
It's just

576
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,980
that I'm used to the washroom here.

577
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,530
Is it strange?

578
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
It wouldn't be

579
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,300
if you didn't follow P'Kit on purpose.

580
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,860
So,

581
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,420
did you tail me?

582
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,370
Was that the case?

583
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,490
Why are you following P'Kit?

584
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,660
What are you up to?

585
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,180
I told you already.

586
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,460
I'm here to use the washroom.

587
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,970
I realised that you were acting strange

588
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,730
since the School's Star
and School's Moon trials.

589
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,020
You seemed happy

590
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,880
when you saw P'Thanu arguing with P'Wayu.

591
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,850
What exactly are you trying to do?

592
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,460
Since you were keeping an eye on me,

593
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,420
I guess there's no need
to hide this from you anymore.

594
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,260
Listen carefully, Phai.

595
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,050
I'm going to help P'Thanu

596
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,900
to return to your side.

597
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,260
What do you mean?

598
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,140
Do you really not understand?

599
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,020
P'Wayu will discover the affair
between you and P'Thanu eventually.

600
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,180
I'm just trying
to accelerate the situation.

601
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,900
What are you up to?

602
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,700
Are you still looking for that portrait?

603
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,940
You can ask P'Wayu about that.

604
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,140
Maybe it's still in his possession.

605
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,940
Or, maybe he has torn it apart.

606
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,460
Sandee,

607
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,260
I trusted you and told you everything

608
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,620
because I saw you as my friend.

609
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,340
How could you give P'Wayu that portrait?

610
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,460
I just want to solve the problem between

611
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,740
you and P'Thanu.

612
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,460
I want everything to get back
on the right track.

613
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,580
Sandee, you'd better remember this.

614
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,740
I will never be the third wheel
in someone's relationship.

615
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,900
The person whom P'Thanu loves

616
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,930
is P'Wayu.

617
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,530
Stop using me as an excuse

618
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,290
to destroy their relationship.

619
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,780
If they were destined to be together,

620
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,940
no matter what I do,

621
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,340
it wouldn't affect them, Phai.

622
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,980
I'll leave first.

623
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,660
Don't go, Sandee.

624
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,980
Phai.

625
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,100
Phai?

626
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,260
Aren't you warming up?

627
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,380
We still need to run laps
across the school.

628
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,820
Yeah.

629
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,980
Pok,

630
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,180
must we do this?

631
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,420
Are you sure we can do this?

632
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,580
The school is huge, you know?

633
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,300
Of course we can do this.

634
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,020
It's lonely to run alone.

635
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,060
That's why I asked you two
to accompany me.

636
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,740
Do you think I'm very free?

637
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,940
I have plenty of things to do, you know?

638
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,340
Just join me for this session.

639
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,540
I'll treat you to a meal.

640
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,540
P'Mark, P'Wayu.

641
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,420
Hello.

642
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,540
-Hello.
-Hello.

643
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,420
Where are you guys going?

644
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm just bringing him outside

645
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,180
to train his body.

646
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,100
Look at his little belly.

647
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,500
Pee, this is such a coincidence.

648
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,140
We were planning to jog.

649
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,780
Would you like to join us?

650
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,740
I need to meet up with P'Kit later.

651
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,820
Sorry that I can't join you guys today.

652
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,380
What a pity.

653
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,580
P'Wayu, would you like to join us?

654
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,420
What a coincidence.

655
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,500
Phai is your direct junior.

656
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,340
Everyone says

657
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,540
that seniors and juniors
can know each other better

658
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,060
if they jog together.

659
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,930
It's just like

660
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,340
how you can know each other's intention

661
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,460
by just looking into each other's eyes.

662
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,540
Sure.

663
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,980
Phai, let's go.

664
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,450
Let's compete.

665
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,100
Wait, P'Wayu.

666
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,660
I...

667
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,300
I admit,

668
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,020
there have been several coincidences

669
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,300
between me and Phai.

670
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,540
But, it won't happen again in the future.

671
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,250
It's because my future

672
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:17,420
only consists of you.

673
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,730
Regarding the visions in our mind,

674
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,620
or

675
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,810
scenes regarding our fate,

676
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,100
I hope you can forget about them.

677
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,740
[And now, we have the chance]

678
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,340
to encounter each other again.

679
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,060
Wayu, give me a chance.

680
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,180
I will compensate for my past mistakes.

681
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,740
[I'm very sorry that
I have to tell you this.]

682
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,620
But, I've made up my mind.

683
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,460
I will never let Wayu be sad again.

684
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,260
If it's possible,

685
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,780
we shouldn't

686
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,460
see each other again.

687
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,980
No matter what happens,

688
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,140
we will face them together,

689
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,980
hand in hand.

690
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,020
[I'm willing to withdraw from this
relationship for the person I love.]

691
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,340
Did you see that?

692
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,980
It was just a coincidence between us.

693
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,100
I was overthinking it.

694
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,420
That's why you don't need
to worry about it anymore.

695
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,940
Thank you, Phai.

696
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,940
Hey.

697
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,570
Phai,

698
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:41,420
why did you stop running?

699
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,980
I didn't want to compete with you.

700
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,620
But why?

701
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,460
If we compete with each other,

702
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,500
someone will win and someone will lose.

703
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,410
I don't want to lose or win.

704
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,770
Phai,

705
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,060
you gave me the portrait
P'Thanu drew for you.

706
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,660
What else do you want to do?

707
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,380
I didn't know about that.

708
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,260
I lost that portrait long ago.

709
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,790
How come it's in your possession?

710
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,180
What do you mean?

711
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,780
Weren't you the one who sent it to me?

712
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:14,980
No.

713
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,100
I lost that portrait long ago.

714
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,330
The person who sent me the portrait

715
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,450
must've wanted me to know
the affair between you two.

716
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,930
Phai, do you know

717
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,260
who exactly he is?

718
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,260
I can't tell you who's behind that.

719
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,050
I don't know what

720
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,220
he's thinking either.

721
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,960
But, I can promise

722
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,180
that I wish for you two to be happy.

723
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,270
I think that person

724
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,390
wishes for you and P'Thanu to be together.

725
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,100
That's impossible.

726
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,140
P'Thanu will never agree to this.

727
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,460
But, you and P'Thanu
have a complicated relationship.

728
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,940
It's not the same for me.

729
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,380
I believe

730
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,450
that our hearts

731
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,050
are the only things
that can decide our relationship.

732
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:14,060
So, what's your relationship
with P'Thanu then?

733
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,930
P'Thanu is the most loyal person I know

734
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,330
when it comes to relationships.

735
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,100
Every time I see him,

736
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,580
he only mentions you.

737
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,260
I don't dare to love a person
who will never be in love with me.

738
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,940
Sorry, Phai.

739
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,820
Maybe

740
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,940
I was overthinking it.

741
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,980
Let's continue our jog.

742
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,980
We still have a long-distance race
to complete.

743
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,020
Let's go, Phai.

744
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,620
Hey!

745
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,530
Wait.

746
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,500
-Phai!
-Phai!

747
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,620
Oi!

748
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,500
I think you fell on top of an ant colony.

749
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,140
Are the ants inside your clothes?

750
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,020
Take off your clothes.

751
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,660
Take off your clothes. Let me see.

752
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,980
Are they in your clothes?

753
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,820
Let me see.

754
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:42,580
How do you feel?

755
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,020
I'm fine now.

756
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,460
Thank you.

757
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,900
Let's continue our jog then.

758
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,980
Don't try to be lazy.

759
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,140
Hurry.

760
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,460
Wait.

761
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
There's nothing between me and Phai.

762
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,500
And, you were the only person
I had set my sights on.

763
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,730
It's because the only person I love

764
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,740
is you.

765
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,290
P'Thanu is the most loyal person I know

766
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,730
when it comes to relationships.

767
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,530
Every time I see him,

768
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,980
he only mentions you.

769
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,340
You behave strangely
whenever I mention P'Thanu.

770
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,940
Tell me.

771
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,820
Don't waste my time
and wait for me to ask you about it.

772
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,660
Why did you argue with P'Thanu?

773
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,100
Join my team.

774
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,820
How long has it been

775
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,260
since we last stayed together like this?

776
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,780
One, two, three.

777
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,850
♫ I fell for you without any reason ♫

778
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:38,340
♫ I'll be satisfied
as long as you're here ♫

779
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,180
♫ I feel happy ♫

♫ And I don't know how to control it ♫

00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,340
♫ Just let it be ♫

788

♫ Because I don't need
a reason to fall for you ♫

♫ Just like that ♫

798
