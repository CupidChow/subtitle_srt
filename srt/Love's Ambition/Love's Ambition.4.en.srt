1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,959
You're from Shanxi, right?

2
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:46,719
Yes.

3
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,719
Have you ever been to Dayun County?

4
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,400
My grandma is from Dayun County.

5
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,400
From Yunlai Village.

6
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,079
Dayun County now,

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
has developed really well.

8
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
It's changed a lot.

9
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,159
Hello, Mr. Shen.

10
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,680
This is our business representative,

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Qiao Jianbin.

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello.

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
By the way, Uncle,

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,919
did you stay a few extra days on your trip?

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,680
No.

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,719
I just went for the ribbon-cutting.

17
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,719
It was a quick trip.

18
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,240
Stop watching the news.

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,199
I want to watch cartoons.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,560
Dad.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,879
Do you have time now?

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,479
I want to talk to you about

23
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,680
the old town renovation.

24
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,479
Sure, that's fine.

25
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,439
Let's go talk over there.

26
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,039
Chenchen.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Chenchen.

28
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,199
How many times have I told you?

29
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,599
Do you want to ruin your eyes?

30
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,879
Old Qiao,

31
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,800
it's time to eat.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,599
I'll finish these two big rolls

33
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,080
and then I'll come.

34
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,479
Yazhen is here.

35
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,680
Sister Sha, got your hair done?

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,879
Yazhen.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,159
Old Qiao in your family is really popular now.

39
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,800
On TV,

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,199
he speaks so well.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
He even outshines the county chief.

42
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,599
That's true.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,400
With so many stores,

44
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,319
they made me the merchant representative.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Of course I had to say something.

46
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,280
Right?

47
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,439
No wonder your daughter turned out so well.

48
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,560
I remember the younger one,

49
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,240
she went to work.

50
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,719
But what's the point?

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
She never even calls.

52
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,439
Only on holidays

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,039
she sends a message.

54
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,840
Our Linlin is still the best.

55
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,919
She stays peacefully

56
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,960
by her parents' side.

57
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,199
That's our little sweetheart.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,039
By the way,

59
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,080
your Linlin

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
is she getting married soon?

61
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Soon, very soon.

62
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,639
My son-in-law

63
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,719
is a future banker.

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,840
Miss,

65
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,800
I work in Dayun County's

66
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
largest fertilizer factory as a buyer.

67
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,879
All the holiday group purchase benefits

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,759
are managed by me.

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Let's add each other on WeChat.

70
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,639
If there's a good deal,

71
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,240
I'll let you know.

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,080
If you need anything,

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,199
just come to our counter.

74
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,400
Please take this.

75
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,080
You're so by-the-book,

76
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,479
how do you make money?

77
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,879
Many sales ladies want to add me,

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,919
but they can't even get through.

79
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,120
Your hand is so pale,

80
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,080
are you sick or something?

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,439
I'll pick you up after work tonight.

82
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,040
Are you sick?

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,399
You...

84
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,079
Stop right there!

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,319
Did I say you could touch me?

86
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,480
Honey!

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
She hit me!

88
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,240
Why did you hit her?

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,279
Why did you hit me?

90
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,439
You... you bitch!

91
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,720
Are you crazy?

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,319
Let go of me!

93
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,000
What's going on here?

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Let go of me!

95
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,839
Let go!

96
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,879
I'm going to report you!

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,000
Linlin!

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,920
Linlin!

99
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,399
You promised to come to our house

100
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,279
to discuss the wedding.

101
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,079
Dad, Mom,

102
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,040
we're back.

103
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,079
Troublemaker!

104
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,319
You still have the nerve to come back.

105
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,120
Auntie, I'm not—

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,560
Linlin!

107
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,120
Dad

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Come

109
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,199
Have some fruit

110
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,160
Dad

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
This is from you and Mom

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,079
for Qiao Lin and my wedding

113
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,120
After the bride price for Qiao Lin's family

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,959
the rings

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
and all the other miscellaneous

116
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,360
expenses are deducted

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,439
there's ninety-eight thousand

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,759
six hundred fifty-four yuan left

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Let me ask one more thing

120
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,199
The wedding gift money

121
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:33,879
will go to you

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,399
Qiao Lin and I discussed it

123
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,639
I'll go through each item

124
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,079
The wedding photos cost

125
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,319
nine thousand five hundred eighty-eight

126
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
The wedding planner

127
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,160
I picked a mid-range one

128
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
eighteen thousand eight hundred

129
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,879
Out-of-town guests' lodging

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,319
I booked twenty standard rooms

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,600
Each room is two hundred eighty-eight

132
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,040
Total is five thousand seven hundred sixty

133
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,600
Cigarettes, alcohol, candy, tea

134
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,639
We'll provide ourselves

135
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,560
Fifteen thousand yuan is enough

136
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,480
I booked twenty banquet tables

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
Each table costs

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,720
one thousand two hundred eighty-eight

139
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,279
Twenty tables for the banquet

140
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,439
How is that enough

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:10,720
Mom

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Our bank has rules

143
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,920
for weddings and funerals

144
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
must be within twenty tables

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,040
can't go over the limit

146
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,639
Otherwise, my boss and I

147
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,639
will be affected

148
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,439
Did your work ever say

149
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,399
family often goes to the police station

150
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,040
or precinct

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,240
if that affects you

152
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,839
Auntie

153
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,079
Just say what you want

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,279
Don't be so sarcastic here

155
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,759
Okay?

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,199
I'm being sarcastic?

157
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,040
You, a young woman

158
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,920
always so reckless

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,680
Why do you never

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
think before you act

161
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,920
That police station

162
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
do you think it's your own home

163
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,759
You go there several times a month

164
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:47,839
Auntie, this

165
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,360
isn't my fault

166
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,720
Today it was that guy

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,839
He started acting obscene

168
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,519
Enough

169
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,040
Say less

170
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,839
Qiao Lin

171
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,959
You're Lin Tao's fiancée

172
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Our county isn't big

173
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,839
If you keep causing trouble

174
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,199
if word gets out

175
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,879
it'll affect Lin Tao's job

176
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,759
Do you know that

177
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,360
If his job is affected

178
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,720
will you be happy

179
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,879
My son

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,720
graduated from a top university

181
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
with a master's degree

182
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,959
He's a bank client manager now

183
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,160
He'll be promoted to section chief

184
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,079
branch manager

185
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,120
and eventually bank president

186
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,759
Look at what you're doing now

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,439
Aren't you ruining my son's

188
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
bright future

189
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,879
If you want to blame someone

190
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,360
we shouldn't have agreed to your marriage

191
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,079
Qiao Lin

192
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,959
I've calculated it

193
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,680
There's still

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,959
seventeen thousand eight hundred sixty-six

195
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,839
Should be enough for us

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,639
to go on our honeymoon

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Go by yourself

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,480
Qiao Lin

199
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,240
What are you doing

200
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,480
Working

201
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,120
What's wrong

202
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Nothing

203
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,519
When will you visit home

204
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,480
Qiao Lin

205
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,320
Have an apple

206
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,519
Thank you, Dad

207
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,039
Dad

208
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
The bride price Lin Tao gave our family

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,240
Did you use it

210
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,559
Yes, we did

211
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,279
Didn't we agree that

212
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,039
this money would renovate the new shop

213
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,519
and after selling the old shop

214
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,720
we'd pay you back

215
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,039
What's wrong

216
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,559
Lin Tao's family

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,360
said something

218
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,759
No, they haven't

219
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm just asking

220
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,600
Your wedding

221
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
How's the planning going

222
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,679
He's too busy at work

223
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,639
I've been busy too lately

224
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,279
Yeah

225
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,720
I might have a business trip soon

226
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,960
The company is sending us

227
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,720
to Jingzhou for training

228
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,159
To Jingzhou

229
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,320
How long will you be gone

230
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,720
Did you tell Lin Tao

231
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,879
Not yet

232
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,480
No

233
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,399
Qiao Lin

234
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,639
This business trip

235
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,519
You should let Lin Tao know

236
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,600
Lin Tao works at the bank now too

237
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,519
He's a key employee

238
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,720
He cares about reputation

239
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,240
You two need to get along

240
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,279
Exactly

241
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,840
You're about to get married

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,039
Can't always think of yourself

243
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,639
You know

244
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,639
Whatever it is

245
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,200
discuss it with Lin Tao

246
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
Did you hear

247
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,879
I heard

248
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,879
Yeah

249
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,240
From now on, you two should

250
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,480
live your own lives

251
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,720
peacefully

252
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,080
stay close to Mom and Dad

253
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
Don't be like your sister

254
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,759
This daughter

255
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,759
is as good as not having one

256
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,480
The guest list and schedule for the family dinner

257
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,639
must be triple-checked.

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,360
If there are any issues,

259
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,440
you can always contact me.

260
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,399
Don't worry.

261
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Sis,

262
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,200
tonight

263
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,080
our department is having a dinner.

264
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,720
Do you want to join us?

265
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,360
I won't go tonight.

266
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,480
My boyfriend is picking me up.

267
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,799
Boyfriend? Really?

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
Isn't he actually our brother-in-law?

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,480
Get home early tonight, okay?

270
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,159
Okay.

271
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,039
Enjoy your date tonight.

272
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,679
I'm heading out.

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,799
Yan Yan,

274
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,759
Qiao Yan.

275
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,679
Do you think I'm lucky today?

276
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,840
I just happened to catch you after work.

277
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,399
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

278
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,279
where to find you.

279
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,840
Why are you here?

280
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,240
I called off the wedding.

281
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
Now I'm totally free.

282
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,759
I thought I'd come to the big city

283
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,799
and see what I can do.

284
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,399
But I haven't found a place yet.

285
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,480
I'll crash at your place for a couple days.

286
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,600
There's a café across the street.

287
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,879
Let's go talk there.

288
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,759
Alright, alright.

289
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,000
Why go to a café?

290
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,600
That's a waste of money.

291
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,039
Let's go.

292
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,799
We'll talk at your place.

293
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,159
It's fine to chat there.

294
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,360
Yan Yan,

295
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,879
Is that your boyfriend?

296
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Then he's my brother-in-law.

297
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,759
Hello, brother-in-law.

298
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,000
And you are...?

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,279
I'm...

300
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,960
My cousin.

301
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,600
She came to see me.

302
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
Hello, cousin.

303
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm picking her up for dinner after work.

304
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,559
Why don't we all go together?

305
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,159
My cousin just arrived.

306
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,320
She's a bit tired.

307
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,320
I need to find a hotel

308
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
so she can settle in.

309
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,960
Alright.

310
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,080
Okay.

311
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
That restaurant tonight

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,039
will have to wait for another day.

313
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Is that okay?

314
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,039
Sure.

315
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,120
Get home early then.

316
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,639
Once I'm home,

317
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,919
I'll call you.

318
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,200
Go ahead.

319
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,039
Bye, cousin.

320
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,120
Be careful.

321
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,039
Drive safe.

322
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,080
This place is pretty nice.

323
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
The transport is convenient too.

324
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,000
Qiao Yan,

325
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,600
Why did you say I'm your cousin?

326
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,919
There's a fridge too.

327
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,840
You can buy whatever you want at the store.

328
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,759
I can see it now.

329
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,840
It's because your boyfriend

330
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,720
is too good for you.

331
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,639
So you look down on

332
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,559
your useless sister like me.

333
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:47,960
Is that it?

334
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,919
Just stay a few days and go home.

335
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,639
What do you mean by that?

336
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,279
You called off the wedding and ran away.

337
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,600
You didn't tell Mom and Dad, did you?

338
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
They'll be looking for you everywhere.

339
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,039
Yeah.

340
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
I'll wait until I'm settled

341
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
then I'll tell them.

342
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,120
It's the same thing.

343
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,799
No, don't change the subject.

344
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm asking you,

345
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,159
why can't you

346
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,039
tell your boyfriend

347
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
that I'm your real sister?

348
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:22,960
Grandma and I

349
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,159
are on the same household register.

350
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,480
My surname is Xu.

351
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,200
Not Qiao.

352
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,759
So from the start,

353
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,519
you should've known

354
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,120
my only family

355
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,039
is Grandma.

356
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,679
Yes.

357
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,600
I know you weren't close

358
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,799
to Mom and Dad growing up.

359
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,159
But I never thought

360
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,960
we weren't family.

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,720
That's just how you feel.

362
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,679
Qiao Lin,

363
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
You showed up without warning

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,159
and came looking for me.

365
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,480
I've done all I can.

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,399
I've gone above and beyond.

367
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,360
When your money runs out,

368
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,480
just go home early.

369
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,919
Don't make them worry.

370
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,480
But if you want to stay, that's fine.

371
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,320
But I have no obligation

372
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,279
to take care of you.

373
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:12,759
Qiao Yan,

374
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,039
If I'd known you felt this way,

375
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,639
from the start,

376
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,480
I wouldn't have come to you.

377
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,960
Do you know that?

378
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,600
My surname is Xu.

379
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,080
Xu Yan.

380
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,080
You—you're called Qiao Yan.

381
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,320
You're Qiao Yan, Qiao.

382
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,879
This is the price of your coldness.

383
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,519
Stupid Qiao Yan!

384
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,840
I shouldn't have saved you back then.

385
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,600
Wild child, wild child!

386
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:34,840
Wild child!

387
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,200
Wild child!

388
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Wild child, wild child!

389
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,480
Move aside, I'm going home!

390
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,639
Little Qiao Yan, no one praises you.

391
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,399
Wild child, no parents.

392
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,080
Who are you? How dare you push me?

393
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
None of your business.

394
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,080
Who dares bully my sister?

395
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,360
Do you dare?

396
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,559
We don't dare, we don't dare!

397
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
You are my sister.

398
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,319
Qiao Yan is here.

399
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,680
She's old enough for elementary school.

400
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,519
Her studies can't be delayed.

401
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,039
You must find her

402
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,359
a school in Dayun County.

403
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,960
All these years,

404
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,880
as her parents,

405
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,519
you haven't fulfilled

406
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
your parental duties at all.

407
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,880
But when it comes to her schooling,

408
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,119
you both must

409
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,319
do your best

410
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,480
and take responsibility, understand?

411
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
Yes, Mom.

412
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,720
We came this time

413
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,119
to bring Qiao Yan

414
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,400
back home for school.

415
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
All these years,

416
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,799
you've raised her alone.

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,960
It's been so hard for you.

418
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,799
Alright, alright.

419
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,039
No need for nice words.

420
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,119
Do you know

421
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,519
Qiao Yan tells

422
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,240
the neighbors' kids

423
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
what?

424
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,640
She says her parents

425
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,799
are abroad.

426
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,519
She's so little, she

427
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,279
How did she learn to lie?

428
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,839
When you had Qiao Lin,

429
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
you insisted on having a boy.

430
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,400
You knew

431
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,039
Yazhen wasn't healthy.

432
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,200
All these years,

433
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,640
her health has been ruined.

434
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,240
Now you have a girl,

435
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,559
and you don't like her.

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
She has a congenital heart disease.

437
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,839
Will you not even

438
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,680
save her life?

439
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,279
As parents,

440
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,319
don't you feel any guilt?

441
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:28,720
Mom.

442
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,440
Mom.

443
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,799
We know we were wrong.

444
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,000
We'll take Qiao Yan home this time

445
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,039
and treat her well.

446
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
We'll make up for what she missed.

447
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:38,559
Mom.

448
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,440
Slow down, slow down.

449
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,039
Alright.

450
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:50,640
We're home.

451
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,960
Come in.

452
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
This is Mom and Dad's home.

453
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,559
It will be your home too.

454
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,000
From now on,

455
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,839
you'll live with your sister

456
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,839
in this room.

457
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:00,680
Alright?

458
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,279
Dad will take your luggage

459
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,119
inside for you.

460
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,799
These pretty clothes

461
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,119
Grandma packed for you.

462
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,720
At Mom and Dad's house,

463
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,079
be sensible and obedient.

464
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,519
If you can do it yourself,

465
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,640
do it yourself.

466
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,359
And these things you like,

467
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,839
Grandma brought them all.

468
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,359
At mealtime,

469
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,119
don't fight with your sister.

470
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,000
Understand?

471
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,599
Grandma will miss you.

472
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,440
Come, take a look.

473
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,279
This is home.

474
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,119
Alright, it's getting late.

475
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,799
Let's bathe and go to bed.

476
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,960
Come, Mom will bathe you.

477
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,400
Mom, I can bathe myself.

478
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

479
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,920
Qiao Yan will bathe herself.

480
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:04,880
Alright then,

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,920
take off your dirty clothes.

482
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,079
Mom will wash them, okay?

483
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,759
Mom, I can wash my clothes.

484
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,759
Why does it smell so much like gas?

485
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:14,839
Qiao Lin.

486
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,519
Qiao Lin.

487
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,400
Qiao Lin.

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,799
Wake up, don't scare Dad.

489
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,240
What's wrong with the child?

490
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Someone, help!

491
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,920
Help! Help!

492
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,119
What's going on?

493
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,000
It's gas poisoning.

494
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,480
Qiao Lin, wake up.

495
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,160
Qiao Lin.

496
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,640
Call 120 for me.

497
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,839
Okay, okay, don't panic.

498
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,440
Qiao Lin.

499
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,799
Wake up, wake up.

500
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,359
Don't scare Dad.

501
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:42,839
Qiao Lin.

502
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,799
Wake up, wake up, Qiao Lin.

503
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:45,799
Qiao Lin.

504
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,039
What's happening?

505
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:47,839
Old Qiao.

506
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,640
Qiao Lin has gas poisoning.

507
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,240
Where did you go?

508
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,720
You left without turning off the gas.

509
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,440
Qiao Lin.

510
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,599
Qiao Lin, are you alright?

511
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,319
Stop shouting here.

512
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,119
Go call an ambulance!

513
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,920
Old Qiao.

514
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,079
Where's Qiao Yan?

515
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,480
Qiao Yan.

516
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,319
Is anyone else here?

517
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,200
Qiao Yan.

518
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:07,920
Help me out.

519
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,039
It's all Dad's fault.

520
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,559
Dad is sorry.

521
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,559
Sweet daughter.

522
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,079
Come.

523
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,000
Have a banana.

524
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,759
Dad will feed you.

525
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,680
Open your mouth.

526
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,119
Have another bite.

527
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,119
A big bite.

528
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,720
Come on.

529
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,119
Good girl.

530
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,599
When we get home, Mom will make

531
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,920
your favorite braised pork.

532
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,759
Alright?

533
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,920
Qiao Yan.

534
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,000
You came back just in time.

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,599
Your sister got into a fight outside.

536
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:51,759
We need to go quickly.

537
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,200
We'll have instant noodles for dinner.

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,119
Old Qiao, hurry up.

539
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,039
Happy birthday to you.

540
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,480
Happy birthday to you.

541
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,160
Happy birthd—

542
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,799
Qiao Yan, is that you?

543
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,519
Happy birthday.

544
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,119
Grandma.

545
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,440
Alright, alright, don't cry.

546
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,799
Come to Grandma's house.

547
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,319
Grandma will make you something tasty.

548
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,599
Okay?

549
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,759
Look at you.

550
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
All you do is fight every day.

551
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,759
You even fight with boys.

552
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,519
He's your classmate.

553
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,920
What if you hurt him?

554
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,160
See?

555
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,000
Every day, the teacher

556
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:50,960
calls us out.

557
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,359
We have to apologize every day.

558
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Keep your voice down.

559
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,359
Someone's sleeping.

560
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,599
We have to pay for checkups.

561
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,160
And treat people to meals.

562
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,000
And apologize again.

563
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,839
See? See?

564
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,240
Your sister is so well-behaved.

565
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,039
But you,

566
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,480
you just fight all day long.

567
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,759
You never let us relax.

568
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,319
Mom, I'm hungry.

569
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,119
Alright, alright.

570
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Hungry, hungry, hungry.

571
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,359
We just apologized to them.

572
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,440
We haven't eaten anything.

573
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,279
Come on, okay.

574
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,359
I'll heat this up now.

575
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,519
Come here.

576
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,200
What do you want for the main dish?

577
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,759
Want noodles?

578
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,319
Noodles, noodles.

579
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,039
Mom, I'm hungry.

580
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,519
Take a bath first.

581
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:18,839
Mom.

582
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,759
Eat after you bathe.

583
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm hungry.

584
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,279
Wash yourself.

585
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
I'll hurry and wash these clothes.

586
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,680
You need them for tomorrow.

587
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,160
Wrap up a bit.

588
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,039
Don't catch a chill.

589
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,200
Qiao Yan's recent mock exams

590
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,440
have all been excellent.

591
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,079
She's in the top thirty of her grade.

592
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,319
Getting into Jingzhou's top university
shouldn't be a problem.

593
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,480
As for which major to choose,

594
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,119
go home

595
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,279
and discuss it with her.

596
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,799
Help her make the decision.

597
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,359
For her to achieve

598
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
such good results,

599
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,240
we must thank the teacher's dedication.

600
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,160
However,

601
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,960
she won't take the college entrance exam.

602
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,960
The family has other plans for her.

603
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,960
Giving up the exam

604
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,799
with Qiao Yan's grades

605
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,799
is truly a shame.

606
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,160
About this,

607
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,519
have you discussed it with her?

608
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,160
What does she want?

609
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,480
Children can't understand

610
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,599
the family's difficulties.

611
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,680
Family matters

612
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,039
are decided by me.

613
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,920
What gives you the right

614
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,039
to stop me from taking the exam?

615
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,880
I'm talking to your teacher.

616
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,599
What gives you the right

617
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,200
to stop me from taking the exam?

618
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,319
Because I'm your father.

619
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,119
Because I'm the head of this family.

620
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,119
Sorry, teacher.

621
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,599
Excuse me.

622
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,559
Sorry you had to see this.

623
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
This is final.

624
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,480
Let's go home.

625
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,839
Why won't you let me go to college?

626
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,559
Dad.

627
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,559
Why won't you let me
go to college?

628
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,240
Dad, wait for me.

629
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,799
Wait a second.

630
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,480
Wait a moment.

631
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,559
Just wait for me.

632
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,759
Why?

633
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,839
Why?

634
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,240
Why?

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
Why?

636
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,200
Because our family is poor.

637
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Because college tuition

638
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:41,920
and living expenses are high.

639
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,039
Our family can't afford

640
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,160
to support two college students.

641
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,480
So we had to decide

642
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,119
to let your sister Qiao Lin
take the exam.

643
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,279
Dad, what about me?

644
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,759
Then... what about me?

645
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,319
After you finish high school,

646
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,680
we'll help you

647
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,720
find a job.

648
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
That way, you can stay

649
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,440
with Mom and Dad.

650
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,960
If anything happens,

651
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,720
we can take care of you.

652
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,519
No.

653
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,720
I...

654
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
I want to know why.

655
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,359
Why have you always

656
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,039
been so biased?

657
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,519
Why does Qiao Lin
get everything good?

658
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,319
Am I...

659
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,359
Am I not

660
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
your real daughter?

661
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,960
Why do you

662
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,759
keep telling me

663
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,240
my parents don't love me?

664
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,359
I thought

665
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,079
if I kept lying to myself,

666
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,519
if I studied hard,

667
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,680
tried to be sensible,

668
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,000
and obeyed you,

669
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,200
you would like me.

670
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,960
Why do you make me

671
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,599
lose even the right to lie
to myself?

672
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,039
I...

673
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,480
What did I ever do
to let you down?

674
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,000
You've grown up,

675
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,440
never lacking food,
clothes, or anything.

676
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,079
Why can't you

677
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,160
be a little understanding?

678
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,079
That's because you never

679
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,039
told me the truth,

680
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,359
and took away my right
to study.

681
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,759
What you did is stealing.

682
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,920
What you did is robbing.

683
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,519
Is this how

684
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,799
you talk to your father?

685
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,200
That's too disrespectful.

686
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,160
You're so unfilial.

687
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,960
Even if you go to college,

688
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,400
you'll still be ungrateful.

689
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,640
Am I really such a bad child?

690
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,359
Did I really do something wrong?

691
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,880
I don't understand.

692
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,640
I don't understand.

693
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Why?

694
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,759
Why do you keep proving

695
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,599
how much you don't love me?

696
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,160
Why?

697
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,759
Why did I have to be

698
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,960
your daughter?

699
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,799
Grandma.

700
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,599
Grandma.

701
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,519
I'm here, I'm here.

702
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,039
Yan Yan.

703
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,319
You...

704
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:13,640
Grandma.

705
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,400
Grandma knows

706
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,000
you've been wronged.

707
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,759
Look at you.

708
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,000
You're all soaked.

709
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,799
Hey, Haoming.

710
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,279
What are you doing?

711
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm on my way home.

712
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,359
Can you come by

713
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,680
my studio?

714
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,519
Now?

715
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,599
Yes.

716
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,319
Come quickly.

717
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,279
Okay.

718
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,559
Driver, change the address.

719
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,559
What's wrong?

720
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,240
It's grown a flower stalk.

721
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,759
It's sixty years old
this year.

722
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,119
I think

723
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,480
tonight

724
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,559
it will definitely bloom.

725
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,079
If it really blooms,

726
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
this will be the brightest
moment

727
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,039
of its life.

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,880
I hope I can witness it

729
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,599
together with you.

730
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
I remember you said before

731
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,799
Agave

732
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,079
blooms only once
in its lifetime.

733
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,240
So after it blooms,

734
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,680
it dies.

735
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
After blooming,

736
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,079
the plant quickly withers.

737
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,640
Its energy is spent,
its light goes out.

738
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,480
In the end,

739
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,920
it returns to dust.

740
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,359
It uses up all

741
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,920
the nutrients it gathered
in its life,

742
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,880
endures hardship,

743
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,599
just to wait for this
moment to bloom.

744
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,359
This is truly

745
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,359
its life's swan song.

746
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,759
What's wrong?

747
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,279
I just feel

748
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,440
it's heartbreaking.

749
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,000
It spends its whole life
overcoming

750
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,000
and struggling to grow,

751
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,079
just for one moment
of blooming.

752
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,119
Because it has no choice,

753
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,440
it must be stronger

754
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,680
than others,

755
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,599
work harder,

756
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,200
endure more,

757
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,119
to finally achieve

758
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
a beautiful result.

759
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,240
A long wait,

760
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,960
enduring wind and rain,

761
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,839
is the price it pays.

762
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,240
Bloom and bear fruit

763
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,720
Grow old, be reborn

764
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The cycle repeats

765
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,799
This is nature's law

766
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,639
But when each agave

767
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,719
blooms

768
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,159
its pollen

769
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,960
drifts everywhere

770
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,760
and meets another agave

771
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,679
they pollinate each other

772
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,800
creating more seeds

773
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,079
These seeds

774
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,559
are what they leave

775
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,480
in this world

776
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,000
the continuation of life

777
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,079
It's just like people

778
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,840
Meeting

779
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,159
Falling in love

780
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,159
Getting married

781
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,960
Having children

782
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,880
After a hundred years

783
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,000
Even though

784
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,039
people may be gone

785
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,320
their love will carry on

786
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,239
When two agaves meet

787
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
they go toward each other

788
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,599
with all their might

789
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,760
even at the cost of life

790
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
Because they know

791
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
this love

792
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,960
is worth it

793
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,920
They never regret it

794
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,639
Just like you and me

795
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
Meeting you

796
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,920
Being with you

797
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,679
No matter what I have to give

798
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,719
no matter the cost

799
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,320
I will never

800
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,519
regret it

801
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,320
What about you

802
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,800
Think carefully

803
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
I do regret a little

804
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,960
Regret that we're marrying next month

805
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,760
We should have

806
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:47,960
married sooner

807
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,800
Let's put this agave

808
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,400
in the pond too, okay

809
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,559
So it will have company

810
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,719
Okay
