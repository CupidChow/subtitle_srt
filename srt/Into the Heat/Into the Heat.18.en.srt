1
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,640
Who lives in this house?

2
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
I checked, the owner is Yang Kaixin.

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,040
He's a professor at the conservatory.

4
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,280
Is the deceased him?

5
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,640
Can't be sure, the body's decomposed.

6
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,840
Decomposed? What do you mean?

7
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,640
We called a locksmith.

8
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,840
They opened the door.

9
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
You'll understand once you go in.

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
We can go in now.

11
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,519
Yes, the forensics team just left.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
The medical examiner is still inside.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Captain Liu.

14
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
We're in trouble, boss.

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
I even wore a new pair of shoes.

16
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
I thought, since it's Xia Yu's birthday...

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
Then when it's your birthday,

18
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,159
let him buy you a new pair, problem solved.

19
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,719
Here.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
Didn't you say not to wear it?

21
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,680
It's for you to use in case you throw up.

22
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,360
You underestimate me, boss.

23
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,560
Brother Zhang.

24
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm here.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,319
Morning.

26
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,120
Teacher Qin.

27
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,479
What's this red stuff?

28
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,759
Maggot shells.

29
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,719
Stick to the edge when you walk past.

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,840
Your forensics team

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,319
Why did you leave so quickly today?

32
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,439
We finished collecting everything.

33
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,199
Nothing useful was found.

34
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,400
It's been too long.

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,159
Even if there was anything, it would have been destroyed by the body fluids.

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,159
How long has it been?

37
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,120
At least a few months.

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,039
Look how badly decomposed it is.

39
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,719
This isn't just badly decomposed.

40
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,960
There's nothing left.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,319
Exactly.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I'm worried too.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
I'm thinking about how to transport the whole thing back.

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,919
Master, if Xia Yu were here,

45
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,120
would he faint?

46
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,680
I wouldn't.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,879
Master, I just finished my work.

48
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,439
I heard there was a case, so I rushed over.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Here, put on a mask. Don't throw up here.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I didn't bring one.

51
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,360
Is there a phone at the scene?

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,159
Haven't seen one.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,439
Are there any clues on the body right now?

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
Clues?

55
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,919
Judging by the physical features,

56
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,280
it's a male. The rest depends on luck.

57
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,879
Can you two see clearly from that far away?

58
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,319
We can see clearly, sir.

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,199
Get closer.

60
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,840
Where are you now?

61
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,280
Hurry up.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
I can't handle this by myself.

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,159
You'll know when you get here. Hurry up!

64
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,479
How did that thing end up there?

65
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,719
This cardboard box—

66
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,680
When we first came in, it was at the door.

67
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,560
Judging by the bloodstains on the wall,

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,279
and the position of the body,

69
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,240
it was probably a slash to the neck from behind.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,639
Looks like it.

71
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,279
A neck slash from behind.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Could it be that the killer knew the victim?

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
There was no sign of defense.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
You two—

75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,279
Check inside the room.

76
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,720
Mr. Qin, can we go in?

77
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,120
All evidence has been collected. You can go in.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
You can enter the bedroom too.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
Keep an eye out.

80
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,680
Sir.

81
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,519
Professor Yang sure has a high standard of living.

82
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,480
Even his mouthwash is imported.

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,240
What is this?

84
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,079
Bianzhong

85
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,240
An ancient musical instrument

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,519
I just heard a police officer mention it

87
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,519
He said Professor Yang teaches this

88
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
He seems to be an authority on it

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,439
The most important thing right now

90
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,040
is to identify the deceased

91
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,360
Wearing only underwear

92
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,279
The deceased most likely lived here

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,079
You two go check around the area

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,160
See if Professor Yang himself lived here

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,959
If so

96
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,480
Was he living alone or with others?

97
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,319
If it was rented out

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,439
Ask who the tenants are

99
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,160
Understood, okay

100
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,240
No one's here, right?

101
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,399
Let's go, let's head down first

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,319
Boss, we've confirmed from multiple sources

103
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,879
The resident in 201

104
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,680
Usually, only Professor Yang lives there

105
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,879
What about his family?

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
His family has four members

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,959
His wife, a son, and a daughter

108
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,319
His wife's name is Wu Minru

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,399
His son's name is Yang Mo

110
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,399
His daughter's name is Yang Wei

111
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,920
Why don't they live together?

112
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,519
We'd have to ask his family about that

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,240
It's just upstairs, 206

114
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,800
Should we go up?

115
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,079
Be careful

116
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,319
Coming, coming! Who is it?

117
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
Who are you looking for?

118
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,079
Are you Professor Yang Kaixin's...

119
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm his wife.

120
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,319
You are...

121
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,519
We're from the Haiming City Criminal Police.

122
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,199
May I ask if Professor Yang usually lives at

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
Unit 201, Building 9, Huacui?

124
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,199
Yes, that's right.

125
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,319
There was an incident there.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,959
So we're here to ask you a few questions.

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,399
An incident?

128
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
What kind of incident?

129
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,800
How many people live here?

130
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
Just my son and me.

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
My daughter doesn't come back often.

132
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,160
Doesn't Professor Yang usually come back either?

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,399
Right, we have two apartments.

134
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,560
He lives at the other one.

135
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,199
Why don't you all live together?

136
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,680
He has to supervise students, you know.

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,439
Students often come to see him.

138
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,360
To discuss academic issues.

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,600
Or to work on performance techniques and such.

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,160
He needs a separate room.

141
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,000
So we let him have that place.

142
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,319
Although this is a one-bedroom apartment,

143
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,360
it's actually quite spacious.

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,319
Usually,

145
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,920
my daughter is studying at university in Jiangning.

146
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,240
She doesn't come home very often.

147
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,519
So there's plenty of space.

148
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,600
Was that when your children were little?

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Yes.

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,600
What are your children's names?

151
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,679
My son's name is Yang Mo.

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
"Mo" as in "end."

153
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,679
My daughter's name is Yang Wei.

154
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,799
"Wei" as in "future."

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,919
Their father chose both names.

156
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,080
He said one doesn't compete to be first,

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,200
and the other is uncertain.

158
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,720
Please think carefully.

159
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,399
When was the last time you saw Professor Yang?

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,320
It's been almost half a year.

161
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,200
The last time was on his birthday.

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,759
He came back and we had a meal together.

163
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,919
When was his birthday?

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
July 2nd.

165
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,519
We haven't seen each other since then.

166
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,320
No.

167
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,559
Why? Has he been reported?

168
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,159
Reported?

169
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,960
Who would report him?

170
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,840
No.

171
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,559
I'm just asking.

172
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,039
Nonsense.

173
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,519
Where does your son work? What time does he get off?

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,799
My son works in editing.

175
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,919
No, not at that magazine.

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,399
He does sales.

177
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,919
He sells ads.

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,879
He doesn't have a fixed time to get off work.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,320
He's been on a business trip these past couple of days.

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,519
He hasn't come back yet.

181
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,200
What exactly is going on?

182
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Here's the situation.

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,519
At Professor Yang's residence,

184
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
a homicide has occurred.

185
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,600
But the victim's identity

186
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
has not yet been confirmed.

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,600
Since your son and daughter aren't home,

188
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,960
we'll need you to come with us in person.

189
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,200
A homicide?

190
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,320
I bought all of these for him.

191
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,200
Ms. Wu, please don't get upset, don't worry.

192
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
Ms. Wu, please calm down, let's talk this through.

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
Please, try to stay calm.

194
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,320
We

195
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,120
still need to confirm some things.

196
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,120
How about we call your son and daughter

197
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,879
and have them come keep you company?

198
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,519
They're both quite busy.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,720
I can handle this myself.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,559
We need to ask you a few questions.

201
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,480
From July until now,

202
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,480
it's been such a long time.

203
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,519
Haven't you been in touch with each other at all?

204
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,240
Old Yang,

205
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
he's good in every way,

206
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,919
except he doesn't like us bothering him.

207
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,159
We live close by, too.

208
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,519
If something comes up, he just comes home himself.

209
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,159
He doesn't let us call him, either.

210
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,799
So how often does he come home?

211
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,080
It's hard to say.

212
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,399
Sometimes he comes back quite often.

213
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,519
If he's especially busy over there,

214
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,000
it's normal for him to come back only once every few months.

215
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,200
So with him gone for so long,

216
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,960
hasn't the school contacted you?

217
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,200
No, they haven't.

218
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,720
How could the school not know either?

219
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
I've really seen something new today.

220
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
I've never seen anything this tragic.

221
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,480
It's been such a long time, you know.

222
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,159
What can you even tell from the body now?

223
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,399
I think we can first rule out

224
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,720
robbery and murder.

225
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
Not bad, you're making progress.

226
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,120
You can even talk about the crime scene while eating.

227
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,600
Go on.

228
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,679
You see, although there are signs of the scene being disturbed,

229
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,840
all the valuables, bankbooks,

230
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
and cards were untouched.

231
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,159
They killed someone,

232
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,519
made such a commotion,

233
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,559
and didn't take anything? That doesn't make sense.

234
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,080
So we can rule out robbery and murder.

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,120
Then the signs of disturbance at the scene

236
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,679
were most likely staged.

237
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,919
The victim was in their underwear.

238
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
The person who killed him

239
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,320
must have been someone he knew well.

240
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,960
And precisely because it was someone familiar,

241
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
they needed to fake the scene to mislead us.

242
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,080
Xiaoli

243
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,759
Bring a case of cold beer.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,799
Okay, boss.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,919
Lei, Lei!

246
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,000
What brings you here, Lei?

247
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,080
Gangzi is here.

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
I had to come.

249
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,519
You even dared to take food to go last time.

250
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
You've gotten bold.

251
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,279
Lei, stop messing around.

252
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,759
Come on, let's go.

253
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Why did it go dark? Is there a power outage?

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Happy birthday to you.

255
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
Happy birthday to you.

256
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,039
Happy birthday to you.

257
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,279
You even prepared this for me?

258
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,120
Go ahead, say it.

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,799
Make a wish.

260
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:09,799
Okay.

261
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,600
Okay.

262
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
Lei, I just went to the kitchen.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,480
Why is your table gone?

264
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,159
I threw it out.

265
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,840
You must be making money now.

266
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,639
Zhang, what does your report mean?

267
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,120
It means

268
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,759
other than the identity being confirmed,

269
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,279
nothing else can be confirmed.

270
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,320
Whether it was strangulation or stabbing,

271
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
there's no way to determine.

272
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,559
Hello, may I ask something?

273
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,120
Hello.

274
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,240
Which apartment is moving out?

275
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,960
202.

276
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:17,720
202.

277
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,480
That's right.

278
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,480
Let's go.

279
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,440
I always thought that Old Yang

280
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,840
was bound to get into trouble.

281
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,320
But I didn't expect something this serious.

282
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,759
How should I put this...

283
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,480
At Old Yang's place,

284
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,879
there was never a shortage of visitors.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,960
Lots of young girls came and went.

286
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
They said it was for lessons.

287
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
But who has lessons in the middle of the night?

288
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,080
Hey, don't gossip behind people's backs.

289
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,159
He's already dead, what's there to be afraid of?

290
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,960
It's okay, uncle.

291
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,679
We're just trying to solve the case as soon as possible.

292
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,320
Right, right, right.

293
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,039
Were they all girls? Any boys?

294
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,399
There were some.

295
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,480
Were there any conflicts?

296
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,960
Yes, around the time of the New Year.

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,240
I came back and stayed for two days.

298
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,639
One night, there was a man

299
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,759
who even went to his door.

300
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,559
At night?

301
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,159
Do you remember what he looked like?

302
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
I didn't see clearly.

303
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,120
I just listened by the door for a bit.

304
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,279
Did you hear what they were arguing about?

305
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,679
I couldn't make it out at all.

306
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,519
Besides, it's been so long.

307
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,759
I've already forgotten.

308
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,759
Master, look.

309
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,279
The person playing the chime bells here

310
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,279
is Professor Yang.

311
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,559
What did the people at the university say?

312
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,720
The university said that after last summer break

313
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,480
they haven't seen Professor Yang.

314
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,480
But for experts like Professor Yang,

315
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
they usually have a lot of freedom with their students.

316
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,919
Sometimes at home,

317
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,039
sometimes at the university.

318
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,279
People at the university also said

319
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,279
they only learned about Professor Yang's murder yesterday.

320
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Oh, right, this—

321
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,679
Dong Chunni, Yang Yan,

322
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,639
Huo Sicong, Li Li—

323
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,240
these four were Professor Yang's former students.

324
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,480
Who is Qiu Chi?

325
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,360
Professor Qiu.

326
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,000
He and Professor Yang were colleagues.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They were also rivals.

328
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,440
Only these two professors taught chime bells in the whole department.

329
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,720
Now that Professor Yang is dead,

330
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,639
Professor Qiu has no competition.

331
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,359
You should put a question mark there.

332
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,200
Someone reported arguing with Professor Yang.

333
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,079
A neighbor reported it.

334
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,880
It was a man.

335
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
In cases like this, it's usually

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
I know, I know.

337
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,880
The wife, it's always the wife.

338
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,559
The husband, it's always the husband.

339
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,839
I didn't say that this time.

340
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
What I mean is, in this world,

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,920
some people look decent on the outside,

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,839
but behind the scenes, they do disgusting things.

343
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,759
No, no, no.

344
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,519
There's no deep grudge or anything.

345
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,640
Didn't I take some time off to go to Ice City recently?

346
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,039
My comrade's daughter,

347
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,480
I've watched that kid grow up since she was little.

348
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,680
She was always good at her studies.

349
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,720
She's honest too, a class leader.

350
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,480
But her advisor,

351
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,119
that's not just sexual harassment anymore,

352
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,160
that's outright molestation.

353
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,920
Why would they come to you?

354
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
By the time you get there, it'll be too late.

355
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,279
It's hard to collect evidence in cases like this, right?

356
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,920
How can someone like him

357
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,039
even be a teacher?

358
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,839
He threatened her with her diploma.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,079
He's an animal, isn't he?

360
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,079
So how was this handled in the end?

361
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,759
How else could it be handled?

362
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,279
Why did my comrade come to me?

363
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,720
He reported it directly to the local police station.

364
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,440
The guy's been arrested now.

365
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,799
Brother Dali is so righteous.

366
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,880
He doesn't let anyone off the hook.

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
You should learn from Brother Dali.

368
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,920
Come on, Li Yugang, come here.

369
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,240
Let's go downstairs, I'll help you train.

370
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,640
No, no, no, come on.

371
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,279
We're investigating a case, stop messing around.

372
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
You're the one who taught him.

373
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,079
Alright, you guys get back to work.

374
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,920
Okay, Brother Dali.

375
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,400
Alright.

376
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
Yang Kaixin's four students

377
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,880
I think Brother Dali

378
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,839
has given us a new direction.

379
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,240
Master

380
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,680
If

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,079
this Professor Yang

382
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,680
had previously molested his female student,

383
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,880
then her father or her boyfriend

384
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
might have killed someone in a moment of impulse.

385
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,839
It's not impossible, right?

386
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,839
If the student was molested,

387
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,160
why didn't she come forward herself?

388
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,759
Wouldn't it be enough if she just spoke up herself?

389
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,559
In these situations, people are usually forced into silence.

390
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,880
After all, it affects graduation and degrees.

391
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
And in schools,

392
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,240
they usually prefer to avoid trouble.

393
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,200
So, contact the school

394
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,039
and arrange to meet these people.

395
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,920
Meet and have a talk.

396
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,039
Preferably today.

397
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,440
But don't mention we're the police.

398
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,720
Question them separately.

399
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,359
Okay.

400
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Let me put it this way.

401
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,519
He doesn't say anything.

402
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,960
If you really want to pass the course,

403
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,880
you have to pay him for extra lessons.

404
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,279
He always orders me around.

405
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
From small things like running errands to the supermarket,

406
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,319
to big things like writing academic papers for him.

407
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,519
He drained all my money and energy.

408
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,519
When was the last time you saw him?

409
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,319
After the final exam results came out last semester.

410
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,279
I even went to his office to argue with him.

411
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,400
I told him I paid the money,

412
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,359
and I took the extra lessons.

413
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,680
Why did you still fail me?

414
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,759
What about the others? Did they pass?

415
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,920
Li Li definitely didn't pass.

416
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,960
Yang Yan didn't pass either, right?

417
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't know about Dong Chunni.

418
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,759
I'm not very familiar with her.

419
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,960
He's a beast in human skin.

420
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
My biggest regret is choosing his class.

421
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,799
Then why did you choose his class back then?

422
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
I didn't know at the time.

423
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,440
We just looked at some introductions from the school.

424
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,240
And some of his personal works.

425
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,960
But once you choose, you can't change.

426
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
You just have to accept it.

427
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,200
If you offend your advisor,

428
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,759
you might not even get your diploma.

429
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,359
That's how it is.

430
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:25,880
I don't know.

431
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Besides

432
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,359
sexually harassing female students, Chunni—

433
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,200
Sexual harassment?

434
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,839
Tell me about it.

435
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,839
One time he called me

436
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,440
and asked me to come to his house.

437
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,920
Professor Yang, I can't drink.

438
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,039
Just drink a little.

439
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,400
Today is my birthday.

440
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,960
I didn't prepare a birthday gift for you.

441
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,559
Then I wish you good health, Professor.

442
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,559
Happy birthday.

443
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,000
Your presence is the best gift.

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,039
Let me toast to you.

445
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,079
In my heart,

446
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,759
you're different from the others.

447
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,880
You have insight.

448
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,480
And you study well.

449
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,599
You'll definitely have a bright future.

450
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,240
Professor Yang.

451
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,119
Where is the restroom?

452
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,880
After I came out of the restroom,

453
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,200
I secretly

454
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
turned on the recording function on my phone.

455
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,160
Yan'er, don't go.

456
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Let go of me, don't go.

457
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,759
I really like you.

458
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,000
Stay and keep me company, okay, Yan'er?

459
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
Calm down first.

460
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,880
So, you kept all this evidence?

461
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,480
Why didn't you report it to the school?

462
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,519
It's my fault.

463
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,920
I still have to finish my graduate studies.

464
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,799
If I report it,

465
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,519
what if he finds out and doesn't let me graduate?

466
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,759
After he harassed you,

467
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,599
how did you handle it?

468
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,920
Did you tell anyone?

469
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,880
I only told Chunni.

470
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,519
As soon as I told her, she exploded.

471
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,480
She wanted to confront him.

472
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,880
With her temper, something would definitely happen if she went.

473
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,319
So I persuaded her not to go.

474
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,480
Did she manage to persuade you?

475
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,519
At the time, she did.

476
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,839
But that old guy didn't restrain himself at all.

477
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,359
He kept making things difficult for her.

478
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,920
He even failed her in the final exam.

479
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
I thought this definitely wouldn't do.

480
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,559
So I found someone from outside society.

481
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,319
To teach him a lesson.

482
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,519
Someone from outside society is...

483
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,559
You mean Huzi?

484
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,039
Yeah.

485
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,920
He agreed right away at first.

486
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,799
But in the end, he didn't do anything.

487
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
And to think I even took him to his house.

488
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,759
Wait.

489
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,799
You—you took this Huzi to Professor Yang's house?

490
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,160
Yeah, twice.

491
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,759
The first time, he wasn't home.

492
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,680
We just checked out the place.

493
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,359
The second time, I even took him inside to meet him.

494
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,799
Then how do you know he didn't do anything in the end?

495
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
Well, he didn't have a bruised face,

496
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
or any broken arms or legs.

497
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,359
So I knew.

498
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,279
So who is Huzi to you?

499
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,559
We dated for a few days, I guess.

500
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,599
How did you meet?

501
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,720
We met while hanging out at a bar.

502
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,079
He rides a motorcycle too—a Harley.

503
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,480
We got along pretty well.

504
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,359
Can you call that Huzi?

505
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,640
Hello, the number you dialed is not in service.

506
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,319
We usually contact each other on QQ.

507
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,960
He blocked me.

508
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,519
Did you two have a fight before?

509
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,200
No, not that I know of. I wouldn't have known if you hadn't mentioned it.

510
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,640
See? Isn't it all normal?

511
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:33,960
Let me take a picture.

512
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,799
Alright.

513
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,839
Leave your number.

514
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,079
I'll write one for you.

515
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,079
It's fine, contact him.

516
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,440
If I have any leads,

517
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,640
I'll contact you directly.

518
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,359
It's all the same.

519
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,720
Dad has a fever and is in the hospital.

520
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,680
Nizi also has a fever.

521
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,319
If you're free tonight, go check on them.

522
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,599
Okay, I got it.

523
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,079
What were you saying about Professor Yang just now?

524
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,039
Professor Yang is not easy to deal with.

525
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,880
His students are all unlucky.

526
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
No one passes his exams the first time.

527
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,039
It's always retake after retake.

528
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,559
Hello, Tingting.

529
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,480
Where are you?

530
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,759
I'm on my way.

531
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,000
Didn't we agree on 4:30?

532
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,359
Why don't you just go straight to the restaurant?

533
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,559
If you can't pick me up,

534
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,119
let me know.

535
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,559
Then don't promise me.

536
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,759
I've been waiting here for over half an hour.

537
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,319
I have a case here.

538
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,519
It delayed me again.

539
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,640
Then you should have told me earlier.

540
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
I'll just go home by myself.

541
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,799
No, no, don't be mad.

542
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm coming to pick you up now.

543
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,359
No need, you go ahead and work.

544
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,279
I can't eat anymore.

545
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm going home.

546
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,240
We'll continue tomorrow morning. You two, don't be late.

547
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,839
Alright.

548
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,680
You can't park here for long.

549
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,839
I'm just picking someone up and then I'll leave.

550
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,039
Hurry up and park downstairs.

551
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,160
Tingting.

552
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm downstairs now.

553
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,240
Come down.

554
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
I've made plans with a friend.

555
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
You eat by yourself.

556
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,839
Is it not illegal to scald someone to death?

557
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
What about removing the hair?

558
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,640
Hello.

559
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,039
Hello, I'd like to book a room.

560
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,279
Are you staying alone?

561
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,039
Just me.

562
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,759
Okay.

563
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,720
Hello, Mom.

564
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,119
Has Diandian gone to bed?

565
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,440
She went to bed early.

566
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
I won't be picking up Diandian today.

567
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,799
Why not?

568
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,079
Where are you?

569
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,279
I'm out.

570
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Out?

571
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
You're not coming home this late at night?

572
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Where are you?

573
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,880
At a hotel.

574
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
A hotel?

575
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,599
Weren't you having dinner with friends?

576
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,880
Why are you staying at a hotel tonight?

577
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,160
Mom, stop asking. Who are you with?

578
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,799
Tingting.

579
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,000
You're not coming home tonight?

580
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,880
Aren't you afraid Liu Ziming will find out?

581
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,880
I actually want him to find out.

582
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,480
Mom.

583
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,839
I don't even know if I want to go back to that home.

584
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,359
Even if I go back, I'll still be alone.

585
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,720
Here,

586
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,119
it's no different.

587
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,599
Sis, what's wrong?

588
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,000
Li Wei came again.

589
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,400
Can you tell him not to come again?

590
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,960
He's still downstairs.

591
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,359
He left.

592
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,599
Why did he come?

593
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,920
He came to ask Nizi for money.

594
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,200
Last time, she secretly gave him two hundred.

595
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,799
Today, she gave him thirty.

596
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,400
It's all her own pocket money.

597
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,119
You need to tell Nizi

598
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,759
she absolutely can't give him any more.

599
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,079
Giving him more will only harm him.

600
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,119
Got it.

601
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't worry about anything else.

602
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Take care of yourselves.

603
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,160
Driver, turn right up ahead.

604
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,200
Dian Dian.

605
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,599
Hand me the hat, Mom.

606
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
Who were you with last night?

607
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,680
I was by myself.

608
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
You stayed at a hotel alone?

609
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,119
Who was it? What do they do?

610
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,279
Tell me.

611
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,200
I was alone.

612
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,680
Why can't I stay at a hotel?

613
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
If you don't want to talk, forget it.

614
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,160
Mom, what are you thinking?

615
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,559
Dian Dian, let's go.

616
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,200
Say goodbye to Grandma and Grandpa.

617
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,680
We're leaving, Dad.

618
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,319
We're leaving.

619
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Dian Dian, you're going home with Mom.

620
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,599
Say bye to Grandpa.

621
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,200
Bye-bye.

622
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,079
Say bye to Grandpa, Grandpa bye-bye.

623
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,839
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

624
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:36,599
Good job.

625
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,559
Let's go.

626
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,839
Drive safe.

627
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,279
Let's go, Dian Dian.

628
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,920
Take it slow.

629
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,960
Is this how you teach a child?

630
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,920
What did I do?

631
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,519
She's a woman, staying out all night.

632
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,160
It's one thing if you don't teach her.

633
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,519
But you gossip about it too.

634
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,240
Your ears aren't deaf, are they?

635
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,359
You're the one who's deaf.

636
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,559
Don't pretend to be the good guy here.

637
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,680
Now you feel sorry for your son-in-law?

638
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,920
Has your son-in-law ever really cared for the family all these years?

639
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,319
It's not like you just found out he's busy.

640
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,400
Looking for a fight, huh?

641
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,480
I wouldn't dare mess with you.

642
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,759
On the third floor.

643
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,559
Who is it?

644
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:53,839
Yangzi.

645
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,599
Wait a moment.

646
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,480
It's me.

647
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,920
Hei, what brings you here?

648
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,119
Give me a puff, Hei.

649
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,240
Not smoking today.

650
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,519
Ziming.

651
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,680
You're here.

652
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,400
Rush, hurry, hurry!

653
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,519
Don't move.

654
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,319
Get up, get up.

655
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
Look, the head is here.

656
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,640
That's how it is.

657
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,559
Did you see?

658
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,279
Is Mom awesome?

659
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,359
Nod.

660
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,920
Don't move. Stay still.

661
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,920
Why are you making a call?

662
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,839
Mom is calling your dad.

663
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,079
He didn't answer.

664
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,559
Why didn't he answer?

665
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,279
Busy.

666
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,279
Behave yourself.

667
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,680
Ziming, is my life over?

668
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,319
I really didn't smoke just now.

669
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,519
I really didn't smoke just now.

670
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,760
Any response?

671
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,360
I tried adding him with several different accounts.

672
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,519
Both male and female accounts.

673
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,519
He just won't accept.

674
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,840
The key thing is, his QQ Space

675
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,199
is set to private.

676
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,360
Boss,

677
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,360
his SIM card has also expired and been reclaimed.

678
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,599
And it's not a real-name card.

679
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,280
You'd think, since they dated,

680
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
there'd be at least one photo.

681
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,119
But Dong Chunni said she doesn't like taking photos.

682
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,079
She thinks taking photos is just for showing off.

683
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,880
So what do we do if he won't accept our friend requests?

684
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,079
Stumped, huh?

685
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,000
High-tech methods aren't working, are they?

686
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,400
Do you know how police investigated before the internet?

687
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,480
How did they do it?

688
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,280
How?

689
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
How?

690
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
With their feet.

691
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,599
How?

692
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,360
Let's go.

693
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,960
Okay.

694
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,599
Boss, we've been staking out all night.

695
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,000
We didn't get anything.

696
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,599
Any other ideas?

697
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,119
Nope.

698
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,079
Eat here, sleep here.

699
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,480
Until we find this Huzi.

700
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
Here, thank you.

701
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,440
Take your time eating.

702
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,679
Here, have another bowl.

703
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,679
Gangzi,

704
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,079
don't come with us for now.

705
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,840
Go online and keep searching.

706
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,719
See if you can find any news about Huzi.

707
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,280
Just now at the bar

708
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
I heard you’re looking for Huzi too

709
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,440
You know him?

710
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,480
Yeah, I know him

711
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,119
The Huzi you’re looking for

712
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,280
Is he the same person as ours?

713
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,599
About 1.7 meters tall

714
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,559
Rides a Harley

715
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,679
That’s him

716
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,159
What’s your relationship with him?

717
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,400
I dated him

718
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,280
Come on, sit down and let’s talk

719
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,480
Grab a stool

720
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,719
Sit down, miss

721
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,480
Here

722
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,079
Boss, another bowl of wontons

723
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,800
Here you go, right here

724
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,159
Miss, have some wontons

725
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,480
Here, take this

726
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,199
Thank you

727
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
What’s your name?

728
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,079
Zheng Xiaomeng

729
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,000
We met last summer

730
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
After he met me

731
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,960
He volunteered to back me up

732
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,639
How did he back you up?

733
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,239
That's right.

734
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,119
I would find someone to chat with.

735
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,840
He would take fifty yuan as a cut.

736
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,159
No matter if the client gave me a hundred,

737
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,039
or two hundred,

738
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,280
he would only take fifty yuan.

739
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:53,920
Sometimes,

740
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,159
after chatting and drinking,

741
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,159
the client wouldn't pay.

742
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,639
He would beat the guy up.

743
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,679
That Huzi is really adaptable.

744
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,760
Go on.

745
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,239
Business was good back then.

746
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,519
I made a bit of money.

747
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,639
And then,

748
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,039
after spending a lot of time together, we developed some feelings.

749
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,920
He moved in with me.

750
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,039
But then,

751
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,960
after I came back home after the National Day holiday,

752
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,800
he was gone.

753
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,880
I couldn't reach him by phone.

754
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,679
He took all my bags, jewelry,

755
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,519
and all the money from my bank card.

756
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,679
I was so angry, I searched everywhere for him.

757
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,280
He was nowhere to be found.

758
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,360
His phone was turned off too.

759
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,360
I really had no way to find him.

760
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
That Huzi has a Harley motorcycle.

761
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:31,159
Do you know where he bought that bike?

762
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,880
Where he bought the bike?

763
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,760
I actually don't know.

764
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,280
But I heard

765
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I also just heard

766
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,800
he used to often go to some

767
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Harley club to attend events.

768
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,119
Do you know where that club is?

769
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,440
I don't know.

770
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,000
If I knew,

771
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,280
I would have gone there myself already.

772
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Alright, don't worry, miss.

773
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,159
We can definitely help you get your money back.

774
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:57,880
Have some wontons.

775
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,960
Go ahead and eat, have some.

776
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,639
Eat while it's hot.

777
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
What happened to your leg?

778
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe I hurt it playing soccer before.

779
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,199
I've been walking a lot these past couple of days.

780
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,280
You should get it checked out.

781
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,199
I'll do it when I have time.

782
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,800
About that motorcycle forum and message board,

783
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,599
I asked around too.

784
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,000
No one knows this Huzi.

785
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,000
There are a few more places ahead, let's check them out.

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,800
No, Master.

787
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,039
You go ahead.

788
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,760
Isn't today your anniversary with Mistress?

789
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
It wouldn't be right to be late.

790
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
The two of us can go.

791
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,760
We can also check the surveillance at the property office.

792
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,199
If there was surveillance, we would've checked it already.

793
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,360
Just check it if I tell you to.

794
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,599
Alright, you two go then.

795
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,519
Tingting.

796
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,559
Tingting.

797
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Where did you go?

798
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,119
Tingting, I had something to do just now.

799
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,440
Then when I called you, no one answered.

800
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,559
Where are you?

801
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,599
I'm at my mom's place.

802
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,199
Diandian is here too.

803
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,840
Okay.

804
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,800
Alright, I'll come over now.

805
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,039
Why are you coming?

806
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,159
No, that's not it.

807
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,760
Isn't today our wedding anniversary?

808
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,280
Diandian is already asleep.

809
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,199
I'm going to sleep too.

810
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,599
Let's talk about it later if there's anything.

811
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,079
Alright, let's leave it at that for now.

812
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,519
Coming, coming.

813
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,039
Who is it?

814
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,000
Dad, it's me.

815
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,199
Ziming?

816
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,559
Come, come, come in quickly.

817
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,400
Come on, come in.

818
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,880
What's wrong? Is something up this late?

819
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,239
Where's Tingting?

820
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,360
Didn't Tingting say she was going to have dinner with you?

821
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,559
Didn't you say today was your wedding anniversary?

822
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,719
Weren't you going to celebrate together?

823
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,039
I held her up.

824
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,719
When I saw she wasn't home,

825
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,719
I thought she came here.

826
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,559
No, she didn't.

827
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,920
Old Lu, Ziming is here looking for Tingting.

828
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:52,840
Ziming.

829
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,440
Tingting.

830
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,559
She waited for you but you didn't show up.

831
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,719
She went to a gathering with her classmates.

832
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,159
What about Diandian?

833
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,079
Already went to bed.

834
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,119
Already went to bed.

835
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,079
What's wrong?

836
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,079
Did you have a fight?

837
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,199
No, I just came from work.

838
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,039
Then she'll probably be home soon.

839
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:13,599
Yes, yes, yes.

840
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,559
I'll head back now.

841
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,039
Then go home and check.

842
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,760
You two get some rest.

843
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,480
Alright, alright.

844
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,559
Drive safely on your way home.

845
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,119
Okay, Dad.

846
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:28,880
Where's Tingting?

847
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,119
How would I know?

848
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,840
You—you don't know?

849
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,159
You said she was at a class reunion.

850
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,880
Aren't you just making up excuses for her?

851
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,320
Enough, keep your voice down.

852
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,239
She has a family and a child.

853
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,679
Shut up, don't you know?

854
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
You're back.

855
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,920
Where did you go?

856
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,400
Out to eat.

857
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,199
With whom?

858
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,599
Colleagues.

859
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,559
Then why did your mom say

860
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,119
you went to a class dinner?

861
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,320
What do you mean?

862
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,119
Are you checking up on me?

863
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,119
Are you interrogating a criminal?

864
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,679
No, I'm just worried about you.

865
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,280
Where did you actually go?

866
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,679
So what?

867
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,719
From now on, whatever I do

868
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,760
I have to report to you first, is that it?

869
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,920
What's wrong with just telling me?

870
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,400
When I was discharged from the hospital

871
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,719
wasn't it you who said

872
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,800
I could do whatever I wanted?

873
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,599
That I should do whatever makes me happy?

874
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,719
Besides,

875
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,320
have you ever cared about what I do?
