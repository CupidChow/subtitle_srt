1
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,000
Ziqing

2
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,400
I need to apologize to you.

3
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,159
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,680
You know, there was a time

5
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,560
I think it was the past couple of years

6
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,000
when I suddenly felt that our lives

7
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,159
were pretty meaningless

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Maybe suddenly you have everything.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
You have money.

10
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
You have a house.

11
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,520
You have a car.

12
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,199
And the child is so adorable.

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,159
When everything goes smoothly all of a sudden,

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
life seems to lose its direction.

15
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,280
It even gets a bit boring.

16
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,560
But after what happened to you this time,

17
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
I just realized that

18
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,919
these are our best days.

19
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,439
Can we keep living together peacefully?

20
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,280
No matter how dull life gets,

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,719
can we just keep going like this?

22
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,639
Yes.

23
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,360
Mr. Liu, please come this way.

24
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,599
Open your mouth.

25
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,560
Son, look how good your mom is to me.

26
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,759
You're so annoying. How do you know it's a son?

27
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,919
What if it's a girl?

28
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,759
I'm telling you, it's definitely a boy.

29
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,560
Let me ask you something.

30
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,599
The gas company called me.

31
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,919
They said there's no money left in your account.

32
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,680
The payment couldn't be deducted.

33
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,319
I already paid the money.

34
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Then where did your salary go?

35
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,399
I lent it to Liu Yang.

36
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,519
He said he needed the money urgently.

37
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
He'll pay me back after a while.

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
I need to take a work call.

39
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,759
Master.

40
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,279
Hello?

41
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,160
All the legal procedures for the An Pinghai case have been completed.

42
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,199
The death sentence will be carried out soon.

43
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
He requested to see you before the execution.

44
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,639
See me?

45
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
We'll talk about it later.

46
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,399
Who wants to see you?

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,120
It's nothing, just a prisoner.

48
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,480
Don't keep standing.

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,759
Go rest, quickly.

50
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,240
Don't tire out my son.

51
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,720
I want to spend a bit more time with you.

52
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,199
I'll come find you after I finish cutting the melon.

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,639
Hello

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,120
Hello

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,879
Please show your police ID

56
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,360
Okay

57
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,279
Okay

58
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,600
Please register

59
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
If you catch me, what level of merit will you get?

60
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,319
Collective second-class merit.

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,800
All I got was a collective second-class merit.

62
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,480
You should know it was just a collective second-class award.

63
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,279
Would you still have risked your life to catch me?

64
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,079
Yes, definitely.

65
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,639
You're bragging.

66
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,360
Back then,

67
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,399
you were so scared your hands were shaking.

68
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,720
I saw the situation at the time.

69
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,839
There were so many of you.

70
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,920
Even if I pulled out a gun,

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,480
I could have shot one or two more people.

72
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,920
But what's the point?

73
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,600
I'd still end up getting caught.

74
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,639
I'm a decent guy, right?

75
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,199
Are you done talking?

76
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm done.

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Then let me say something.

78
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,000
Go ahead.

79
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,160
You're right.

80
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,279
I was scared.

81
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,199
And I should thank you.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,279
The day after we caught you,

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,079
my wife told me she was pregnant.

84
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,519
If you had shot me back then,

85
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,800
my child would have grown up without a father.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,279
A person only has one life.

87
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,000
Who isn't afraid of death?

88
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,399
I'm afraid too.

89
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,079
I was terrified at the time.

90
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,439
I was afraid my wife would lose her husband.

91
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,600
Afraid my child would lose their father.

92
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,839
Afraid my sister would lose her brother.

93
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,839
And afraid my father would lose his son.

94
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,600
But all of that was fear after the fact.

95
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,839
If I had to do it again,

96
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,040
I would still risk my life to catch you.

97
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,160
Are you out of your mind?

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,879
Are you like this just with me, or with everyone?

99
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,480
Can't help it, this is my job.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,879
Are you going to be a cop again in your next life?

101
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,800
That's something for the next life.

102
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,680
Let's talk about it in the next life.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,839
Did you come to see me just to brag,

104
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,000
or is there something else?

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,439
I have a mother.

106
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
Pension

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
It's still enough to live on.

108
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,079
It's just that I'm getting older.

109
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,079
My legs are getting less and less flexible.

110
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
I live on the fifth floor.

111
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,079
My mom has told me several times.

112
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,000
That I should

113
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,720
move to a lower floor.

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,480
But I haven't done it.

115
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,919
Can you

116
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,159
Can you help me with it?

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
Is the first floor okay?

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,279
I went to several places.

119
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,399
I found a few on the first floor.

120
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,200
One of them isn't expensive.

121
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,279
It's similar to the one the old lady is living in now.

122
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,519
You should help him find an agent.

123
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,879
Don't handle the buying and transfer yourself.

124
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,799
As for the move,

125
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,080
if they really need help,

126
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,879
go talk to the local police station and neighborhood office.

127
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,720
Ask them to coordinate and lend a hand.

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
The old lady hasn't broken any laws.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,279
This is also serving the people.

130
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,559
Understood.

131
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
My back these days...

132
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
Getting older really takes its toll.

133
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I still can't do it.

134
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,840
No, I used to be able to get up in one go.

135
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Quite charming.

136
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,120
What the heck?

137
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,639
I'm here to ask you out for a meal.

138
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,879
I said I'm not going.

139
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,440
You keep calling—aren't you annoyed?

140
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,559
They're thinking of you, it's your birthday.

141
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,519
Isn't that nice?

142
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:22,879
Let's get together.

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
No, I don't want to.

144
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,000
Then let's go shopping this afternoon.

145
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,759
Ask Tingting to go with you.

146
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,279
You stay at home like this every day.

147
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,679
Don't you get bored?

148
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,639
You're actually right about that.

149
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,000
Not boring at all.

150
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,200
I'm really enjoying this moment.

151
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,120
I feel like all those meals and drinks before,

152
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
were all for nothing.

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,600
You've really reached a new level of awareness.

154
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,360
Then let's celebrate at home.

155
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,320
Sure.

156
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,840
Alright, I'll go take a shower.

157
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,759
I'm all sweaty.

158
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Let's go to the seafood market later.

159
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,919
And buy some seafood.

160
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,840
Why not shower after we get back?

161
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,799
No, I’m too hot right now.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
The seafood market is so full of different smells.

163
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,240
Hello?

164
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:19,799
Zhuzi,

165
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,519
what's wrong with you?

166
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,919
Come back.

167
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,039
I told you, you shouldn't have gone to that lousy place.

168
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,200
Who's supposed to welcome you back?

169
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,919
Me, I promised your sister-in-law.

170
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,360
You have to eat at home today, got it?

171
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,799
What? You...

172
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,720
Why do you always get so worked up? The way you talk...

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,039
Stop always cursing at people.

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,039
We'll talk about it later.

175
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,480
Happy birthday to you

176
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,480
Happy birthday to you

177
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,600
Happy birthday to you

178
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
Happy birthday to you

179
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,519
Okay

180
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,519
That's great

181
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,440
Mom, turn on the light

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
I always think wearing this looks really silly

183
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,919
You put one on, let me see

184
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,279
Dad, what wish did you make?

185
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,240
I can't say that

186
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,559
If I say it, it won't come true

187
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,559
Ni Zi, let's eat some food before the cake

188
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,519
Eat the food, eat the food

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
Look, your mom made seafood

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,840
There's also fish

191
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,000
Dad, does the food taste good?

192
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
They're urging you

193
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,720
It's fine, just stay

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,919
It's up to you if you go or not

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,639
Just eat a little and then go

196
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,960
Zhuzi finally came back to the country

197
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,600
Go

198
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm going

199
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,919
Go ahead

200
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll go and come back early

201
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,279
Don't drink too much

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,519
Come here, big baby

203
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,519
He's so annoying, isn't he?

204
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,840
Big smooth talker

205
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,720
Bye-bye

206
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,720
Don't drink too much

207
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,720
I won't, I'm leaving

208
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,919
Zhuzi

209
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,000
Brother

210
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,879
Happy birthday

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,480
Sixth Brother

212
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,799
Happy birthday

213
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,960
Sit down, sit down

214
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,840
We were just waiting for you

215
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:38,279
Sixth Brother

216
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,080
We have to drink this together

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Good brother

218
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,120
Sixth Brother, Sixth Brother, Sixth Brother

219
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,240
Sixth Brother

220
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,399
You’ve become a homebody now

221
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,679
Yeah, staying home is pretty nice

222
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,759
Raising fish and growing flowers at home

223
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,360
Cultivating yourself and your character

224
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,080
Weizi

225
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,480
Good stuff, from Guangdong.

226
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,960
This is for Brother Liu.

227
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,480
Brother Liu.

228
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't touch this stuff anymore.

229
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,159
You don't understand, Weizi.

230
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
This is an upgraded version.

231
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,159
It's completely different from the old stuff.

232
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,240
Brother Liu, Brother Liu, Brother Liu.

233
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
Go ahead, try it.

234
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Really, I've quit, I've quit.

235
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,120
I won't touch it anymore.

236
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,919
A piece or two of this definitely won't get you hooked.

237
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,360
Sorry.

238
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Up to you.

239
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,000
Thanks for understanding.

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,320
Thanks for understanding.

241
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,960
Come on, cheers.

242
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Come on, let's do it together.

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,240
All together, come on.

244
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,879
Happy birthday to Brother Wei.

245
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,840
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

246
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:52,519
Cheers.

247
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
Bottoms up.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,399
The fetal heartbeat is normal right now.

249
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,480
The head circumference is a bit larger than average.

250
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,799
And currently, the baby is in breech position.

251
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,440
A natural delivery would be somewhat difficult.

252
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,759
Last time I came, the baby was head down.

253
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,399
How did it turn breech this time?

254
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,320
That's possible.

255
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,039
The baby keeps moving inside the womb.

256
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,440
The position can change at any time.

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
My due date is coming up soon.

258
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,639
Is there any way to get the baby to turn?

259
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,840
I still want a natural delivery.

260
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,240
It's hard to say.

261
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,399
You should prepare for a C-section just in case.

262
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,600
Come to the hospital immediately if your water breaks.

263
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,240
Doctor.

264
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,200
Is there any way to make the baby turn?

265
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
It's possible.

266
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,279
Tingting

267
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,159
I'm here. Which floor are you on?

268
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,960
You went home.

269
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,080
Why are you in such a hurry?

270
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,200
Alright, alright, I'm going home now.

271
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,799
Sis

272
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,720
Nizi

273
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,759
Okay, I'll come over right now.

274
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,639
Uncle

275
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,519
Sister

276
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,840
I told her not to call you

277
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,879
But she insisted on calling you

278
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,519
What's going on?

279
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,440
He owes too much and can't pay it back.

280
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,640
No, technically this is your only residence.

281
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,880
It can't be enforced.

282
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,920
He has another small property under his name.

283
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,319
The old lady is still living there.

284
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,920
We can't really go through with that plan, can we?

285
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,680
Uncle, my mom said she would take me to stay at a hotel.

286
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,720
But I don't want to stay at a hotel.

287
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,240
Hotels are too expensive.

288
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
My mom even sold the car.

289
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,759
We won't stay at a hotel.

290
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,200
We'll stay at uncle's place.

291
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,079
Sis, come stay at my place for a few days.

292
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,920
You can also help me look after Tingting.

293
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:30,960
Let's go.

294
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,599
Mom, just listen to my uncle.

295
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,519
Let's go.

296
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,839
Why put yourself through all that suffering?

297
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,279
Isn't a C-section still giving birth?

298
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
No, I want a natural birth.

299
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,039
Kids born naturally are smarter.

300
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,839
Smart?

301
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,599
That depends on who the child takes after.

302
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,400
If the baby takes after his dad, that's trouble.

303
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,079
Why would that be trouble?

304
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,599
Our Ziming is the smartest.

305
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
He's a police officer.

306
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,599
Let's not talk about being smart.

307
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,000
Does he know how to care for you?

308
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,279
No matter if it's scorching hot or freezing cold,

309
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,160
he always makes you squeeze onto the subway alone.

310
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,400
To go for your prenatal checkups.

311
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,960
Has he ever accompanied you even once?

312
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:19,839
So what?

313
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,079
I can do it myself.

314
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,799
After all these years,

315
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
why hasn't he managed to get a car?

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
Mom, you're so annoying.

317
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,720
Your cousin Jianjun,

318
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,519
he got promoted recently.

319
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,680
He gets driven around in a sedan every day.

320
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,599
His wife never has to squeeze onto a bus anymore.

321
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,160
That car isn't cheap.

322
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, I ride a subway train worth over eighty million every day.

323
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,240
Mom.

324
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,400
You're here.

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
Ziming is back.

326
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,559
What are you doing?

327
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:52,960
Sis, come here, sis.

328
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,200
Come in, hurry, hurry.

329
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,799
The girl has grown so big.

330
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,599
How old is she?

331
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
I'm five years old.

332
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,759
Come here, girl, come.

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,039
This is

334
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,960
I asked my sister to come and take care of Tingting.

335
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,480
We don't need so many things.

336
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,559
After Tingting gives birth, she'll stay at the postpartum care center.

337
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,400
It's fine, it won't be a problem.

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,839
It's great to have someone to help out.

339
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,079
What's that smell on you?

340
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,880
Oh, that's rotten eggs.

341
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,000
What were you just doing here?

342
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,599
The doctor said our baby is in breech position.

343
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:21,960
I need to turn the baby around.

344
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,559
Why do you need to turn the baby?

345
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,519
For a natural delivery.

346
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,200
Stop messing around. Let me see. Don't move her.

347
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,079
Hurry up, go wash your hands and change your clothes.

348
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,200
It's okay, Mom.

349
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,839
Hurry, hurry.

350
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,960
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

351
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,880
Sis, you sit down. Mom, it's fine.

352
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
Don't just stand there.

353
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
Grandma.

354
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,759
Here, have an apple.

355
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,519
Thank you, Grandma.

356
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,319
Such a good kid.

357
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,759
How long are you planning to stay?

358
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,200
We just came to see Tingting.

359
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
We'll leave in a little while.

360
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,519
You're leaving so soon?

361
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,400
That won't do.

362
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,440
Sis, you've had a child, you have experience.

363
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,960
You have to stay and take care of me.

364
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,720
When you gave birth to Nizi,

365
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
was it a natural birth or a C-section?

366
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,799
Natural birth.

367
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
See, children born naturally

368
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,559
are both smart and cute.

369
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,799
Isn't that right, Nizi?

370
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,039
Let's go.

371
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,119
Come help your aunt tidy up the room.

372
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,319
Just these two pieces of luggage, right, sis?

373
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,200
Okay.

374
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,400
Don't move, don't move, I'll do it.

375
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,559
It's fine, it's fine.

376
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Come on, Nizi.

377
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,680
Sis, have a seat.

378
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Why are you standing?

379
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,519
Did something happen at home?

380
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,319
Mom, you don't need to worry about this.

381
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,119
Right now, Tingting is the most important.

382
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,559
We should do whatever we can to make her suffer less.

383
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,480
"We"? There's no "we" in this.

384
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
What hardship could you possibly go through?

385
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,759
You didn't even give birth to this child.

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,279
Yes, yes, I know.

387
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,160
What do you know? Tell me.

388
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,519
That it's painful and exhausting.

389
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,559
So you know how tired and sore I am?

390
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,000
Mom, help me pick up that watermelon.

391
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,039
What do you need the watermelon for?

392
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,279
What are you doing?

393
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm going to tie it around your waist.

394
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Let you feel what real exhaustion is like.

395
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,599
Stop messing around, I have to go to work soon.

396
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,119
You can't take it off at work either—keep it on.

397
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,200
Liu Ziming

398
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,720
What are you doing?

399
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
It's loose. I want to tie it tighter.

400
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,599
Take it off.

401
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,680
It's fine.

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,960
Alright, you can go back.

403
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,240
Go inside.

404
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm leaving now.

405
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,759
Why is that guy strapping a watermelon to himself?

406
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,880
Who knows?

407
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,319
Aren't you going back to take care of my dad?

408
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,920
Don't worry, I'm even more concerned than you are.

409
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,400
My sister is here with me.

410
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,480
Alright, alright, I got it.

411
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,039
Let me know when you get home.

412
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:56,920
Okay, bye.

413
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,559
Are you eating, or is mom eating?

414
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,359
Girl.

415
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,519
What cartoons do you like to watch?

416
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,480
Here, you can change the channel yourself.

417
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,799
Sis.

418
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,319
Watch TV by yourself for a while.

419
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,480
What about the company?

420
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,799
He must have some shares, right?

421
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,720
It filed for bankruptcy just last month.

422
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
Even my bank card,

423
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,279
I don't even know when,

424
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,000
he took all the money out of it.

425
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,599
The money for this girl's schooling,

426
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,480
he didn't even leave any for her.

427
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,000
Forget it.

428
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,119
Once someone gets involved with this stuff, it's all over.

429
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,480
The first time he came back from rehab,

430
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,920
I still believed he would get better, that he would change.

431
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,640
And he really did change.

432
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,039
No matter who invited him out, he wouldn't go.

433
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,640
He came home on time.

434
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,680
One day, it was his birthday.

435
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,240
A few friends called to celebrate.

436
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,039
I told him to go.

437
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,319
Have some fun.

438
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,480
Go out and get some fresh air.

439
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
It was just that one day.

440
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,200
That very night, I got a call from the police station.

441
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,400
The second time he came back,

442
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,480
I still had hope in my heart.

443
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,279
But I didn't expect it to happen even faster this time.

444
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,640
It wasn't even a week.

445
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
The third time he came back,

446
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,319
he was like a completely different person.

447
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,680
He lost his temper every day and smashed things.

448
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,319
I tied him to the bed.

449
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,039
He kicked me.

450
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,279
And hit me.

451
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,440
When I saw him like that, I thought,

452
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,480
Forget it, just let him be.

453
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,079
Sis,

454
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,000
you did your best.

455
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,559
I

456
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,039
Um

457
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,119
This is what you

458
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,480
gave me when I got married before

459
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,279
Tingting, this is from your sister

460
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:31,960
I can't take it

461
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,279
Listen to me, I haven't spent a cent

462
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm giving all of this back to you

463
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,039
Please don't make me upset at a time like this

464
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,680
Just take it

465
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,279
You need money now that you're pregnant

466
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,400
Stop arguing with me

467
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,039
Otherwise, I'll just give birth right here

468
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,200
Take it

469
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,799
This is what Ziming and I want

470
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,279
Sis, take it

471
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,000
You and Nizi will stay in this room later

472
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,319
I'll stay in that room

473
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,480
It's really comfortable for me to stay alone in that room

474
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,319
It's okay

475
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't cry

476
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,519
My emotions are already unstable right now

477
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,880
Okay, okay, I won't cry

478
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,440
I won't cry, don't worry

479
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
What's wrong?

480
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,839
Nizi, don't move, don't move.

481
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,559
Be careful, don't prick your hand.

482
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,279
Go sit over there.

483
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,799
Go sit over there.

484
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,559
Aunt

485
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,079
Is this cup expensive?

486
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,839
It's fine, it's not expensive.

487
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:17,960
Where's your mom?

488
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,680
I don't know. She left when I got up.

489
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,839
Did your mom go out to buy you breakfast?

490
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,240
I've been making breakfast myself lately.

491
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,200
My mom hasn't been sleeping well.

492
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,440
I saw her secretly taking sleeping pills.

493
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Really?

494
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,440
You're amazing, girl.

495
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,839
You can even make your own breakfast. Eat up.

496
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,880
Hello, sis.

497
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,960
Where are you?

498
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a walk.

499
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,039
I'll be back soon.

500
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,880
Did Ni Zi cause any trouble?

501
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,480
She's fine, really well-behaved.

502
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,839
She even made me breakfast.

503
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,680
Come back soon, okay?

504
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,839
Alright, alright.

505
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,759
Sis

506
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,359
Let's go up to the third floor.

507
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,519
Please take a look.

508
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,200
Three bedrooms and one living room, with good north-south ventilation.

509
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,160
These two bedrooms face the sun.

510
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,880
How many square meters is this apartment?

511
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,960
This apartment is fifty-nine square meters.

512
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,799
According to your requirements,

513
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,079
this is the most cost-effective apartment in the whole complex.

514
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,039
The layout is very regular.

515
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,920
It has a high usable area ratio.

516
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
Although it's on the third floor and there's no elevator,

517
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,319
going up and down the stairs

518
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,680
can be considered as exercise.

519
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,119
How much is this one?

520
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,480
The owner is eager to rent it out—eight hundred per month.

521
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,880
But you need to pay a whole year upfront.

522
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,720
Plus one month's deposit.

523
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,440
You can use this room as a study.

524
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,440
Ma'am, about this apartment,

525
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,200
there are still many clients coming to see it this afternoon.

526
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,279
If you think it's suitable,

527
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,440
you should make a decision quickly.

528
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,359
Otherwise, it'll be rented out soon.

529
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,880
You don't need to persuade me like this.

530
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,119
I'm just being honest.

531
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,480
I used to work as an agent too.

532
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,599
I'm even more familiar with these lines than you are.

533
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
This apartment of yours

534
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,519
has been vacant for at least two or three months.

535
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,640
It's not that easy to rent out.

536
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,480
Compared to similar apartments in this complex,

537
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,279
why is this one so much cheaper?

538
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,400
Is there some kind of problem?

539
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,440
A problem?

540
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,640
There's no problem.

541
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,200
As you can see,

542
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,480
the buildings in this complex are generally quite old.

543
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,880
And the appliances aren't fully equipped.

544
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,559
A haunted house?

545
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,480
To be honest with you,

546
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,920
an old man passed away here.

547
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,599
But it wasn't an unnatural death.

548
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,680
He died of old age, it was a peaceful passing.

549
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:07,559
It doesn't affect anything.

550
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,799
It's fine, I'm not afraid of haunted houses.

551
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,960
What are you doing?

552
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,839
Call the landlord right now.

553
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,559
Ask him if 8,000 yuan a year

554
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,000
can include the property management fee.

555
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,480
If yes, we'll sign the contract today.

556
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
If not, I'll switch to another agency.

557
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Alright, I'll get in touch.

558
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,880
These were all classic models back in the day.

559
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,599
They were only worn once or twice.

560
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,079
All the certificates are included.

561
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,400
Appraisal certificate.

562
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,440
Sis, this is the price I'm offering you.

563
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,359
Is this price for everything?

564
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,640
Or just for these two?

565
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:04,720
It's for all of them.

566
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,279
Are you kidding me, kid?

567
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,359
You can see for yourself.

568
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,519
You handle so many things every day.

569
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,599
These are all good items.

570
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,880
Most of them are almost brand new.

571
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,039
And they all have receipts.

572
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,200
Look, there are even certificates of authenticity.

573
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,680
Altogether, they're worth over three hundred thousand.

574
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,920
You should at least offer a bit more.

575
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,880
That's definitely not possible.

576
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,240
The price I'm offering you

577
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,039
is the highest in this area.

578
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,920
I'm just in a tough spot right now.

579
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,359
Sis, everyone who comes here is in a tough spot.

580
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,839
I know you have difficulties.

581
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,960
I have my own problems too.

582
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Let's try to understand each other.

583
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,079
Why don't you look around a bit more?

584
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:48,920
How about this, then

585
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,920
You take this one too

586
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,839
And then this bag

587
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,680
Aren't you collecting bags too?

588
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,599
You don't need to look

589
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,880
This is D-level

590
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,160
The best kind

591
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,279
Good morning, boss.

592
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,160
Xiaobo.

593
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,240
Do your best.

594
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,440
Of course.

595
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,160
Xiaobo

596
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,799
What is this?

597
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Where?

598
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,759
This.

599
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,359
It's a dried-up well.

600
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,480
Is there still water?

601
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,920
No, there hasn't been for a long time. We all use tap water now.

602
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,640
Then why is it covered?

603
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,759
O-open it, open it and take a look.

604
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,200
Hasn't it always been covered?

605
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,039
Why does it smell so bad?

606
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:27,759
Xiaobo

607
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,839
Did you just poop here?

608
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
No, I didn't. I don't know what's going on either.

609
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,200
Boss, come look, what is this thing?

610
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,359
I can't see clearly either.

611
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,720
What's inside here?

612
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,599
The smell is coming from here.

613
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:50,759
A dead body

614
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,160
Call the police right away

615
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,159
Xiao Qin, come over and take notes.

616
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,599
The deceased is female.

617
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,760
Height is 1.65 meters.

618
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,199
Age is in her twenties.

619
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,360
There are obvious strangulation marks on the neck.

620
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
In two places.

621
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,199
There is a pair of underwear in the mouth.

622
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,840
Captain Liu

623
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,320
Check if there’s any jewelry on your hands.

624
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,639
Come here.

625
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,760
Check the lower leg and foot more carefully.

626
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,719
Who reported the case?

627
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,599
Me. Him.

628
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,960
Who found it?

629
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,920
I found it.

630
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Li Yugang.

631
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
Ask about the details.

632
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,800
Could you come over for a moment?

633
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,000
Hello.

634
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Can you tell me roughly what happened?

635
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,000
It was in the morning.

636
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,800
I just came out to have a look around.

637
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,519
Then I walked over here.

638
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,800
When did you discover it?

639
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,239
Around eight in the morning.

640
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,760
I thought I'd open it and take a look, and then—

641
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,400
Did you know there was a well here before?

642
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,760
Yes, there's always been a well here.

643
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,119
Later, the water dried up.

644
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,039
Now everyone uses tap water.

645
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,320
So it's just been left unused.

646
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,480
Do you usually live here?

647
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,320
Yes.

648
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,760
I've always lived in that house over there.

649
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,000
We keep the door locked here, no one else can get in.

650
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,119
Xiao Lü.

651
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,039
Captain Liu.

652
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
Take these two back with you.

653
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,239
Make a detailed statement.

654
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,880
Okay.

655
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,000
Of course.

656
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,119
You two come with me to the station to make a statement.

657
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,599
Check the body.

658
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,039
See if there are any other injuries.

659
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:24,679
Or any blunt force injuries.

660
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,400
Brother Ming.

661
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,800
Li Yugang, Xia Yu.

662
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,280
Hello, hello.

663
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,119
Cotton.

664
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Don't regret it later.

665
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,079
What's going on?

666
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,800
It rained all night.

667
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,119
All the footprints have been washed away.

668
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,280
There are no signs of dragging or fighting around.

669
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,440
This probably isn't the primary scene.

670
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,840
Are there any personal belongings?

671
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,719
The wallet, phone, everything is gone.

672
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,840
Alright, let's go.

673
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,000
Brother Zhang

674
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,760
Captain Liu

675
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,639
Come

676
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,639
Wait, wait, wait

677
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,320
The deceased is a woman

678
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,840
She is 1.65 meters tall

679
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,000
The main thing is there are clear strangulation marks on the neck.

680
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
The time of death should be more than forty-eight hours ago.

681
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,440
Oh, right.

682
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,719
There was also a pair of underwear stuffed in the mouth.

683
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,719
Why are you two standing so far apart?

684
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,239
Come here.

685
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,039
Smell it.

686
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,679
Master, how am I supposed to smell this?

687
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,599
Smell it.

688
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,039
Did you find anything?

689
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,599
Nothing but a bad smell.

690
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,199
Smell again, get closer.

691
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,400
Master, a little closer.

692
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,519
Calf position

693
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,519
It kind of smells like that floral cologne.

694
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,000
Alright.

695
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,760
Come.

696
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,559
How much longer will you be?

697
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,719
We want to go in and have a look.

698
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,639
It'll be ready soon.

699
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:46,960
We're done extracting.

700
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,519
You can go in now.

701
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay, thank you. Good work.

702
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Good work.

703
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,360
Bye.

704
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,079
Bye.

705
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,679
Bye.

706
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,840
You two go down and take a look.

707
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,599
Master, didn't the forensics team already collect samples here?

708
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,559
The forensics team is the forensics team.

709
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,559
We are us.

710
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,760
Go down.

711
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,440
I'll do it.

712
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,400
No need.

713
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,440
You go.

714
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,639
You know what to do in a bit, right?

715
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,360
I know.

716
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,599
Search every inch.

717
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,719
Ask one by one.

718
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,760
Xia Yu, climb up by yourself in a bit.

719
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,320
It's fine, don't worry.

720
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm here, Master.

721
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:57,840
Be careful.

722
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,559
Be careful.

723
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,039
Do you think there is

724
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,639
a painless way to die in this world?

725
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,159
No.

726
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
There must be some that are relatively less painful, right?

727
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,840
No, every way to die is painful.

728
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,440
Have you died before? How do you know?

729
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,599
I just know.

730
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,840
Then tell me one, if you don't believe me.

731
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,760
Fine, I'll name one.

732
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,679
Sleeping pills. Swallowing sleeping pills shouldn't be painful, right?

733
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
A lot of people think taking sleeping pills isn't painful.

734
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,199
But actually, that way is the most uncomfortable.

735
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,039
Because when you're half-asleep,

736
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,360
the drugs irritate your stomach and cause vomiting.

737
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,360
And at that point,

738
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,320
your nerves are numb,

739
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,360
and you can't move.

740
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,360
The vomit can enter your lungs and nasal cavity,

741
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,239
causing a severe burning sensation in your lungs.

742
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,920
This process can last

743
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,079
about fifteen minutes.

744
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,559
Sometimes it comes with convulsions and spasms,

745
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,840
and loss of bladder and bowel control.

746
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,320
In the end, the real cause of death is

747
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,239
Enough, stop talking.

748
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,039
choking on your own vomit.

749
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,239
You just memorized all that.

750
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,599
Just wait, I can definitely think of one.

751
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,400
Just wait.

752
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:05,960
But let me tell you,

753
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,760
actually, before you even think of one,

754
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:09,960
you...

755
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,519
You should recharge your brain first.

756
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,119
Here, let me help you recharge your brain.

757
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,239
Judging by the contents of the stomach,

758
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,760
the time of death should be October 2nd,

759
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,960
between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.

760
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,599
The cause of death is mechanical asphyxiation.

761
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
She was strangled.

762
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,719
There was sexual intercourse before death.

763
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
But there are no lacerations on the genitals.

764
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,760
So it's impossible to determine if it was sexual assault.

765
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,360
Was any semen collected?

766
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,039
No.

767
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
The other party may have used a condom.

768
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,800
By the way,

769
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,920
I found some skin tissue

770
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,440
on her finger.

771
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,559
It's being tested.

772
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,559
About that pair of underwear from before,

773
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,960
judging by the style and size,

774
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,039
it should belong to the victim.

775
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,159
You two,

776
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,320
Zhang has been working hard.

777
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,320
Cut that watermelon for Zhang.

778
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
Master, you're being so polite.

779
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,119
There's no knife.

780
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:06,880
I've got one here.

781
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,639
This one?

782
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,960
You go ahead. I'll do it, I'll do it.

783
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,719
Let Zhang have some to quench his thirst.

784
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,440
Give it to me.

785
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,079
Where's the watermelon?

786
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,000
Here it is.

787
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,679
Can you wash it here?

788
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,360
You're really washing it here?

789
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,559
Is it okay to wash it here?
