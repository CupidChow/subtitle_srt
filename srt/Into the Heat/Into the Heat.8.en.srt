1
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,480
All units, be alert. The person involved has arrived.

2
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,280
What do we do now?

3
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
Drive. Let's go.

4
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Liu Ziming

5
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,240
How's your situation over there?

6
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,560
Liu Ziming

7
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,960
Zhao Dali

8
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,439
Zhao Dali

9
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,039
Zhao Dali

10
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,039
Captain Huang, it's probably because of the weather.

11
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,639
It's causing poor walkie-talkie reception.

12
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,280
Quickly send a message to Liu Ziming.

13
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,120
Tell him the walkie-talkie signal is bad.

14
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,719
If anything happens, tell him to shout right away.

15
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,439
Understood.

16
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,159
Surround them! Surround them! Surround them!

17
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,800
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Surround them!

18
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Surround them! Surround them!

19
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
Go! Go!

20
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Don't run! Stop!

21
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,360
Don't run!

22
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,439
Hurry!

23
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
Stop! Stay there!

24
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,120
Don't run! Stop!

25
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,079
Don't run.

26
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
Where is he?

27
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,560
Let's split up and look.

28
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,920
Okay, this way. Go.

29
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,800
Why aren't you calling out?

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,519
If calling out is all we can do, why aren't you doing it?

31
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,839
Just say less, will you?

32
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,680
He was shouting so loudly.

33
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,759
He nearly lost his voice from shouting.

34
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,959
What if no one hears?

35
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,839
Who heard it?

36
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,839
I heard it.

37
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,480
Alright, alright.

38
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,319
Who wouldn't be frustrated if we haven't caught him?

39
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,160
He saw him and didn't call out on purpose.

40
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,439
Is he out of his mind?

41
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,600
What does he get out of this?

42
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,800
Stop shouting aimlessly here.

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
Wouldn't it be better to use this time to think of a solution?

44
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,240
Director Zhou.

45
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
Director Zhou.

46
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,720
What's going on?

47
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,319
Director Zhou.

48
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,319
It's my fault.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Heavy rain severely affects visibility.

50
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,639
Plus, the area is wide open.

51
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,120
This results in a large distance between positions.

52
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,560
The walkie-talkies failed, so people on site could only shout.

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,519
In this situation,

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,519
it's hard for anyone to guarantee nothing will go wrong.

55
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,519
Enough, enough, stop making excuses.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,439
You all know,

57
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,759
the golden window for rescue is seventy-two hours.

58
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,079
You must rescue the child for me.

59
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,720
Yes.

60
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,560
Move out.

61
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,720
Liu Yang

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,120
Here

63
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,839
Your team

64
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,000
Go between the victim's home and the school

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,720
Understood

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Zhao Dali, your team

67
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,120
Here

68
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,439
Go to the place where the child went missing

69
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,079
Check for suspicious vehicles that might appear nearby

70
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,079
Investigate any suspicious individuals

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,639
Yes

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Zhang Yu, your team

73
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,120
Here

74
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,199
Go to the transaction location

75
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,560
Places where the suspect might show up

76
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,600
Conduct a thorough search

77
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:45,759
Wang Yalin

78
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,199
Here

79
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,800
Notify the police stations near these locations

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,879
Send them an internal notice

81
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Understood

82
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,399
Ask them to assign personnel to assist us

83
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:51,800
Okay

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,720
Let's go

85
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
Move out

86
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,959
If you go by the voice,

87
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,199
how old do you think this person is?

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
He’s disguising his voice.

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
I can’t tell.

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
Just give a rough guess.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,759
Twenty, thirty, or forty?

92
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,839
I...

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,439
I can't tell.

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Is there an accent?

95
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,639
Was it a dialect or standard Mandarin?

96
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,600
There didn't seem to be a noticeable accent.

97
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,759
We got the call at five o'clock.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
Why didn't you call the police then?

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,240
I... I said not to call the police.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,279
But you insisted on calling.

101
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,959
We were going to give him the money.

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,399
Then he would let the child go.

103
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,839
We took the money and drove.

104
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,040
We went to that place.

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,040
While waiting, I started to get anxious.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,399
The more I thought about it, the more I worried something might go wrong.

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,879
So I convinced my wife.

108
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,879
That's when we called the police.

109
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,000
We even had an argument during this time.

110
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
It delayed us a bit.

111
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,839
Who usually picks up the child?

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,399
Isn't it you?

113
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,639
Yes, it should be me.

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,720
But my car was at the dealership today.

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,639
It was getting serviced.

116
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,920
When I went, it wasn't done yet.

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,199
So I had to wait a bit longer.

118
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,759
How many times has this happened?

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
You can't even handle such a small thing.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,040
You're either busy or you forget.

121
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,639
How many times has the child come home alone?

122
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,600
You tell me.

123
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,839
Are you satisfied now?

124
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,079
Might as well not have called the police.

125
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,160
You police officers,

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,000
what are you even good for?

127
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,079
You even saw the person,

128
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,240
but still couldn't catch them.

129
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,439
If I had paid the money now,

130
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,160
would my child have come back already?

131
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,920
Please don't worry yet.

132
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,040
Worrying won't help.

133
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,439
We also want to find the child.

134
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,199
Have you ever offended anyone before?

135
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Relatives, friends,

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,600
colleagues, neighbors—

137
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,879
Think carefully.

138
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,759
Is there anyone you’ve had a conflict with?

139
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,360
If you put it that way,

140
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,560
I fired a driver last month.

141
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,240
Why did you fire him?

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
Where did the person go?

143
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,639
Go ahead and say it.

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
You know how serious this is.

145
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,759
This isn't about whether you talk or not.

146
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm telling you,

147
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,639
sooner or later, you'll have to talk.

148
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,680
If you speak up now, we'll all save time.

149
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,000
Hurry up and find Yunhao.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,439
After all, the child is innocent.

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,639
I really don't know anything about Haohao.

152
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,240
Mr. Li transferred me to another position.

153
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,839
I don't have anything to complain about.

154
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,560
I'm the one who let Mr. Li down.

155
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
How did you let Mr. Li down?

156
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,439
Go ahead, say it.

157
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,160
I've been driving for Mr. Li for over two years.

158
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,319
About half a year ago.

159
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,439
Mr. Cheng suspected that Mr. Li was having an affair.

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,279
He always had me keep an eye on him.

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,600
Where he went, who he was with.

162
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,279
He always wanted me to message him right away.

163
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,200
About half a month ago.

164
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,879
Mr. Li found out.

165
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,960
Then he talked to me alone.

166
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,279
After that, he didn't let me drive anymore.

167
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
So did Mr. Li have an affair?

168
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,480
She doesn't have time for that.

169
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
She's as busy as a spinning top.

170
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,159
The day before yesterday, between 4 and 10 p.m.

171
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Where were you?

172
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
I've been on the night shift this week.

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,919
From 4 p.m. to midnight.

174
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,840
I've been here the whole time.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,639
My coworkers here can all vouch for me.

176
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Brother Dali.

177
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,240
It was this public phone that was used.

178
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,120
The tech department already checked it.

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,600
They said all the fingerprints were destroyed.

180
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,759
They also asked people nearby.

181
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,039
No one saw anything suspicious.

182
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,480
Let's split up and investigate further.

183
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,639
Did Cheng Yunhao act unusual at school yesterday?

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Nothing unusual.

185
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
We finished school on time yesterday.

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,879
He left together with everyone else.

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,679
Where does he usually go after school?

188
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,639
Do you know?

189
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,399
I'm really not sure about that.

190
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,600
Mainly, these kids—

191
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
Their parents usually pick them up after school.

192
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,919
Even if no one comes to pick them up,

193
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,840
they still have someone to walk home with.

194
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,320
But as for Cheng Yunhao,

195
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,840
no one else lives in his neighborhood.

196
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,919
So he always goes home by himself.

197
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,200
Boss.

198
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,519
Hello.

199
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,480
I'm from the city criminal police.

200
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,519
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

201
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,039
So he left by himself yesterday afternoon too?

202
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,039
Yesterday afternoon,

203
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,639
when we left the school gate,

204
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,240
he was walking with Wu Yanyan.

205
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,559
Where did you two part ways?

206
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,759
We just split up when we got there.

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,639
Did he say where he was going?

208
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,360
Did you run into anything on the way

209
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,799
that looked like a bad guy?

210
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,320
Captain Huang

211
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,919
A citizen just called.

212
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,279
He said he's a witness.

213
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,960
He witnessed the entire kidnapping.

214
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,679
He's at the Taihua Police Station.

215
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,480
Hurry over and ask him about the situation.

216
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,440
Understood.

217
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,840
Lei, let's go.

218
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:49,799
Captain Cao

219
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,120
Captain Liu

220
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,159
This is the gentleman who provided the clue.

221
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,159
Sir

222
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,360
Oh, it's you?

223
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,919
You witnessed the kidnapping?

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
I saw it very clearly.

225
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,960
What did that person look like?

226
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
About 1.8 meters tall.

227
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,919
He had spiky hair covering his face.

228
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,080
Wearing a blue down jacket

229
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,759
Single eyelids, looks quite energetic

230
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,480
Did you see what kind of car he was driving?

231
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,159
What kind of car?

232
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,480
A van.

233
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
A silver one.

234
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,120
What time did you see this?

235
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,480
Five ten

236
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,759
What did you have for lunch?

237
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Instant noodles, spicy flavor.

238
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,320
Alright, got it, okay.

239
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,639
Thank you for your hard work.

240
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,279
We understand.

241
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,039
It's no trouble.

242
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
Thank you, thank you.

243
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,039
It's not me, I haven't finished speaking yet.

244
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,799
Don't rush, sir, sir.

245
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,559
Please have a seat, please sit down, please sit down.

246
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,440
Is it because the money isn't enough?

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,559
What are you doing?

248
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,200
If the money's not enough, Haohao won't come back.

249
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,720
I gave them all the money.

250
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,919
Is there any left in the company?

251
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,960
Is there any left in the company or not?

252
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,480
Calm down.

253
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,679
Does the company have any or not?

254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,360
Calm down.

255
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,919
You don't have enough money.

256
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,879
What you gave isn't enough.

257
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,159
Of course they won't let Haohao go.

258
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,279
That's enough.

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,840
How dare you yell at me?

260
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,320
How dare you yell at me?

261
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,519
Have you seen this child before?

262
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,360
No impression.

263
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,279
No impression.

264
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,240
Did his parents ever bring the child here?

265
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,759
Did they ever come here to buy anything?

266
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,360
No.

267
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
No impression either. No impression.

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,519
Captain Huang.

269
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,559
Liu Ziming, what's going on?

270
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,919
The witness who just called said

271
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,200
you guys aren't taking people seriously.

272
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,679
People are complaining to me now.

273
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,840
No, I just saw them.

274
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,159
It's of no value.

275
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,639
No value? Are you sure?

276
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,639
Yes.

277
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,720
How can you be sure?

278
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,399
I've seen that old man.

279
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,080
The old man who cut the phone line before.

280
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,120
He's a bit mentally unstable.

281
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,519
Can what he says be useful?

282
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,360
I think you're the one with a problem.

283
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,080
Go back and keep questioning.

284
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,399
Let me tell you,

285
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,480
we can't miss a single

286
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,080
potentially valuable clue.

287
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,120
But Captain Huang, it's almost seventy-two hours now—

288
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,679
Go back and keep questioning.

289
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,039
Do you understand?

290
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,480
Alright.

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
Then I'll arrange an identification.

292
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,360
Identification for what?

293
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,320
Yes.

294
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,120
It's him.

295
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
The one on the far right.

296
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
He's the one who kidnapped the child.

297
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,519
Are you sure? Did you see clearly?

298
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,080
That's right, it's him.

299
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
I saw clearly.

300
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,759
There's no mistake at all.

301
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,000
Sir,

302
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,720
Do you know who he is?

303
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,360
The one who kidnapped the child.

304
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,320
He's the one who was just talking to you.

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,559
His surname is Huang, he's in charge of household registration.

306
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,919
This gentleman is named Chen Jianjun, he's seventy-five this year.

307
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,399
Fifteen years ago, he took his grandson out to play.

308
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,480
His grandson got lost.

309
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,039
He still hasn't been found.

310
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,759
He's been mentally unstable since then.

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
We've already notified his family.

312
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,799
Someone will come to pick him up soon.

313
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,159
Alright, sorry to trouble you.

314
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,879
We still have a few more questions to ask.

315
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,559
Hello?

316
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,559
Don't call this number.

317
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,960
This line can't be busy.

318
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,159
Besides going to school and home, where else does the child usually go?

319
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,679
Is there anywhere else they might go?

320
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,159
I've already said this many times.

321
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,159
I don't know.

322
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,559
Please think about it carefully again.

323
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
Park, internet café

324
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,080
Arcade, amusement park

325
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,919
It's possible.

326
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,000
You should tell us everything you can think of.

327
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
I already said I don't know.

328
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,279
Let's put a reward notice in the newspaper.

329
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,559
Happy birthday to you

330
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,720
Happy birthday to you

331
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,200
Happy birthday, Haohao

332
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,000
Happy birthday

333
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,480
You're nine years old now

334
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,519
How does it feel?

335
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,200
Make a wish

336
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,440
Come on, make a wish

337
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,320
Okay.

338
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,559
That was so short.

339
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,519
What did you wish for?

340
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,160
I can't tell you.

341
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,559
Tell me one.

342
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,359
Just tell me one.

343
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,039
No.

344
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,920
Alright.

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,599
Come, blow out the candles.

346
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,759
Come on, let's blow out the candles together.

347
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,359
Let's blow out the candles together.

348
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,119
Okay, one, two, three.

349
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,839
Great job! Happy birthday! Well done!

350
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
Come on, Haohao.

351
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,599
Come, come, you cut the cake.

352
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,119
Come on.

353
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay, you cut it.

354
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,519
Daddy will cut it for you.

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Happy birthday.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,079
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

357
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,839
Doctor! Doctor!

358
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,880
Which hospital?

359
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,559
Okay, I'll let him know.

360
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,880
Mr. Cheng.

361
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,640
Mr. Cheng.

362
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
Xiao Xie, call 120!

363
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:12,559
Okay, thank you.

364
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,119
You're welcome.

365
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,039
How's it going?

366
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:20,920
There are a total of twenty-five buildings.

367
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,759
The units here are small—four hundred and twenty households.

368
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,519
Let's eat something first.

369
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
In a bit, you take the east side and I'll take the west.

370
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,640
Four hundred and twenty households—that's a lot to check.

371
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,480
Can they send two more people over?

372
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,119
We also need to check the elevator surveillance.

373
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,759
The two of us can't handle all this.

374
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,319
There's no one else left.

375
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,640
Everyone's already been sent out.

376
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,519
Hello, Yang.

377
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,079
We just finished checking Baoyue.

378
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,359
Now we're heading to Swan Lake.

379
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,480
How's it going on your end?

380
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,920
Is everyone okay?

381
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,160
That's good.

382
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:53,960
Alright.

383
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,559
What's wrong?

384
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,680
Cheng Xianglin tried to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills.

385
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,440
He's having his stomach pumped at the hospital now.

386
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,559
Can he be saved?

387
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,519
He should be fine.

388
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,880
Well, isn't that something.

389
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,519
Now both of them are in the hospital.

390
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
What about the fortune-telling old lady?

391
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,400
She's been detained.

392
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,519
Do you think

393
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,839
he's already let Haohao go?

394
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,920
Because the place is too far,

395
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,160
and he's not familiar with the roads,

396
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,319
he can't find his way home.

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,440
Looking for Haohao, looking for Haohao.

398
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,519
Li Jia.

399
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:49,880
Li Jia.

400
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,519
Wait for me!

401
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,000
Haohao.

402
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,200
Haohao.

403
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,680
Haohao.

404
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,319
Cheng Yunhao.

405
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,880
Cheng Yunhao.

406
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,000
Haohao.

407
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,319
Haohao.

408
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
Who are you?

409
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,519
Haohao.

410
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,599
Who are you?

411
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,559
Are you crazy?

412
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,200
Are you crazy?

413
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
No, this is our Haohao.

414
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,160
Who are you? Why are you taking the child?

415
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,839
Hurry, go, go, go!

416
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,880
Our Haohao.

417
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,799
Haohao, Haohao.

418
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,799
Where are you?

419
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Haohau

420
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,680
What's going on?

421
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,240
We're looking for our child, our son.

422
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,240
He went missing, what else could it be?

423
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:41,960
Get in the car, we'll talk at the station.

424
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,039
That child's name is Cheng Yunhao.

425
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:43,839
No.

426
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,240
Get in the car, we'll talk at the station.

427
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
Get in, get in.

428
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,400
We're looking for our child.

429
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
We'll talk at the station.

430
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
He was kidnapped.

431
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,200
Due to the cold wave

432
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,000
temperatures across large areas of the east will drop significantly

433
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
the lowest temperatures in many places

434
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,680
will be noticeably lower than the same period in previous years

435
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,240
and some areas may break record lows for this time of year

436
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,079
May I borrow some hot water?

437
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,720
Sure.

438
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,519
It's boiled—go ahead and use it.

439
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,119
Okay, thank you.

440
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,079
Have you eaten?

441
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,599
Have a steamed bun.

442
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
No, thank you.

443
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:21,759
Eat something.

444
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,559
I...

445
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,480
How can you find someone if you’re not full?

446
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,039
Have one.

447
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,039
Brother Lei

448
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,079
Come on, drink this.

449
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,039
Careful, it's hot.

450
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,519
Captain Huang

451
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,039
Hello, Captain Huang

452
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,880
Where are you?

453
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,759
On the rooftop

454
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,519
Where's Liu Ziming?

455
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,000
He's right next to me

456
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,440
Why didn't you answer the phone?

457
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,960
I'm asking why you didn't pick up

458
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,160
My battery died

459
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,200
The battery died

460
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,799
Another child has been kidnapped

461
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,240
Hurry, one of you come back

462
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,920
Another one?

463
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,640
I'll go

464
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,599
Take it easy

465
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,240
They demanded 110,000 right away

466
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
If I had it, I would have given it to him.

467
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,519
Officer,

468
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,960
all of my family's savings combined

469
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,400
amount to less than fifty thousand yuan.

470
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
It's so early in the morning,

471
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,160
where am I supposed to get the money?

472
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,279
Officer, how about this instead?

473
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm begging you.

474
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:24,960
Please, I'm begging you.

475
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,559
Can you lend me some money?

476
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,519
Please lend me some money.

477
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,599
I promise, I promise I'll definitely pay you back.

478
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,599
I swear to God.

479
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,200
Even if I have to sell everything my family owns,

480
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
I'll still pay you back, okay?

481
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,319
No, no, no.

482
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,799
Come on, get up, get up.

483
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,000
We completely understand how you feel.

484
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Please, sit down first.

485
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Calm down, calm down.

486
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,279
I understand, money is just a material thing.

487
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,960
Compared to your child, it's nothing.

488
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,440
Think about it.

489
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,839
The kidnapper's goal is simple.

490
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,400
He just wants to get the money.

491
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,640
For him,

492
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,440
the hardest part is actually getting the money.

493
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,839
So we need to take advantage of this.

494
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,200
We have to negotiate with him.

495
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
Try to buy us more time.

496
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Because this is also

497
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,279
the best time for us to track and catch him.

498
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,359
Once he gets the money, it actually gets harder, don't you think?

499
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,279
Yes.

500
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,079
Yes, yes, you're right.

501
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,480
So, officer,

502
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
what should I do now?

503
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,640
I'll do whatever you say, okay.

504
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,039
Don't panic, don't panic.

505
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,319
You've done very well by coming to the police now.

506
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,079
This is an excellent choice.

507
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,559
Trust us with the rest.

508
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,079
Let us handle it, okay?

509
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,519
Okay.

510
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,079
We will definitely work with you

511
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,079
and do everything we can to find your child.

512
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,319
Now, at this moment,

513
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,720
I'll ask you a few questions, please try to stay calm.

514
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,200
Okay.

515
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,960
Yes, yes, just calm down.

516
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,720
So first,

517
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,000
Do you remember what time the child went missing?

518
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,599
Seven o'clock.

519
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,319
No, it was 7:30 in the morning.

520
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,359
It's okay, it's okay.

521
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,960
This time is very important to us.

522
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Don't worry.

523
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,599
Stay calm, take your time.

524
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,079
The more details you can give, the better.

525
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,240
Okay.

526
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,319
Officer,

527
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,440
you all know,

528
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,839
in our line of work,

529
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,079
we usually leave early and come back late.

530
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,359
We don't have time to take the child to school.

531
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,240
Usually, the child goes to school alone.

532
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,200
This morning, around seven o'clock,

533
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,440
after the child left for school alone,

534
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,599
about half an hour later,

535
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,640
Yes, just over half an hour.

536
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,640
My phone suddenly rang.

537
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,519
The caller said, "I've kidnapped your child."

538
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,559
He immediately demanded 110,000.

539
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,759
What am I supposed to do?

540
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,359
I understand.

541
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,400
Did he tell you

542
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,200
what time and where to give him the money?

543
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Three o'clock in the afternoon.

544
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,799
At that wholesale market.

545
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,240
He said the specific method would be decided later.

546
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:26,759
Understood.

547
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,599
Got it?

548
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,119
Yes, I got it.

549
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:30,880
Three o'clock in the afternoon.

550
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,519
That's right.

551
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,319
At the wholesale market.

552
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,319
Okay, I understand.

553
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,279
Usually, you guys...

554
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,039
Who do you usually interact with the most?

555
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,279
In our line of work,

556
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,880
we don't really interact with anyone.

557
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,839
Normally, we leave early and come back late.

558
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,319
When we get home, we just crash and sleep.

559
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,640
So, recently, have you...

560
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,480
had any unpleasant incidents with anyone?

561
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,039
Any arguments, quarrels, or conflicts?

562
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,559
No, that's even less likely.

563
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:55,880
At most, we just bargain with others.

564
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,079
That's about it.

565
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,319
I understand, I understand.

566
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,319
The child's mother now...

567
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,559
As soon as she heard about what happened to the child,

568
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,759
she fainted right away.

569
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,839
She's still in the hospital now.

570
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,599
Captain Huang

571
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,680
Do you think

572
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,400
could it be the same person?

573
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,799
That's possible.

574
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,920
We can't rule it out.

575
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:23,839
If only that were the case.

576
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,599
As long as we catch him,

577
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,599
we can also find Cheng Yunhao.

578
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,359
Then do this:

579
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
Take a few days off from the 11/25 case

580
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,359
and come back for a few days.

581
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,160
Focus on fully cooperating with Zhao Dali's team for now.

582
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,799
See if there's a possibility to merge the cases.

583
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,319
Wait, let's hold on a second.

584
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,319
But I've been thinking about this.

585
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,880
How did his asking price suddenly jump from eight thousand

586
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,119
to one hundred and ten thousand?

587
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah, that's a huge difference.

588
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Even if he succeeded last time,

589
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
he's getting greedy way too fast.

590
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:47,920
So, you see,

591
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,200
is it possible that

592
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,200
he saw our newspaper notice,

593
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,599
where the reward for one child is one hundred and fifty thousand,

594
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,759
but he only asked him for eight thousand?

595
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,359
He really lost out on that deal.

596
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,440
So he decided to ask for more this time.

597
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,839
This is going to be a problem, Master.

598
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,160
He never intended to release the child for money.

599
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,720
We've provoked him into committing another crime.

600
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,640
Enough.

601
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,720
Here's what we'll do.

602
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,279
Ziming, from now on,

603
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,279
you, for twenty-four hours,

604
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,359
must stay with the victim at all times.

605
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,799
Everyone else, split up and get ready.

606
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,279
Check around this wholesale market

607
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,559
and map out all possible routes.

608
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,519
Prepare for the capture.

609
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,160
This time, we can't afford any mistakes.

610
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:21,799
Move out.

611
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
Could you please calm down first?

612
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,359
We will definitely find the child.

613
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,160
The child will definitely be found.

614
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,359
That's right.

615
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,960
Are you all having a meeting now?

616
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:32,480
No.

617
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm telling you, time waits for no one.

618
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,160
Please don't worry, don't worry.

619
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,039
Worrying won't help.

620
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,000
You go ahead and take care of your things.

621
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,519
Okay.

622
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,359
Come with me.

623
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,640
Wait, where are we going?

624
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We're going to look for money.

625
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
We'll get as much as we can.

626
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:43,720
No, that's not it.

627
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,359
Didn't you just say we didn't need to look for money?

628
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,640
We didn't mean for you to actually give it.

629
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,480
Borrow from relatives and friends.

630
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,039
Even if you can't borrow a single cent,

631
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,680
you still need to make it look like you're trying to borrow money.

632
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,079
This is to prevent it from being someone you know.

633
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,240
And secretly gather information.

634
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,960
Also,

635
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,480
every call you receive from now on

636
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,240
must be listened to very carefully.

637
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,759
If it's the kidnappers calling,

638
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,119
you must find a way to stall them.

639
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,400
Try to buy as much time as possible.

640
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,160
Do you understand?

641
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:06,400
Okay.

642
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,039
Let's go.

643
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,279
I'll take all of these.

644
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,559
Give me some more.

645
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,200
Alright.

646
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,839
Boss, how much is this one?

647
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,559
This one? It's three hundred fifty.

648
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,400
Three hundred fifty is too much. Can you make it cheaper?

649
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,359
That's not expensive.

650
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,960
It's already a good deal.

651
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,119
Still too high.

652
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,680
How much do you want to pay?

653
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,079
One hundred.

654
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,799
No way.

655
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,960
There's no profit in that, no profit.

656
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,759
That's not possible.

657
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,079
Lao Wang.

658
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,559
Brother Hao.

659
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:34,920
What's up?

660
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,200
I want to ask if I can borrow some money.

661
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,079
Having cash flow problems again?

662
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,359
How much?

664
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,119
Sixty thousand.

665
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,000
Sixty thousand?

666
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,200
Something came up.

667
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
Don't ask, it's emergency money.

668
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,559
Do you have it or not?

669
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,960
It's all tied up in inventory.

670
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,440
All the money is in the goods.

671
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,960
This is all the cash flow from this morning.

672
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,920
You can take it all.

673
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
Alright, give it all to me.

674
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,519
Thank you, Brother Hao.

675
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,720
Come get your big corn!

676
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,680
Sweet and glutinous corn here!

677
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,480
How much is it?

678
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Two yuan per ear.

679
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Come get your sweet and glutinous corn!

680
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,440
Have some corn!

681
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,119
The police are handling a case.

682
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,279
I need to use your stall for a moment.

683
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,759
Thank you, thank you for your cooperation.

684
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,519
Alright, alright.

685
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,400
Thank you for your cooperation.

686
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,839
Go check over there and keep an eye on that side.

687
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:06,680
How is it?

688
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,319
How's point one?

689
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
Didn't have time to count, but it should be about right.

690
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,599
Any movement?

691
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:24,720
No.

692
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,400
Remember.

693
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,440
Don't pay unless you see the child.

694
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,440
Understood.

695
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,119
Hello

696
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,519
Have you got the money ready?

697
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,720
It's ready, it's ready.

698
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,519
Where are you?

699
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,839
The location has changed.

700
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
Changyang Park East Gate, four o'clock sharp

701
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,279
I want to talk to the child

702
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,480
I want to talk to the child

703
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,920
Hello

704
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,480
Hello

705
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,880
Huang, the meeting location has changed.

706
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,400
They want it at exactly four o'clock.

707
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,720
At the east gate of Changyang Park.

708
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,039
All our earlier preparations were for nothing, huh?

709
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,880
Hurry up.

710
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,440
Let's go, move quickly.

711
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,480
All units, stay alert.

712
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
All units, stay alert.

713
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,000
The meeting location has changed.

714
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,119
East gate of Changyang Park.

715
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:51,880
Everyone, withdraw separately.

716
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,519
Everyone, withdraw separately.

717
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Thanks, man.

718
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,480
Okay.

719
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,119
The suspect could show up at any moment.

720
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,319
Everyone, stay sharp.

721
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,200
This kidnapper is highly alert to counter-surveillance.

722
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,359
He probably has a criminal record.

723
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,000
Keep a close watch on him.

724
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,519
Hello, I'm here, I'm here.

725
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,559
Let the police next to you talk to me.

726
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,960
What police? There's no police here.

727
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,400
Do you want the money or not?

728
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,799
Why are you yelling?

729
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,720
Do you still want your child?

730
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,200
I want my child.

731
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,759
At the very least,

732
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,359
let me talk to my child.

733
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,960
I need to know if he's alive.

734
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,920
Isn't that right?

735
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,279
Soon.

736
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,480
Bring the money and you can pick up your child.

737
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,839
In front of the Second Hospital, five o'clock.

738
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,319
Okay.

739
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay, I got it.

740
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:14,960
I'll trust you this time.

741
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,319
But I can't make it by five.

742
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,720
I can only get there by six.

743
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,079
Okay.

744
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,079
There's a bus stop at the entrance. Wait there.

745
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,119
Okay, wait for me.

746
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:24,519
Wait a moment.

747
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,320
What's wrong, Master?

748
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,679
How do we get to that consultation room?

749
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,559
Turn left, then go straight to the end.

750
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
You'll see a consultation room—that's the one.

751
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Hello, do you need any assistance?

752
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,559
Is Liu Hongxia here?

753
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,159
Liu Hongxia.

754
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,400
No one answered, let's not wait any longer.

755
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,679
Next, please.

756
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,639
Zhang Li.

757
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,280
Zhang Li.

758
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,199
Here he comes, Zhang Li is here.

759
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,159
It's your turn.

760
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,079
Alright, I won't wait anymore.

761
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,320
Here you go.

762
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,599
Thank you.

763
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,960
Keep an eye on it.

764
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,559
The problem now is

765
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,400
we still can't be sure if he's the suspect.

766
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,320
Whatever you do, don't alert him.

767
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Right, only move in if he makes a move.

768
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,679
Don't withdraw the perimeter.

769
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,719
Keep a close watch on him.

770
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,119
Call me immediately if anything happens.

771
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,440
Brother Dali

772
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,559
Wang Dongfeng has already gone in with the money.

773
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,920
Okay, got it.

774
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,599
Alright.

775
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,360
Hello.

776
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,199
Wang Dongfeng, what are you trying to do?

777
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,519
Who let you in?

778
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,440
No, it's not that.

779
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,079
I... I really needed to use the bathroom.

780
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,519
Let me tell you something.

781
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,360
Go back right now.

782
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:14,360
Then take the next bus for two stops.

783
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,400
Did you hear me?

784
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
After you get off at the second stop,

785
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,880
wait for my call.

786
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,679
Don't hang up on me.

787
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,559
Did you hear me?

788
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,400
Okay, okay, I'll go back right away.

789
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,519
I'm going back right now.

790
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,559
Otherwise, watch out for your child. Do you hear me?

791
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,000
Squat down.

792
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't move.

793
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,679
What are you doing?

794
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,599
Don't move!

795
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,760
Police. What's your name?

796
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,440
What's your name?

797
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,760
Zhao Hui.

798
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
How many of you came here?

799
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,920
Where's the child? Where is the child?

800
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,000
Take him away.

801
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:55,920
Get up. Get up.

802
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,480
Keep your head down.

803
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,400
Wait a moment.

804
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,920
Zhao Hui.

805
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,519
Where is my child?

806
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,519
Calm down, calm down.

807
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,280
Calm down.

808
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,000
Calm down.

809
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
Where is my child?

810
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,079
Speak.

811
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:14,599
Calm down.

812
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,239
If there's something, talk about it back at the station.

813
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,400
Where is my child? Tell me!

814
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,119
We'll talk at the station.

815
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,199
Take him back to the station too.

816
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,880
Yes.

817
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,079
Come down. Come out.

818
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:33,960
Come down.

819
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,559
Come down. Come out.

820
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:36,880
Come down.

821
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,719
Go.

822
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,159
Take him away. Don't move.

823
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:41,760
Don't move around.

824
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,000
Sit down.

825
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,519
Come on, tell me—where is the kid hiding?

826
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,199
The kid?

827
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,719
What kid?

828
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,079
Don't play dumb.

829
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,760
Your old employer—

830
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,119
Wang Dongfeng's son, Wang Xiaoyong.

831
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,039
Where is he hiding?

832
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,360
No—

833
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,079
What does his missing son have to do with me?

834
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,039
How would I know?

835
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:26,880
Zhao Hui.

836
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,559
Let me tell you something.

837
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:29,679
When we handle cases at the police station,

838
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,559
we always base things on facts,

839
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,199
and follow the law as our standard.

840
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,159
As for you right now,

841
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,320
you should say what you know.

842
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,239
Give yourself a chance.

843
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,159
Whether you take this chance or not

844
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,840
depends entirely on your attitude.

845
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,599
Do you understand?

846
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,760
What chance? What attitude?

847
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,599
This is my attitude.

848
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,599
You're framing me.

849
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,760
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

850
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,920
I'll sue you for false accusation.

851
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,079
How many times has this happened?

852
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,400
How many have you kidnapped?

853
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,519
Kidnapped who?

854
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,880
Kidnapping for ransom.

855
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,559
Who are you trying to scare?

856
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:13,440
Fine.

857
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,880
You're pretty tough, kid.

858
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,760
Alright, let's wait it out then.

859
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,760
No, we’re not really close either.

860
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,760
He just worked for me about half a year ago.

861
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,320
He was in charge of receiving and shipping goods.

862
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,159
Did you ever have any conflicts?

863
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,039
No.

864
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,800
Then why did he leave later?

865
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
Did you fire him?

866
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
No, no, no.

867
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,519
He left on his own.

868
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,960
I even paid him his last month’s wages.

869
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,039
I settled it with him.

870
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,760
Do you know where he went after that?

871
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,239
I think he went to

872
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,000
the building materials market next door.

873
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,400
He was in charge of deliveries.

874
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,320
He lives here.

875
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Yes.

876
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,960
Open it.

877
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:02,760
You stay here.

878
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,320
Okay.

879
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,159
Ziming

880
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,159
Here's a vehicle registration.

881
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,079
Take a look.

882
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,119
Talk.

883
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,639
What is this?

884
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,880
I don't know, never seen it.

885
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,880
We found it on you, and you don't know?

886
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,960
I picked it up off the ground. Is that a crime?

887
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,800
It's not a crime. Let me read it to you.

888
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,840
Wang Dongfeng, 1319037483.

889
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,119
He says he picked it up.

890
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

891
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,679
Fine, we're hungry too.

892
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,679
We've been hungry half the day just to catch you.

893
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,119
Think it over carefully.

894
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,320
How should I say it?

895
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,440
Just finish talking sooner.

896
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,559
Wouldn't it be better if we all went to a restaurant together?

897
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,400
At least let me use the bathroom.

898
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,519
Sure.

899
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Whatever you want.

900
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,480
We'll go with you, no problem.

901
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,599
Are you going to wipe for me?

902
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,559
I'll wipe for you.

903
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,039
Zhang Yu, come here.

904
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,280
I don't want to go anymore.

905
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,039
Brother Lei

906
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,480
Yes.
