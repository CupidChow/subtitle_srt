1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,239
How are you?

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,719
I

3
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,439
am really good.

4
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,319
Come on, come on.

5
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,840
Come on, let's hurry up.

6
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Has your anesthesia worn off?

7
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,719
You should get another shot.

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,159
No, no need, Dr. Wang.

9
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,959
He’s not afraid of pain, he can really endure it.

10
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,680
Even if you stitch a few more times, he’ll be fine.

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,639
Really?

12
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,039
You can hold it in.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,159
That works too.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,199
Don't move.

15
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,520
It hurts, doesn't it?

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,759
It doesn't hurt, I'm fine.

17
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,479
How can a wound this big not hurt?

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
Doctor, please be gentle.

19
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,039
Alright, don't worry.

20
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,039
Qing.

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
Come, you wrap it up.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,719
I'll head over right away.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,319
Thank you, doctor.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Be gentle.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,039
You really need to keep an eye on him.

26
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,479
He's always getting into something new every day.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,520
Back when he was on the wrestling team, it was just minor injuries.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Now that he's a police officer, it's so much more dangerous.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,479
Now he's getting hurt down to the flesh.

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,919
Next time, it might even reach the bone.

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
My ex-boyfriend was like that too.

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,159
He was the same way.

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,319
You don't like it?

34
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,439
I actually like it a lot.

35
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,520
Didn't you see?

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,960
He just fought two people by himself. It was really cool.

37
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
Does he have time to be with you?

38
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,439
If he has time, he keeps me company.

39
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,199
If he doesn't, then he doesn't.

40
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,680
I have a good time on my own.

41
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,360
It's not like I'll die if no one is with me.

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,159
Thanks.

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Let's go. Come on.

44
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Thanks.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,639
Don't forget to come back and change your bandages.

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,719
This is the one who scrubbed your scalp raw.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,199
Let's not talk about it. It's all in the past.

48
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,080
Why not talk about it? Come on, tell us.

49
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,319
Why did you two break up?

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,719
Tingting, you really need to think this through.

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,159
In our line of work, we hardly ever see each other.

52
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,560
Liu Ziming, listen to me carefully.

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,520
Whether we see each other or not,

54
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
you're still my person, Fang Tingting's.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,759
Tomorrow, change the dressing somewhere else.

56
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,680
I'll poke you.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,879
Change it.

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,800
Tomorrow is Wang Xuanxuan's birthday.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,879
Master asked me to buy a cake and bring it to her.

60
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,199
Alright, it's a good chance for you to spend some money.

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,160
You get to decide?

62
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,680
Let's go, Xuanxuan.

63
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,439
I'm not going.

64
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,160
Get in the car.

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
Peng asked me to pick you up.

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
He said it's for your birthday.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,480
Let go.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,639
What, not giving me any respect?

69
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,000
Do I owe you any respect?

70
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,639
Getting bold, huh?

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me be clear, you're going whether you want to or not.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,839
Got it?

73
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,720
You hit me.

74
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,120
Get in the car.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
Get in the car, now.

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,879
Try touching me again.

77
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,000
Wang Xuanxuan.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,439
Who are you?

79
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,879
Give it to me.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,560
Give it to me.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,439
I'm asking you a question.

82
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,519
I asked who you are.

83
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,040
You don't know her.

84
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,759
Let's go.

85
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,639
What, you're taking her with you?

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm telling you, she can't leave today.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Maybe you can't leave either.

88
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,399
Trying to act tough and fight?

89
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,000
What kind of skill is it to hit a girl?

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Trying to act fierce?

91
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,279
Let's go.

92
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,319
Why are you here?

93
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,879
Get up, now.

94
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,439
You think I wanted to come here?

95
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,360
How old are you?

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,480
How did you know today is my birthday?

97
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,800
Let's just leave it at that.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
Do I look that old?

99
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,720
Who is Wei Jie to you?

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,199
You call him Wei Jie too?

101
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,240
A friend.

102
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,120
More like your dad's friend, right?

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,199
Why are you staring at me?

104
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,079
All your dishes are here.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,639
Thank you.

106
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,240
Are you still thinking of poking me with a compass?

107
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,319
Why are you celebrating your birthday alone?

108
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,319
Where are your mom and dad?

109
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,000
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,839
Why are you so angry?

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,240
Blow out the candle before you leave.

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,319
I thought you were going to treat me to something delicious.

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,240
But it's just someone else's leftover cake.

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,480
Just tell me, does it taste good or not?

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
It tastes good.

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,519
But

117
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
it's not as good as the one from the day before yesterday,

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,319
the birthday cake I bought for your sister.

119
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
You forgot again.

120
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
You two celebrated together that day.

121
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,560
Let me talk to you about something serious.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,319
My parents want to meet you.

123
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,120
What's wrong?

124
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Weren't you the one who said it?

125
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,920
That we should get our marriage certificate when we're both free?

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,120
Have you changed your mind?

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,319
Shouldn't there be an official proposal or something?

128
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,160
A ceremony.

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,000
Kneeling down in front of everyone.

130
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,279
Forget it, we don't need a proposal.

131
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm afraid of that.

132
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,360
But I still think we should meet the parents.

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,519
Tomorrow evening at 7:30.

134
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,439
Come to my house.

135
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't be late.

136
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
I'll think about it.

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,759
What is there to think about?

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,199
Even if it's raining knives, you have to come.

139
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
If you don't come, I'll kill you.

140
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,480
Alright, I'll go.

141
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Mr. Li.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,240
Brother Ming is here to see you again.

143
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,519
Brother-in-law.

144
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,639
Come in, come in.

145
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,240
I'm busy.

146
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,079
I brought you some fruit.

147
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,639
What do you mean?

148
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,399
Are you trying to barter again?

149
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,639
With what?

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,279
Didn't you always say you'd teach me about tea tasting?

152
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,439
I just happen to be free today.

153
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,480
So I came over to learn how to drink tea from you.

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,120
You've finally figured it out.

155
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
How's this tea?

156
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,360
Is that even drinkable?

157
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,839
You have to drink it.

158
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm telling you, you have to drink this kind.

159
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,120
It's sold by the gram.

160
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,080
By the gram?

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
How much does this cost?

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,039
It's not available anymore, you can't buy it no matter the price.

163
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,720
President Li, President Wang is here.

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,879
He’s waiting for you in the meeting room.

165
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,639
Alright, alright.

166
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,720
Then you, you smell it first.

167
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,440
I’ll be back in a bit.

168
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,639
Okay, you go ahead and take care of things.

169
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,840
Let’s go, let’s go.

170
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,240
Come back later.

171
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Don’t be mad, don’t be mad.

172
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,919
It’s only natural for a brother-in-law to take from his brother-in-law.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Senior brother, can you listen to this for me?

174
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,799
Want a banana?

175
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,720
Go wait over there.

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
Listen, I need to practice.

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,799
Yang, what are you doing?

178
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,799
Hello.

179
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,399
What is this?

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
He's going to Thailand.

181
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,399
I'm done joking with you.

182
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,799
I have to catch a flight tomorrow morning.

183
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,039
I'm going to sleep.

184
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,600
Goodbye.

185
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,200
That's not Thai either.

186
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,120
Be careful.

187
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,919
See you when you get back.

188
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,759
Why are you going to Thailand?

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,320
Going to Thailand to catch someone—an Interpol red notice.

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,559
That sounds great.

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,919
What's so great about it?

192
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,279
You think it's a vacation?

193
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
It's dangerous.

194
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,440
Why isn't this working?

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,600
Lei.

196
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,399
Can you help me fix this thing?

197
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,879
Lei.

198
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,639
That Wang Xuanxuan.

199
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,559
Do you know what's up with her parents?

200
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,519
Wang Xuanxuan.

201
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Don't know her. Who is that?

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,919
You don't know her?

203
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,399
Forget it then.

204
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,279
Ma.

205
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,360
Can I ask you something?

206
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,759
Do you know a girl named Wang Xuanxuan?

207
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,759
Wasn't she called Wang Xuanzi before?

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,360
She changed her name.

209
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,639
No.

210
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Is she my mentor's daughter?

211
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,360
You don't know?

212
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,240
How would I know?

213
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,919
I don't know either.

214
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,279
No, you definitely know.

215
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,960
There was a case five years ago.

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
The wife had an affair.

217
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,240
The husband killed both his wife and her lover with a knife.

218
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:29,039
He was later sentenced to death.

219
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,080
I think I've heard about this.

220
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,399
As for this case,

221
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,799
it was handled by your mentor.

222
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,840
Her father was also arrested by your mentor.

223
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,799
At the time of the arrest,

224
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,960
the child was about ten years old.

225
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,600
It happened right after she got out of school that day.

226
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
She saw everything.

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,759
That child is Wang Xuanxuan.

228
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,559
She didn't have any relatives.

229
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
So no one was left to take care of her.

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,559
She skipped classes and hung out in internet cafes all day.

231
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,759
It was your mentor who pulled her out of that life.

232
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,240
He counseled her and helped her.

233
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,080
In just a few years,

234
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,360
her grades reportedly improved.

235
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,799
She's now one of the top students in her class.

236
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,080
She's really smart.

237
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,799
She can even play the drums.

238
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,039
Some cases are just considered closed once they're solved.

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,080
Everyone thinks the case is over.

240
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
The bad guy is caught.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
And that's supposed to be the end of it.

242
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,840
But few people care about those left behind.

243
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,600
Brother Ma

244
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,320
You guys are here.

245
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,279
Brother Ma

246
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,000
What's up?

247
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
Brother Ma, is that thing stuck to you or what?

248
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,679
Don't move. What are you doing?

249
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
Stop messing around.

250
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,679
The child's mother came to report a case.

251
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
She said her daughter was raped.

252
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,559
Did you do a trace examination?

253
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,879
It's not a recent case.

254
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,159
It happened six months ago.

255
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,679
Then why is she only reporting it now?

256
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,639
The girl's mother said she's been busy working in the fields every day.

257
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,159
We found out yesterday that the girl is pregnant.

258
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,039
When we asked, she said she was raped.

259
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,559
Does the girl know who did it?

260
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,159
She only said that someone dragged her into the field at night.

261
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,159
She doesn't know who it was.

262
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,080
Let's go, let's go inside first.

263
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,080
It's too noisy out here.

264
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,320
It's not convenient to talk here.

265
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
I'll have the two of them wait here for now.

266
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,480
I'll leave it to you, Yalin.

267
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,559
No problem.

268
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,919
Hello, ma'am. I'm from the criminal police unit.

269
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm here to take a statement from the child.

270
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,519
What's your name?

271
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Tang Xiaoru.

272
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,720
Xiaoru.

273
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,639
Xiaoru, how old are you this year?

274
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,679
I'm asking you—say something.

275
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,120
Is your mind muddled or something?

276
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,320
Sixteen

277
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Xiaoru, what grade are you in this year?

278
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,519
What grade? She can't go to school.

279
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,600
How can she go to school with that big belly?

280
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,759
She's such a disgrace.

281
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,679
Auntie, could you let the child speak for herself?

282
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,440
Fine.

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,639
Stand up for me. No, no, no.

284
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,879
Speak properly. Don't.

285
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,519
Can you have her mother step out for a moment?

286
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,519
It's impossible to ask like this.

287
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,080
Okay.

288
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,879
How can the child talk with you here?

289
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,559
You like this...

290
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,320
Why don't you go to the other room, have some water, and calm down?

291
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,279
Come with me to the other room.

292
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,159
Don't touch me.

293
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,080
Let me tell you,

294
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,039
it's her shameful business

295
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,519
that made me this way.

296
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,480
I don't even want to live anymore, you know?

297
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,200
Calm down, okay?

298
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Alright, alright.

299
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,159
See, you can't be like this.

300
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,159
How can I calm down?

301
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:13,919
Alright, alright.

302
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,559
We're just doing our job, right?

303
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,559
Come on, sit here and calm down.

304
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,519
Alright.

305
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,879
Go get her a glass of water.

306
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,480
Auntie

307
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,080
Where is Xiaoru's father?

308
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,679
He passed away.

309
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,200
Xiaoru's father was a truck driver.

310
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,399
He died in a car accident.

311
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,279
Her father left early, he's at peace now.

312
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,080
All these years, I've had to be both father and mother.

313
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,799
And I still have to endure this shame with her.

314
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,519
You see this child, sometimes I just don't want to go on.

315
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,960
Your daughter is a victim too.

316
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,360
I'm a victim as well.

317
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,080
I've told her so many times.

318
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,879
Don't go out at night.

319
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,639
Don't go out and mess around.

320
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,480
She doesn't listen.

321
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,159
Every other day, she sneaks off to that person's place.

322
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,039
That person's house.

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,240
Whose house?

324
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,279
Zhao Yingchun, a classmate of hers.

325
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,480
Is it a boy or a girl?

326
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,320
A girl.

327
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,440
But there are men in that household.

328
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,159
Right?

329
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,679
If only there were a man in our family,

330
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,480
would I be bullied like this?

331
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,200
Right?

332
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,399
It's humiliating.

333
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,360
I really don't want to live anymore.

334
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,519
Have some water.

335
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,879
Here, put on this hat.

336
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,480
I don't need it.

337
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,839
Go ahead and wear it, it's getting cold.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,480
Thank you.

339
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,599
It's nothing, just put it on.

340
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,319
Is it here?

341
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,960
Didn't you tell me last night it was over there?

342
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
Is it the Shi family's place?

343
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,359
I can't remember clearly.

344
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,160
Are you out of your mind? What can you even remember?

345
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,240
Maybe it was dark at night, and the kid was nervous.

346
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,680
So the memory isn't that clear.

347
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,480
No, what's so hard to remember about this?

348
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,960
Each family only has one plot of land.

349
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,160
It's not like she hasn't worked with me before.

350
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
She could find it with her eyes closed.

351
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,759
Isn't that our family's land?

352
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,920
Such a big piece of land.

353
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,559
Can you handle all this by yourself?

354
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,599
She used to know a thing or two.

355
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,160
She could lend a hand.

356
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,319
But now, she just stays in bed.

357
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,200
She gets dizzy after a while.

358
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,160
She keeps throwing up every now and then.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,599
She's so dramatic, honestly.

360
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,319
So, no relatives have come to help out?

361
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,799
After her father passed away,

362
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,160
no one has visited since.

363
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,599
Only a fellow villager came by a couple of years ago.

364
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,880
He was able to lend a hand back then.

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Now, he won't come even if you ask.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,319
He says the pay is too little.

367
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,559
Where does Zhao Yingchun live?

368
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,559
Whose house?

369
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,440
Zhao Yingchun.

370
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,160
Over there, to the east.

371
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,160
A bit to the west from there is our house.

372
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,400
Why don't you take Xiaoru home and let her rest for a bit?

373
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Why should I rest?

374
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm busy, I have so much to do.

375
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,200
Yalin, hurry up and see them off. Let's go.

376
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Stop complaining.

377
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,359
Let alone half a year,

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
even if this case was reported three days ago,

379
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,599
we might not be able to find any clues.

380
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,480
What are the mother and daughter planning to do?

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
They don't have money for an abortion.

382
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,279
The mother said to let the child be born.

383
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,160
Give birth to it.

384
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
Xiao Ru is only sixteen.

385
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
What will they do if she gives birth?

386
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
An abortion doesn't even cost that much.

387
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,559
When the man in their family died in a car accident,

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,480
because the vehicle wasn't insured,

389
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,680
they didn't get a single cent in compensation.

390
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,759
She relies on farming this land to support her daughter.

391
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,799
She really has no money.

392
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Bai Xiaoju just said

393
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
there's a fellow villager who comes to help.

394
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,599
Do you know what he does?

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,559
I don't know.

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,799
Bai Xiaoju can't explain it clearly either.

397
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,200
He wanders around all day.

398
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,279
Sometimes he comes back to help with the farming,

399
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,559
and helps out during the corn harvest.

400
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,440
Now,

401
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,400
no one knows where he's gone off to make money again.

402
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,079
Cases like this

403
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Eighty percent of the time, the perpetrator is someone the victim knows.

404
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,279
No doubt about it.

405
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,880
I think we can't rule out the possibility of puppy love either.

406
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:47,799
Alright then.

407
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,039
Let's look around the area.

408
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,359
Let's also ask around at the school.

409
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,559
Okay.

410
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,559
Then I'll go talk to Zhao Yingchun.

411
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,599
Let's go. Okay.

412
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,440
How did this get spread around the class?

413
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,759
Who was the first to talk about it?

414
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,160
I don't know.

415
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,000
At first, I thought she had just gained weight.

416
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,599
I even argued with someone about it.

417
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,680
Later, I asked her several times.

418
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,920
She finally admitted it to me.

419
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,680
When Xiaoru comes to see you,

420
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,200
what do you two usually do together?

421
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,599
We just watch TV together.

422
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,759
Read some magazines.

423
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
And chat about things.

424
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,319
Do you ever go to her house to hang out?

425
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,680
Not really.

426
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,279
She always comes to me.

427
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,160
She doesn't like staying at her own home.

428
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,799
Her mom is always working in the fields.

429
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,920
They hardly even talk to each other.

430
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,200
They don't even have regular mealtimes.

431
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,480
My mom is always at home.

432
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
So she often comes to our house for meals.

433
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,200
Sometimes, if it's late,

434
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,279
she just sleeps over here.

435
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,079
Since you two are so close,

436
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,880
has she ever told you

437
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,359
if she likes any boys?

438
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,279
No.

439
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,319
She doesn't like hanging out with boys.

440
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,599
She barely even talks to them.

441
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,799
Does she keep a diary?

442
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,880
Who even keeps a diary these days?

443
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,920
Does she have any friends outside of school?

444
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Absolutely not.

445
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,319
So what does she usually like?

446
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
That's where the two of us just can't connect.

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,759
The things she likes are just too out there.

448
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,480
She likes aliens.

449
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,559
Officer

450
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,119
You’ll definitely catch the bad guys, right?

451
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,480
Definitely.

452
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,599
Thank you.

453
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,319
It's the place up ahead.

454
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,720
We pay by the piece here.

455
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Making one flower earns you two cents.

456
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,400
A vine has eight flowers on it.

457
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,319
And a few leaves.

458
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,839
Altogether, that's seventeen and a half cents.

459
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,200
If you're quick with your hands,

460
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
you can make four or five yuan a day.

461
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,640
She used to work in a cold storage.

462
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,759
She helped people pull off shrimp heads.

463
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,200
She earned more there than here.

464
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
She could make about ten yuan a day.

465
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,960
Her hands got frozen; she worked there for half a year.

466
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,960
She only came here after her hands were damaged by the cold.

467
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,640
A few fingers on her right hand

468
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
don't work well now.

469
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,240
She works slowly.

470
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,599
I didn't really want to let her come.

471
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,279
But then she said,

472
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,839
If others work ten hours,

473
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,920
she'll work twenty hours.

474
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,519
So I thought I'd look out for her.

475
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,599
That's why I let her come.

476
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
So, those two, mother and daughter,

477
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,680
who do they usually get along with in the village?

478
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,799
Who wants to get too close to a widow's house?

479
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,079
Even if she asks for help fixing up her house, no one comes.

480
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,079
She has to do everything herself.

481
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,119
It's really pitiful.

482
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,319
She has to be the father, the mother, and even the beast of burden.

483
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,599
Homeroom teacher

484
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,119
I talked to all her subject teachers.

485
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,000
Their evaluations were pretty much the same.

486
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:29,640
What about Xiaoru?

487
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,799
She doesn't cause trouble and keeps a low profile.

488
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,400
What about her classmates?

489
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
I asked around about that too.

490
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,200
No boys have had any special contact with her.

491
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,440
Is there anything off about the teachers?

492
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,519
I didn't notice anything unusual.

493
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
Just now, Ma and I

494
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,400
also asked all the neighbors in the area.

495
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,559
No one seemed suspicious.

496
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,039
If we have to talk about something unusual,

497
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,920
the most unusual one is Xiaoru herself.

498
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,920
She won't say anything right now.

499
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,400
Is it that she doesn't want to talk, or is she afraid to?

500
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,480
How about this:

501
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,720
Let's check her online activity when we get back.

502
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,920
See what she's posted.

503
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,039
And who she's been friends with.

504
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,599
Okay.

505
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,720
Ziming

506
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
You and Ma, go back to the station.

507
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,279
Check the household registration records for Bai Xiaojü's family.

508
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,079
Got it.

509
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,559
This is Bai Xiaojv's household registration information.

510
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,279
Bai Xiaojv's original hometown is Cang County.

511
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,880
She is the third child in her family.

512
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
She has two older sisters.

513
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,599
She has a younger brother.

514
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
But he passed away young.

515
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,799
She married here when she was twenty.

516
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,359
She has no relatives here.

517
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,400
Do you think it's possible

518
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,519
that during holidays and festivals

519
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,559
Bai Xiaojv took Xiao Ru back to her hometown?

520
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,279
What about the people she interacted with back home?

521
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,400
We've already asked about that.

522
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,240
She hasn't gone back since her parents passed away.

523
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,519
Then we can only wait for news from Brother Lei.

524
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,400
It's eight o'clock, I have to go.

525
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm going to meet my mother-in-law.

526
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,240
Wait a moment.

527
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,920
You're meeting your mother-in-law in those clothes?

528
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
At the very least, you should change into clean pants.

529
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,160
Where would I find clean pants?

530
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,839
Wait a second.

531
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,559
Old Wu.

532
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,759
Old Wu.

533
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,880
Old Ma, what's up?

534
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,079
Do you have a pair of

535
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,720
long pants you can wear?

536
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,839
I have to say, it actually suits you.

537
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,240
It fits, just right.

538
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:15,599
Thank you, Wu.

539
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,319
You're welcome.

540
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,599
Why do you have a pet here?

541
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,279
You're asking about that?

542
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Don't even mention it.

543
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,799
It's a chicken raised by the neighbor upstairs.

544
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,359
It's so annoying.

545
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,400
It makes noise every day.

546
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,920
Every time it makes noise, people call the police.

547
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,839
There's nothing we can do.

548
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,559
Guess what Ma did.

549
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,000
He bought it himself.

550
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,920
Brother Wu, can I ask you something?

551
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,960
Why is Brother Ma always fully geared up every day?

552
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,079
He takes things so seriously.

553
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,839
You're asking about that?

554
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,680
This goes back more than twenty years.

555
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,680
Back then, Old Ma was working a case with his mentor.

556
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,519
Coincidentally, there was a mentally ill person in that area.

557
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,599
He had episodes every day.

558
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,519
Whenever he had an episode,

559
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,599
the neighbors would call the police.

560
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Luckily, the first few times they went,

561
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,039
they were in uniform.

562
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
As soon as they arrived, he behaved himself.

563
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,240
But the last time,

564
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
his mentor went in plain clothes.

565
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,279
When they got there and knocked on the door,

566
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,759
the mentally ill man opened the door himself.

567
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,920
He even greeted them.

568
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,079
Doesn't that seem just like a normal person?

569
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,680
But who would have known,

570
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,240
he turned around and grabbed a kitchen knife.

571
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,279
He went straight for his mentor's neck.

572
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,759
So ever since then,

573
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,960
whenever Old Ma goes out on a call,

574
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,680
no matter if it's a big case or a small one,

575
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,880
he always wears full gear.

576
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,640
Alright, thanks, Wu.

577
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,400
Don't mention it.

578
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,319
Take it easy.

579
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,839
Wu, Wu!

580
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,519
Bring me that chicken.

581
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,359
Why do you need the chicken? To stew it?

582
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,119
Aren't you going to your mother-in-law's? Alright.

583
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:42,960
So you have somewhere to go.

584
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,519
You can't go empty-handed.

585
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,200
Here.

586
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
Alright, I'll carry it over.

587
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,400
Take this.

588
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

589
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,160
Just take it if I tell you to.

590
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,279
Tingting, I'm downstairs.

591
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,200
Can you open the door for me?

592
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,440
My parents are already asleep.

593
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Maybe another day.

594
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
It's really okay, don't blame yourself.

595
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
Got it.

596
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,119
Hello.

597
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,440
You want to apologize to me?

598
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,839
I won't accept it.

599
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
Stop messing around, I have something to ask you.

600
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,839
So you can actually talk like a normal person.

601
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,240
What is it?

602
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,079
Go ahead.

603
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,559
How should I put this...

604
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,240
If you were bullied by a guy,

605
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,079
like, in a really serious way,

606
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,640
I take back what I just said.

607
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,240
You still can't talk like a normal person.

608
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,799
No, seriously, stop joking.

609
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,839
I just want to ask,

610
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
what do girls your age usually think about?

611
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,839
Why don't you want to talk about things when something happens?

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,680
Did Lao Wei say something to you?

613
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,240
No, it's not about you.

614
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,240
We have a case here.

615
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,200
A girl, about your age.

616
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,680
She won't say anything when we ask her.

617
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
Can you help me analyze it?

618
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,240
Why is that?

619
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,839
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

620
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,880
Just tell me, let me hear it.

621
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,039
Let me put it this way.

622
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,359
I have a girlfriend,

623
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,000
she was also bullied by a guy.

624
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,839
When I first asked her, she wouldn't tell me either.

625
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,359
So why did she tell you later?

626
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,839
Because I told her about my own experience.

627
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,400
Then she trusted me.

628
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,279
Alright, I get it.

629
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,559
Thank you, thank you.

630
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,599
You still haven't apologized to me.

631
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
The people of the opposite sex we usually come into contact with

632
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,319
are just teachers at school,

633
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,359
classmates, and neighbors.

634
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,759
Who else could there be?

635
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Didn't Bai Xiaojv say the other day

636
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,319
that there was a fellow villager who came to help?

637
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,240
Was it a man or a woman?

638
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,799
I'll ask her again in a bit.

639
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,960
But can I join in the conversation?

640
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,559
Of course, absolutely.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,839
I just went through

642
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,480
the files of previous rape cases.

643
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,200
I found that the victims in these cases

644
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,680
usually have a sense of guilt.

645
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:10,960
Why

646
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,079
when women experience sexual assault,

647
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,759
I've noticed they seem

648
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,160
more likely to reflect on

649
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,039
whether they dressed too revealingly,

650
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,440
or acted too flirtatiously,

651
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,440
and why they were the ones harmed, not someone else.

652
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,160
And if the perpetrator is someone they know,

653
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,200
the level of self-blame increases even more.

654
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,720
They can't help but think,

655
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
What exactly did I do?

656
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,200
Why would a good friend assault me?

657
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,839
Why would a respected elder

658
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,480
do something like this to me?

659
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,759
So they always blame themselves first,

660
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
and blame the perpetrator later.

661
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,640
But I think, compared to catching the suspect,

662
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,720
it's more important for Xiaoru to make peace with herself.

663
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,400
That's right.

664
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,200
Then, let's head out now.

665
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,240
Let's go.

666
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,720
You mentioned last time that there was a fellow villager coming to help.

667
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,880
Is it a man or a woman?

668
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
A man.

669
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,920
What's his name? How old is he?

670
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,200
Called

671
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,720
Tang Xiaoqiu

672
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,519
About the same as him

673
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,680
Thirty, I think

674
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,480
Yes

675
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,680
What does he do?

676
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,880
He used to drive trucks with my husband

677
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,160
He said the money wasn’t enough—let me, let me, let me

678
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,480
No, no, no

679
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,440
Don’t prick your hand, it’s fine, it’s fine

680
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,240
He said that job didn’t pay much

681
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,880
He’s just lazy, so he started doing business

682
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,039
Has he come by recently?

683
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,039
Haven’t seen a trace of him

684
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,880
When was the last time you saw him?

685
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,720
It was this summer

686
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,480
He helped out for a few days, then left again

687
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,559
He’s really unreliable, I’m telling you

688
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,440
With such a big thing happening to Xiao Ru

689
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,680
Didn’t you ask him for advice?

690
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,519
I told him

691
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Listen, you know what he said?

692
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,920
He said to get rid of it, that it’s an illegitimate child

693
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,039
He said it can’t be kept

694
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,000
That brat never has anything good to say

695
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,160
Come in

696
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,960
Put it here

697
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,440
She’s in that room

698
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,599
Why are you knocking on the door?

699
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,759
The police are here to ask you a few questions. Answer properly.

700
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,319
Auntie.

701
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,279
Why don't you just wait here?

702
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,119
Okay.

703
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,000
Go inside.

704
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,680
Alright.

705
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,480
There's a chair over there, you can sit there.

706
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,799
Xiaoru, don't be nervous.

707
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,279
We're just here to check on you.

708
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,000
Are you feeling unwell at all?

709
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,799
Xiaoru.

710
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,599
I heard you like aliens.

711
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
These books are for you.

712
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,319
Thank you.

713
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,279
Xiaoru.

714
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,039
Don't think of us as police officers.

715
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,680
Just think of me as an older sister.

716
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
Actually, you know,

717
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,279
There are many girls who have been bullied like you.

718
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,880
A lot of them were bullied by people they knew.

719
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,039
So you mustn't blame yourself.

720
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,039
Xiaoru.

721
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,400
When I was very young,

722
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,119
my mom passed away.

723
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,000
Just like your dad.

724
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,680
She also died in a car accident.

725
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,480
When my mom passed away,

726
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,039
I was even younger than you are now.

727
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,880
Back then, our family had a taxi.

728
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,720
They had agreed on a plan.

729
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,920
My mom would drive the day shift.

730
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,920
My dad would drive the night shift.

731
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,440
But because my dad drank a lot,

732
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,039
my mom had to drive day and night.

733
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,480
That day, my mom came back to switch shifts.

734
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,319
But my dad was drunk again.

735
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,119
Then the two of them had a big argument.

736
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Then she got in the car and left.

737
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
She never came back.

738
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,880
When I was a child, I always blamed myself.

739
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,039
I thought

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,480
it was my fault for not protecting my mom.

741
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,680
So I can understand you.

742
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,279
Why you don't want to talk about it.

743
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,319
Because you're afraid of causing trouble for your mom.

744
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,720
But Xiaoru,

745
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,640
if you don't say anything,

746
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,440
that's actually causing more trouble for your mom.

747
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,680
My mom has it really hard on her own.

748
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,000
She works in the fields by herself.

749
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,319
She supports the whole family.

750
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,640
And she still has to take care of me.

751
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,400
I don't want to make things harder for her.

752
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,039
Xiaoru,

753
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,480
you did nothing wrong in this matter.

754
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,920
But if you don't say anything,

755
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,599
your mom will be upset for the rest of her life.

756
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,360
Look,

757
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,519
your mom brought you to the police.

758
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,440
Isn't it because she wants us to catch the bad guy?

759
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,199
Right?

760
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,280
And that shameless criminal

761
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,679
still hasn't been brought to justice.

762
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,679
He could very well

763
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,639
go on to hurt other girls.

764
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,719
Why should he get away with it?

765
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,039
Right?

766
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,480
Xiaoru,

767
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,800
I know you know that person.

768
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,480
Can you tell me now

769
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
who he really is?

770
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,920
Yes.

771
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,679
Uncle Xiao Qiu.

772
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,360
He threatened you, didn't he?

773
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,719
He said if I told anyone about this,

774
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,000
He would strangle me and my mom.

775
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,039
When did it start?

776
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,480
The year before last.

777
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,800
It happened many times.

778
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,000
The one in the white shirt, right?

779
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,519
Yeah.

780
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:31,039
That's him.

781
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,039
He's so big, catch him.

782
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,639
I give up, I give up.

783
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,480
Do you admit defeat?

784
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,559
Yeah, I admit it.

785
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:41,760
Come on.

786
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:43,719
Five.

787
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,519
Seven.

788
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:47,239
Ghost.

789
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,199
Here.

790
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,920
Tang Xiaoqiu, your cards are pretty good.

791
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Tang Xiaoqiu.

792
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,559
Who are you?

793
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,280
Bai Xiaoju is your relative, right?

794
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,679
I brought something for you, it's in my car.

795
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,519
Come with me to get it.

796
00:35:59,039 --> 00:35:59,679
You keep playing.

797
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,599
I'll play, okay.

798
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,480
I haven't seen you before.

799
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,440
A friend, Bai Xiaoju's friend.

800
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
You know, your relative, the weather's really nice today.

801
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm telling you, they're so good to you.

802
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,559
They brought you a whole bunch of stuff.

803
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,880
It's just so-so.

804
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,239
Let's go.

805
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,320
Don't move! Police!

806
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,440
Police! Don't move!

807
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,559
Move and I'll shoot!

808
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,639
Why are you arresting me?

809
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:18,960
Don't move.

810
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,840
Tell me, what did you do?

811
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,719
What crime did I commit?

812
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:21,639
Don't move.

813
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,320
Auntie

814
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,039
Auntie

815
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,960
Stopped him

816
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,239
Okay

817
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,039
Alright, alright

818
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,239
Let him go. It's okay, Auntie.

819
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,320
Let him go

820
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,559
Stopped him

821
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,519
Ziming, open the door

822
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,440
Alright, alright, Auntie

823
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,800
Let me in

824
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,519
You can't go in here. You can't go in here.

825
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,760
Brother Ma pooled some money together with us.

826
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,559
It's not much, but enough for a surgery.

827
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
Do you think

828
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,559
I can't bear to part with this bit of money?

829
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,280
I asked already.

830
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,719
The doctor said six months is too late.

831
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,719
Having an induced labor now

832
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,920
is too risky.

833
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,800
If something goes wrong, it could cost her life.

834
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
I've already lost my husband.

835
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,840
I can't lose my daughter too.

836
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,880
How would I go on living, right?

837
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,480
What I think is,

838
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,559
the family would rather raise one more child

839
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,320
than lose another person, right?

840
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,440
To put it simply, it's all my fault.

841
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,039
I was only focused on making money.

842
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,519
Because I was earning money, I neglected my daughter.

843
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,039
How many years could he get?

844
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,519
This isn't up to us.

845
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,599
It's not up to you.

846
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,039
Damn it.

847
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,840
Thank you, thank you.

848
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,119
Deserves to be shot.

849
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,880
Let me see you out.

850
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,920
Shoot him.

851
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,000
Sixteen years old

852
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,920
About to become a mother

853
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,159
Someone like Tang Xiaoqiu

854
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,719
Wouldn’t have an easy life even if she went in

855
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
It's set.

856
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,360
Sister Bai, who is it?

857
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,000
It's me.

858
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,880
Officer Ma.

859
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Uncle Ma, Officer Ma.

860
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,159
Come in, come in!

861
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,360
It's the New Year, it's nothing much.

862
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,559
I'm here on behalf of the station to bring you some things.

863
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,840
You didn't have to bring anything.

864
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,800
No need for gifts, thank you.

865
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,519
How has Xiaoru's health been lately?

866
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,599
I'm doing well.

867
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,320
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

868
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,960
Um...

869
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,480
Have a seat over there and rest.

870
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,559
Let's have dumplings together in a bit.

871
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,239
No, thank you.

872
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,559
My wife is also making dumplings at home.

873
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,039
Then I'll head back now.

874
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,480
Brother-in-law, Happy New Year!

875
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,039
Dad, let me get you some tea leaves.

876
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:41,920
Alright, alright.

877
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,360
Let me introduce you to Dad.

878
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,159
Is there a camel on top of that?

879
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,800
Stop pretending to study, I saw you.

880
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,639
Come on, help make dumplings.

881
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,639
Take the camel down.

882
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,079
Take that camel down.

883
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,679
Take it down, they want that camel.

884
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,519
Do you know how to make dumplings?

885
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,079
Yes, I do.

886
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,360
Her father, it's New Year.

887
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,800
The three of us are doing just fine.

888
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
So don't worry.

889
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,480
Let's eat dumplings.

890
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
Chengcheng

891
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Look what Daddy brought back for you.

892
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,920
Toy rescue

893
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,719
Look, does this seem fun?

894
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Hold it up higher.

895
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,679
Hold it up higher, look.

896
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,960
Doesn't it look like a little puppy?

897
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,719
This is mine.

898
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,679
This is Mommy's, this is Daddy's.

899
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,079
This is Daddy's.

900
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,639
Mommy's.

901
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,960
This is Mommy's.

902
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,719
Lao Ma

903
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,639
Why are you here?

904
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,800
Come in, come in.

905
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,400
On such a cold day,

906
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,639
Didn't I tell you not to come?

907
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,239
But I had to bring you dumplings, didn't I?

908
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,760
How beautiful!

909
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,039
Here, happy holiday!

910
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:33,760
Happy holiday!

911
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,480
Give Dad a kiss.

912
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,440
Come on, give a kiss.

913
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,719
Pretty, isn't it, honey?

914
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,000
There are already two.

915
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,679
That one.

916
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:53,880
Which one?
