1
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,079
My condolences.

2
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,599
This is something your mother left behind.

3
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,640
You know what your mom does, right?

4
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,920
My mom?

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
She washes dishes at a restaurant.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,920
That’s probably not it.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,439
When can I bring her home?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,080
Not yet.

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,560
We’ll let you know when it’s possible.

10
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,879
Take good care of yourself.

11
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,400
No matter how hard it gets,

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
don’t end up like your mom.

13
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,879
Lei, Yang

14
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,840
How is it?

15
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,240
Did you find it?

16
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,759
No.

17
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,919
Alright, let's do the laundry first.

18
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
After the laundry, I'll take a nap.

19
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
We'll continue searching tomorrow morning.

20
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,319
Is it this one?

21
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,839
Yeah, it matches his description.

22
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,879
What do you mean, "matches"?

23
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,800
Where did you find it?

24
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,720
In a trash can two blocks from the crime scene.

25
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
I searched all night.

26
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,639
It's been three days since the crime.

27
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,399
The trash still hasn't been collected.

28
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,399
And the knife was still waiting for you in the trash can.

29
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
Isn't it a pure black knife handle?

30
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,560
What color is this then?

31
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,720
Are you colorblind?

32
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,639
You call this black in your house?

33
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,680
I was in a hurry, didn't see clearly.

34
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,839
Then what did you see clearly?

35
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,079
What are you thinking about every day?

36
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,040
If I didn't find it, I just didn't find it.

37
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm just telling the truth.

38
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,959
Are you planning to quit, I'm asking you.

39
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,240
If we can't find it, the case can't be closed.

40
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,199
Say that again.

41
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,120
You think you're the only one working on this case?

42
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,079
What do you think the prosecutor's office and the court are for?

43
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,319
The chain of evidence is incomplete.

44
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,240
If the case gets sent back, whose responsibility is it?

45
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm asking you, whose responsibility is it?

46
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,199
Are you trying to make a wrongful conviction here?

47
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,199
Thought

48
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
Comrades of the police,

49
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,319
thank you for your hard work.

50
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,399
After I learned the truth about my mother,

51
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,079
I felt deeply guilty.

52
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,759
All these years,

53
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,800
she worked so hard to raise my sibling and me.

54
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,639
She endured hardships and made sacrifices no one knew about.

55
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Time to eat mooncakes.

56
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
You don't need to worry about me.

57
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,959
Our boss treated us to Four Happiness Meatballs.

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Squirrel-shaped Mandarin Fish.

59
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
No, wait—Sweet and Sour Fish.

60
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
I don't smoke now, I quit.

61
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
I gave it up.

62
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,519
Smoking is bad for your health.

63
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,839
All these years

64
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
my mother always taught us

65
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,360
to take things one step at a time

66
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
to be honest and down-to-earth

67
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,199
and to do things diligently

68
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
I won't comment on her actions

69
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,879
but no matter what she has done

70
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,120
she is still our mother

71
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,560
Thank you all again

72
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,240
She always says she's uneducated

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,879
and urges my brother and me to study hard

74
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,199
so we won't end up like her

75
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,759
Let me ask you, Liu Ziming.

76
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,399
Why did you become a police officer?

77
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,279
To fight crime.

78
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,920
Who do you fight crime for?

79
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,360
For me, is that it?

80
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,839
For the leaders.

81
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,759
Or is it for yourself?

82
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,040
Let me tell you all,

83
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
and you all listen up.

84
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,079
There are two kinds of people.

85
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
One kind just drifts along.

86
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,920
The other kind tries to get ahead.

87
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,920
Some who just drift actually do well.

88
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,759
Trying to get ahead doesn't always work out.

89
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,639
If you just drift here,

90
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,839
get out.

91
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,559
Check that spot, and over there too.

92
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,840
Search everywhere.

93
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,159
Be careful.

94
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,000
Got it.

95
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,799
No, that's not it.

96
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,480
This one is green.

97
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Right.

98
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,440
Found it.

99
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,200
Look.

100
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,799
Master, the report is out.

101
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,399
The shape of the fruit knife matches the wound very well.

102
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,120
The extracted blood matches the victim's blood type.

103
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,759
The fingerprints have already matched.

104
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,200
And Li Gang has now confessed as well.

105
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,039
Understood.

106
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:27,840
Hey, sis.

107
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,480
I called you and you didn't answer.

108
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,960
I didn't have time.

109
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,320
You really have some nerve.

110
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,639
I've only got two months left before I give birth.

111
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,960
Every day, I'm running around cleaning up your mess while pregnant.

112
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,600
Dad's heart is really bothering him.

113
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
He said he almost fainted.

114
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,320
His heart feels bad.

115
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,559
Did you ask him if it's because he drank too much?

116
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,320
Or was he upset by his dance partner at the ballroom?

117
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,559
He said you made him angry.

118
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,200
If you have time, come home quickly.

119
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,120
Alright, I won't talk to you anymore.

120
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
Take care of yourself.

121
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,080
Don't skip meals.

122
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
This piece is our latest style for the season.

123
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,200
If you like it,

124
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,200
you can go try it on.

125
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,399
The fitting room is over there.

126
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,320
Okay, thank you.

127
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,200
Hello, sir.

128
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,320
Is there anything I can help you with?

129
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,240
Step aside, I'm looking for someone.

130
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,440
What are you peeking at?

131
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,639
Is it any of your business?

132
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,559
Yeah, I'm making it my business. So what?

133
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,519
How old are you?

134
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,559
Have you got any shame?

135
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Who's peeking?

136
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,240
Stop right there!

137
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,240
Why are you running?

138
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,120
Stop!

139
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,759
You pervert!

140
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,120
Can't you make this curtain a bit longer?

141
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
Sorry about that.

142
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,440
Thank you, sis.

143
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,799
It's fine. Just be more careful next time.

144
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,000
I won't try anymore.

145
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,879
Over here, over here.

146
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,440
Where is the person?

147
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,240
Inside?

148
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,919
What's going on?

149
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
I got up in the morning,

150
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
and I said, "Let's go buy some groceries."

151
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,039
I tried to push this door, but it wouldn't open.

152
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,039
I forced it open and took a look.

153
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
It was your father.

154
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,919
Do you have mosquito coils at home?

155
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,519
Here, thank you.

156
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,919
What about your father?

157
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,679
Please don't worry about it.

158
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,960
You should go buy groceries.

159
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
If you didn't look so much like your dad,

160
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,360
would you have just cremated me right away?

161
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,799
Do you think this is a public restroom?

162
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
You just do your business and leave?

163
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,480
Have you ever seen a public restroom that smells this much like alcohol?

164
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,359
What about that fool?

165
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,480
You're back.

166
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,119
Sis.

167
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,480
You bought me clothes again.

168
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,599
If I don't buy them for you, who will?

169
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
Stop buying them, I can't wear them all.

170
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,400
How is he?

171
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,440
He's fine.

172
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,359
He has a bit of heart palpitations.

173
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,319
The doctor said he should try not to get angry.

174
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,480
He should also get plenty of rest.

175
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,759
The doctor prescribed some medicine.

176
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,680
Remind him to take his medicine on time.

177
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,599
If he drinks less alcohol, all his problems will be solved.

178
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,640
He got drunk, just carry him back.

179
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
Why did you scald him?

180
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,200
Wow, when I saw that huge puddle...

181
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,440
The old man is really angry this time.

182
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,720
He said it.

183
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,119
You eat his food, live in his house, and still mistreat him.

184
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,680
Then don't lie down at someone else's door.

185
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,359
At his age.

186
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,880
That lady was startled.

187
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,559
Keep your voice down, aren't you embarrassed?

188
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,200
You're never around all day.

189
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,240
Are you a cop or a thief?

190
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,880
A thief.

191
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,359
What are you doing?

192
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
You just keep going on and on.

193
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,240
He's your real father.

194
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,839
Would it kill you to humor him a little every day?

195
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,559
Do you know what Dad says outside?

196
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,039
Do you know what he tells others about you?

197
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,440
He says I mistreat him.

198
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,400
He tells everyone he meets.

199
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,400
"My son is a police officer."

200
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,599
"If you need anything, just let me know."

201
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,119
Now look what happened.

202
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,480
Isn't this just a slap in his face?

203
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,559
Why do you hang around here every day?

204
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,200
What's the point of ironing these shabby clothes?

205
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
Just go home and get some rest.

206
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,680
Our air conditioner at home is broken.

207
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,839
What's wrong with me staying here for a couple of days?

208
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,880
Still pretending.

209
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,440
Li Wei called you.

210
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,599
He bombarded me the whole way.

211
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,039
He said you were angry.

212
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,039
And ran away from home.

213
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,799
He begged me to persuade you to go back home.

214
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,079
How did he beg you?

215
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,400
Wait, what was the reason anyway?

216
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,680
Just because he has a bit of money, he doesn't even know who he is anymore.

217
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,079
New phone, huh?

218
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,559
It’s expensive, don’t touch my phone.

219
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,400
Brother-in-law.

220
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,880
He’s at home.

221
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,680
What else can she do? She’s crying.

222
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
She’s out of breath.

223
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,200
I can’t calm her down.

224
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,759
Yeah, yeah, you should come over quickly.

225
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,400
Hurry and come take her back.

226
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,519
I’m not going back.

227
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,599
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,880
You’re already here.

229
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,240
Alright, alright, just hurry up.

230
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,200
If you’re late, I’ll have to call an ambulance.

231
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,480
She’s already foaming at the mouth.

232
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
So annoying.

233
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,400
Don’t touch my phone from now on.

234
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,960
You’re pregnant, just live your life peacefully.

235
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,079
What can’t be solved?

236
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,079
I’m telling you, stop always getting mad at Dad.

237
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,440
You want me to get less angry.

238
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Like I have nothing better to do than argue with him.

239
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,839
He’s always so improper.

240
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,519
At his age, he still goes to the dance hall every day.

241
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,440
Have you ever been there?

242
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,480
How do you know people there aren’t decent?

243
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,640
Besides, what’s wrong with having a hobby?

244
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,720
Would you be happy if he just lay around at home all day?

245
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,960
How is drinking a normal hobby?

246
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,839
He drinks because he feels bad inside.

247
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,759
What right does he have to feel bad?

248
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:09,880
I feel bad too.

249
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,119
If it weren’t for him, Mom—

250
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,039
Would you even need to be ironing clothes?

251
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,880
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

252
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,799
I'm heading back to the team.

253
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,200
Take your clothes with you.

254
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,880
Take them.

255
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,400
Don't buy them anymore.

256
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,519
What's wrong?

257
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,880
I just like seeing you in new clothes.

258
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Wear them, wear them, wear them.

259
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,079
So you really are a thief.

260
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,440
Hurry home.

261
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,839
What kind of brain do you have?

262
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,359
Rewrite it.

263
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,400
What kind of person are you?

264
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,039
How can you just go through other people's stuff?

265
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
Not convinced, huh?

266
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Master.

267
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,519
How come you walk without making a sound?

268
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,799
Like a robot cat.

269
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,400
If you’re not convinced, don’t let me catch you again.

270
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
I’ll borrow this to wear for a couple of days.

271
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,119
Let's see where you can look this time.

272
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,079
What's wrong, Master?

273
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,000
What happened?

274
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,160
Dispatch the police, quickly!

275
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,160
What's up?

276
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,839
Stealing the Yellow Team's Benz again?

277
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,599
What else can I do if I don't steal it?

278
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,720
Our car broke down, didn't it?

279
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,680
That fall really hurt!

280
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,599
A-are you okay, Master?

281
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,720
Why were you so careless?

282
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,559
Where did this dog come from?

283
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:45,880
Director Sun

284
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,519
Captain Wei

285
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,480
How is it?

286
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,160
Still searching.

287
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,400
Found anything?

288
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,079
Is there a wallet or any ID?

289
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,000
Nothing at all.

290
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,279
The scene has already been disturbed.

291
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,400
There are footprints everywhere.

292
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:00,839
Old Zhang

293
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,400
Can we determine the cause of death now?

294
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,119
Can't confirm for now.

295
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,359
There are too many wounds.

296
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
We still need to take the body back for examination.

297
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,440
Alright.

298
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,960
Why are you standing so far away? Come here.

299
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,640
Why aren't you coming closer?

300
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,279
Take a look.

301
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,079
Analyze it, like I taught you.

302
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,720
The main scene is located

303
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,039
at Taihe Road and Hong'an Road

304
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
by the riverbank, 150 meters east.

305
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
There are messy footprints all around.

306
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,440
The victim is male, about twenty years old.

307
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,720
Wearing a purple top.

308
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,480
And white jeans.

309
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Alright, remember this clearly.

310
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,640
We'll use it for analysis later.

311
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay.

312
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,599
No, wait, Master, I'm not done yet.

313
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,079
His shoes seem to be a limited edition.

314
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,480
A junior from my wrestling team has a pair.

315
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,119
He said even if you have money,

316
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,200
you might not be able to buy these shoes.

317
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,559
If we can find the sales channel,

318
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,680
maybe we can identify the victim.

319
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,960
Remember this, it's very important.

320
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,799
Alright, Director Sun.

321
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,880
We'll head back now.

322
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,839
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

323
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's go.

324
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Master, I'll go to the wrestling team.

325
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,400
Alright.

326
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:13,519
Xiaolong

327
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,839
Xiaolong

328
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,000
Where's Xiaolong?

329
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,039
Xiaolong went to change clothes.

330
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,880
Xiaolong, I've been looking for you for ages.

331
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,000
Ming, how come you had time to come back today?

332
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,279
Where are your shoes?

333
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,400
Which shoes?

334
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,839
The white ones.

335
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,559
The limited edition ones you said there are only a few of in the world.

336
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,279
Where did you buy them?

337
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,559
Those? What, you want to buy them too?

338
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,799
Cut the nonsense, just tell me.

339
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,880
We have a case.

340
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,559
A victim was wearing the same shoes as you.

341
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,559
Come on, take me there quickly.

342
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,079
Where did you buy them?

343
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,680
No, that's not it.

344
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,000
What's wrong?

345
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,799
Ming

346
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,119
My pair is fake.

347
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,519
When I went to Fujian for a competition,

348
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,039
I bought them at a street stall.

349
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,160
Ziming

350
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,480
How many junior disciples do you have?

351
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,640
Quite a lot.

352
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
With brains like these,

353
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,759
they're all just like us.

354
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,559
Alright, alright.

355
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,759
Let's get back to the case.

356
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,119
What about the time of death?

357
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,720
It was roughly between midnight and 3 a.m.

358
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,480
Chest and abdomen.

359
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,000
Fifteen stab wounds to the heart.

360
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,039
The fatal wound was the one to the chest.

361
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,359
Cause of death: hemorrhagic shock.

362
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,440
The stab wounds are mainly on the chest, abdomen, and waist.

363
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,920
It was probably caused by a single-edged sharp weapon.

364
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,000
It's probably

365
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:42,599
twenty centimeters.

366
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,240
About this length.

367
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,720
Left forearm, right palm—

368
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
each has a defensive wound.

369
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,599
All caused by the same weapon.

370
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,839
It's likely a fruit knife.

371
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,440
But the problem is, this knife—

372
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
hasn't been found yet.

373
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,480
That's quite strange.

374
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,960
There are three stab wounds to the genitals.

375
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,559
Go on.

376
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,640
Anyway, in my opinion,

377
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,279
this wasn't done by just one person.

378
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,400
Think about it,

379
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,359
stabbing someone over a dozen times takes a lot of strength.

380
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,960
It probably wasn't just one person.

381
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,480
Based on the footprints at the scene,

382
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,440
the initial assessment is that there were four or five people.

383
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,319
Another thing,

384
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,039
the attack was so brutal,

385
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,000
it looks like a deliberate act of revenge.

386
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,119
No, but the victim didn't have a wallet on him.

387
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:27,720
Is it possible

388
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,759
that it was a spontaneous robbery and murder?

389
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,599
The time of the crime wasn't ideal for a robbery.

390
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,359
The victim wasn't very old either.

391
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,400
Not really a suitable target for robbery.

392
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,960
The key point is, after the robbery,

393
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,359
there's no need to keep stabbing endlessly, right?

394
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,400
Right.

395
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
Robbery is usually just for money.

396
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,680
Most people only carry a little cash.

397
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,920
It can't be much.

398
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,200
Maybe they got angry because there was too little money.

399
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,799
How little is "too little"?

400
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,119
No matter how little, it shouldn't have led to this.

401
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Four or five people, working as a gang.

402
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,200
That's not necessarily the case.

403
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,000
If it's a gang, they must be after something.

404
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,000
But what would they gain by stabbing someone like this?

405
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,240
The lower body was stabbed.

406
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,359
Could it be a crime of passion?

407
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,720
Maybe someone was cheated on.

408
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,319
Make a note of this key point.

409
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,720
Ziming.

410
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,480
Didn't you go to the scene? Tell us about it.

411
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,559
I just want to know the victim's identity right now.

412
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,960
I agree with what Liu Ziming said.

413
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,079
The top priority.

414
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,599
We need to confirm the victim's identity as soon as possible.

415
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,880
I'll go to the station for a meeting and hold things down for a bit.

416
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,920
You lead everyone in continuing to analyze the case.

417
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,279
I also think what you just said makes sense.

418
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,079
Otherwise, why stab the lower body?

419
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,519
Stabbed three times—what do you think this person was after?

420
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,599
That's sick.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,079
Master

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,160
You're deep in thought.

423
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,119
What are you thinking about?

424
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,440
Master

425
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,119
They said someone was stabbed fifteen times.

426
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,480
How much hatred or resentment must there be?

427
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,519
Why is that?

428
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,799
I don't understand.

429
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't understand.

430
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,519
If you don't understand, go investigate.

431
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,200
In our line of work,

432
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,839
it's all about figuring out the "why."

433
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,039
Why commit a crime? Why kill?

434
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,480
Why use this method?

435
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,960
Staring at the sky won't help.

436
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,519
You could think about it all day and still not figure it out.

437
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,039
How's it going? Let me see.

438
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,480
What are you talking about?

439
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,559
Nothing, just work.

440
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You guys keep talking.

441
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,480
Let's go, let's go.

442
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,119
Wei Jie

443
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,119
I'll kill you

444
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,160
Wei Jie

445
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,880
Hello, Criminal Police Unit.

446
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
Okay, okay, okay.

447
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,839
Could you please give me the phone number and address?

448
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,599
Address.

449
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,640
Hello, this is the Criminal Police Unit.

450
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,279
Hold on a moment, I'm taking a call.

451
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,039
Ma'am

452
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,319
Did you make the call?

453
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,440
Yes, I made the call.

454
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,119
Why did it take you so long to get here?

455
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,839
Sorry.

456
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,759
Are you sure it's the person in the photo?

457
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,039
Yes, that's right.

458
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:28,960
Yes.

459
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,519
They've been gone for four or five days.

460
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,680
Her mother cries at home all day.

461
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,640
How could she not be worried? How could she be at ease, you tell me?

462
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:36,440
Hurry up.

463
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,839
I... I'll take you there.

464
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,440
Um, what's the name?

465
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,119
Are they local?

466
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:40,960
Her name is Nana.

467
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,200
Nana.

468
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,880
A girl?

469
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,359
Yes.

470
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,079
Ma'am

471
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,240
Are you sure you saw clearly?

472
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,519
We're looking for a boy.

473
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,200
It's not Nana.

474
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,960
No.

475
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,720
Sorry for taking up your time.

476
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,240
It's fine.

477
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,079
Here's what you should do.

478
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,599
She hasn't been home for four or five days.

479
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,039
Have her family go to the police station up ahead as soon as possible.

480
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,200
Report her as a missing person.

481
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,039
Alright.

482
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,720
You need to hurry.

483
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,960
They should go right away.

484
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,440
Thank you for your concern. I'll go in a bit.

485
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,079
Thank you, thank you.

486
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,720
Sorry, sorry.

487
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,440
It's okay, it's okay.

488
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,079
Thank you.

489
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,759
Thanks.

490
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,720
Captain Wei, Brother Ma.

491
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,119
This is our Captain Wei.

492
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:15,920
Hello, hello.

493
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,519
Hello.

494
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,680
They just returned from Korea.

495
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,720
He said his son calls him every week.

496
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,440
But for some reason these past few days,

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,680
they lost contact.

498
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,400
So they came back from abroad.

499
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,359
They've been searching for two days.

500
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,599
But couldn't find him anywhere.

501
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,359
So they came to report him missing.

502
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,400
This is the photo they provided.

503
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,920
Yes, this is my son.

504
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,799
How should I address you?

505
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,640
My surname is Jin, and this is my wife.

506
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,160
Hello, hello.

507
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,839
Your son's name is...

508
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,519
Jin Di.

509
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:46,960
The "Di" as in "flute".

510
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,680
You usually live in Korea, right?

511
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Yes, we do business in Korea.

512
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,799
Our child studies alone here in China.

513
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:00,920
Come.

514
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,559
Come, follow me and take a look first, okay?

515
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:02,880
Come.

516
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,599
Follow me, follow me.

517
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,279
Let's go.

518
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,639
Impossible.

519
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,559
It can't be my son.

520
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,119
That's impossible.

521
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,360
Come on, calm down.

522
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,960
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

523
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,719
He's my son.

524
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,159
Mr. Jin, come take a break.

525
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,519
Take a break, come on, come on.

526
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,719
Take a break, take a break, come on, come on.

527
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,320
Do you know if he usually has conflicts with anyone?

528
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,400
Do you have a girlfriend?

529
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,679
Do you know where he usually goes?

530
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,760
When can I take my son home?

531
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,079
I'm afraid that's not possible at the moment.

532
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,039
The case is still under investigation.

533
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,920
If I withdraw the case now,

534
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,519
can you take him away?

535
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
This won't work either.

536
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,599
Because this is a public prosecution case.

537
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,119
We have to wait for the investigation process no matter what.

538
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
I hope you understand.

539
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,239
I'm tired.

540
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,599
I'm going back.

541
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,280
We haven't finished asking questions.

542
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,719
I don't want to say anything else.

543
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,000
This...

544
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
How is your relationship with Jin Di?

545
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,159
It's just average, I guess.

546
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,039
Even though we're roommates,

547
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,199
he doesn't really come back to stay much.

548
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,679
Why doesn't he come back to stay?

549
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,400
I think his family is pretty well-off.

550
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,039
It seems like he rented a place outside to live.

551
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,519
He's a nice person.

552
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,760
He smiles at everyone.

553
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,719
He's very easygoing.

554
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,599
I feel like he kind of looks down on us.

555
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,679
But I think everyone actually likes him.

556
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,159
Art supplies market,

557
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,840
supermarket, convenience store, internet café—

558
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,760
we checked all of them.

559
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,840
Only the owner of a convenience store said

560
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
that around 1 p.m. on the 4th,

561
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
Jin Di bought a drink there.

562
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,639
We checked everywhere else too,

563
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,440
but found no leads.

564
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,360
Had regular classes in the morning.

565
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,639
Had lunch in the cafeteria at noon.

566
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,119
After one o'clock, went to the convenience store to buy a drink.

567
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,400
Went home as usual in the afternoon.

568
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,079
Master.

569
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,039
Captain Huang.

570
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:08,719
Ziming.

571
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,559
Boss, give me a bowl of noodles.

572
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,719
Alright, coming right up.

573
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,880
We asked over thirty restaurants.

574
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,599
Two of them recognized him.

575
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,679
They said he usually ate there.

576
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,559
But no one saw him before the incident.

577
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,239
Let's eat first.

578
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,360
Hurry up and eat.

579
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,599
What do we do next?

580
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,400
Keep going.

581
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,360
Check around their house again.

582
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,599
After that's done,

583
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,000
search the Xixiaohe area again.

584
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,519
Alright.

585
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,360
You do it, okay?

586
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,480
You and Liu Yang, the two of you

587
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,239
go to his parents' house tomorrow.

588
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,880
Okay.

589
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
Hello?

590
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,199
Hello?

591
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,599
Here you go.

592
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,800
Boss, I didn't order this, did I?

593
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:57,960
Old Huang ordered it.

594
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,320
He said to make it a large one.

595
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,039
Alright, please settle the bill for me.

596
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,239
Old Huang already paid the bill.

597
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,719
When did Captain Huang pay?

598
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,960
How did I not notice?

599
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,719
Hello, Mrs. Jin.

600
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,800
We still want to talk to you.

601
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,039
There's nothing to say.

602
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,119
We completely understand how you feel.

603
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,239
But we still need you to provide

604
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,519
Please leave this place.

605
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,440
No, Mrs. Jin, we—

606
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,840
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

607
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,599
Aren't we police officers?

608
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,400
I just don't get it.

609
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,519
Her son died, you know.

610
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,559
But as a mother, she doesn't seem sad at all.

611
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,840
She acts like nothing happened.

612
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,760
Do you think you have to see it to believe she's sad?

613
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,840
Look at the state of you all.

614
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,119
Tomorrow, wash your face and shave.

615
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,440
Get a good night's sleep.

616
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,679
Then we'll keep going.

617
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,039
Boss, where are we going next?

618
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,519
What do you mean, "where are we going"?

619
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,519
Within a five-kilometer radius of the crime scene.

620
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,239
Keep searching.

621
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,519
Didn't we already search there before?

622
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,800
The situation has changed now.

623
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:18,000
Now that we know the victim's identity, it's different.

624
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,039
Did anyone see him?

625
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,760
Does anyone know him?

626
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,639
Where did he go before heading to the river?

627
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,400
Go ask around for me.

628
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,480
But boss,

629
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,239
the area is too big.

630
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,239
Are you stupid or what?

631
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,920
Wouldn't you pick the closest one first?

632
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,000
Restaurants, residential complexes.

633
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,400
Does anyone know him?

634
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,440
Who is he with?

635
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,840
Master, we've been everywhere.

636
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
We've kept records of going door to door.

637
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,159
We've been everywhere.

638
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:44,960
We really have been everywhere.

639
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,239
We really have.

640
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,519
Did you go to Xiwang Community?

641
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,079
Yes, we did.

642
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:52,880
Went there too.

643
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,719
Did you go to Building 2, Unit 3?

644
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,960
We went everywhere there were people.

645
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,679
Really.

646
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
Did you go to Unit 102 in Building 3?

647
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,000
No, we've been to so many places, I can't remember.

648
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,159
Don't you have notes?

649
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,000
Check, look at your notes.

650
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,760
Let me check.

651
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,639
Let's go to Unit 102 in Building 3.

652
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,519
Did we go?

653
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,280
We probably did. Check with Ziming.

654
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,760
I think so.

655
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,480
We went, but there were no leads.

656
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,000
That one.

657
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,239
The one where we knocked on the door for a long time.

658
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,000
Remember?

659
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,400
Yeah, I remember.

660
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
I think it was that one.

661
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:33,280
What's the situation?

662
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,079
It's a widow.

663
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:34,920
How many people live there?

664
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,639
Two people.

665
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:36,960
A widow.

666
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,800
How many exactly?

667
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,920
Two. The widow and her child.

668
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,960
The child is over thirty, right? Yeah, that's right.

669
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,840
How old?

670
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,079
Over thirty.

671
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,920
Over thirty, huh.

672
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,079
What's the place like inside?

673
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:46,199
How is it arranged?

674
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,239
What kind of furniture?

675
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
Uh...

676
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:49,719
Let me think.

677
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,239
By the door, right when you enter.

678
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,559
There's a purple sofa.

679
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,239
Right?

680
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,280
And in front of it is the TV.

681
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,079
Is that right?

682
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,679
Now you're making things up?

683
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,880
Who taught you that?

684
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,639
Where do you get all these made-up details?

685
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
How do you guys even handle cases?

686
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,079
Who are you investigating, me?

687
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,719
What's wrong, Master?

688
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,679
You tell me.

689
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm saying that address is my parents' house.

690
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:17,880
Let me tell you all,

691
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,639
this case must be solved.

692
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,719
If you can't solve it, go apologize to the victim's family.

693
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,159
Master, we really don't know how to investigate anymore.

694
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Jindi's mother said

695
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
if we go ask again,

696
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,559
she'll call the police on us.

697
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,360
Yes, Master.

698
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,559
How should we proceed with the investigation?

699
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,440
You tell me, how should we investigate?

700
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Didn't I already tell you?

701
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,079
Go ask everyone within a five-kilometer radius.

702
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,239
Hurry up.

703
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,440
Master, please don't be angry.

704
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,960
Master, we're leaving now.

705
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Call from the station

706
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,639
Hello, I—

707
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,079
Okay, then I'll have Liu Yang and Cao Lei go back.

708
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,360
Alright, just leave it.

709
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:21,880
Okay.

710
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,320
Master

711
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,320
Then it's just the two of us left.

712
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,599
How long do we have to keep going?

713
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,440
No matter how tough it gets, we have to keep going.

714
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,440
Even if there's only one person left, the job still has to be done, right?

715
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:43,559
Hello

716
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,559
Have you eaten yet?

717
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:48,840
Not yet.

718
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,480
Not at our Fulai Restaurant, right?

719
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,920
How about we meet up later?

720
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,280
Alright, it's settled then.

721
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,440
Who did you make plans with, Master?

722
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,320
Wang Bancheng. Do you know him?

723
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,159
No, I don't.

724
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,519
You'll get to know him. Let's go.
