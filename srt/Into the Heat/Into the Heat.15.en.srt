1
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,879
Finished washing.

2
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,280
Done.

3
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,280
Why did you throw the clothes away?

4
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,239
Why did you throw away this brand of yours?

5
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,200
Isn't yours a name brand too?

6
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Mine...

7
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,280
Look at mine.

8
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,080
I just bought this.

9
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,039
I asked Brother Zhang.

10
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,159
This kind is pure cotton.

11
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,599
It can't be washed out.

12
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,560
It's fine.

13
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
If it doesn't come out, just wash it again later.

14
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,919
Then you wash it.

15
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,319
Let me wash yours for you.

16
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

17
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,400
Freezing to death.

18
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,960
Freezing to death isn't painful.

19
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,719
You go numb, right?

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm really puzzled.

21
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Why do you keep obsessing over this?

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,479
Numbness.

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,039
You think numbness means you don't feel anything?

24
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,199
Before you go numb,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,879
first, your body temperature

26
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,879
will drop straight from thirty-seven to thirty-four degrees.

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,039
At that point, your whole body

28
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,280
feels like it's being pricked by needles.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
A pain that goes right to the bone.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,560
After your nerves go numb,

31
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,879
you'll feel

32
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,319
suddenly hot.

33
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,159
You start hallucinating.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,840
You might even want to take your clothes off.

35
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:01,960
I don't believe it.

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,479
I'll take a cold shower in a bit.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Then hurry up, do it now.

38
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,240
I'll do it right now.

39
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,439
So, are you in the shower now?

40
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,319
It's not cold at all.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
No, it's warm.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,719
Wait a moment.

43
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll make it even warmer for you.

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,719
You go ahead and shower first.

45
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,919
Open the door for me.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
You really turned on the cold water for me?

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Are you trying to freeze me to death?

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
Lei, Lei, Lei!

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,639
Wow, you guys really showed up right on time.

50
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,120
The crayfish are sold out.

51
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
What should we eat then?

52
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,080
No more crayfish.

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm almost sick of eating them anyway.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,479
Let's just eat whatever we have.

55
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,400
So, how about egg fried rice?

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Sure, sure.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,280
Xiaoli.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Use the leftover rice in the kitchen to make some egg fried rice.

59
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,719
And whip up a couple of side dishes too.

60
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,479
Okay!

61
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,840
You two wait for me a bit.

62
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,639
Okay, boss.

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,319
Go get me two bottles of beer from the fridge.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,280
Wait, Lei.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,680
Can you add two more eggs for me first?

66
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,680
Xiaoli.

67
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,000
Add two more eggs, we've got a foodie here.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,599
Okay!

69
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,439
Lei, the two of us can't drink.

70
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,159
We didn't get permission.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,040
I'll drink.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,079
You really can't take a hint.

73
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,079
Coming, coming, coming!

74
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,160
Move aside, pour it.

75
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,439
This young man

76
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,680
He's quite particular

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,959
He even wrapped it for me with a tissue

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,319
Go ahead, tell me

79
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,279
That's for Master

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,279
How have you been lately?

81
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,680
Just learning from Master

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,839
What have you learned?

83
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,639
Lately, the two of us

84
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,480
have been discussing

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,279
ways to die without pain in this world

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
Ways to die without pain

87
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,959
Tell me about it

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,480
Suicide by cutting one's own throat

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,480
You've watched too many TV dramas.

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Suicide by throat-cutting isn't that easy.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
First, you have to find the right spot.

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,639
Cut through the muscle.

93
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,639
You have to cut both your artery and vein horizontally at the same time.

94
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,480
With your reaction speed,

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,879
it would take you at least half an hour.

96
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,560
Even if you could chop your head off in one go,

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,040
your head would roll onto the ground,

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,439
but you still wouldn't be dead yet.

99
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,040
You'd have to watch yourself

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,079
get decapitated.

101
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,600
Why would I cut off my own head?

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Weren't you asking about suicide by throat-cutting?

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
But I can't cut off my own head!

104
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I think this kid's got it.

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,439
He memorizes these terms so well.

106
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,319
All he can do is recite them.

107
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,079
What kind of case is this, all bloody and messy?

108
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
It's not something you can explain in a sentence or two.

109
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,120
Brother Lei,

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
you have a lot of experience.

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,279
Share some with me.

112
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,839
Is there a painless way to die?

113
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,079
A painless way to die?

114
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,879
Xiaoli,

115
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,759
add some arsenic to the fried rice.

116
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,360
No.

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
Don't say that. Dying from poisoning isn't painless.

118
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,079
Arsenic poisoning causes stomach pain and diarrhea.

119
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,160
Dizziness and headaches.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,040
Fried rice is here.

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,319
Thank you.

122
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,240
Kidney failure, liver failure.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Multiple organ failure.

124
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,680
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,319
What do you mean by that?

126
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,839
What, is this not enough food?

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,399
What?

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,879
Here.

129
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,879
Thanks, Lei.

130
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,079
Stewed pork.

131
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,199
Looks like we're on a case today.

132
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,959
Hurry up and eat, come on.

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,759
You can really eat at a time like this.

134
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,480
Eat, starving is the worst.

135
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,959
The way you eat...

136
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,319
reminds me of a poem.

137
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,480
A breeding pig walks down a country lane.

138
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,879
I like it.

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
Hurry up, I've been hungry all day.

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,759
I left out the cilantro for you.

141
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Thank you, Master.

142
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,000
Lei.

143
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,079
Remember last time we were on a case, there was a body...

144
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,360
Severely decomposed.

145
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,279
Severely decomposed.

146
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,199
The intestines were spilling out.

147
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,000
The intestines were spilling out, Master.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,160
Kind of like this, right?

149
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,959
Pretty much the same.

150
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,839
Let me see.

151
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,279
Severely decomposed.

152
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,800
These intestines, yeah, about the same.

153
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,360
Severely decomposed.

154
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,199
Come on, no, Lei.

155
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:53,959
Have one.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,560
There will be plenty more of this in the future.

157
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,639
Eat.

158
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,439
Eat.

159
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,519
Come on, even Master said you should eat.

160
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,879
Just eat more, you...

161
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
I've thought of a way for you to die.

162
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,600
Die from being annoying.

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
I'm happy to.

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
Alright, enough joking around.

165
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,680
Hurry up and tell me about the visits.

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,879
We've asked everyone we could nearby.

167
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,759
No one knows anything.

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360
The people who come to this nursery are regular customers.

169
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,079
No suspicious people have been seen.

170
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,040
Brother Lei,

171
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,040
Shouldn't you step out for a bit?

172
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,959
No, I'm just listening.

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,519
I just served you your food.

174
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,279
And now you want me to leave? What do you mean?

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,439
Just step out for a bit.

176
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,800
Alright, Liu Ziming.

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm leaving, okay?

178
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm stepping out, alright?

179
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm heading home, guys.

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,319
Bye, bye Brother Lei.

181
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,720
Master, what can't he know about?

182
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,160
We've all had a long day.

183
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,399
Don't let him hang around here anymore.

184
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,759
Let him go home and get some sleep.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,680
You two,

186
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,720
one of you keep visiting people,

187
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,199
the other go to the police station to compare missing persons.

188
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,560
Yes.

189
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,519
Then I'll go do the visits.

190
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,519
No, you come with me for the visits.

191
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,759
You go and carefully do the comparison.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
Master, don't make me sit in the office.

193
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
I really can't sit still.

194
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,879
I'm begging you.

195
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,199
I'll go crazy, seriously.

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,199
If you weren't a cop,

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
you wouldn't have to sit for even a second.

198
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
Forget I said anything.

199
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,559
Hurry up and eat.

200
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm eating, I'm eating.

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,720
If you've already bought the house,

202
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,320
can you back out before taking possession?

203
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,960
It's probably not worth it, right?

204
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,320
They'll deduct a penalty for breach of contract and all that.

205
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,039
Master, are you in urgent need of money?

206
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,919
I still have some.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,679
It's nothing, I was just asking.

208
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,960
Don't blame me.

209
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
I really have no other choice.

210
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,559
If this well isn't filled in,

211
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,840
I won't be able to run my business at all.

212
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,039
Thank you.

213
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
Didn't he just leave?

214
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Why did he come back?

215
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
Call the police, hurry, call the police!

216
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,879
Hurry, call the police! Call the police!

217
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,720
Call the police! Call the police! Call the police!

218
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,279
I... I just...

219
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,360
Take your time, don't rush.

220
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,360
I just feel uneasy inside.

221
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
I think it's a bad omen.

222
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,399
So today I came to burn some paper offerings for her.

223
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,440
I thought I'd fill in the well while I'm at it, you see...

224
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,240
Take your time, don't rush, just speak slowly.

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,080
I mean, I... you... she...

226
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,720
She already... last time she...

227
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,600
I, I, I... Please calm down first.

228
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,639
Boss, I'll take him aside to calm down.

229
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,720
And take a statement while we're at it.

230
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,080
Come on, this way.

231
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,440
No.

232
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
Last time, she... Come on, this way.

233
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,039
She already came here once before.

234
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,440
Right?

235
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,519
After it was over...

236
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Wait a moment.

237
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,360
Female, around thirty years old.

238
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,399
Same as the previous one.

239
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,559
A pair of underwear stuffed in her mouth.

240
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,879
But she hasn't been dead for long.

241
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,000
No more than ten hours.

242
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:58,960
Let's go.

243
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
Zhang, hurry up!

244
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,879
Copy that, Captain Liu.

245
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,399
Boss.

246
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,320
She also has a bit of cologne scent on her.

247
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,799
Go check the boss's background.

248
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,240
Could he be the one who did it?

249
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,039
Hard to say, just go quickly.

250
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,720
Yes.

251
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,159
Honestly, I really don't know.

252
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,120
Really?

253
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,639
Then where did you sleep last night?

254
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,840
Your wife said you didn't come home last night.

255
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,399
I played cards outside all night yesterday.

256
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,159
My wife, you know...

257
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,639
She wants to control everything.

258
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,799
I didn't even dare tell her about this.

259
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
From October 2nd until today,

260
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
where have you been,

261
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,000
who have you met,

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,720
what have you eaten,

263
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,200
write down clearly the times for each.

264
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,519
I...

265
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
It's been such a long time.

266
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm afraid I can't remember it all clearly.

267
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,919
Don't you want to clear yourself of suspicion?

268
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,639
Do you want to clear yourself of suspicion or not?

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,600
Then think carefully.

270
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Think it through.

271
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,200
October 2nd.

272
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,679
October 2nd.

273
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
On October 2nd, I went to the agricultural machinery station.

274
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,320
Right.

275
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,919
October 2nd, I went to the agricultural machinery station.

276
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,159
Ten thousand.

277
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
Here, five bamboos. Hello, officer.

278
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't be nervous.

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,399
I want to ask you about someone.

280
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,159
Do you know Li Kun?

281
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,879
Yes, yes, we know him.

282
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,480
We all know him.

283
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,960
You all know him?

284
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,720
Yes, we all know him.

285
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,519
He's the nursery owner, right?

286
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,600
Yes, yes, that's right.

287
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
Take a look, is this him?

288
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,320
That's him, no doubt.

289
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,919
Take a good look.

290
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,440
That's right, that's right.

291
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,039
It's him, right?

292
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,759
Yes, yes, yes.

293
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,919
Yes, yes.

294
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
Last night, that is, October 11th.

295
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
Was he playing cards here the whole time?

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,919
Yes, yes, we were all here, more or less.

297
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,600
All of us were here.

298
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,799
He was called over at six o'clock.

299
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,120
We played until eight.

300
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,799
My back started hurting from playing so long.

301
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,159
Otherwise, we would have kept playing.

302
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,559
Miao Pu called and told him to go back for something.

303
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,720
Did she say what it was about?

304
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,960
She said someone had died.

305
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,559
He thought it was bad luck.

306
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,399
He went back to get a master to perform a ritual.

307
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,879
What about the ages of the two victims?

308
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,960
Both were between twenty and thirty years old.

309
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,759
There were signs of sexual activity before death.

310
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,240
Both died from mechanical asphyxiation.

311
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,960
Both had underwear stuffed in their mouths.

312
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,799
Preliminary assessment:

313
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,000
Both cases were likely committed by the same suspect.

314
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,840
Have the victims been identified?

315
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,879
We checked, they're not in the missing persons database.

316
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,759
We also canvassed the area.

317
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,440
No one has seen them.

318
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,559
Let alone know them.

319
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,120
So it's just like the first case.

320
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,879
Yes.

321
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,120
Has the time of death been determined?

322
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,960
It's about ten days apart from the first case.

323
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
Ten days apart.

324
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
There's something I can't figure out.

325
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,279
If this was

326
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,519
done by the same suspect,

327
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,879
in such a short period,

328
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
how did he manage to put the body there again?

329
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,879
Didn't you put up a police cordon at that place?

330
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,200
How could he still put the body there?

331
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,879
Yeah.

332
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,960
After our team finished examining the scene,

333
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,639
everyone left.

334
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,600
The owner thought the stuff was in the way and took it down.

335
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
The owner should be punished accordingly.

336
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,000
No,

337
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,240
so there was no police cordon.

338
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,799
Is this person out of their mind?

339
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,240
He should have noticed that you took the body away.

340
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,919
Even if there's no well, you can still see inside.

341
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,720
Doesn't he know this place has been exposed?

342
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,480
Captain Huang, about your concern,

343
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,039
my mentor and I had the same question at the time.

344
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,799
We specifically investigated it.

345
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,480
That well is very deep.

346
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
During the day, you can see the body if you look inside.

347
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,399
At night, it's pitch black and you can't see anything.

348
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,840
We've verified all of this.

349
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,679
The question now is

350
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,559
if it really was done by the same person,

351
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,320
committing two crimes in such a short time,

352
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,279
I suspect he’ll strike again soon.

353
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,639
Is there any other discovery?

354
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,639
The suspicion on the nursery owner

355
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,039
has been completely ruled out.

356
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,759
The nursery is not the first crime scene.

357
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,519
But where is the first crime scene now?

358
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,320
We still don’t know.

359
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
Also, there are no cameras at the nursery.

360
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
The only camera on the highway is broken.

361
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
We can’t get any surveillance footage.

362
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,919
So

363
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,960
we haven’t found anything, right?

364
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,360
Even if we did, the camera’s broken.

365
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,120
Guys,

366
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,759
don’t just stand around here.

367
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,639
Hurry up and keep investigating.

368
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,679
I’ll tell you tomorrow morning.

369
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,360
Before tomorrow morning,

370
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
figure out the victim’s identity for me.

371
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,759
What if we can’t find out?

372
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
If you can’t, I’ll deal with you.

373
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
You’d better find out. If you can’t—

374
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,320
Sis, why are you in such a hurry?

375
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,799
Tingting said she couldn't hold you back.

376
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,279
What's wrong with staying a few days?

377
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,159
It's really inconvenient for Tingting right now.

378
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,000
I just happened to find a suitable place.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,879
So I moved.

380
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,039
What's so inconvenient about it?

381
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,759
Besides, you don't have to rent a place.

382
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,679
You could just stay at Dad's for a few days.

383
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,720
Dad's such a light sleeper.

384
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,919
I'm afraid I'll disturb him.

385
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,360
Honestly, you're something else.

386
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,559
Where's the place? How is it?

387
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,360
It's pretty good.

388
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,559
I'll send you the address later.

389
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,639
I'll tidy up a bit these days.

390
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,759
In a couple of days, I'll bring Nizi over.

391
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,039
Let me know if you need anything.

392
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,160
I'll bring it to you.

393
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,240
I don't need anything.

394
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,559
Please don't buy anything.

395
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,960
Alright, my hands are full and it's heavy.

396
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,960
I'll talk to you later.

397
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,519
Let me know if you need anything.

398
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,319
Master.

399
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,839
Captain Huang wants us to

400
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,519
confirm the identity before tomorrow morning.

401
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,119
Are we just going to sit here like this?

402
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,440
What's the rush?

403
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,480
It's not time yet.

404
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,799
Eat.

405
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,160
I'm drinking.

406
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,720
What's going on?

407
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,119
Li Wei's mom is here.

408
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,599
Why did she come?

409
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,200
She came to ask for someone.

410
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,559
Ask for someone?

411
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,319
Who does she want?

412
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,920
Who else could it be?

413
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,359
She wants Ni Zi.

414
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,359
What did she say?

415
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,400
She said you made Li Wei end up like this.

416
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,640
She wants to take Ni Zi and raise her.

417
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,519
She said Ni Zi is a Li after all.

418
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,000
I made him like this?

419
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,559
Did I make her son do drugs?

420
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,839
She said,

421
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,559
If you had cared about Li Wei even a little,

422
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,839
if you had treated him a bit better,

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,799
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

424
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,200
Is that even something a person would say?

425
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm going to talk to her.

426
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,039
Wait, wait, stop!

427
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,480
Dad.

428
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,599
You don't think that too, do you?

429
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,039
Do you think Li Wei turned out like this

430
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,359
because of me?

431
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,960
Wouldn't you help him quit then?

432
00:18:59,079 --> 00:18:59,960
Unbelievable.

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,720
Nizi

434
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,720
Auntie

435
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,440
Do you know where to find someone who sells drugs?

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,480
Why are you asking about this?

437
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,880
I need it for something.

438
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,039
Did someone come to you?

439
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,359
Or did someone ask you to find out?

440
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,119
No.

441
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,720
I just want to ask drug dealers

442
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,480
if there’s really any way to quit.

443
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,200
You’ll understand when you’re older, Nizi.

444
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,799
Auntie bought you pizza.

445
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,119
Come on, try it and see if it’s good.

446
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
Thank you, Auntie.

447
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,519
You’re welcome.

448
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,519
Which piece do you want? Here.

449
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,319
Is it good?

450
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,079
What did you draw here?

451
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,960
A family of three.

452
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,680
Master, where are we heading?

453
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,400
Let me ask you all,

454
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,000
what do these two victims have in common?

455
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,720
They're both women.

456
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,680
Both are quite young.

457
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,400
Other than the floral water, nothing else, right?

458
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,279
What is floral water used for?

459
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,519
Outdoors, outdoors.

460
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,480
That means they often spend time outdoors.

461
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,720
Got it.

462
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,400
Hey handsome, want to come sit with us?

463
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,960
No, thanks.

464
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,079
Come join us for a bit.

465
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,240
Master, should we?

466
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,480
Is it a crime for someone to invite you to sit?

467
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,319
Is it really this open?

468
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,599
Don't move, come here.

469
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,759
What for?

470
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,839
I didn't do anything.

471
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,559
Do you know her?

472
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,200
Take a look.

473
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,759
Look carefully.

474
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,559
Don't move, just look.

475
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:34,799
Do you know her?

476
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,799
I'm asking you, do you know her?

477
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,440
Take her back to the station.

478
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,279
No, no, no.

479
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,279
I know her.

480
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,599
This one.

481
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,640
Come with us.

482
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,160
Is it her?

483
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,359
What's her name?

484
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,240
Hong Xia.

485
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:00,359
Full name.

486
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,359
Yu Hongxia.

487
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,640
Come over here.

488
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,920
She... she came here three years ago.

489
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,720
She used to always be with me.

490
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,119
But this year during the New Year

491
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,279
her dad got into a fight after drinking

492
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,119
and had bleeding in his brain.

493
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,759
He's still lying in the hospital now.

494
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,839
He's been in a coma the whole time.

495
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,559
The family keeps saying to stop the treatment.

496
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,920
We said the same.

497
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
But she refuses.

498
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,359
One time, I spoke a bit harshly.

499
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,200
We argued, and she left.

500
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Where did she go?

501
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,559
Over by Jianshe Road.

502
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,480
With whom?

503
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,680
Who else? Dong Xiang.

504
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,039
Which characters?

505
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,160
Dong as in the surname Dong.

506
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,079
Xiang as in "to fly."

507
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:05,599
Listen up.

508
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Your business isn't over yet.

509
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,079
Don't worry.

510
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,039
Even if this hadn't happened, I was going to quit anyway.

511
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,200
Sis.

512
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm coming right over.

513
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,799
Give me the car keys.

514
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,599
Find out exactly where this Dong Xiang is.

515
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,160
Yes.

516
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Doctor, family of Liu Ziqing.

517
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,279
Yes.

518
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,039
The patient took a large amount of sleeping pills.

519
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,079
Her stomach has already been pumped.

520
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,200
She's fine, don't worry.

521
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,519
Okay, thank you, thank you.

522
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,359
What were you thinking?

523
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,319
Do you think dying will solve the problem?

524
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,119
Aren't you being selfish?

525
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
Do you also think

526
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,480
that Li Wei ended up like this

527
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,880
all because of me?

528
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,920
How could that be? What are you talking about?

529
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:53,720
Who said something like that?

530
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,720
Sis, don't listen to those people talking nonsense.

531
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
Li Wei ended up like this

532
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,279
because of his own actions.

533
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,119
If you can't get over this

534
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,680
it's really not worth it.

535
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,680
Actually, I regretted it right after I swallowed it.

536
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,519
I don't want Nizi to end up like us,

537
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,920
losing her mother at such a young age.

538
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,640
I know what you're trying to say.

539
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't worry.

540
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,799
No matter what,

541
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
I'll raise Nizi and watch her grow up.

542
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
As long as you know.

543
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,319
Hello?

544
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,559
Master, we've found something.

545
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,000
This Dong Xiang is from Shijiazhuang.

546
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:04,920
Born in 1979.

547
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,359
There's a record of him checking in at Dongfeng Hotel tonight.

548
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,480
We're getting ready to head over.

549
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,079
Keep an eye on him for now, don't make a move.

550
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,200
Wait for my instructions.

551
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,279
Alright, you should go now.

552
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,720
I'm fine now.

553
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,000
I've already been through death once.

554
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,160
Go on.

555
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,400
Don't tell Dad about this.

556
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,599
Go.

557
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm leaving.

558
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,359
Come by later.

559
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,920
Don't overthink it.

560
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,720
Get me a piece of paper.

561
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,279
Go.

562
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,359
I'm going.

563
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,359
Why are you looking for me?

564
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
You really don't know why?

565
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,200
How would I know?

566
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,240
Do you know these two?

567
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,359
Take a good look.

568
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,279
Do you recognize them?

569
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,279
This has nothing to do with me.

570
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,240
No.

571
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,759
I could never kill anyone.

572
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
We know it has nothing to do with you.

573
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
You wouldn't dare.

574
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
No, these two people...

575
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,680
No, when did they die?

576
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
Her—who actually did it?

577
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,200
Who do you think did it?

578
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,200
Let me tell you.

579
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,359
Honestly, I have no idea.

580
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,559
About their deaths.

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,039
Let's not beat around the bush.

582
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,960
My case is urgent.

583
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,839
You know what I mean, right?

584
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,799
Just tell me what you know.

585
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,359
What are their names?

586
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,200
Yu Hongxia.

587
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,759
Zhu Lulu.

588
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,960
Do either of them have any enemies?

589
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,279
Or do you have any enemies?

590
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,480
I don't have any enemies.

591
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,119
But let me ask,

592
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
am I under arrest or just being questioned?

593
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Neither, right?

594
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,920
I'm just cooperating with the investigation.

595
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,240
What are you three doing here?

596
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,359
You know quite a lot.

597
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,279
Don't worry.

598
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,680
Dong Xiang.

599
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,720
Applied to the police academy in 1998.

600
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,279
Didn't meet the admission cutoff.

601
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,640
What, you wanted to be a cop too?

602
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,039
If I had passed back then, with you three,

603
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,920
I would have been your superior.

604
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,880
Alright, stop bragging.

605
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm not bragging, seriously.

606
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,240
It's not that I didn't pass.

607
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,880
I just missed one subject.

608
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,200
Why didn't you take it?

609
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,920
I got to the exam hall entrance.

610
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,000
Then I checked my pocket,

611
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,839
and my exam permit was gone.

612
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,759
Later, I figured it out.

613
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,519
My dad tore up my exam permit.

614
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,960
He probably thought if I passed, I'd arrest him.

615
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,279
Enough with the nonsense.

616
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,279
List of regular customers.

617
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,960
Anyone you've had conflicts or grudges with,

618
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,920
write them all down.

619
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,559
You're asking me to offend people, aren't you?

620
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,319
What?

621
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
You still want to keep doing this?

622
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,119
What else can I do?

623
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,839
The state doesn't pay me a salary.

624
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,319
How am I supposed to eat or drink?

625
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,559
Let me tell you,

626
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,279
what matters most to me right now

627
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,279
is finding out who killed those two.

628
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,759
You can't run from your own issues.

629
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,240
And don't think you can escape either.

630
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Do you understand?

631
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,960
Was I clear enough?

632
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,880
Crystal clear.

633
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,640
I'll write the list for you.

634
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,799
But let me make this clear first,

635
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,279
you're not forcing me to do this.

636
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,160
It's because I was truly friends with those two.

637
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,000
Enough with the talk.

638
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,599
Ziqing, Ziqing.

639
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,480
Where are you? Where are you?

640
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,319
I was wrong.

641
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,680
I'll really change this time.

642
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,400
Don't ignore me, Ziqing.

643
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,480
Why did you come out?

644
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,119
You're not allowed to make calls in here.

645
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
Hang up quickly.

646
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,680
Ziqing, say something.

647
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,799
I really can't stay in this place anymore.

648
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,440
Can you come get me out?

649
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
Say something.

650
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,200
I'm talking to you.

651
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,119
Which room are you from?

652
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:04,880
Hang up, hang up.

653
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,920
Come here, I'm talking to you.

654
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,319
Dad, I'm going to school.

655
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,559
Okay, okay, wait a second.

656
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,359
Let me pack this for you.

657
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,559
At noon, um...

658
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,720
If you get hungry, just eat these.

659
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,359
Drink the milk and eat the bread, okay?

660
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,319
And listen to your teacher.

661
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
Pay attention in class.

662
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
Get along well with your classmates.

663
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,039
Listen to your teacher.

664
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:41,759
Go on.

665
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,799
Dad will pick you up tonight.

666
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,480
Bye, Dad.

667
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,400
Bye, bye.

668
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Pan Weiting, right?

669
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,599
Let's go inside and talk.

670
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay.

671
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,519
Take a look.

672
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,759
Do you know this person?

673
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,920
No, I don't.

674
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,079
I don't know them.

675
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,079
Look carefully.

676
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,640
Do you recognize them?

677
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,039
N-no, I don't.

678
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,119
This is a homicide case.

679
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,119
Be clear with your answer.

680
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,359
The sooner you're cleared as a suspect,

681
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,759
the better it is for you.

682
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,319
She is the victim.

683
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,720
Tell the truth. You know her, right?

684
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,200
Officer, I'm really sorry.

685
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,160
I-I lied just now.

686
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,440
I only met her twice.

687
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,559
That doesn't really count as knowing her, right?

688
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:53,920
Where were you on the night of October 11th?

689
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,640
I was at the shop.

690
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
What time does your shop usually close?

691
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,759
Around 9:30, I think. About that time.

692
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,640
Where did you go after closing?

693
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,319
I slept in the shop.

694
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,480
Can anyone confirm that?

695
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,039
Officer.

696
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Um...

697
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,559
Can we talk about this?

698
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,159
Can you keep it a secret for me?

699
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
When my son was two years old,

700
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,159
my wife started talking about divorce.

701
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,599
It went on for more than two years.

702
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,159
I tried to make it work for more than two years.

703
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,519
But in the end,

704
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,960
someone tried to set me up with someone else.

705
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,719
But after just a couple of days,

706
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
my son started crying and making a fuss.

707
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
He didn't want a stepmother.

708
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,360
You all saw it too.

709
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,800
I only have this one shop.

710
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
So I thought, with my son,

711
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
we should just live a good life together.

712
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,440
I decided not to date anyone else.

713
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,360
I just stopped dating.

714
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,039
Dating means you have to deal with feelings and all that.

715
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,119
For someone like me,

716
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,880
I just spend a little money, no need for feelings.

717
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,199
I was wrong, I know I was wrong.

718
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,559
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

719
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,960
I won't dare do it again.

720
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:14,679
But

721
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm a single man too.

722
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,800
I...

723
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,159
I may look old,

724
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,960
but I'm actually only forty.

725
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,360
When he was exiled to Huangzhou,

726
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,280
he was a convict.

727
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,960
But because he was open-minded,

728
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,559
and especially humorous,

729
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:44,320
he got along well with everyone wherever he went.

730
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,400
So what happened?

731
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,079
He was treated to hospitality every day.

732
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,639
He had wine to drink and meat to eat.

733
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,320
So in Huangzhou,

734
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,400
he lived a very happy life.

735
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,920
And in Huangzhou,

736
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,360
he wrote many classic phrases, lines, and poems.

737
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,800
"Niannu Jiao"

738
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,760
The great river flows eastward.

739
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,440
Do you want to hear it?

740
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,280
Yes.

741
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,360
The great river flows east, sweeping away

742
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,760
all the gallant figures of ages past.

743
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,639
Do you recognize it?

744
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,760
No.

745
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,039
Professor Wang,

746
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,559
this girl's name is Yu Hongxia.

747
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
She's twenty-two years old.

748
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,880
Is she my student?

749
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,599
No.

750
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,360
I can't remember.

751
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,559
Then take a look at this one.

752
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,519
Do you recognize her?

753
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,880
She often hangs around the Shenlun Hotel area.

754
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,880
Sorry, I have something else to do.

755
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I'll leave first.

756
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,480
Don't rush.

757
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,039
I ran into your wife when I arrived.

758
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
She's also a teacher here, right?

759
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
No, officer, I...

760
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,679
I only went to see her once.

761
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:08,960
When was that?

762
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
September 16th.

763
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,519
You remember it so clearly.

764
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,760
That was my birthday.

765
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,159
It just so happened my spouse was on a business trip.

766
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,239
October 2nd, 10 p.m.

767
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,719
Where were you from then until noon the next day?

768
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,400
I was at home.

769
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Because during that time,

770
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,039
I was helping students prepare for their thesis defenses.

771
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,760
I stayed up until two or three every night.

772
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
Whether what you say is true or not,

773
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,320
we will verify it.

774
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,760
We also hope you

775
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,960
will report to the police station yourself.

776
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,039
Officer, I beg you,

777
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,639
please don't let this get out.

778
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,119
So you know it's wrong, too.

779
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,119
I was wrong, I was wrong.

780
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,239
I've been a teacher my whole life.

781
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,159
My spouse is my colleague.

782
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,159
I live in the teachers' dormitory here.

783
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:54,079
At work, it's all teachers, colleagues, and students.

784
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,320
After work, it's still colleagues.

785
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,559
It's like I'm living in a cage.

786
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,719
I... I...

787
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,119
Officer, of...

788
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:02,960
This...

789
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,760
What's the situation on your end?

790
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,960
Xia Yu and I are investigating separately.

791
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,320
I've already been to that restaurant run by our fellow townsman.

792
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,199
I found the chef named Liu Lianyu.

793
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,159
He really was at the restaurant that day.

794
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,480
The people in the dorm can all vouch for him.

795
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,519
As for the Wutong Gym and Xinlong Company,

796
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,119
I've been to both as well.

797
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,440
No news for now.

798
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,000
It seems Xia Yu hasn't made any progress either.

799
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,039
Okay, keep checking according to the list.

800
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,440
Call me if anything comes up.

801
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,119
Alright.

802
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
Why did you leave the hospital?

803
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,679
I couldn't stay in bed any longer.

804
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,320
Take this.

805
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,239
You should've told me, I could've picked you up.

806
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,159
No need, it's not that serious.

807
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,159
Hey, stop doing that, let me handle it.

808
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,880
Don't, take a break.

809
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,840
I'll do it, it's fine.

810
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,679
Did you buy all this?

811
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,000
I bought some daily necessities and fruit.

812
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,239
And some basic medicine.

813
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,519
Why did you buy so much?

814
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm usually busy.

815
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,400
Take good care of yourself.

816
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,880
Don't worry, I also found you a housekeeper.

817
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,119
She'll come in a couple of days.

818
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,760
So just make do for the next two days.

819
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,079
Give it to me, give it to me.

820
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:24,800
It's ruined, it's ruined.

821
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Your hand, your hand, your hand!

822
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,239
Hello

823
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:39,679
Got it

824
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,599
I'll be right there

825
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,079
What's up?

826
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,840
Sis

827
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,280
I'm about to get the keys to my new place

828
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:50,880
You can move in then

829
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,440
I'm living in that place now

830
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,800
I can't go

831
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,719
That's your mother-in-law's house

832
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,679
How could I feel comfortable living there?

833
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,079
I'm really fine here

834
00:39:59,079 --> 00:39:59,880
Look, just tidy up a bit

835
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,559
Once it's clean, it's pretty comfortable

836
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,840
I've paid for a whole year

837
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,360
Why would you feel awkward?

838
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,519
Think it over again

839
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,480
Stop doing that, let me handle it

840
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,159
Okay

841
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm leaving then

842
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,880
Go on, go on, go on

843
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,760
Lie down and rest for a bit

844
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,079
Stop moving around, okay, okay

845
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,559
Alright, alright, I'll tidy up this area

846
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,239
Ni Zi is doing well at my place

847
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,360
Ting Ting has someone to keep her company too

848
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,159
They had pizza for lunch

849
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,840
Don't worry, take it, take it

850
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,800
Go, go, go

851
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,519
I'm leaving then

852
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,679
Stop fussing

853
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,519
Why do you talk so much? Hurry up and go

854
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,719
Close the door, close the door

855
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,840
I'll wipe down the back here

856
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,119
Master, Master

857
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,039
What's going on?

858
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,480
We've gone up several times.

859
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
We've been blocked and can't see him.

860
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,559
The secretary said he's not here.

861
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,320
So is he here or not?

862
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,039
Doesn't the secretary have his schedule?

863
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,639
I asked, but she just won't give it.

864
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,840
If she won't give it, can't you think of a way?

865
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,679
I've got an idea.

866
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,159
You need to check.

867
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,079
Check it.

868
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,360
Master

869
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:52,079
Let's go.

870
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,480
Help me hold this.

871
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,920
Mr. Hu

872
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:19,800
President Hu

873
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,960
Wait a moment.

874
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,559
Everyone, what are you doing?

875
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,480
Police.

876
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,599
We're here to ask President Hu to cooperate with our investigation.

877
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,719
Sorry.

878
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,400
President Hu doesn't have time right now.

879
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,519
When you take President Hu to the park,

880
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,519
he has time then.

881
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,519
But he doesn't have time to cooperate with the police?

882
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,840
Do you know who President Hu is?

883
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,840
I suggest you watch your words.

884
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,719
How should I watch my words?

885
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,119
Isn't it right to cooperate with a police investigation?

886
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,079
If, because of your words,

887
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,079
there is any damage to President Hu's reputation,

888
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,320
we will hold you responsible.
