1
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,400
One day, he drove back.

2
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,079
I noticed it wasn't his usual license plate.

3
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,719
So I stopped him and asked a few questions.

4
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,719
Which house are you going to?

5
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm an owner, I pass through here every day.

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,719
You don't recognize me?

7
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,599
There are so many people every day.

8
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,719
How could I remember everyone?

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,040
Please get out and register.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,519
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

11
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,599
Are you crazy?

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,959
Hurry up and open the gate, I have things to do.

13
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,200
Why are you insulting me?

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Get out and register. No entry without registration.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,599
Do you even know how to guard a gate?

16
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,360
Are your teeth even all grown in, and you're already biting people?

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,639
He Shun, why are you insulting people?

18
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,000
What, you want to get physical now?

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,840
He Shun.

20
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,280
Don't move.

21
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,159
He Shun.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,120
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Our employee was out of line.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,919
Please get in your car, I'll open the gate for you.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
You killed someone just because of this?

26
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,280
If it was just this one time, it would be fine.

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
After that, every time he passed the gate,

28
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,000
as long as I was on duty,

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
he would stop his car, roll down the window, and pick a fight.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,360
Are you stupid?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,319
One time, he even threw stinky dog poop at me.

32
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,800
I talked to the team leader about this.

33
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,960
I said I wanted to switch to the night shift.

34
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,400
It's just some trash being thrown.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
Why don't you just pick it up and be done with it?

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
You're always making a fuss.

37
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,240
I quit out of anger.

38
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,360
You resigned on December 1st.

39
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,360
It's been such a long time since then.

40
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,039
Why are you thinking about going back for revenge now?

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,000
After I quit, the company didn't want me anymore.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,680
Security companies all talk to each other.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,439
If this one doesn't want you,

44
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,599
the others don't want you either.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
So I thought I'd just deliver packages.

46
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,800
I was doing just fine.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,240
Who would've thought I'd run into him again?

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,719
Here, let's have a good cooperation.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,039
Sure, looking forward to working together.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
This time, I not only lost my job,

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,680
but also had to pay compensation.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,280
The money I worked so hard to save

53
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
wasn't even enough to cover it.

54
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,639
So what did he do to you this time?

55
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,199
If it weren't for him,

56
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,800
I'd still be working as a security guard.

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
If I hadn't run into him again,

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
I'd still be delivering packages just fine.

59
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,800
Tell me about what happened that day.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,839
You're crazy.

61
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,480
You're the crazy one.

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,319
Come on.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,879
Director Zhang, you wanted to see me?

64
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
If you really can't go this time,

65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,079
I'll have to send someone else.

66
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,639
You've already taken such a long sick leave.

67
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,040
And you can't work overtime usually.

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,439
Director Zhang, you don't need to say more. I can go.

69
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,079
This business trip will take seven days.

70
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,839
Can you manage things at home?

71
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,160
No problem.

72
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,240
Mom will be traveling for work a lot lately.

73
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,000
But I promise you,

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,439
whenever I'm home,

75
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,279
I'll spend more time with you, okay?

76
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,879
Mom, don't be like this.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,399
It's just boarding at school. I can handle it.

78
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,680
If we both take care of ourselves,

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
that's being responsible to each other.

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,240
Where did you learn all this from?

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,519
Don't get mad when I tell you.

82
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,040
I won't get mad. Who is it?

83
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,279
Dad said it.

84
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,040
He sent a letter to my school.

85
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,040
He told me to study hard

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,879
and take good care of you when I grow up.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,879
Put your backpack on.

88
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,040
Let's go. I'll take you to school.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,959
Mom.

90
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,519
If Dad changes for the better in the future,

91
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,000
can he live with us again?

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Help Mom push this little suitcase.

93
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,079
Ziming.

94
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm taking Nizi to school now.

95
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,120
I'm almost done packing too.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,199
I'll be leaving soon as well.

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Where are you going?

98
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,639
Where else can I go?

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,800
Grandpa, this is for you.

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,720
Come on, let's go inside and play with Grandpa.

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,120
Come, come, come.

102
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's go.

103
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,959
Long time no see.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,279
So, you’ve become a chef now.

105
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,079
Just helping out here.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,279
Business has been good lately.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,360
Have one, it’s on me.

108
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,240
Look at you.

109
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,159
Long time no see.

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,279
Long time no see.

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,600
Have a seat.

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,519
Hello.

113
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,200
Hello.

114
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
Two coffees, please.

115
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,679
Okay.

116
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
Still two packets of sugar?

117
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,679
My blood sugar is high, I’ve quit.

118
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,799
How have you been lately?

119
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,279
Not bad.

120
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,039
Enough about me, how are you?

121
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,240
I got married.

122
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,159
But now you have to call me Section Chief Ma.

123
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,759
Hello, Section Chief Ma.

124
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
I’m still just an ordinary investigator.

125
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,879
It’s fine, I didn’t go out to the scene today.

126
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,879
About my sister’s situation—

127
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,159
I won’t stand on ceremony with you.

128
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,919
I can’t repay such a big favor.

129
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,279
If you ever need anything in the future,

130
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,559
if you need my help, just let me know anytime.

131
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,679
If you can help,

132
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,840
it probably won’t be anything good.

133
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,320
That’s true.

134
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
How is your sister’s recovery?

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,399
She’s doing okay.

136
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,840
The doctor said she needs to recover slowly.

137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,960
As long as her mindset is fine,

138
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,159
I’ll be at ease.

139
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,879
That’s good.

140
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,360
Hello, who is this?

141
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,279
Yes.

142
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,879
Okay, I’ll be right there.

143
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,960
Alright, thank you.

144
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,159
Sorry, teacher.

145
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,080
It's okay.

146
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,840
Sorry, sorry.

147
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,519
Thank you.

148
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,039
It's nothing.

149
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,840
Come on, son.

150
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,159
Let's go, let's go, time to go home.

151
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,840
Say goodbye to the teacher.

152
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,559
Goodbye, Diandian.

153
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,519
Goodbye, teacher.

154
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,080
Goodbye.

155
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,799
Thank you, teacher.

156
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,039
It's fine, bye, bye.

157
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,360
Grandpa.

158
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,960
Diandian is back.

159
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,440
Go play in your room.

160
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,559
You're at home?

161
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, what's up?

162
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
Then why didn't you pick up the child?

163
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,240
I forgot.

164
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,759
It's such a small thing.

165
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,840
All I asked was for you to pick up the child on time.

166
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,919
And you still forgot.

167
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,200
Did you drink again?

168
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,639
No, what are you thinking all day?

169
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,399
Is there anything in your head besides dancing and drinking?

170
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,600
Nothing else matters, right?

171
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
Wouldn't you feel bad if the child got lost?

172
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,559
Where did you hide the alcohol?

173
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,720
Is this son yours or mine?

174
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,840
I owe you.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
Fine, you don't owe me.

176
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,279
Go ahead and drink.

177
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,559
Drink as much as you want.

178
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,080
From now on, you don't need to pick up the child.

179
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll do it myself.

180
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,360
Let's go.

181
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,399
Hello

182
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,279
Master, we've received a report.

183
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,720
There's been a body dumped in the Lizhuang area.

184
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,879
Got it.

185
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,440
You go ahead first, I'll be there soon.

186
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,200
Dad, are you leaving again?

187
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,360
Daddy has to go out for a bit.

188
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,960
Be good and go to sleep.

189
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,600
Tomorrow morning,

190
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,120
how about Daddy takes you to school?

191
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:30,720
Okay.

192
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,639
Go to sleep.

193
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,519
Alright.

194
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,639
I just saw a figure.

195
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,240
Was the figure tall?

196
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,039
Fat, short, or thin?

197
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,879
Pretty tall and sturdy.

198
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,080
Seemed like a man.

199
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,519
Which direction did he go?

200
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,559
That way, that way.

201
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,120
Yes, that way, over here.

202
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,360
He went inside this way, right?

203
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,120
Where?

204
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,519
Do you remember what he looked like exactly?

205
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,519
I didn't see his face clearly.

206
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,919
Master.

207
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,919
Ma'am, I'll take you back to make a statement first.

208
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,679
Xiao Qin.

209
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,919
Brother Ming.

210
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,120
What's going on?

211
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,320
The body was found over there.

212
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,000
There are drag marks along the way.

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
All the way to here.

214
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,879
No more traces were found beyond this point.

215
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,360
So the starting point should be here.

216
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,879
Before that, it was probably carried or held.

217
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,759
Thank you.

218
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,639
You take her.

219
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,120
Okay.

220
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Boss.

221
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,639
What is it?

222
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,519
The lady with the dog is the witness.

223
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
She was out walking her dog at midnight.

224
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,440
Then she noticed

225
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,960
someone putting something on the ground over there.

226
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,200
She saw that person sneak away.

227
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
The dog kept barking in that direction.

228
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,639
She called the police.

229
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,399
When she went over to look,

230
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,919
she found a woman on the ground.

231
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,519
But she can't remember what that person looked like.

232
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,000
Probably no use making a sketch.

233
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,559
What do you mean, "probably"?

234
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,519
Get a sketch done.

235
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,720
Is there a phone at the scene?

236
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,399
Nothing was found

237
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,759
related to the victim's identity.

238
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,159
I sent that police car out to investigate.

239
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,399
But I don't think there's much hope.

240
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Let's go take a look.

241
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,759
Let's go.

242
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,120
We should expand our cordon a bit more.

243
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,639
Okay, expand it by another five meters.

244
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:43,840
Director Guo.

245
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,159
Sir.

246
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,879
I just took a look.

247
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
The victim is quite young.

248
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,960
The method was also very brutal.

249
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,279
So I wanted to trouble you

250
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,080
to come and check the scene.

251
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
Let Old Zhang brief you on the situation.

252
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,519
We'll start working through the night right away.

253
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:57,919
Understood.

254
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,960
You take a look at the scene first.

255
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,440
Don't worry.

256
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,639
Sir.

257
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,440
Brother Zhang.

258
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,480
You're here, Ziming.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
I just finished talking to Xiao Xia.

260
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,799
The preliminary cause of death

261
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,679
is asphyxiation.

262
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,399
Mainly, I want to show you this rope.

263
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,559
Look.

264
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,000
It comes down from the back of the neck.

265
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,600
The arms are tied behind the back.

266
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,279
And there's a knot at every joint.

267
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,200
It loops back around to the ankles.

268
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,039
There's a slipknot on the hands.

269
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,399
Very professional.

270
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
What kind of professional?

271
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,000
Who would tie knots like this?

272
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,559
Hard to say.

273
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,399
What about the time of death?

274
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,000
It should be around twenty-four hours.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
Judging by the rigor mortis.

276
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,279
Li Yugang.

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,440
Go check the missing persons records.

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,960
Okay.

279
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,679
Xia Yu.

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
Let's take a look around the area.

281
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,799
See if we can find the primary crime scene.

282
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,799
Zhang, you guys keep working.

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,679
Please hurry with the autopsy report.

284
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,599
Master.

285
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,640
This leads straight to the villa area.

286
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,319
Hello?

287
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,400
Wait, wait.

288
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,279
Let me put you on speaker.

289
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,559
Go ahead.

290
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,799
Boss.

291
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,400
Speak.

292
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,720
The victim's identity has been confirmed.

293
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,759
The victim's name is Zhao Hongxia.

294
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,480
She's 39 years old, from Huicheng.

295
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,160
She used to work at the Haiming Song and Dance Troupe.

296
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
She was a dancer.

297
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,440
She lived in this residential complex,

298
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,440
No. 12, Yujing Yayuan.

299
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,799
It's not far from the crime scene.

300
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,519
Boss, it's that villa area.

301
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,279
Yujing Yayuan.

302
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,960
How was she found?

303
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,160
I was investigating the missing person case.

304
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,720
Around 10 p.m. the night before last,

305
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,319
a little girl was crying and shouting,

306
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,759
and told the security guard in the complex

307
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,799
that her aunt was missing.

308
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,799
The security guard also searched,

309
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,680
but couldn't find her.

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Then the girl's mother

311
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,960
called the police.

312
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,759
The local officer arrived at the scene immediately.

313
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,960
They started linking this case with other nearby incidents.

314
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,799
Like muggings and following women,

315
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,160
including theft cases.

316
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,480
They investigated for over forty hours but found nothing.

317
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,599
Then I checked again,

318
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,079
and happened to find her.

319
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,079
Also, her

320
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,039
fingerprint information

321
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,359
has already been matched.

322
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,279
The deceased on the ground

323
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,119
is the person from the night before last

324
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,720
that they reported missing.

325
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,160
What's the relationship between the person who reported it and the deceased?

326
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,640
She's her sister-in-law.

327
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,000
Her name is

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,759
Zhang Lu.

329
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,279
Should I notify her now?

330
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,799
Let's wait until morning.

331
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,720
Tomorrow, bring the little girl in for a talk as well.

332
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,559
Go find a place to get some rest.

333
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,119
Alright, that's it then.

334
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,160
You should go rest too.

335
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,160
But what about you, sir?

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,039
Don't worry about me.

337
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,759
Son,

338
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,759
it's not open yet.

339
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,359
Go back to sleep for a bit.

340
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,359
Okay.

341
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,519
What exactly do you mean?

342
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,079
Master.

343
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Can't you spare some time?

344
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,920
This woman is Zhao Hongxia's sister-in-law.

345
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,640
She's your biological younger sister, her name is Zhang Lu.

346
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,039
She was the one who reported the case the day before yesterday.

347
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,359
And this little girl is Zhang Lu's daughter.

348
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,960
Her name is Tiantian, and she's also Zhao Hongxia's niece.

349
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
This is our Captain Liu.

350
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,200
Hello.

351
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,480
Hello, please have a seat.

352
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,480
We just want to ask you a few questions.

353
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
Do you usually live here?

354
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,799
We don't live here.

355
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,759
I'm going back this afternoon.

356
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,680
I've only been staying here for these three days on a business trip.

357
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,279
Why did you bring your child on a business trip?

358
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,359
Isn't she supposed to be in school?

359
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,680
My child has never been away from me since she was little.

360
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,680
When she found out I was going on a business trip,

361
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,680
she kept crying and fussing.

362
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,640
So my husband asked for a few days off for her.

363
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,799
He let me bring her with me.

364
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,480
But I have work to do.

365
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,359
I definitely can't take care of her all the time.

366
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,759
So my husband called Hongxia.

367
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,079
Hongxia was very welcoming at the time.

368
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,680
She said we could stay at her place.

369
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,680
She could also help me look after my child.

370
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,279
When did you arrive?

371
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:54,880
The day before yesterday.

372
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,680
We came straight here after landing at noon the day before yesterday.

373
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,079
Our company had a business dinner that evening.

374
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,880
I left at around five o'clock.

375
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,480
Do you know about Zhao Hongxia's usual lifestyle?

376
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,519
Are you familiar with it?

377
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,680
Who does she usually spend time with?

378
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,759
Does she have a boyfriend?

379
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,279
I don't really know about these things.

380
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,519
We don't usually keep in touch.

381
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,480
We just call each other to say hello during holidays.

382
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,240
You just called her brother, right?

383
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, my husband.

384
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,279
Does he know about her situation?

385
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,119
They haven't seen each other in years.

386
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,559
They don't usually keep in touch either.

387
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,279
It's just that after the case was reported,

388
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,880
the police contacted him to ask about her.

389
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,160
He only knows that she works in a song and dance troupe.

390
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
He doesn't know anything else.

391
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,279
Why didn't he come?

392
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
Their relationship as siblings is pretty ordinary.

393
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,640
They usually don't keep in touch.

394
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,279
Also,

395
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,920
our family runs a restaurant.

396
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,960
A few days ago, all the waiters quit.

397
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,119
He's really too busy to get away.

398
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Ask in more detail.

399
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,160
Okay.

400
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,359
May I speak with your daughter for a moment?

401
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,079
Sure.

402
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,160
Tiantian,

403
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,000
can you repeat what you just told me

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,640
to this uncle now, is that okay?

405
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,079
Try to carefully recall what happened that day.

406
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,640
The more details, the better.

407
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,960
That day, Mom went out to work.

408
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,559
In the evening, Aunt ordered pizza.

409
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,759
I don't like pizza.

410
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,680
When it was almost bedtime, Aunt saw I was hungry.

411
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,279
So she said she'd go out to buy me something to eat.

412
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,519
But after a long time, Aunt still hadn't come back.

413
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,079
I was scared being home alone.

414
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,680
So I went out to look for her.

415
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,200
About what time did your aunt leave?

416
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Do you remember?

417
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,759
It was almost nine thirty, I think.

418
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,519
And what time did you leave?

419
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,240
Almost ten thirty.

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,240
Can we leave now?

421
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,920
We've already verified the itinerary you mentioned.

422
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,039
It's just as you said.

423
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,079
The questioning record is finished, right?

424
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,680
It's done.

425
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,880
Then you can go.

426
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,079
But please keep your phone available.

427
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,880
We'll inform you about anything else later.

428
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,799
Okay, thank you.

429
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,680
Sorry for the trouble.

430
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Yalin, see them out.

431
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,559
Okay.

432
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,559
Let's go.

433
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,160
Bye, Tiantian.

434
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,119
Bye.

435
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,799
Bye.

436
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,279
Master

437
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,039
What have you found out?

438
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,920
The local police in their hometown said

439
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,119
There are four people in Zhao Hongxia's family.

440
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,680
Her parents both fell ill and passed away last year.

441
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,039
They were workers before they died.

442
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,000
She has an older brother.

443
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,519
But the siblings aren't very close.

444
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,039
They don't keep in touch much.

445
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,359
Her brother has always stayed in their hometown.

446
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,559
He hasn't left for half a year.

447
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,559
She didn't even go back when their parents died?

448
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Her brother said she didn't go back.

449
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,079
But she did send money.

450
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,240
The funeral was quite grand, you know.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,960
What about her workplace? What did the song and dance troupe say?

452
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,640
I called them.

453
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
They had a really bad attitude.

454
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,400
Right away they said

455
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,440
Never heard of her, don't know, don't recognize.

456
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,880
So I went there in person.

457
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,440
To their finance department.

458
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
That's where I finally found Zhao Hongxia's records.

459
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,359
They said she was just nominally affiliated.

460
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,160
She never received a salary.

461
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,279
No one has ever seen her.

462
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,880
She was on unpaid leave.

463
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
She was on unpaid leave,

464
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,440
yet she lives in such a big villa,

465
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
and even has a sports car.

466
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:20,960
Where did the money come from?

467
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,480
That's a bit strange.

468
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,160
I'll go check

469
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,680
the transaction records for her house.

470
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,480
Hurry up.

471
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Let's go.

472
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,480
Xiao Qin

473
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,359
Brother Ming

474
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
Have you found anything?

475
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,680
Not yet.

476
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,039
If I had to say something,

477
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,759
let me take you to the third floor for a look.

478
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,559
That child kept crying.

479
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,960
So I accompanied her to look all the way.

480
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,559
Then I found several other people

481
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,559
to help search together.

482
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,359
But in the end, we didn't find her.

483
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,519
Afterwards, I called her mother.

484
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Her mother came back and checked the situation.

485
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,279
She said we should call the police.

486
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,680
Around your neighborhood,

487
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,559
are there any restaurants or supermarkets?

488
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,880
There are two or three restaurants.

489
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,960
There's a supermarket about two kilometers away.

490
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
It's a bit bigger.

491
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,039
Nearby, there's only a convenience store.

492
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,599
Just go out from here,

493
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,440
then turn right, and at the end, turn left.

494
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,240
Does anyone usually come to see her?

495
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,519
She usually comes and goes by herself.

496
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,000
There used to be an old gentleman

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,160
who often spent time with her.

498
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,359
How long ago was that?

499
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,680
It's been more than half a year.

500
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,160
Anyway, I haven't seen him for a long time.

501
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,799
Do you remember what that old gentleman looked like?

502
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,640
That old gentleman,

503
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,680
looked to be in his sixties.

504
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,400
And

505
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,359
yes, he had a Cantonese accent.

506
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,480
He was about 1.7 meters tall.

507
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,279
He should be around 1.7 meters.

508
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,160
He always dressed very neatly.

509
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,640
He always wore a suit.

510
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,440
Did he drive?

511
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,079
Yes.

512
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,319
In this neighborhood, most people drive Mercedes or BMWs.

513
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,559
But he drove an old Crown.

514
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,079
Do you have the license plate number recorded?

515
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,160
The license plate number?

516
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,680
Please wait a moment, I'll look for it.

517
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,880
It should be this one.

518
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,279
Make a note of it.

519
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,680
Okay.

520
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,680
On the east side of your neighborhood,

521
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
what's the situation with that vacant lot?

522
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,279
Why hasn't it been developed?

523
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,680
They said before that it would be developed.

524
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,279
But then something seemed to have happened.

525
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm not too sure about that.

526
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
So it was put on hold.

527
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,240
Does anyone usually pass through there?

528
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,039
Probably not.

529
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,319
There's nothing there at all.

530
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,799
In the contents of the victim's stomach,

531
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,039
we found undigested corn kernels and starch,

532
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,880
as well as chicken.

533
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,519
From this, we inferred her time of death.

534
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,680
From the time of death to when she was found

535
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,119
was between twenty and twenty-two hours.

536
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,680
That is, on March 5th,

537
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,519
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.

538
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,359
This matches the information provided by her niece.

539
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,279
The victim did order pizza before her death.

540
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,319
Additionally,

541
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,039
there are signs of molestation on the body.

542
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,640
But there are no signs of intercourse.

543
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,559
The cause of death is asphyxiation.

544
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,359
What kind of asphyxiation?

545
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,680
Was it strangulation by rope or by hand?

546
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,799
Neither.

547
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
Although there are marks on her neck,

548
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,559
and they were indeed caused by human hands,

549
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,799
the cause of death was oxygen deprivation.

550
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,279
What does that mean?

551
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,799
At first, we also suspected she was strangled to death.

552
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,119
Because her external features

553
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,119
were very similar to those of hanging, ligature, or manual strangulation.

554
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
But after

555
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,519
examining the pathological evidence under the microscope,

556
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,960
we believe her chest cavity couldn't expand and contract,

557
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,880
and she died due to impaired lung ventilation.

558
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,559
In other words, she was smothered.

559
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,119
Smothered?

560
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:39,480
Yes.

561
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
What was she smothered with?

562
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,039
That, we can't determine.

563
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,880
Because there are too many possibilities.

564
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,920
For now,

565
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,480
Go on.

566
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,400
Now, let's look at this rope.

567
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,960
We cut it open for the autopsy.

568
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,160
It's all been cut apart.

569
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,680
That means,

570
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,480
it was originally a single piece of rope.

571
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
But it tied up every joint on the victim's body.

572
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
All of them were bound.

573
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,640
This shows the person who did it was very skilled.

574
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,160
Let's look at this as well.

575
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,640
The superficial wounds on her hands

576
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,079
were all inflicted while she was alive.

577
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,160
Including the dirt under her fingernails.

578
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,319
It's deeply embedded

579
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,680
in the nail crevices.

580
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,160
Captain Huang,

581
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,039
that's all we have for now.

582
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,039
Xiao Yao, do you have anything to add?

583
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,880
The sand and soil on the body

584
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,160
are just common local plants and soil.

585
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
There's also a trace of river sand.

586
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,960
But there's no river nearby.

587
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,359
Right, but there are construction sites everywhere now.

588
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,960
And dust control isn't effective.

589
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,519
So it's not much use as evidence.

590
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,920
What about the rope used for binding?

591
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,319
It's just regular nylon rope.

592
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,480
The same kind used for bundling clothes

593
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,079
or tying up goods.

594
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,319
You can buy it anywhere.

595
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,440
From under the victim's fingernails,

596
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,920
we extracted some skin tissue.

597
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,119
We're still waiting for Lao Zhang's test results.

598
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,680
What about the victim's phone?

599
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,799
It's been out of service the whole time.

600
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,319
We're checking the call records from the past six months.

601
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,279
Play that surveillance footage.

602
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,240
I also visited the nearby restaurants.

603
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,119
Supermarkets and convenience stores too.

604
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,079
Finally, near the residential complex,

605
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,920
I found a convenience store about 500 meters away.

606
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,079
This is Zhao Hongxia's last shopping surveillance footage.

607
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,240
I also asked this shop assistant.

608
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,279
She went there alone.

609
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,640
There were no suspicious people before or after.

610
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,519
Alright, stop.

611
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,519
Everyone, take a look.

612
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,319
This video shows

613
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,640
that before 10 p.m. on March 4th,

614
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,440
Zhao Hongxia was still fine.

615
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,359
According to her family,

616
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,079
she hadn't returned home by 10:30.

617
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,920
So the time of the attack should be between these times.

618
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,119
Just now, Lao Zhang also said

619
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,640
the time of death was early morning on March 5th.

620
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Right, between 1 and 3 a.m.

621
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,079
Between 1 and 3 a.m.

622
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,960
And the place where she was found

623
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,559
was on the night of March 5th.

624
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,839
So during this period,

625
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,480
where did she go?

626
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,359
And her clothes—

627
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,480
her coat is missing.

628
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
She was wearing a white coat at the time.

629
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
Where did the coat go?

630
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,039
Also,

631
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,519
why was the rope tied like that?

632
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,519
Normally, people wouldn't go to such trouble.

633
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,720
It's impossible that

634
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
it was tied that way just for easier transport.

635
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,359
Of course, the most important thing is

636
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,319
where the primary crime scene is.

637
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,960
Ziming, what do you think?

638
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,200
Gangzi,

639
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,119
report the ownership transfer information for Zhao Hongxia's apartment

640
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,799
to Captain Huang.

641
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,960
The apartment Zhao Hongxia is living in now

642
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,440
was transferred in 2002.

643
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,960
The original owner was Lai Hongchuan.

644
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,119
Fifty-six years old, from Hong Kong, China.

645
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,680
The person registered to the license plate mentioned by the security guard

646
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,000
is also Lai Hongchuan.

647
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,240
Go and conduct a thorough investigation.

648
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,319
Understood.

649
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,720
Alright, this way please.

650
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,559
Take it slow.

651
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,759
Mr. Lai, the guest has arrived.

652
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,799
What a tragic death.

653
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,519
How could this happen?

654
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm sorry.

655
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,039
It's alright, please calm down first.

656
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,799
I'd like to ask you something.

657
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,400
The villa at Yujiang Elegant Garden,

658
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,480
was it you who transferred it to Zhao Hongxia?

659
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,680
Yes.

660
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,799
I gave it to her as a gift.

661
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
What is your relationship with her?

662
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,799
Why did you give her a villa?

663
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,599
That goes back to when I first met her.

664
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,400
That must have been in 1999.

665
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:58,240
I was at a nightclub called Gesong.

666
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,640
I saw her dancing there.

667
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,440
The first time I saw Xiaoxia,

668
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,640
I was captivated by her.

669
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,400
Her every expression and smile

670
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,640
were so charming.

671
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,200
And also,

672
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,599
the look in her eyes when she danced—

673
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,279
I still can't forget it to this day.

674
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,079
Please come in.

675
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,440
Mr. Lai, you're here.

676
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,440
You look stunning.

677
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
These flowers are for you.

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,039
Thank you, you shouldn't have spent so much again.

679
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,079
Are you hungry?

680
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,480
Get changed, I'll take you out for a late-night snack.

681
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,680
Alright, wait for me outside for a moment.

682
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,079
I'll just change and be right out.

683
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:54,880
Okay.

684
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,279
She studied dance professionally.

685
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,440
Why would she dance at a club then?

686
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,440
I asked her the same thing.

687
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,199
She told me she needed money urgently.

688
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,440
The club owner was generous with money.

689
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,639
Also, in the evenings,

690
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,599
she could still go back and practice dance.

691
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,320
Why did she need money so badly?

692
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,000
She didn't tell me either.

693
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,519
I only found out later.

694
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,039
Turns out she had a first love.

695
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480
His name was Liu Jun.

696
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,440
Liu... Liu what?

697
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,679
"Jun" as in "handsome."

698
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,599
"Jun" as in "handsome." Okay, please continue.

699
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,000
Both of them are from Huicheng.

700
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,480
Liu Jun got into that University of Posts and Telecommunications.

701
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,119
Later, Xiaoxia also joined that song and dance troupe.

702
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,119
Xiaoxia came here because of him.

703
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,800
She left her hometown and came here for him.

704
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,679
A few years later,

705
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,800
Liu Jun was about to graduate.

706
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,440
He wanted to study abroad.

707
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
But his family was poor.

708
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,440
They couldn't afford it.

709
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
So Xiaoxia helped him.

710
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,880
She went to perform as a dancer.

711
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,000
I didn't want her to work so hard.

712
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,239
So I gave her two hundred thousand.

713
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,519
Liu Jun took the money and went abroad.

714
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,159
Liu Jun stayed overseas for several years.

715
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,079
Did he ever come back to see her during that time?

716
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,480
No.

717
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,679
He went to the US to study programming.

718
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,880
At that time, it wasn't very popular in China.

719
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,519
While he was studying,

720
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,880
his thoughts changed later on.

721
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,280
He wanted to stay there.

722
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,559
This was different from

723
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,199
the agreement he had with Xiaoxia at the beginning.

724
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,880
If he wanted to stay in the US,

725
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,159
he had to get a green card.

726
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,480
He took a shortcut.

727
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,519
He found a girl in the US and got married.

728
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,800
When Xiaoxia found out, she went crazy.

729
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,280
She was in a lot of pain.

730
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,159
Actually, I knew from the start

731
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,239
that he wouldn't come back.

732
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:10,920
Alright.

733
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,920
It's good that you've figured it out.

734
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,079
Look at you.

735
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,920
You're not even pretty anymore.

736
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:21,239
Someone like him isn't worth your love at all.

737
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,639
Forget about him.

738
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,480
Xiaoxia.

739
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,440
Promise me, let me take good care of you.

740
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
You can stay in this house for now.

741
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,039
Later, I'll transfer it to your name.

742
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,639
That's better.

743
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,960
If you keep crying, you won't look pretty.

744
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,679
Later, Xiaoxia agreed.

745
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,880
I was truly very happy.

746
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,280
The next day, I transferred the house she lived in

747
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,880
to her name.

748
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,199
She was with me for about seven or eight years.

749
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,480
It was around the middle of 2008.

750
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,400
I came back from Hong Kong, China.

751
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,440
I felt that Xiaoxia was acting a bit strange.

752
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:14,000
She was always gloomy.

753
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,519
I asked her repeatedly.

754
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,199
She finally told me.

755
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,800
Liu Jun had come back.

756
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,280
They met up.

757
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,800
Not only did they meet,

758
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
they got back together.

759
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:29,480
So did Liu Jun come back to visit family

760
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,800
or to work?

761
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,000
To start a business.

762
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,440
He happened to return

763
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
right during the information technology boom.

764
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,639
At that time,

765
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,880
Xiaoxia helped him once again.

766
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,880
She mortgaged her house.

767
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,400
She even borrowed some money from me to give to him.

768
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,239
It was about ten million.

769
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,679
At that time, I tried to persuade her.

770
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,239
I told her, "This person is not trustworthy."

771
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,800
I was worried she would get hurt even more.

772
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,239
But Xiaoxia

773
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,639
was infatuated.

774
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
She wouldn't listen.

775
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,440
Liu Jun got ten million.

776
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,320
He immediately started a company.

777
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,039
He bought two houses under the company's name.

778
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
Two ground-floor commercial units.

779
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
And an office building.

780
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,400
He started his own business.

781
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,880
It's quite a big operation.

782
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,519
But during this period,

783
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,400
I didn't feel that Xiaoxia was happy.

784
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,480
She seemed even more miserable to me.

785
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,079
Why was she so miserable?

786
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,679
Because Liu Jun never intended to marry her.

787
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,079
At this stage,

788
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,800
how was your relationship with Zhao Hongxia?

789
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,920
Did you two argue?

790
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,679
Of course we argued. How could we not?

791
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,880
My relationship with Xiaoxia

792
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,800
became unstable because Liu Jun came back.

793
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
It was already on the verge of collapse.

794
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,639
And on top of that, Liu Jun

795
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,079
didn't treat her well.

796
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,639
From that time on,

797
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,639
she started going to bars and nightclubs frequently.

798
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,519
She spent money to get drunk.

799
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,199
It was around last November, I think.

800
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,880
She came to me.

801
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,800
She asked me for money again.

802
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,559
This time,

803
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,800
I didn't give it to her.

804
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,639
Xiaoxia, come back with me.

805
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,639
Leave me alone.

806
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,639
You won't lend me money, but you still want to control me.

807
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,000
Come home with me.

808
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,599
Where is home?

809
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,039
Where is my home?

810
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,840
Who are you to me?

811
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,000
You're drunk.

812
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,239
If you have something to say, let's talk about it at home.

813
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,760
I told you to leave me alone.

814
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,039
Xiaoxia, you're still young.

815
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,039
Don't ruin yourself.

816
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,239
You're giving up on yourself right now.

817
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,280
Look at you.

818
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,519
Drinking, gambling...

819
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,679
You're hurting yourself.

820
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:18,840
Yeah.

821
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
So what?

822
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,039
How about this then?

823
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,199
Marry me.

824
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,039
Marry me.

825
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,679
I'll stay at home and be a full-time housewife for you.

826
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,639
I won't go anywhere.

827
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,559
I won't do anything else.

828
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,400
Is that okay?

829
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,159
Can you do that?

830
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,760
If you can't, then what's the point of talking?

831
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,599
So from now on, the two of us...

832
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,000
We'll each go our own way and live our own lives.

833
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,360
You don't need to care whether I live or die.

834
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,639
And I don't owe you anything.

835
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,239
Xiaoxia

836
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,239
Since then

837
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,639
we haven't seen each other again.

838
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,239
So that was the last time you saw each other?

839
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,400
We haven't met again since.

840
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,400
Even on my birthday,

841
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,239
she didn't call me.

842
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,440
Master, do you think what he said is true?

843
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,280
Speaking of the last time he saw the deceased,

844
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,360
it ended on a bad note.

845
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,639
He didn't avoid suspicion at all.

846
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,480
It probably isn't a lie.

847
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,039
I don't think it's a lie either.

848
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,639
When I called him,

849
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,760
he was in Qingdao.

850
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
As soon as he heard about Zhao Hongxia's accident,

851
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,239
he immediately flew back.

852
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,039
He really did seem quite concerned.

853
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,400
Let's not answer.

854
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,519
Someone else will answer.

855
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,159
Master, you startled me.

856
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,840
What are you doing?

857
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,320
I'm just trying to recreate

858
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
the way the killer tied the knots.

859
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,199
We can't get anywhere with traces or physical evidence.

860
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,719
I want to figure out his method.

861
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,800
Maybe it will help us solve the case.

862
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,119
So, what have you found out?

863
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,599
Well, that depends on how you look at it.

864
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,199
Just explain it step by step.

865
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,960
Look,

866
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,159
this knot here,

867
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,519
is a figure-eight knot.

868
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,280
What's a figure-eight knot?

869
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,000
You also bend the rope into a loop,

870
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
then take the working end

871
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,199
and pass it around the fixed part,

872
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,440
then thread it back through the loop.

873
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,840
That's a figure-eight knot.

874
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,960
A figure-eight knot is more effective than a reef knot.

875
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,159
So you mean to say

876
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,400
this kind of knot is rarely used in daily life?

877
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,880
Right, we usually use a reef knot in daily life.

878
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,639
But there's a group of people who use the figure-eight knot.

879
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,679
What kind of people?

880
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,679
Fishermen.
