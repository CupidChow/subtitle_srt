1
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,079
Have you ever cared about what I do?

2
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,640
Dong Chunni has brought Huzi before.

3
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,239
He’s been to Professor Yang’s house twice.

4
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,680
But we did a follow-up visit in the end.

5
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,759
We found out that Huzi himself had gone there a few more times.

6
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,080
Boss.

7
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,479
Go on.

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,560
According to the statement,

9
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,240
Huzi was wearing a black jacket.

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,199
He has a short crew cut and looks pretty sharp.

11
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,840
He often hangs around that neighborhood.

12
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,719
But we’re not sure what he actually looks like.

13
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,840
We can only rely on

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
these physical features to identify him.

15
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:29,680
To be honest, we don’t know if it’s really him.

16
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,800
But I think he’s the most likely suspect.

17
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,280
Boss, didn’t you tell me to look into Huzi?

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,879
I was shocked by what I found.

19
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,560
Take a look.

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,199
These are photos from his QQ profile.

21
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,039
I’ve already printed them out.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
After Captain Huang gave the order,

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,560
I cracked his QQ password.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,159
I even recovered some of his chat history.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,479
Look.

26
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,319
Wait, boss.

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
This is Huzi.

28
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,280
Didn’t Dong Chunni say he had a crew cut?

29
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,919
But this isn’t curly hair either.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Who says it isn’t?

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,159
He looks just like one of those Korean idols.

32
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,800
It’s not called “non-mainstream” anymore, right?

33
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,879
It’s called “trendy.”

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,319
Look, all these photos are like that.

35
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,240
This isn't a Harley motorcycle either.

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,639
Isn't this a Porsche Cayenne?

37
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,960
Did you check this photo with Dong Chunni?

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,680
I checked.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,159
I asked her, and at first she was confused too.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
But later, she said this person is Huzi.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,759
So she didn't recognize him at first either.

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,759
Look at this style.

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
Just changing the hairstyle,

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
it's like he had plastic surgery.

45
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,560
And with these photos,

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
they've all been edited.

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,879
It's really hard to tell.

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,439
Master, are you not confused?

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,960
Is there no clue in the chat records?

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
There is. I found something.

51
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,560
Take a look.

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,639
This person called Guose Tianxiang,

53
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,840
her real name is Guo Rui.

54
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,879
She runs a company called Women's Secret Words.

55
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,800
I looked it up online.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,719
They sell liquid condoms.

57
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,719
She reported to the police station last month.

58
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,719
She said her Porsche Cayenne was stolen.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
On her case receipt,

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,120
it lists the phone number she used to register QQ.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Did they find the car in the end?

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,439
That's the key question.

63
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,919
She later withdrew the case.

64
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,719
She said the car was found, it was a misunderstanding.

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,120
So this receipt,

66
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,480
is it in the chat records?

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,120
His chat records with Guose Tianxiang

68
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,319
have all been deleted, they're gone.

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,199
You can only see how often they interacted.

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Master.

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,279
Go, talk to her.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,199
Also, don't let the bar out of your sight.

73
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,319
Keep watching.

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,079
Okay.

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,639
No impression.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,639
Really haven't seen them.

77
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Take a good look.

78
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,759
There are too many people around Lao Yang, and they're all kinds of people.

79
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,680
There are students, fans,

80
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,959
and people who discuss academic issues with him.

81
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,759
Other colleagues and such.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,759
I really can't remember clearly.

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,480
There are fans too?

84
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,879
Yes.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
Some like him,

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,639
and some attack him.

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,519
I've heard Lao Yang mention

88
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,560
that someone insults him online.

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
He can't figure out who it is.

90
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,879
He was quite angry about it.

91
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,279
What do they attack him for?

92
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,839
Yeah.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,160
It's on some forums or something.

94
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,279
I don't go online either.

95
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,079
I don't really understand it.

96
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,759
Yang Mo hasn't come back yet.

97
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,759
Not yet.

98
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,360
Does he know about his dad?

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,800
No, he doesn't.

100
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,879
I haven't told him yet.

101
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,639
He said he'd be back in a couple of days.

102
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,240
I want to wait until he comes back to tell him.

103
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,920
He's out there alone.

104
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
I'm afraid he can't handle it.

105
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,839
Captain Huang

106
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,639
When Huzi got involved with Dong Chunni,

107
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,240
he was still dating Zheng Xiaomeng.

108
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,959
They were even living together.

109
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,839
He also claimed that he would

110
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,319
stand up for Zheng Xiaomeng.

111
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,959
He also said he would beat up Professor Yang for Dong Chunni.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
But in the end,

113
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,000
he didn't fight anyone or stand up for anyone.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,480
Huzi suddenly disappeared.

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
After getting involved with

116
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,839
these successful middle-aged women,

117
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,160
he drove their luxury cars,

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,279
and dated rich, beautiful women.

119
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,600
I guess his schemes were exposed.

120
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Who was the one who reported it to the police station?

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,639
It was Guo Rui.

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
She previously reported her Cayenne stolen.

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
But later, she withdrew the case.

124
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,160
Huzi even kept the chat records with her.

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,199
Everything has been completely deleted.

126
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
Our preliminary analysis now is,

127
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,240
these two probably had a falling out.

128
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,240
This Huzi

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,759
is a strong suspect.

130
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,920
When Professor Yang was killed,

131
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,040
he happened to disappear.

132
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,879
He might have gone on the run out of guilt.

133
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,399
If he really did run away out of guilt,

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,839
then he probably blocked Dong Chunni.

135
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,959
And robbed Zheng Xiaomeng.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,439
But why did he suddenly come back?

137
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,680
Reinventing himself and hanging around in a higher-end market.

138
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,199
That's some strong nerves.

139
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,319
I don't think so.

140
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
That he ran away because of murder

141
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
and that's why he blocked Dong Chunni.

142
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,519
Why?

143
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,120
I suspect he borrowed money from Dong Chunni.

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,000
Just like with Zheng Xiaomeng.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,319
You're familiar with Dong Chunni.

146
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,759
Give her a call.

147
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,519
Confirm it.

148
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:50,879
Ask her.

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
Hello, Dong Chunni.

150
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,079
Yes, this is Xia Yu.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,639
I want to ask you something.

152
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,319
When Huzi was with you,

153
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,720
did he ever borrow money from you?

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes, he borrowed five thousand.

155
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,000
Did you ask him to pay it back later?

156
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,240
No.

157
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,000
I never planned to ask him to pay it back.

158
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,920
Besides, I also asked him to beat up Professor Yang.

159
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,839
Okay, got it.

160
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,959
If I have more questions, I'll ask you later.

161
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
Alright, sure.

162
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,319
He borrowed money.

163
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,159
But Dong Chunni didn't intend to ask for it back.

164
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,320
That's why she didn't mention it to us before.

165
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,720
But it's very possible

166
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,159
he was afraid Dong Chunni would ask him to pay it back.

167
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
That's why he blocked her.

168
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,840
The key point is, right now

169
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,679
we have no evidence that Huzi killed someone and is on the run.

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,720
And up to now,

171
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
we haven't even seen this person.

172
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,200
So what's your plan next?

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,919
We're thinking

174
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,399
we should meet Huzi's girlfriend first.

175
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:54,879
Yeah.

176
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,159
I was thinking the same.

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
Well, you didn't say it.

178
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,279
You didn't ask what I thought.

179
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,840
Alright.

180
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,639
Let's go meet her.

181
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,320
We'll head out now.

182
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,799
Do you want more water?

183
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,799
No, thanks.

184
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,799
Police.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,159
We have an appointment with your Manager Guo.

186
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,320
Please contact her.

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,879
Please wait a moment, I'll make a call.

188
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,399
Sorry to keep you waiting.

189
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,120
Hello.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,240
Hi, please have a seat.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Wasn't the case dropped?

192
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,799
Why are you here again?

193
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,000
We're here this time

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,720
not because of your stolen car report.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,200
We want to talk about the man who drove your car away.

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
About him.

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
What happened to him?

198
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,840
He was arrested for fraud.

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,399
We can't disclose the details of the case right now.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,759
Let's talk about this person, Huzi.

201
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Huzi?

202
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,200
Okay, what do you want to know?

203
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,320
What's his real name?

204
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,519
How did you meet him?

205
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
I've seen his ID card.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,759
His real name is Cheng Xi.

207
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,960
Cheng Xi? Which characters?

208
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
"Cheng" as in "formula."

209
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,480
"Xi" is the one with the sun radical.

210
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,399
We met at a cocktail party.

211
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,440
It was around spring.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
April.

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,440
Yes, in April.

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,799
I had just gotten divorced at that time.

215
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,360
I just wanted to get out and clear my head.

216
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,799
So I went to the party.

217
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,399
He was the one who approached me.

218
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,519
We ended up having a good conversation.

219
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,240
We exchanged contact information.

220
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,440
What kind of party was it?

221
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,519
The party was just

222
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,799
some regular social activities.

223
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,720
They also teach some social etiquette and such.

224
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
It's a club.

225
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
What kind of people usually go to that club?

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,399
There are self-made people like us,

227
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,000
who are already successful in their careers.

228
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
There are also some young women and men,

229
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,200
trying to present themselves well and find a wealthy sponsor.

230
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,639
To put it bluntly, it's a place for people to make themselves look good.

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,799
What was the name of that club you mentioned?

232
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
The club is called Sai Li Ya.

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,759
I went there a few times and found it pretty boring.

234
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,080
So I stopped going after that.

235
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,279
It seems like this club isn't as simple as it looks.

236
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,919
There must be a lot going on behind the scenes.

237
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
And I just thought of something.

238
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,559
I don't know if it occurred to you.

239
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,879
Look at Huzi.

240
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,759
Back when he was with Dong Chunni

241
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,120
and Zheng Xiaomeng,

242
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,440
he used to ride a motorcycle and dress like a thug.

243
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,879
But look at him now.

244
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,919
He's changed completely in just a few months.

245
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:24,720
It's like he's leveled up.

246
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,519
I don't think he could have done it on his own.

247
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,840
Someone must be helping him.

248
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll check his call records again.

249
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,120
See who he's been calling frequently lately.

250
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,120
Diandian isn't back yet?

251
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,039
She's at my mom's place.

252
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,879
That's perfect.

253
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,240
If you have time now,

254
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,480
let's talk.

255
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,200
Let's end things on good terms.

256
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,639
Let's get a divorce.

257
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,399
Are you kidding me?

258
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm not joking.

259
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Liu Ziming, after all these years

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
I actually really envy your suspects

261
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,799
even your victims

262
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,639
Haven't you noticed

263
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,879
that the two of us, usually

264
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,639
don't really have much to talk about?

265
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,360
Even when we do chat occasionally

266
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,279
it's always about your cases

267
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,639
Your mind is always filled with your cases

268
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,799
Every day, what you think about is

269
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,600
why they did what they did

270
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
what matters most to them

271
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,080
what is most important to them

272
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,000
But have you ever thought about me?

273
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,799
Do you know what I care about?

274
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,600
What is most important to me?

275
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,480
Tingting

276
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
You need to have limits when you lose your temper

277
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,639
You can't just bring up divorce every time you get angry or act on impulse

278
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,799
and mention divorce

279
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,879
I've actually thought about this for a long time

280
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,799
I want a divorce

281
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,559
It has nothing to do with anyone else

282
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,240
It's just that our life together can't go on anymore

283
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
Are you still upset about what happened yesterday?

284
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,399
Are you still holding a grudge?

285
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,759
I'm sorry, I apologize to you

286
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,679
I know you're angry

287
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:01,960
My two apprentices

288
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,639
will be ready to work on their own in half a year

289
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,759
How about I come home every day to have dinner with you from now on?

290
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
Stop making empty promises to me

291
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
You've done it too many times

292
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,759
You've really made up your mind to divorce

293
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Divorce

294
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,360
We can't go on like this anymore

295
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,279
I am a person.

296
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,960
I am a woman.

297
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,919
I don't have it.

298
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,120
I'm not as strong as I thought I was.

299
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,080
There are times when I feel weak and helpless.

300
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,919
There are times when I'm sick and need someone to take care of me.

301
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,759
But you were never there during those times.

302
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,080
We've been married for so many years.

303
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,639
I've taken care of the child by myself.

304
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,159
I've taken care of both our parents.

305
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,679
I even went to have surgery alone.

306
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,840
I've been living my life alone.

307
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,679
Sometimes I feel

308
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,279
that it doesn't matter whether I keep living like this or not.

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,960
Liu Ziming, let's be honest with ourselves.

310
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,039
I've never wronged you.

311
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,840
Your family,

312
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
your friends,

313
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,240
how I've treated them,

314
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,519
you've seen it all.

315
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,440
I've never wronged you either.

316
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,639
But I feel like I've let myself down.

317
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,720
Is there anything else you want to ask?

318
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,720
Okay.

319
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,839
Why are you here?

320
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,039
Just came to take a look.

321
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,640
You don't need to come.

322
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,240
Tingting was here this morning, just arrived.

323
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
Does she come often?

324
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Anyway, she comes more often than you.

325
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Did she say anything?

326
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,640
She said quite a lot.

327
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,319
Just chatted about daily life.

328
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
What's wrong?

329
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,960
Nothing much.

330
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,599
It's nothing, you should get some sleep.

331
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,319
I'll leave in a bit.

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,400
By the way,

333
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,119
Before she left, she told me

334
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,680
she's been too busy lately.

335
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,000
From now on,

336
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,119
she won't be able to come anymore.

337
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,920
After you finish eating, just lie down and rest.

338
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,119
Don't think about anything.

339
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Master, Master.

340
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,799
Master, we went to Guo Rui's company today.

341
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,079
We found a club.

342
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,079
Just wanted to report to you.

343
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,000
No need to report.

344
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
You guys go ahead and talk.

345
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,119
Guo Rui mentioned something called the Seliya Club.

346
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,640
How do you even investigate a club like that?

347
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,680
Just go in and show your badge.

348
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
How would you investigate it?

349
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,039
You make it sound so easy.

350
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,839
It's an exclusive club with a membership system.

351
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,640
What could you possibly find out by just asking?

352
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,519
Then send in a female officer.

353
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,599
She could go undercover.

354
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,160
Undercover?

355
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,839
How long would she have to stay undercover?

356
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,640
Besides,

357
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,279
Even if we report it, the higher-ups might not approve.

358
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,640
Would the higher-ups approve it?

359
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,119
Would they really approve?

360
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,839
I looked up a phone number.

361
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,039
This number interacts frequently with Huzi.

362
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,519
This number has posted a lot of

363
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,799
job postings about this place called Sailiya.

364
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,799
Job postings? For what positions?

365
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,079
They're hiring supervisors and waiters.

366
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,839
Listen to this ad copy.

367
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,359
Read it.

368
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,640
We don't care if you have experience.

369
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,640
Or if you have a degree.

370
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,440
We only care that you have

371
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,680
an unwillingness to be ordinary and a desire to challenge yourself.

372
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,319
The salary is pretty high.

373
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,640
How much?

374
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,079
A base salary of ten thousand.

375
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:19,920
That's not including commission.

376
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:21,799
A base salary of ten thousand.

377
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,039
That's more than we get in the police force.

378
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,359
You two

379
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,079
should go apply.

380
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,000
Boss, I think the police force is pretty good.

381
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,519
Yeah.

382
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,880
Go apply.

383
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,240
Don't joke around, boss.

384
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm not joking.

385
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,839
Aren't we looking for Huzi?

386
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,920
I can ask around and find out.

387
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,519
If you ask,

388
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,680
do you think they'll tell you the truth?

389
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,599
Boss, can we discuss this a bit more?

390
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,640
Besides, if the two of us go,

391
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,279
we can't really be waiters, right?

392
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm not asking you to be waiters.

393
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,200
Then...

394
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,519
Apply for supervisor.

395
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,000
Boss, supervisor isn't suitable either.

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Don't, don't mess around.

397
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
We're doing just fine as police officers.

398
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,240
No need to discuss.

399
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,119
Go take care of it right now.

400
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,880
Clothing fee is 580, business card fee is 50.

401
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
Health certificate costs 30.

402
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,799
There's also a training fee of 480.

403
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,279
In a bit, everyone will go with me to pay the fees.

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Excuse me, miss.

405
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,279
I have a question.

406
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,279
Can we get a receipt?

407
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,720
First, you'll go in for training.

408
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,279
After training, you'll start working right away.

409
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Consider it a probation period.

410
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,640
Follow him.

411
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,880
You, you, you.

412
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,759
You stay.

413
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,559
Actor.

414
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,799
Actor.

415
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,960
Actor.

416
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,519
Actor.

417
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,839
Actor.

418
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,359
Actor.

419
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Actor.

420
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:03,960
Okay.

421
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:04,960
Actor.

422
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,279
Actor

423
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,480
Everyone, remember these two words

424
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,119
and engrave them deeply in your mind

425
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,000
Because

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,359
we are actors

427
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,559
Everyone here

428
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,960
will become an outstanding actor in the future

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,640
An outstanding actor

430
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,079
Smile

431
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,880
Keep a smile on your face at all times

432
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,640
Hide your intentions deep in your heart

433
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,799
As for your intention

434
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
in acting theory, it's also called

435
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,519
action, or the highest objective

436
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,039
Action has three elements

437
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,000
What is it, why, and how to do it

438
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,640
This

439
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
is mentioned in Stanislavski's

440
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,480
"An Actor's Work on Himself"

441
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,160
I won't go into detail about it today

442
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,480
After class, everyone go to logistics to get a copy

443
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,039
Alright

444
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,839
Okay, okay

445
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,279
Now, let's get back to talking about actors

446
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,839
An actor's job is to fully

447
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,240
and perfectly interpret different roles, right?

448
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,039
Right

449
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,240
So our job

450
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,599
is to use our different sides

451
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,000
to deal with different customers

452
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,880
Remember

453
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,440
No customer will cater to your temper

454
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,720
Your feelings are not important

455
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,200
The customer's feelings are the most important

456
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,839
In everything

457
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,240
think from the customer's perspective

458
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,200
Understand?

459
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,920
Understood

460
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,400
Good

461
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,519
Come, sit here.

462
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Friend, where are you from?

463
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,920
Where are you from?

464
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
My hometown is Guangdong.

465
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,640
Kai, I've brought the person to you.

466
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,039
Thank you, dear.

467
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,799
I'm leaving.

468
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,359
Take off your jacket.

469
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,759
Cross your hands and raise them above your head.

470
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,359
Not bad.

471
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,599
Thank you.

472
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,559
My name is Ma Kai.

473
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,960
My name is Xia Tian.

474
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,559
Xia Tian.

475
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,279
Yes.

476
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,039
Xia Tian.

477
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Yes.

478
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,039
Are you sick?

479
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,359
I get a physical every six months.

480
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,519
Why did you come here?

481
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,960
To make money.

482
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,240
If you want to make money, this is the right place.

483
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,559
How about this, don't work as a waiter anymore.

484
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:34,759
Work with me.

485
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:35,880
Okay.

486
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,200
It won't take long.

487
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,400
Then you can buy a real one.

488
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,759
That's great.

489
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,559
Come.

490
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
You can borrow anything here.

491
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,559
But you can only borrow two items at a time.

492
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,240
You have to pay a deposit each time.

493
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,640
Pick whatever you like.

494
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,039
Go ahead.

495
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,759
Just these two.

496
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,920
Alright, I'll take you to pick out some clothes.

497
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Have you studied acting?

498
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,559
No, I haven't.

499
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,759
It's okay, I'll teach you.

500
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,000
Brother Kai

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,640
Let's get to work.

502
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,279
Okay.

503
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,240
Come on, please.

504
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,720
Let's not be so tense, alright?

505
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,599
Be a bit more natural.

506
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,599
Okay.

507
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,599
That's the right state.

508
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,960
Hold it, hold it. Good.

509
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
Let's do another set of that.

510
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,400
Come on, look at me.

511
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,359
Yes, good, right leg.

512
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,599
Good, face forward.

513
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,720
Okay.

514
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,359
Alright, I think we got it. That's a wrap.

515
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,400
Oh, and later, send him a digital copy.

516
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,799
You should also post it online yourself.

517
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,480
Okay.

518
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,200
This is great.

519
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,640
Brother Kai

520
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,599
What are we going to use these photos for?

521
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,039
To help promote you.

522
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,200
Otherwise, who would know about you?

523
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
See, isn't this great?

524
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,599
Xia Tian

525
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,319
I believe in you.

526
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,640
Thank you, Brother Kai.

527
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
Don't forget about me when you make it big.

528
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,039
Definitely, definitely.

529
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,799
I'll give you a gift.

530
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,319
If I become rich and successful,

531
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,039
I won't forget you.

532
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:19,880
You...

533
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
Stop eating and come with me.

534
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,160
You, you

535
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Come with me

536
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
Manager, manager

537
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,480
Um

538
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,599
Can you assign me some work?

539
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,279
I'm a pretty energetic guy

540
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,880
You, take the mop

541
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Someone threw up next door, go clean it up

542
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,319
(Smiles)

543
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,240
Kai

544
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,759
Okay

545
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,200
Lisa

546
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,519
Ma Kai

547
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,240
Long time no see

548
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,200
I missed you so much

549
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,759
It's been a while

550
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,680
You haven't come for so long

551
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,759
I've missed you like crazy

552
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,880
I've missed you so much

553
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,960
Alright, I'll get you a bottle of wine

554
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,880
Thank you, okay

555
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,960
This is my cousin

556
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,519
He's in charge of this room today

557
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,359
He's got a great figure

558
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,680
Really?

559
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,839
Lisa

560
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,720
Hello, Lisa

561
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,039
Come here, what are you standing there for?

562
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,640
Come, Xia Tian, sit here

563
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Pour a drink for your sister

564
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,880
Okay, okay

565
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,400
Thank you, Kai

566
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,839
Sit next to me

567
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,759
I'll go get busy

568
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,039
Call me if you need anything

569
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,480
Alright, go ahead

570
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,079
Go pick a song

571
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,920
Sing a song

572
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,200
Go, go sing

573
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,880
Come on, come on

574
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,160
Sit here.

575
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,079
Ladies, have a drink.

576
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,279
You're Xia Tian's little brother, right?

577
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,039
Come on, that's right.

578
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:18,880
Have a drink with me.

579
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,119
Um, I’m allergic to alcohol, I can’t drink.

580
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,119
Allergic to alcohol?

581
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,920
You work in this business and can’t drink?

582
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,599
Then why are you here? Drink.

583
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,359
I really can’t drink.

584
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,720
But I can pour drinks.

585
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
I can pour drinks.

586
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,400
I have a special skill—pouring drinks.

587
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,920
But it’s different from others.

588
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,319
Come on, let’s watch the show, let’s watch the show.

589
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,400
He’s going to perform, he’s going to perform!

590
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,359
This is the final step.

591
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,240
Okay.

592
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,880
Drink up, drink up! This is strong stuff, come on.

593
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,559
Okay.

594
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Come, over here, over here.

595
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,960
Come find me next time, okay?

596
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,519
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

597
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,960
Come on, take it slow, slow down.

598
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
Slow down, take it easy.

599
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,559
Slow down.

600
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,319
Alright.

601
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,480
Ladies, come again next time.

602
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,039
Yes.

603
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,079
Yes.

604
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,000
I miss you very much.

605
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:46,640
Alright, good night, dear.

606
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,039
Kai.

607
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,319
What accent are you speaking with?

608
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,680
Why does it keep changing?

609
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,279
It’s just for the role.

610
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,039
I’m learning a lot.

611
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,680
Don't think it's too little.

612
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,839
No, not at all. Whatever you give is fine.

613
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Thank you, Kai.

614
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,640
Let me tell you, Xia Tian,

615
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,440
I really have high hopes for you.

616
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,640
Thank you, Kai.

617
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,160
Kai,

618
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,599
You see, I just got here.

619
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,319
There are a lot of rules here I don't quite understand yet.

620
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,519
You're usually busy.

621
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,680
Could you maybe find someone experienced

622
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,279
to guide me more?

623
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,359
I want to learn more.

624
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,680
I really like hardworking people like you.

625
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,160
How about this:

626
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,279
Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to someone.

627
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,279
Really?

628
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,160
Thank you, Kai. Thank you!

629
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,400
Go ahead.

630
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,599
I'm heading back.

631
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,440
Good luck!

632
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,160
You got this!

633
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,319
Bye, Kai.

634
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,000
Bye.

635
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,759
Hello, Xi. Are you free tomorrow?

636
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,640
Bend your leg a bit more.

637
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,680
Okay, stand up.

638
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,960
Bend down, bend down.

639
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,039
I've told you a hundred times.

640
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,839
Don't you understand?

641
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,079
Watch your expression.

642
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,480
Everyone, pay attention to your back position.

643
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,599
Xi-ge.

644
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:11,079
Kai-ge.

645
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,559
Xi-ge.

646
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
Kai-ge, Kai-ge.

647
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:13,240
Xi-ge.

648
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,720
Kai-ge.

649
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,279
Let me bow to you, Xi-ge.

650
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,480
Kai-ge, you shouldn't do that.

651
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,960
Xi-ge's temper is getting worse.

652
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,279
I learned it from you.

653
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,519
Gently swirl the wine glass.

654
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,559
Look straight ahead.

655
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,160
Not bad.

656
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,319
Pretty good, huh?

657
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,640
The conditions are all quite good.

658
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,839
I didn't embarrass you, did I?

659
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,440
Let me introduce you to someone even better.

660
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,319
Call Brother Xi.

661
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:35,839
Brother Xi.

662
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,880
Louder.

663
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,799
Brother Xi.

664
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,519
I-I'm called Xia Tian.

665
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,319
So, what do you think? Not bad, right?

666
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,200
You have good taste, what else can I say?

667
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,559
Let me tell you, your Brother Xi is amazing.

668
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,960
He dumped me back in the day.

669
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,079
Look how big his business is now.

670
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,680
So many success stories.

671
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,519
Learn well from your Brother Xi.

672
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,279
Brother Xi, please guide me in the future.

673
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,880
No need to talk about guidance.

674
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,720
Tomorrow, I'll bring a few guys.

675
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,640
We'll help you out, make a good showing.

676
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,960
Thank you so much, Brother Xi.

677
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,680
Brother Xi.

678
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,000
I'll give you my contact info in a bit.

679
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,519
If you need anything, just let me know anytime.

680
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,279
No need.

681
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,279
Tomorrow night at eight.

682
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
Wait for me at the entrance of Sai Li Ya.

683
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,079
Alright, alright, thank you, Brother Xi.

684
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,119
Alright then, I'm heading out.

685
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,079
Go ahead, Brother Kai.

686
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,680
You make so much money, buy a real one.

687
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,079
I'm waiting for you to give me one.

688
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,240
Wait for me, go find your partner.

689
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,319
I'm leaving.

690
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,559
Do you still need me to walk you out?

691
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,240
I'm leaving, Brother Xi.

692
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,960
Take care, Brother Kai.

693
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,599
Sis.

694
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,240
Alright, everyone, let's do it again.

695
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,720
Finally, we need to taste its flavor.

696
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,839
Master, it's me.

697
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,079
It's not locked.

698
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,359
Master, I found Huzi.

699
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,079
Tomorrow.

700
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,880
Master, there was a burglar in your house.

701
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,720
Turn off the light.

702
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:05,839
Hu.

703
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,840
Let me help you clean up first.

704
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,599
You're back.

705
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,119
Come in, come in!

706
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,639
Look.

707
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,079
Vacuum cleaner.

708
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,719
I've liked this for a long time.

709
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,679
How did you know?

710
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,960
How could I not know what you like?

711
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,840
It's a waste of money.

712
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,480
Whenever you're upset, you like to clean the house.

713
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,599
Having a robot to help can lighten your load.

714
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,880
I'm not upset.

715
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,199
Oh right, Master.

716
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,960
I found Huzi.

717
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,079
Are we picking tomorrow?

718
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,119
Yes.

719
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Okay.

720
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,239
Wait, Master, where are you going?

721
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:17,800
No.

722
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,599
Two groups

723
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,760
Each group has its own leader in charge

724
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,239
Altogether, there are about twenty people

725
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,280
Since new people join every day

726
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,599
the number of people isn't fixed

727
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,960
It's said that at its peak

728
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,159
the total number

729
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,679
couldn't even fit into three private rooms

730
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,400
Also, these people aren't officially employed

731
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,559
and they don't sign any contracts

732
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,719
Between the company and the workers

733
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,800
it's a very loose kind of partnership

734
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,280
And regardless of appearance

735
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,199
education level

736
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,199
or experience

737
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,760
as long as you pay the required fees

738
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,199
the company basically doesn't care anymore

739
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,239
How's the business?

740
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,239
The business

741
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:50,840
Every day, they

742
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,679
collect several thousand yuan in recruitment fees

743
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,679
which adds up to over a hundred thousand a month

744
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,639
and that's not even counting what they make at nightclubs

745
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,039
They have lots of cash

746
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,519
They don't give receipts or invoices

747
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,039
and don't provide anything

748
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,039
that can prove the employees' identities

749
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,679
Even if these job seekers

750
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,119
realize they've been scammed

751
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,639
and report it to the labor department or the police

752
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,800
if you don't provide evidence

753
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
there's nothing they can do about it

754
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,760
But I've recorded all of this on video

755
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,119
That's great

756
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,480
What time is the meeting with that guy called Huzi?

757
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,440
Tonight at eight.

758
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,280
Eight o'clock.

759
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,079
Alright.

760
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,639
I'll quickly report to the bureau.

761
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,280
You two go over first and keep them steady.

762
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,599
Understood.

763
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,440
I'll lead the team tonight.

764
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,519
Let's try to clean this place up completely.

765
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,599
You two have just one task.

766
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,079
Keep a close watch on Huzi.

767
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,000
Don't let him get away no matter what.

768
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,199
Understood. Okay.

769
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Where's your master?

770
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,840
Master? I just saw him a moment ago.

771
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,639
He's not answering his phone either.

772
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,400
What's going on with him?

773
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,280
Maybe he had something to take care of.

774
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,239
Right, Captain Huang.

775
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,400
There's something important.

776
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:48,639
This.

777
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,360
What's this?

778
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,599
Earned it yesterday.

779
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,760
You made this much?

780
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,639
He taught me well.

781
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,559
I only made twenty.

782
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,840
Go, go, don't embarrass yourself.

783
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,800
Take it and get a taxi.

784
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,360
Look at him. Thank you, Captain Huang.

785
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,440
Captain Huang, we'll head out now.

786
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,039
Go ahead.

787
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,320
Sorry.

788
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,559
The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

789
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,880
Please try again later.

790
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,840
Hello?

791
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
You two can just go.

792
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:47,559
I won't be going.

793
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Cheers

794
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,039
Maybe I

795
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,000
Okay

796
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,280
Okay, well sung

797
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,840
Well sung, Tiger

798
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,440
Well sung

799
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,239
Don't move, don't move, don't move

800
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,280
Everyone, don't move

801
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Hands on your head

802
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,039
Squat down

803
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,239
Don't move, squat down

804
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,440
Squat down, squat down, behave

805
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,440
Squat down, behave

806
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,239
Squat down, hands on your head

807
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:39,239
Look up

808
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,639
Look up, watch closely

809
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,760
What's your name

810
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,440
Speak

811
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,159
What's your name

812
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,920
Cheng Xi

813
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,960
That's him, go, take him away

814
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Everyone out

815
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,239
Hands on your head, walk out

816
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:49,840
Go, go, go

817
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Hurry up

818
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,239
Take them all away, go

819
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:51,800
Go

820
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,239
Hurry up.

821
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,119
You handled this case well.

822
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,199
You two, organize these materials.

823
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,280
Get ready for the handover.

824
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,000
No problem.

825
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,800
It's mainly because Captain Huang gave good guidance.

826
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,280
That's right.

827
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,719
Oh, stop it.

828
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,639
You sure know how to talk.

829
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,159
Our mentor said—

830
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,360
Wait, wait.

831
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,039
What did he say this time?

832
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,079
He said the two of us should interrogate Huzi.

833
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,239
He wants you two to interrogate Huzi?

834
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,760
Where is he?

835
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:22,960
The two of us can handle the interrogation.

836
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,360
Captain Huang, give us a chance.

837
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,760
Yeah.

838
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,079
I'll give you two a chance.

839
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,199
So I don't need to care where he is, right?

840
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Let me tell you something.

841
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,199
You two can do the interrogation.

842
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,800
But you must inform your mentor first.

843
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,960
Tell him to immediately

844
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,679
come to the team and report to me.

845
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,719
Okay.

846
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,079
Right away.

847
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,079
Understood, Captain Huang.

848
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,639
Go ahead, talk.

849
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,559
Talk about what?

850
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,960
What do you want me to say?

851
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
There's nothing to say.

852
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,079
Didn't you guys already catch me?

853
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,599
You have other things going on, right?

854
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,960
No, nothing else.

855
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,199
Aren't you going to talk about Guo Rui?

856
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,559
Didn't she drop the case?

857
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:33,960
What about Zheng Xiaomeng?

858
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,360
She thought she was dating you.

859
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,000
But you ended up raiding her place.

860
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,360
And Dong Chunni.

861
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
The one who studies folk music.

862
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,239
When are you going to pay back the money you owe her?

863
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,760
You guys really dig up everything.

864
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,880
I never said I wouldn't pay her back.

865
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,400
They never came to ask me for it.

866
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,039
Alright.

867
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,000
She lent you that five thousand yuan.

868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,360
She wanted you to deal with her advisor.

869
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,880
You took the money too.

870
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,320
So why did you run away?

871
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,199
I chickened out.

872
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,719
Talk.

873
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,000
When did you go?

874
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,960
What time did you go?

875
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,559
Not going to say, huh?

876
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,719
Alright, then think about it carefully.

877
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,800
Whenever you remember, that's when we'll talk.

878
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
If you can't remember, don't leave.

879
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,159
Captain Huang.

880
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,239
We got their home address.

881
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,280
Should we search it?

882
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,039
Alright, you guys go check it out.

883
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,960
Don't miss any clues.

884
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,880
Search thoroughly.

885
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,679
Okay, thank you.

886
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,199
Are you sure the blood on this knife isn't human?

887
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,679
If it's not human blood, then it's chicken blood.

888
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,840
We've already investigated everything.

889
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,679
You really checked it thoroughly?

890
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,119
Interrogate this Huzi one more time.

891
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,239
You can go back.

892
00:41:59,239 --> 00:41:59,960
You go back first.

893
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,639
Okay.

894
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:12,719
Wake up.

895
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,559
Have some water.

896
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,400
So, what exactly do you want to know?

897
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,119
Can't you just ask directly?

898
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
You've got me all confused.

899
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,719
Going back and forth like this.

900
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,440
Isn't it just about the money from those women?

901
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,199
Besides, don't you already know the situation?

902
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,840
What we know is our business.

903
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,000
What you confess is your business.

904
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,800
They're two different things.

905
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,880
Right.

906
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,840
Yes, I did take their money.

907
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,079
But I didn't deceive them.

908
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,119
They spent money.

909
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,559
I made them happy.

910
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,519
I did things for them.

911
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,039
What's wrong with that?

912
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,119
Honestly,

913
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,400
I'm actually the victim here.

914
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,039
Didn't you ask me when you arrested me

915
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,119
why I resisted so strongly?

916
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:52,639
I'll tell you the truth.

917
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,280
I was tricked by someone.

918
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,800
You brought me here,

919
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,440
so I can't go out and find them.

920
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,000
As for this Professor Yang,

921
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,320
I don't know anything.
