1
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,920
I really have to thank you.

2
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,519
If you hadn't spoken up last time,

3
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,239
about that lousy company,

4
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,760
hiring a lousy security guard, and not minding that my brother had been in prison,

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,840
I'll drink this for my little brother.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,519
Watch me.

7
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,879
No need to thank me, no need.

8
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,840
That kid is hardworking and wants to learn.

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,400
No one can stop that, right?

10
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,640
Not like young people these days.

11
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,439
They have no direction.

12
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,239
What do you mean by that?

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,239
Just a couple of days ago,

14
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,239
a kid from the art academy, doing fine,

15
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,920
got stabbed to death.

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,239
What kind of thing is that?

17
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,759
I heard about that.

18
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,319
Do you know him?

19
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,120
I wouldn't dare to.

20
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,560
That kid,

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
studied art.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,639
Those art students,

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
they're different people day and night.

24
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,960
What do you mean?

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,400
They draw nudes during the day,

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,479
and hang out in nightclubs at night.

27
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,000
Eat, then dance, then drink.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
They live better than I do.

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
My buddies all know him.

30
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,360
Which nightclub?

31
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,360
Mermaid Palace.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
There are so many people coming and going.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,560
In our place here,

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,039
Look carefully, take a good look.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Just answer what you're asked.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Think hard.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,120
I've been thinking for a long time.

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
I really can't remember. Let me try again.

39
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,039
Just answer the questions.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,919
We don't do anything illegal here.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm asking if you remember.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Just answer what's asked.

43
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,800
Let him take another look.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,199
Do you remember now?

45
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,520
I remember, I remember, I remember.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm just afraid of saying something wrong.

47
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,879
So you do remember, right?

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,840
You do remember, so tell us.

49
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,120
He came here, he came here, he came here.

50
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,080
He's not a regular.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,439
When did you see him?

52
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,479
Last Wednesday or Thursday.

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,199
I remember that was the day the alcohol delivery came.

54
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,919
What time did he arrive and leave?

55
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,000
It was pretty late.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,800
Around eleven, a little after eleven.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,639
The group that came just drank.

58
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,080
Was there any conflict at the time?

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,759
No conflict.

60
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,680
I can guarantee that.

61
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,719
I really guarantee it, there was none.

62
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,360
If there was, someone would have come to me.

63
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,520
No one came to me.

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Come on in, come in.

65
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,439
You're back.

66
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,439
Sister-in-law.

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,840
Wash your hands, we'll eat soon.

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,879
Sister-in-law, let me help you.

69
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,439
Master's wife.

70
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,360
Master, please change your shoes.

71
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,879
Take that dish out, please.

72
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,159
You made so many dishes, Master.

73
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,000
Where's the bathroom?

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,719
Over there.

75
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,840
There are dumplings too.

76
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
They're all your favorites.

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,199
Of course.

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,319
Master, please have some water.

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
Come on, give me a hand.

80
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,600
Why are you holding your chest?

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
My heart was beating a bit fast just now.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,199
I might be having a heart attack.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
Master, who was that girl just now?

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
Oh, her?

85
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,360
She's your sister-in-law's colleague.

86
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,920
Her name is Tingting.

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,879
Eat, eat, hurry up.

88
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,480
How are you planning to investigate your case next?

89
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
It's probably someone they know.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,920
We'll look into their social connections.

91
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,319
Here, the braised pork is ready.

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,839
Come on, make some room.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,079
Sister-in-law, you don't need to keep busy.

94
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,360
Come sit down and eat with us.

95
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,600
Tingting and I have already eaten.

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
We just finished eating when you said you were coming back.

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,439
So I quickly made a few more dishes for you.

98
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't mind me, you all take your time and eat.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Thank you, ma'am.

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
There are also dumplings.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
Go ahead and eat.

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,199
What's going on with you today?

103
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,079
Why are you being so polite?

104
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,839
Acting all refined.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm not very hungry today.

106
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,560
Not hungry?

107
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,639
After washing your hands, you're not even hungry anymore?

108
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,439
We're hungry, let's eat, let's eat.

109
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,680
Come on, have some meat, Master.

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,319
Sis.

111
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,600
Who's that boy with short hair?

112
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,120
I've never seen him before.

113
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,439
They all have short hair.

114
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,720
Which one are you talking about?

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
The one in red.

116
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,160
That's Liu Ziming.

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,639
He used to practice wrestling.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
So, the "Ming" in Liu Ziming,

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
Which "Ming" is it?

120
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
The "Ming" from "brightness."

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,040
Where is he from?

122
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,160
He's local.

123
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,319
He's coming.

124
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Help me take a look.

125
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,279
Okay, coming, coming.

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Here they come.

127
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,079
Sister-in-law

128
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm eating.

129
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,639
Why are you here again?

130
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,720
It's not even a holiday or festival.

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Listen to what you're saying.

132
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,839
Do I have to wait for a holiday to visit you?

133
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,079
Brother Wei

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,319
Freshly caught June yellow crabs

135
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,399
I brought them over for you

136
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,560
You can add a dish to your meal

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,800
Alright, take them away

138
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,439
He's allergic to these

139
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,800
Allergic

140
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,319
I just caught these, they're fresh

141
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm allergic to anything you give me.

142
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Hurry up and go.

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Master, why are you so weak?

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,160
Do you want to go to the hospital to check for allergens?

145
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,959
What allergies would I have?

146
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,240
With a disciple like you,

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,519
how could I not have allergies?

148
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,600
Hurry up and eat.

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
That Liu Ziming is pretty funny.

150
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
What do you mean?

151
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,319
She wants to find a policeman.

152
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,399
Didn't you also find a policeman?

153
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,800
I was young and naive back then.

154
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,519
Police officers are pretty good.

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,800
Especially detectives.

156
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,160
Let me tell you,

157
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
it's really hard to meet up.

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,199
But I see that you and your husband

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,839
have always had a good relationship.

160
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,920
You get used to it.

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,720
Is everyone full?

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,720
Yes, we're full.

163
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,759
Let's go out and walk off the food.

164
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Where are we going, boss?

165
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,720
Is the burglary case finished?

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,560
Not yet.

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Go investigate it, then.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,360
Give me a piece of paper.

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,720
You shouldn't just sit around either.

170
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Go through all the bars around the crime scene again.

171
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
Boss, I've already been three times.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,959
Three times isn't that much.

173
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
What did the manager say?

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,079
At 11:30, this group went into the Mermaid Palace.

175
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,560
They had been drinking before that.

176
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Where did they drink before?

177
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,560
Was it while they were drinking

178
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
that they got into a conflict with someone?

179
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,399
Someone was waiting at the door.

180
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,639
When they left the Mermaid Palace,

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,560
they were stabbed.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,639
Hurry up and go.

183
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,360
Got it.

184
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,120
Ziming, wait a second.

185
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,879
Tingting.

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,399
Let Ziming walk you downstairs.

187
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

188
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,519
Hurry up.

189
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,399
Bye, sis.

190
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,160
Bye, brother-in-law.

191
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,000
Take care. Bye, ma'am.

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Where do you live?

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,399
Do you have a girlfriend?

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,039
No.

195
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,039
What's your phone number?

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll introduce you to someone.

197
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,720
I don't have a phone.

198
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,679
Did you bring a pen?

199
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,120
This is your phone.

200
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,559
Remember to call me.

201
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,600
Bye-bye

202
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
Bye-bye

203
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,399
Wow

204
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,879
I could barely hold it in

205
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,879
Master, please slow down

206
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,799
Make a call.

207
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,039
Okay, go ahead.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,480
Hello

209
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,120
Is this Fang Tingting?

210
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,399
Yes, who is this?

211
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm from the Public Security Bureau.

212
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,960
I want to ask about your recent activities.

213
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
And whether you've been involved in any illegal activities.

214
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,200
If I turn myself in voluntarily,

215
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,320
can you give me a lighter sentence?

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
It's hard to say, it depends on the situation.

217
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,519
How about we meet and talk?

218
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,399
It's really hard to get a hold of you.

219
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,720
Can't you get a phone?

220
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,159
It's not that easy to get a phone, they're expensive.

221
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,759
Who doesn't have a phone these days?

222
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,679
Let's stop talking for now.

223
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Here, here, okay, one yuan.

224
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,519
Master.

225
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,519
Master.

226
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,159
Master.

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,960
Master.

228
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,879
Why are you in such a hurry?

229
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,600
Cell phone.

230
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,919
Jindi loves going out so much.

231
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,120
How could he not have a cell phone?

232
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,360
Yeah.

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Why didn't you think of that earlier?

234
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,480
What were you thinking?

235
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,120
Why didn't you say he had a cell phone last time?

236
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,279
No one asked last time.

237
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
What's the number?

238
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,480
The number.

239
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,200
Walked up to the podium.

240
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,639
About to announce.

241
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,519
13602.

242
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,559
This.

243
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
The envelope is sealed.

244
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,960
But the achievements of others

245
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,240
also deserve our gratitude.

246
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,919
Now, I will announce

247
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,799
the voting results.

248
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
The 29th Olympic Games

249
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Beijing.

250
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,159
How much is this?

251
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,559
Two thousand five hundred ninety-nine.

252
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,039
This one is currently on promotion.

253
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,960
The special price is 1,899.

254
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,759
That's good.

255
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
You can put it away, thank you.

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Master

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,080
Why not buy a phone?

258
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,159
What would I need it for?

259
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,360
It would make it easier to reach you.

260
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
Why don't you buy one?

261
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't have any money.

262
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,799
You think I can afford one?

263
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,960
So your wife doesn't have a phone either?

264
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,240
She said a couple of days ago she was looking at one.

265
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,159
I think... I think it was this one.

266
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,879
She just hasn't found the time yet.

267
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
She's that busy?

268
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,759
Does she work overtime a lot?

269
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,879
It's summer break now, isn't it?

270
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,440
They have a lot of students signing up for classes.

271
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,080
How many days off does she get a week?

272
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,840
She gets weekends off.

273
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,559
What time does she get off work?

274
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,159
Usually around six or seven.

275
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,320
She works in the office, she doesn't teach classes.

276
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,000
What time does she start in the morning?

277
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,360
What exactly are you trying to find out?

278
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,200
Just wondering if she has any...

279
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
...hobbies after work or something.

280
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,320
Why are you asking for so many details?

281
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,840
You know your sister-in-law is already married.

282
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,679
Do you realize that?

283
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,799
I know.

284
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,279
But you're always so busy...

285
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,679
Doesn't your wife get upset?

286
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't you think you're being a bit nosy?

287
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
Sorry for making you wait so long.

288
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,519
It's fine.

289
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,000
No problem, thank you.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,559
Thank you.

291
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,200
Thanks a lot.

292
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Could you please check for me?

293
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
Where was this last call made from?

294
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,600
Okay, I'll check.

295
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,039
No. 24, Zhongshan Road, South City

296
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,679
Just call it Wild Wolf.

297
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,240
Thank you.

298
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,799
It's so far.

299
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,519
Can I help you with something?

300
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,840
Around 7:30 p.m. on July 4th,

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,639
did this person come here?

302
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,399
Have you seen him?

303
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,639
I don't remember.

304
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,320
Take a good look.

305
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,639
Have you seen him or not?

306
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,159
I really haven't.

307
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,080
I can't just make something up for you, can I?

308
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,080
Phone numbers don't lie.

309
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,080
The call was made from here, right?

310
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,600
Wasn't it?

311
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,799
Yes.

312
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
But look, the phone is just sitting there.

313
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,279
There are so many people here.

314
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
How could I possibly keep track, right?

315
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,639
Business license.

316
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,000
Wait a moment.

317
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,000
Xiao Han, Xiao Han.

318
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,919
Business license, business license.

319
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,039
Here, take a look.

320
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,360
We absolutely run a legal business here.

321
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
All our documents are in order, don't worry.

322
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,159
Who are your regular customers?

323
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,960
You'll have to ask the boss about that.

324
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,039
So you don't know?

325
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,919
If you don't know, let's go.

326
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,639
Take care, take care.

327
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,799
Thank you, thank you.

328
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,080
Take care, take care.

329
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,279
Tell your boss

330
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,799
that someone named Wei will be waiting for him here at 9:30.

331
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,360
Alright, alright, take care.

332
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,720
Take care, take care.

333
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,279
Master

334
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,039
Will the boss come?

335
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,440
He'll definitely come.

336
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,559
Who is he?

337
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,159
I've arrested him a few times for fighting.

338
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,279
Brother Wei

339
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,080
I just rushed back.

340
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,399
Sorry to keep you waiting.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
This subordinate of mine, he doesn't know any better.

342
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,320
Please don't nitpick.

343
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,639
Your subordinate doesn't understand.

344
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,799
You don't understand either.

345
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
Or what, then?

346
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,880
Why don't you ask for his opinion on my behalf?

347
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
Are we going to talk things out here,

348
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,039
or go back to the station to talk?

349
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Got it, got it. Come here.

350
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,480
Captain Wei

351
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,000
Be honest and you'll get leniency. Resist and you'll be punished more severely.

352
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
Hurry up and talk.

353
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,799
Captain Wei, I failed to recognize someone important.

354
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,839
Tell me, what happened that day?

355
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,319
That young man in the photo?

356
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
I do remember him.

357
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,160
They came at nine o'clock that night.

358
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,279
A group of young people drinking together.

359
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,599
When they left, it was about

360
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,640
around 10:30, not quite 11.

361
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Who were they?

362
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,279
I really don't know the person in the photo.

363
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,960
But there was someone named Shen Fu.

364
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,920
He's a regular.

365
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,680
What does he do?

366
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,720
He's a loafer.

367
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,079
In his twenties, likes to drink a bit.

368
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,400
He always has four or five younger guys with him.

369
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,599
Acts like a big shot.

370
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,000
From his accent, he must be from out of town.

371
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Did they argue?

372
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't think so.

373
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,720
They seemed to be drinking happily.

374
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,359
What does Shen Fu look like?

375
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,279
Short and chubby, even fatter than me.

376
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
He has really bad bowlegs.

377
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,480
Every time he comes, I can tell right away.

378
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,039
Looks like he's riding a horse—okay, okay, that's enough.

379
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,799
Yes.

380
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Anything else?

381
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,920
That's really all I know.

382
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,319
It's fine now, you can go back.

383
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,359
Alright.

384
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,359
Master.

385
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,680
In that case,

386
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,440
we've figured out Jin Di's movements.

387
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,680
First, he came here.

388
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,880
Then he went to the Mermaid Palace.

389
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,400
And then he died at West Creek.

390
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Alright, let's go.

391
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,279
Please wait a moment, I'll go inside for a bit.

392
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,039
Where are you going?

393
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm going to the restroom.

394
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,440
Hurry up.

395
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,400
Waiter, where's my drink?

396
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,640
Right away.

397
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,759
Master

398
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,880
How long have you been stuck in the pit?

399
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,160
Take a look at this.

400
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,559
What is this?

401
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,599
In Shen Fu's gang,

402
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,039
there's one who's the youngest.

403
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,160
His name is Kanzi.

404
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,160
He once pursued a waitress there named Xiao Li.

405
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,000
This is the pager number Kanzi left for her.

406
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,960
Does she have Shen Fu's pager number?

407
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,400
She really doesn't know.

408
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,599
Head to Yuelai Restaurant

409
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,960
Why are we going there?

410
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,319
Shen Fu has a girlfriend

411
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,359
who used to work as a waitress at Yuelai Restaurant.

412
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,960
How did you know that?

413
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
I'm going to the restroom too.

414
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,519
Let's go.

415
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,279
When was the last time you saw each other?

416
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,720
The last time we met

417
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
was probably about half a month ago.

418
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,079
He said he had some personal things to take care of.

419
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,559
He told me not to bother him.

420
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,920
What's his pager number?

421
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,160
1274357062.

422
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,640
Do you know this person?

423
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,880
Yes, we've had dinner together twice.

424
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,359
Do the two of them have any conflicts?

425
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,720
No.

426
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,759
They always seem happy together.

427
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,759
Jin Di can drink and loves to have fun.

428
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,079
Whenever we go out, he always insists on paying.

429
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,160
We can't even stop him.

430
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,680
What's your relationship with Shen Fu like?

431
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,240
We're good.

432
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,119
Really good.

433
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,799
You haven't been in touch for so long?

434
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Miss,

435
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,839
you look so young,

436
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,319
let me be honest with you.

437
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,680
Shen Fu is in trouble.

438
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,039
And it's serious.

439
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,200
The closer you are to him,

440
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,519
the more you'll get dragged into this.

441
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
You might not want to hear this,

442
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,440
but it could even threaten your personal safety.

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If he contacts you, it's definitely because he needs money.

444
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,480
If he finds out we've talked to you,

445
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,119
you could be in even more trouble.

446
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,160
If he contacts me,

447
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,920
I promise I won't tell him you came to see me.

448
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,119
Master

449
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,880
Could it be that our thinking is wrong?

450
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,440
From what Jiang Min said,

451
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,000
the few of them seem to have a good relationship.

452
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,240
Let's search this area again tomorrow.

453
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,279
We must find Shen Fu.

454
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,160
Understood.

455
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,000
Come on, I'll take you somewhere.

456
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,559
Didn't I tell you not to come to places like this?

457
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:03,960
What are you doing?

458
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,000
Go back.

459
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,000
Go!

460
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,559
What are you looking at?

461
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,519
How's your studying going lately?

462
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,079
It's just so-so.

463
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,400
What do you mean, "just so-so"?

464
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,240
If you don't do well on the next test, I won't let you off.

465
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,759
I'm telling you.

466
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,559
Let's go. We're going home.

467
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,599
Take it.

468
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,200
Go straight home.

469
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,119
Got it.

470
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,319
Master

471
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,799
Is she your illegitimate daughter?

472
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,119
She's no one. Stop asking.

473
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:02,960
Hello

474
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,400
On Zhang Kan's pager

475
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
a Chinese-character message appeared

476
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
The message said you all should be careful

477
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,880
The police have already noticed us

478
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,759
What number did you page?

479
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,279
Okay, thank you.

480
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,640
Master.

481
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,200
Master.

482
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Can you stop shouting all the time?

483
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,119
Kanzi's pager is still in use.

484
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,559
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

485
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,599
Where are you now?

486
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,160
Do you still remember?

487
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,599
The place I took you to play when you were little?

488
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,759
There's a trash can at the entrance of the alley.

489
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,839
I've been waiting for you right here, right here.

490
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,200
You passed it.

491
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
Come back.

492
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,119
Did you forget that place?

493
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,720
Why aren't you coming back?

494
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,039
I wait for you there every day.

495
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,799
Are you sure the call came from here?

496
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,519
That's right.

497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,559
Go take a look.

498
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,119
Did you forget that place?

499
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,920
I used to take you to play there.

500
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,119
I've been waiting for you there all along.

501
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,559
Sir, who are you talking to?

502
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,799
The line's been cut.

503
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,640
What's wrong?

504
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:25,880
It's nothing, it's nothing.

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,279
Go ahead and make your call. Go ahead.

506
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,640
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

507
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,240
Grandson.

508
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:32,880
Master.

509
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,039
Why aren't you saying anything?

510
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,680
The old man isn't quite right in the head.

511
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,759
The line was cut.

512
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,960
Definitely cut.

513
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
Yeah, the cut is really clean.

514
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,880
I suspect it was Shen Fu's group.

515
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,799
Why?

516
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,200
They were afraid of being traced after making the call.

517
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,480
So they cut the line.

518
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,839
Couldn't it just be someone messing around?

519
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,400
No one would be that careless.

520
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,720
Master.

521
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,440
I suspect they live nearby.

522
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,720
If they could cut the first one,

523
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,880
they'll definitely cut the second one.

524
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll wait here.

525
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
Wait for them to come back and make another call.

526
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,839
Then we can catch them.

527
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,559
Yes, yes, that makes perfect sense.

528
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,559
Then you wait here.

529
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:11,920
I'll go call for backup.

530
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Alright.

531
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,920
Let's go.

532
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,160
Grandson

533
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,640
Come back

534
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,359
Grandpa misses you

535
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,240
Do you still remember when you were little

536
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,519
when Grandpa took you to play at the entrance of the alley

537
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,759
There was a trash can next to it

538
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,880
Grandpa would wait for you right there

539
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,160
No, nothing else, I just missed you.

540
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,519
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

541
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,160
I have, I have one more thing to say.

542
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,599
It's just that—

543
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,720
Can we not break up?

544
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,880
You're crazy.

545
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,799
You're the crazy one.

546
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:09,519
Don't move!

547
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,119
What are you doing? Who is it?

548
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,000
Don't move! Police!

549
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,759
Who? Police?

550
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,079
What did I do?

551
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,240
What are you doing? Don't move!

552
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,240
What do you want to do?

553
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,920
Police! Don't move!

554
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,240
What police? What did I do?

555
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,200
What's wrong with me?

556
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Don't move.

557
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,240
What did I do? Don't move. Be honest.

558
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,960
I've been out for way too long.

559
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,559
If I go any slower, I really won't make it.

560
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,319
I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!

561
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,680
Mom

562
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
Don't worry, don't worry.

563
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,759
Don't worry, don't worry.

564
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,960
Coming, coming.

565
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,519
Coming, coming, coming.

566
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,160
Alright, alright.

567
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,519
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

568
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,880
Master.

569
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,200
I just asked.

570
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,680
He didn't have time to commit the crime at all.

571
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,039
Then he...

572
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
His mother has a disease called ALS.

573
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,160
She needs her phlegm suctioned every few hours.

574
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,519
If it's not suctioned, she won't make it.

575
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,960
She also needs to go to the hospital once a month to have her tube changed.

576
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,279
If it's not changed, she won't survive either.

577
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,240
It's a good thing we didn't take him back.

578
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,359
If we had held him overnight,

579
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,079
his mother would have died.

580
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm feeling better now.

581
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:47,680
You said you were fine.

582
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Why did you cut that phone line?

583
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,599
I just can't stand people making phone calls.

584
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,200
Why are they so happy?

585
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,000
What are they so happy about?

586
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,000
I can't stand seeing others happy.

587
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,759
My girlfriend

588
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,079
broke up with me over a public phone.

589
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,480
Enough.

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,079
Take good care of your mom.

591
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,160
When you have time,

592
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,000
hurry to the police station

593
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,039
and explain clearly about cutting the phone line.

594
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,640
Captain Huang

595
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,359
It's nothing.

596
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,319
What's going on with you?

597
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,720
Hey, what are you looking at?

598
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,000
Yesterday, we almost arrested the wrong person.

599
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,720
No, no, no.

600
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,640
Bro, you're being too polite.

601
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,960
You call that "almost"?

602
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,160
You already had the guy...

603
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,319
Alright, alright.

604
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,279
This, this, this...

605
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,759
You watched this all night.

606
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,000
But it doesn't solve anything.

607
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,720
You're something else.

608
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
Go find me a place to sleep.

609
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,359
Hello

610
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,599
Calling 9517

611
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:32,960
Yes

612
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,000
To the bike shed at Xinxingli

613
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,640
The convenience store at this entrance

614
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:38,240
Yes, yes, yes

615
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,680
Okay, thank you

616
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,279
Why is it you?

617
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,480
Is your mom okay?

618
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,319
She's fine now.

619
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,599
Here, take this.

620
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,240
I don't know what your mom likes.

621
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,359
You can just pick something for her.

622
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,680
I'm really sorry about that day.

623
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,880
Sorry.

624
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Is the evidence sufficient?

625
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,160
There’s no evidence.

626
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,480
But if you keep avoiding it, it’s basically them.

627
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,000
So what do you plan to do?

628
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,039
Conduct a thorough search.

629
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But the problem is you don’t have enough evidence right now.

630
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,640
And you can’t prove they’re the killers.

631
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,559
If we insist on treating them as suspects and launch a search,

632
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,720
we’ll have to deploy a lot of police resources.

633
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,240
If we arrest the wrong people,

634
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
it’s not just a waste,

635
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
it’s also embarrassing.

636
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,119
Then issue a request for assistance.

637
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,680
Check out Shen Fu’s family’s

638
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,200
hometown situation.

639
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,039
Alright.

640
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,880
The problem is, you don't have enough evidence.

641
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,799
It's hard to issue this joint investigation notice.

642
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,440
Captain Huang, how is there not enough evidence?

643
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,880
Why can't we issue it?

644
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,519
Did you knock? Get out.

645
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,599
No manners.

646
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,599
Weren't you the one urging us to close the case quickly?

647
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
Did I say you could come in?

648
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,960
But we've already investigated this far.

649
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,880
If there's a suspect, why haven't we arrested them?

650
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,559
There's a suspect.

651
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,160
May I ask what evidence you have?

652
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,720
That proves they are the suspect.

653
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,759
Then bring them in for questioning and we'll know.

654
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,519
Get out.

655
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,559
Bring them in for questioning, really?

656
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
Are you a thug? You think you can arrest whoever you want?

657
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
Are you a cop?

658
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,680
If you want to arrest someone, go find me some evidence.

659
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,240
You can still laugh?

660
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,680
This is the apprentice you trained?

661
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,400
Get out.

662
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,160
Like attracts like.

663
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,680
What a mess this is.

664
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,960
Did that tree do something to bother you?

665
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Why are you getting worked up over it?

666
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,720
We've already investigated this much.

667
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,480
And you're still discouraging people.

668
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,720
Who's discouraging you?

669
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,519
Captain Huang.

670
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What did Captain Huang say?

671
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,639
He said not to arrest.

672
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
Did he say not to investigate?

673
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,199
Then how are we supposed to investigate?

674
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,039
What do you mean, "how"?

675
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,239
Just investigate as you should.

676
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
Can't figure it out, right?

677
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,039
Come on, let me show you how to relieve stress.

678
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,280
See that?

679
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,039
It's Captain Huang's.

680
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,119
Isn't this inappropriate?

681
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,960
There's nothing inappropriate about it.

682
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,880
There are plenty of times you can't figure things out.

683
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,719
Throw it, go ahead.

684
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,199
This one?

685
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,880
Do it again.

686
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,360
Just pick it up later.

687
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,840
Please come in.

688
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,239
You

689
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,760
haven't ordered yet.

690
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,599
So, what would you two like to eat?

691
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,360
Sorry to trouble you.

692
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
Please close the door.

693
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,760
What kind of shrimp do you use for your fried shrimp?

694
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
Is it fresh?

695
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,280
Black tiger shrimp.

696
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,480
They're pretty big. Sold by the gram?

697
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,760
Shen Fu came to you again, didn't he?

698
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,320
No.

699
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,360
Did you just mention shrimp?

700
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,760
Shredded pork in Beijing sauce, twenty-eight.

701
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,199
Did he ask you for money?

702
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,320
Would you like an order of shredded pork in Beijing sauce?

703
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:49,400
The food here is really not cheap.

704
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,400
Working hard just to earn a little money.

705
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
It's only enough for a few meals.

706
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,840
It's not easy.

707
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,199
He asked you for money and you just gave it to him.

708
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Don't be nervous, don't be nervous.

709
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,000
Come on, come on, have a seat, let's talk.

710
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,239
How many times has it been now?

711
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,960
This is the third time.

712
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,360
When was the first time?

713
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,760
Probably the third day after you came to see me.

714
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,119
How did he contact you?

715
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,639
He sent me a pager message.

716
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,159
Did you meet him in person?

717
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,360
What did you talk about?

718
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,320
He told me he smashed up a karaoke bar recently.

719
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,760
He said if he laid low, it would blow over.

720
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,400
Then he said, "Baby, don't tell anyone I contacted you."

721
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,559
"Don't tell anyone at all."

722
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,519
After that, he asked me for money.

723
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,400
How much?

724
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
Two hundred.

725
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,039
How much did you give him the second time?

726
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,280
He didn't ask for money at first, really.

727
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,280
He just said to go somewhere to deliver water.

728
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,599
But that still means he wanted money, right?

729
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,519
I really have no money left.

730
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,239
I just got two hundred yuan from the front desk for him.

731
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,159
When was the last time you saw him?

732
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,519
Last night.

733
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,559
Where?

734
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
In a basement.

735
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
But I don't know exactly which room.

736
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:33,960
How many people?

737
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,159
Anyway, he was the only one who came out.

738
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Please write down the address.

739
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,440
Here's what happened.

740
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,960
You don't need to be nervous.

741
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,519
Just go about your work as usual.

742
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,320
We'll see if we can

743
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,800
help you get your money back.

744
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,679
Alright, thank you.

745
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,480
Go ahead and get back to your work.

746
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:01,800
Thank you.

747
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,119
Master

748
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,559
Let's have this stir-fried shrimp.

749
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,119
Let's go.

750
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,599
Not eating? I'm hungry.

751
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Are you paying?

752
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Then forget it.

753
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,880
Cooking.

754
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,000
Going out.

755
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,440
Are you two here to rent a place?

756
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,320
Let's talk about renting over here.

757
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,199
Come in, come in.

758
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,719
You two are here to look at the house?

759
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,039
Are you satisfied with it?

760
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,119
It's great, really nice, very nice.

761
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,320
Let me ask you something.

762
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,039
We're actually looking for someone we know.

763
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,039
Is this person here with you?

764
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,639
We heard he might be around here.

765
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,360
Him?

766
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:05,840
He's thinner than you.

767
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,960
But still pretty chubby.

768
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,920
That guy looks like,

769
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,840
like he just got off a horse.

770
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,719
Riding a horse?

771
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,920
Bow-legged.

772
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,119
Yes, yes, there is someone like that.

773
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,920
He's here.

774
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,719
Yes, yes, yes.

775
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:17,880
How many people with him?

776
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,679
Just him.

777
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,679
Which room did he rent?

778
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,920
The one at the end, on the right.

779
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,559
He's been renting for about a month.

780
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:23,559
Haven't seen him these past couple of days.

781
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,800
But he hasn't moved out.

782
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,000
Do you have any rooms available?

783
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

784
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,599
I'll take one, give me a room.

785
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,119
Alright.

786
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,679
Then, let's skip the deposit.

787
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,920
Come on, I'll show you.

788
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,440
Yes, yes.

789
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,239
Here at our place,

790
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,519
the water bill is calculated monthly.

791
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,800
It's ten yuan per month for unlimited use.

792
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,840
Electricity is metered and charged by usage.

793
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
All bills are settled together on the due date.

794
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,199
As for taking a shower,

795
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,840
it's one yuan per person each time.

796
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,000
You need to finish within fifteen minutes.

797
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,519
This is the restroom.

798
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,880
Remember to flush after use.

799
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,400
Otherwise, you'll be fined if caught.

800
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,440
This is the room, please take a look.

801
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,320
Come in.

802
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,840
Let me turn on the light for you.

803
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,320
Alright.

804
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,760
Take a look, this is how the place is.

805
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,679
Are you satisfied with it?

806
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,559
Yes, it's good, very good.

807
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,239
Okay, okay.

808
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,360
Then I'll give you the key.

809
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,880
Boss, to be honest with you,

810
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,079
this Shen Fu owes the two of us some money.

811
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,960
But he won't pay us back.

812
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,639
So we have to look for him, right?

813
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,800
If you see him, don't mention it.

814
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,199
We'll handle it ourselves.

815
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,159
Alright, I understand.

816
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,599
Please help us out if you can.

817
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,400
Here, have a pack of cigarettes, brother.

818
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,239
Alright, alright.

819
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,199
Keep the key safe.

820
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,920
I'm at the front desk, come to me if you need anything.

821
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,199
Okay.

822
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,360
You take a rest, I'll head out.

823
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,199
Even this rundown place needs a deposit.

824
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,519
What's even worth putting a deposit on?

825
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,079
Hold onto the key, let's head back to the team first.

826
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,880
Let's go.

827
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,280
Liu Ziming

828
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,119
Tingting

829
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,800
Why are you here?

830
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,440
Last time I called you,

831
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,880
were you upset?

832
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,199
I just mentioned it,

833
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,880
who doesn't have a phone these days?

834
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,159
You hung up on me.

835
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,119
Of course not.

836
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,480
I should thank you for last time.

837
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
You really helped me out.

838
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,760
Really?

839
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,000
Do you want to come up for a bit?

840
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,039
No, it's fine. As long as you're not upset.

841
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,239
Here, take this.

842
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,559
What is it?

843
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,119
It's a gift for you. You can use it.

844
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,400
I can't accept it.

845
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,880
Just take it, okay?

846
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,480
Otherwise, I can never find you.

847
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,760
I'm leaving.

848
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,639
Let me walk you out.

849
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,199
Anyway, if we want to catch him,

850
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,679
we have to move into the basement.

851
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:36,280
Stake it out.

852
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,519
How many people does he have?

853
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,239
The boss said it's just Shen Fu.

854
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,840
Of course.

855
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,679
He doesn't watch all the time, either.

856
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,519
Here's what I'm thinking.

857
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,400
I'll take Ziming with me.

858
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,760
I'll move in first, okay?

859
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,559
Just the two of you?

860
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,639
That won't work.

861
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,440
We don't know if he's alone or with others.

862
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,360
What if it's a whole group?

863
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,519
That's too dangerous.

864
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,400
Where am I supposed to find more people now?

865
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,519
Everyone's busy.

866
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
I'll scout the area first.

867
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:01,840
If anything happens, I'll call you.

868
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,719
Isn't that enough? Okay?

869
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,480
Keep dreaming.

870
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:04,960
Don't even think about it.

871
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,280
Let me tell you,

872
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,239
If there are fewer than three people, you're not going.

873
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,440
Why not?

874
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,679
What do you mean, why?

875
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,039
You don't know him.

876
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:12,679
This guy,

877
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:15,400
his methods are ruthless enough.

878
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,039
I'm telling you,

879
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,400
even just him alone is dangerous.

880
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,960
Let alone when we know nothing about the situation.

881
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,119
That's true.

882
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,639
I'll go ask Zhao Dali for help.

883
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:25,599
Go ahead.

884
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,840
Write an application.

885
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,280
Take a gun with you.

886
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Alright, that car.

887
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,559
Go, go, go.

888
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,679
Forget about the car.

889
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,719
Master, how did it go?

890
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,559
Did they agree?

891
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Go back and change your clothes.

892
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,400
Come back right after you change.

893
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:51,719
There are clothes in my team.

894
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,800
Just go when I tell you to.

895
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,079
Also,

896
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,960
Let your dad know.

897
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,880
I might be a bit busy these days.
