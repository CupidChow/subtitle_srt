1
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,599
My mom

2
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,680
almost died

3
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,000
No

4
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,799
We talked her out of it

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
But she would die for you

6
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,319
You say she's a coward

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,599
She's not

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,439
I think she's braver than you

9
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
She didn't even dare to die at home

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Do you know why?

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
Because she was afraid the two apartments would become stigmatized

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
and ruin your chances of getting married

13
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,439
Officer

14
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,039
This has nothing to do with my mom

15
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,400
She doesn't know anything

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,199
I know

17
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,479
I've confessed, right?

18
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,199
Tell us the whole process clearly

19
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,680
That day

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I went to see my dad

21
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,000
It was still about the apartment

22
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,719
I kept begging him

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
But he kept yelling at me

24
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,919
Look at how pathetic you are, Dad

25
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
You're so annoying

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,639
Get out

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,240
I don't want to either

28
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,120
Even if I donate or burn this apartment

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,280
I still won't give it to you

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,439
Just get out of here

31
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:40,960
Dad

32
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,840
Where's the knife?

33
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,560
Where's the knife you used to kill?

34
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,159
After I ran out of the house,

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,159
I just tossed it into the small river by the roadside.

36
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,800
Write down the address.

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,919
Notify the salvage team.

38
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,560
Okay.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,719
Officer, I've already told you everything.

40
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,000
It has nothing to do with my mom.

41
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,759
It has nothing to do with her.

42
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,199
I thought Master was completely done for this time.

43
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,639
I didn't expect him to investigate in secret.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,399
How do you think he came up with

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
starting with that mother and son?

46
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,319
No idea.

47
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
But I think

48
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Captain Huang probably knows.

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,000
We've already identified the victim.

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,319
But the mother still hasn't told her child.

51
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,439
That's even more suspicious.

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,079
So I think their family must be hiding something.

53
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,519
But the problem is, it's been half a year.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
All the evidence is gone.

55
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,720
Just like you analyzed.

56
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,199
If it really is related to those two,

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,879
after all this time,

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
they must have been mentally prepared by now.

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,519
Getting them to talk won't be easy.

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,120
If we alert them and then have to let them go,

61
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,040
it'll be even harder to handle later.

62
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,519
So we have to make them reveal themselves.

63
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,800
What's your plan?

64
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,639
I think this old lady

65
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
is the backbone of their family.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
I want to tail her.

67
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,000
Alright.

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,639
Let's do that.

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,439
Let Li Yugang and Xia Yu keep an eye on the club for now.

70
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,439
You focus on the old lady for now.

71
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,240
Understood.

72
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
What about your own issues?

73
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,439
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

74
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,240
Handle what, exactly?

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
I'm asking you, what can you handle?

76
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,199
Let me tell you something.

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
When it comes to family matters,

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,000
sometimes not dealing with them

79
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,399
might be the best way to handle them.

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,399
Know your limits.

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,279
I'm heading out, then.

82
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
Didn't knock.

83
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,519
Captain Huang, have some water.

84
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,240
No need.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,959
Let me ask you.

86
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,920
How is the Liu Ziming case going?

87
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,079
It's been solved.

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,959
That's good.

89
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,120
It's not just because he's my senior.

90
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,959
You trained all of us.

91
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,480
Thank you, Captain Huang.

92
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,680
Take care, Captain Huang.

93
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,720
Still can get promoted.

94
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,560
Mom.

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,079
There's a letter for you.

96
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
Say goodbye to Grandpa. Grandpa, bye-bye.

97
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,480
Bye-bye.

98
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,639
Go to kindergarten with Dad.

99
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,279
Why aren't you going? Why aren't you leaving?

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,480
The car's here.

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,079
Come on.

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,560
Buckle your seatbelt, Diandian.

103
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,879
Give me your hand.

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,079
Good girl.

105
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,319
What's wrong with your leg?

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,360
It's nothing.

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,519
It's my old problem.

108
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,800
The weather might change these days.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
It's hurting a bit more than usual.

110
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,120
Let me take you to get it checked later.

111
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,639
No need, I'll go by myself.

112
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,600
How will you get there?

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
You don't even have a car.

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,279
It's so inconvenient.

115
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,120
I'll come pick you up after I drop him off.

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,759
No need.

117
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,319
It won't take much time to get it checked.

118
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,839
Your leg has been hurting for a long time.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
What if it's rheumatism?

120
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,759
The sooner you check, the sooner you'll have peace of mind, okay?

121
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,279
Take the child first, we'll talk when you get back.

122
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,480
Go inside, it's cold.

123
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,399
Ziming.

124
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,080
Have you gotten in touch with Tingting?

125
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,519
This child...

126
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
She won't even answer my calls now.

127
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,919
Don't take it to heart with her.

128
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,600
I think

129
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,639
she just can't process it right now.

130
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,360
I'll talk to her when I see her.

131
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,039
Does Mom know where she went?

132
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,440
Would your mom even tell me if she knew?

133
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,120
You go first, we'll talk when you get back.

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,440
Okay.

135
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
I'll talk to her later.

136
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,639
I'll call you when I get there.

137
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,360
Alright, alright.

138
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
Pay attention in class today.

139
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
Listen to your teacher.

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,879
Don't get into fights, you hear me?

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,879
Is Mom coming to watch my performance today?

142
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,200
She promised me before.

143
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,080
Mom is on a business trip.

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,639
Wait until she comes back and perform for her then.

145
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,320
You're lying to me.

146
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,679
Did you and Mom get divorced?

147
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't talk nonsense. Who told you that?

148
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,080
Alright, go to class.

149
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,679
Go on.

150
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,679
Be good.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,639
Hello.

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,279
Hello.

153
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,559
Hello, teacher.

154
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,279
Hello.

155
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,360
Good morning.

156
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Morning, hello.

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Go inside.

158
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:45,799
Morning.

159
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,960
We suspect this is bone metastasis from lung cancer.

160
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,159
It's basically late-stage lung cancer.

161
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,080
Late-stage lung cancer

162
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
Could there be a mistake?

163
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,519
Before

164
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,000
Earlier, my wife was diagnosed with lung cancer.

165
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,399
But after the surgery, they said it was benign.

166
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,120
That's unlikely.

167
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,039
Ziming

168
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,159
It's okay, everything's fine.

169
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,279
The doctor said

170
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,080
to do another scan.

171
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,159
A chest CT scan.

172
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,960
Why are they checking the leg too?

173
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,320
It's a chest CT scan.

174
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Aren't they just ordering unnecessary tests?

175
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,799
Let's just do whatever the doctor says.

176
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,759
The doctor thinks

177
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,879
it might be related to Dad's chronic bronchitis.

178
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,720
And tomorrow they've scheduled

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
a bronchoscopy.

180
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,799
The cough is related to the leg too?

181
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,080
This, this, this...

182
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,679
Alright, alright.

183
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,519
Let's go get the tests done first.

184
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:51,879
Let's go.

185
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,679
Dad, let me help you. Take it slow.

186
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,320
Slow down.

187
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,759
Let me.

188
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,679
Let's switch later.

189
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,120
It's time to pick up the child.

190
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Alright, I'll go.

191
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
No, you don't need to go.

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,519
I'll take him to stay at my dad's for a couple of days.

193
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,120
Are you sure you can handle it?

194
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,519
You've been running around with us all day.

195
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,960
Don't you still have to go back to your team?

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,600
It's fine, I'm not busy these days.

197
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:26,960
Then you should go.

198
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,679
I'll go.

199
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay.

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,960
Mom.

201
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
Call me if you need anything.

202
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,919
Take care.

203
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,879
Drive safely.

204
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,120
You should rest.

205
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,360
Take it easy on your way.

206
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,360
Grandpa.

207
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,519
Diandian.

208
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,559
How come you have time to visit Grandpa?

209
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Dad said he'd bring me back to stay.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,840
What, are you moving back too?

211
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,519
It's not convenient for me.

212
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,399
You go back, you go back.

213
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,159
Why not? What's inconvenient about it?

214
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,519
Why are you like this, old man?

215
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,240
No, what's inconvenient about it?

216
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,399
Diandian.

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,159
I want to be with Dad.

218
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,639
Give the child back to me.

219
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,039
Come here.

220
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Let's go, Diandian.

221
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,559
Let's go, let's go.

222
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,679
We're not playing with him. No, no, no.

223
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,320
Hey.

224
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,519
Leave Diandian with me.

225
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,720
Let him stay by himself.

226
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,120
Coming.

227
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,559
Aunt.

228
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,039
Coming.

229
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,759
Uncle.

230
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,919
Ni Zi, is your mom home?

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,480
My mom hasn't finished work yet.

232
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,759
What are you doing?

233
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,159
I'm doing my homework.

234
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,120
Dad

235
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,559
Dad

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,879
Have you eaten?

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,799
Not yet.

238
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,279
Then play with your little brother for a while.

239
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,759
I'll go make you something to eat.

240
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,120
Are you hot? Take off your jacket.

241
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,480
You'll need this in the future too.

242
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Look, this is my homework.

243
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,840
Diandian, don't make a mess.

244
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,720
Hello, sis.

245
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,519
I'm at your place.

246
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,200
Dad called and told me.

247
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
Wait, what does he mean?

248
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,080
He doesn't agree with your divorce.

249
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,080
If you go home, it means you're separated.

250
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
That changes the situation.

251
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
If there's even the slightest chance,

252
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,360
you have to fight for it.

253
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,879
Wait, you didn't tell him

254
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,559
that right now

255
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,240
I have nowhere to stay?

256
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,960
I didn't tell him.

257
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,039
Why not?

258
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,559
What do you mean, why?

259
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,879
If he hears, he'll have another stroke.

260
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,320
Alright, I won't talk to you anymore.

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
I'm in a meeting.

262
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
Let's talk when I get back.

263
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm hanging up now.

264
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,039
Diandian

265
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
Come back quickly.

266
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,879
Shall we play with the toy cars together?

267
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,720
Get that one for me.

268
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,600
Get me this big toy car.

269
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Hello, the number you dialed is currently busy.

270
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,120
Please wait a moment.

271
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,320
I want to play with that one.

272
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,279
Get it for me.

273
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,360
Which one?

274
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,080
That one.

275
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,279
That toy car is too big, I can't carry it.

276
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,399
Why can't you carry it?

277
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,559
Late stage.

278
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,360
Lung cancer.

279
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,440
Yes.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,759
Mom.

281
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,159
You have to hang in there.

282
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,200
Dad still needs you to take care of him.

283
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,799
If you collapse too,

284
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,200
then we won't be able to handle things.

285
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
Ziming, tell me,

286
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,600
about my illness.

287
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,840
Is it not looking good?

288
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,720
It's nothing serious, just pneumonia.

289
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,200
Stay in the hospital for a few days,

290
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,120
then we'll go home, really.

291
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
Really, really.

292
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,120
Hurry, but be careful.

293
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,519
Dad, Mom.

294
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,799
You didn't even tell me.

295
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,600
I came by myself.

296
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,240
During this time,

297
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,919
thank you for taking care of my dad.

298
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,360
Thank you.

299
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,799
He's my dad too.

300
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,519
Of course I have to help.

301
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,960
Tingting.

302
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,159
When you have time,

303
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,399
let's have a good talk.

304
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,919
Dad, I'm heading out now.

305
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,080
Go ahead.

306
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,679
Ziming.

307
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,840
If you have time,

308
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,919
bring Diandian over so I can see him.

309
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,679
Okay.

310
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm leaving, Mom.

311
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,559
Alright, drive safely.

312
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,480
Master.

313
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,480
Why are you in the dorm?

314
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
I looked all over for you.

315
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,759
Um, my report is out.

316
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,559
Take a look.

317
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,759
Has the weapon identification result come out?

318
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
Yes, it's that knife.

319
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,559
Is that okay?

320
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,559
What's wrong with you?

321
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,480
Where did you go?

322
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
You're all wet from the rain.

323
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,759
Did the rain chase only you?

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,839
Yeah, just me.

325
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Hurry, dry off quickly.

326
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,880
Hurry up.

327
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't mention it.

328
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,759
I just passed by Tianqi Street.

329
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,640
I saw someone jump into the water from the bridge.

330
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,359
I rushed down right away.

331
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,799
I went down to pull him out.

332
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,680
How is the person?

333
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,119
They pulled me out of the water.

334
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,319
I almost drowned.

335
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,480
I was swimming in the wild.

336
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,640
Why do you always do things like this?

337
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,279
I have some medicine here, wait—

338
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,160
I already took it.

339
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,759
Who jumps off a bridge for no reason?

340
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,640
That's so dangerous.

341
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Just imagine if this sport really

342
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,559
became popular in the future. Alright, alright.

343
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,039
I have medicine here.

344
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,240
Quick, mix it and drink some, don't catch a cold.

345
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,559
Oh my god.

346
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,599
By the way, Master,

347
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,200
I just ran into Captain Huang.

348
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:00,960
Captain Huang said

349
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
he wants to borrow the two of us for Dali's team.

350
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,680
Yeah.

351
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,240
What case is it?

352
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,279
He said it's around Zhongshan Road train station.

353
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,279
There have been robberies.

354
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,160
The victims are all

355
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,400
single people walking alone at night.

356
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,799
Several victims have reported it.

357
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,920
Captain Huang.

358
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,359
He uses my people without even telling me?

359
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Well—

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,759
Zhao Dali's team is short-handed on this case.

361
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,519
So he asked them to help out for a few days.

362
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,440
He should at least let me know.

363
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,279
I'm going to talk to him.

364
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,119
Come back.

365
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,319
I've noticed that you

366
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,000
have become so petty lately.

367
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,359
Didn't you ask Zhao Dali to lend you some people before?

368
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,480
He helped you out, right?

369
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,359
His case is really short on manpower right now.

370
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,359
What's wrong with helping out for a few days?

371
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,000
But I have cases on my end too.

372
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,319
Who am I supposed to borrow people from?

373
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,279
You can deal with your side when the time comes, right?

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,000
Besides, I've already arranged it for you.

375
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,759
Well, I think...

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,079
Lately, you...

377
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:59,000
have had a lot going on at home.

378
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,000
And you've been pretty tired.

379
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,039
I want you to get some proper rest.

380
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,119
Recently, the city bureau has been reallocating personnel.

381
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,160
To carry out a very important security task.

382
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,839
I've put your name in for it.

383
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,759
Security?

384
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,279
You won't have to run around everywhere.

385
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,359
You'll just be sitting in the car.

386
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,400
The kind where you eat, drink, and do everything in the car.

387
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,839
Right.

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,559
You call that taking a break?

389
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,440
Isn't that a kind of relaxation too?

390
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,920
But, Ziming,

391
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,519
you really do need some peace and quiet lately.

392
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,519
Don't you think so?

393
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,480
I've been through this myself.

394
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,799
Take some advice from your elder brother.

395
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,680
A lot of things

396
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,599
can only be handled well when you calm down.

397
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,359
What things?

398
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:53,279
Who knows what things you have going on?

399
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,039
Whatever it is, you need to calm down.

400
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,279
Figure it out yourself.

401
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,680
Your dad and I, in this lifetime,

402
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
have always just made do.

403
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,759
But in the end,

404
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,400
neither of us feels happy.

405
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,519
The reason I insist so much

406
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,279
is because I hope

407
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,400
you won't live your life the way I did.

408
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
But now,

409
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,640
having come to this point,

410
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,160
only you can know what happiness means to you.

411
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
All these things,

412
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,440
you have to experience for yourself.

413
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,359
Even if you don't get married,

414
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,640
and live alone,

415
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,039
as long as you feel at ease in your heart, that's enough.

416
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,559
Always hiding like this isn't a solution.

417
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,319
Whatever decision you make,

418
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,680
Mom will support you.

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,279
But I still hope you two can work things out.

420
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm going to check on your dad.

421
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,519
Aren't you angry?

422
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,519
I'm not angry.

423
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,119
Have you all eaten?

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,200
Why isn't there a door here?

425
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Where is there a door?

426
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
This one doesn't have a door.

427
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,720
It's here, your sister is putting it together.

428
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,319
Where is there a door?

429
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,759
The noodles are ready.

430
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,640
Where is it?

431
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:48,799
Sis,

432
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
You still need to help me take care of her for two more days.

433
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,039
Wait until I finish what I have on hand.

434
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,319
Oh, come on, give me a break.

435
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,279
I'm your real sister, and you want me to watch her for two more days?

436
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,839
Tingting's dad has always treated you well.

437
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
You should go and take care of him.

438
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,519
You can't keep troubling yourself like this.

439
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,960
Let me think about it.

440
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,000
If you don't want to divorce her,

441
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,359
then have a proper talk with her.

442
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,400
Right?

443
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,559
You can't keep dragging this out forever.

444
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,440
A lead came in a couple of days ago from Yinhai Community.

445
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,640
They said there was a suspicious motorcycle parked in the community.

446
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,279
I asked property management to pull the surveillance footage.

447
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,480
Look at this part.

448
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,079
This one.

449
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,039
The resolution can be enlarged.

450
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,119
Can you see the face clearly?

451
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,880
No, it's not clear.

452
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,720
Wait, stop.

453
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,240
Brother Dali,

454
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,319
Come over and take a look.

455
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,839
They're in groups of three.

456
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,359
These three wait outside first.

457
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,279
The rest go in first.

458
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,720
Even though their faces aren't clear,

459
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,839
look at the one wearing the baseball cap.

460
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,200
And the one in jeans.

461
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,279
They went in together.

462
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,119
When they came out from here,

463
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
the one with the baseball cap left with these two.

464
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,079
The one in jeans was with the two cars behind.

465
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,680
This shows that the cars all know each other.

466
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,519
So there might be more than three people involved in the robbery.

467
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,319
It's a gang.

468
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,559
And this person.

469
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,720
Look at his movements.

470
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
He's left-handed.

471
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,279
I remember the report from the police station.

472
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,559
The surveillance footage from the crime scene.

473
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,119
That person seemed to be holding the knife in their left hand, right?

474
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,079
Yes.

475
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,359
Alright.

476
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,039
Report it to the traffic police.

477
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,319
No, check the traffic cameras.

478
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,599
You need to check until what time?

479
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,720
No need to check everything.

480
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,839
They snatched things while riding a motorcycle, wearing a hood.

481
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,559
After grabbing the stuff, they must have returned to their neighborhood, right?

482
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,359
They can't keep the hood on forever.

483
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,000
Besides, people like this

484
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,880
often run red lights.

485
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,200
Now all the cameras are high-definition.

486
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:49,880
As long as they run a red light,

487
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,359
there's a good chance their face was caught on camera.

488
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,279
Wu Hai, can you

489
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,279
spend less time hanging out with Li Yugang?

490
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,440
You act like a fool when you’re with him.

491
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,359
Alright, alright.

492
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,519
Hello?

493
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,920
Hello, Li Yugang.

494
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,319
Go to the traffic police unit now.

495
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,240
Focus on checking the surveillance on Wutong East Road

496
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,039
and Yanjiang East Road.

497
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,960
Yes, okay.

498
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,440
Alright, go on.

499
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,319
Why did you come back?

500
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,680
I already thought of everything you just said.

501
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,000
That’s what it means to be one step ahead.

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,319
That’s what it means to take the initiative.

503
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,559
Let me see first.

504
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,519
Here, I’ll show you first.

505
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,720
Dali, let me take a look.

506
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,079
Baseball cap.

507
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Jeans.

508
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,039
This one, I know.

509
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,440
This one.

510
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,079
Yes, yes, yes.

511
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,319
He lives in that

512
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,440
Building 8, apartment 1503.

513
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,400
Are you sure?

514
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,160
I'm sure.

515
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,359
He has to give his apartment number when picking up packages.

516
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,000
Do you recognize the person in front?

517
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,519
It's too blurry, I can't see clearly.

518
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,240
I don't know.

519
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,599
Do you know when these people

520
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,240
usually pick up their packages?

521
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,920
Around seven or eight in the evening.

522
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,400
Sometimes when they go out shopping,

523
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,880
they pick them up on the way back.

524
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,559
Got it.

525
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,480
Let's break up.

526
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,240
Liu Ziming, remember this.

527
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,799
You'll always belong to me, Fang Tingting, in this life.

528
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,400
Even if you die,

529
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,599
you'll still be mine, Fang Tingting's.

530
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,319
Wu Hai, send a message to that security guard.

531
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,319
Tell him not to be so nervous, to relax a bit.

532
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,759
Ask how to relax.

533
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,119
How do you relax?

534
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,000
How? Have him sing a song.

535
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,519
Dancing is fine too.

536
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,240
Dance my ass.

537
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,039
Then just have him sing.

538
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,200
It's just to relax.

539
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,519
Whistling is fine too.

540
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:21,920
Look at those two.

541
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,839
Is it them?

542
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:26,839
It should be.

543
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,400
Should we wait a bit longer?

544
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,559
Don't wait, there's no time.

545
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
Wait, wait, wait.

546
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,519
Master, it's them.

547
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:45,680
Let's go.

548
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,839
Bro

549
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Don't move! Police!

550
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,200
Don't move!

551
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,160
Who is it?

552
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,640
Don't move! Don't move!

553
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,519
Hands on your head! Crouch down!

554
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:05,960
I can't hear you, crouch down!

555
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,759
Don't move.

556
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,359
Get up.

557
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,839
Move! Move!

558
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,119
What's your name?

559
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:16,960
Speak.

560
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,519
Cheng Liang

561
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,279
Zhou Yang

562
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,119
How old are you?

563
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,079
Nineteen.

564
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:20,799
Eighteen.

565
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,160
How many people are upstairs?

566
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,680
Five.

567
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,359
Exactly seven lunch boxes.

568
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,000
Hurry up.

569
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,279
Boss, boss.

570
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,119
You got them.

571
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,079
That was fast.

572
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,119
Yeah, there are two more ahead.

573
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,039
Seven in total.

574
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,279
Aren't you following Zhao Dali? Where is he?

575
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,559
Dali and Captain Huang are still staking out over there.

576
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,640
There are two main suspects left.

577
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
Captain Huang is already on it.

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,359
We're really short on people.

579
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,279
Short on people and you still didn't call me.

580
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,880
Tell me about it.

581
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,839
The two of us still prefer working with you.

582
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,640
Alright, alright.

583
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,039
Enough chatter, get back to work.

584
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:00,759
Seriously.

585
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,519
We're off, boss.

586
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,279
We're off, boss.

587
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,039
Those people ahead of them...

588
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,359
Don't forget to log that list.

589
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,759
Where did everyone go?

590
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,920
What are you doing?

591
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,640
Run!

592
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,640
Go!

593
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,920
Police! Don't move!

594
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,759
Where do you think you're going?

595
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,000
Watch closely. What's your name?

596
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,000
Pull him up.

597
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,720
Chen Tao.

598
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,119
What's your name?

599
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,119
Li Na.

600
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
Who the hell is this guy?

601
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,799
He hits so hard.

602
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:06,880
Right?

603
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,640
This guy shares a room with you every day.

604
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,759
And you say you don't know him?

605
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,440
Shares a room with me?

606
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,000
It's too dark.

607
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,640
You can't see the face clearly.

608
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,039
Exactly.

609
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,039
Of course you can't see, it was filmed at night.

610
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,279
Let me introduce you.

611
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:27,279
Cheng Liang, five armed robberies.

612
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,400
Phones, computers, cash.

613
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
He also injured three people.

614
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,279
It's him.

615
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,559
You're so young and already mixed up in this.

616
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,440
Don't your parents care about you?

617
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,160
My parents divorced when I was little.

618
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,880
Then they both remarried.

619
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,400
No one looked after me.

620
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,119
Go on, talk.

621
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,160
How much did Chen Tao give you from selling the goods?

622
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,279
No money.

623
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,160
No money.

624
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,799
Does pocket money count?

625
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
Just for food and drinks and stuff.

626
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,160
If we wanted something,

627
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,559
we'd just tell Tao.

628
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,319
He would buy it for us directly.

629
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,680
We didn't really need any money.

630
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,279
That Tao,

631
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
whatever he told you to do, you did it?

632
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,319
Whoever he told you to rob, you robbed?

633
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,920
Tao treated us so well.

634
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,960
He took care of our food and housing.

635
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,240
So helping him out with some robberies

636
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,599
was only right, wasn't it?

637
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,200
You kids,

638
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
what are you thinking all day?

639
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,000
You're only nineteen and already doing this.

640
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,000
Who told you to do it?

641
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,160
No one told me to.

642
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,079
I did it willingly.

643
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,119
What's your relationship with Chen Tao? Tell me.

644
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,400
Stop asking, I won't tell you.

645
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,400
My dad died.

646
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,160
How did he die?

647
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:38,559
Brain cancer.

648
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,920
He was gone in just a month.

649
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,319
What about your mom? Doesn't she take care of you?

650
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
I don't need her to.

651
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,319
It'd be better if she never cared about me at all.

652
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
What did she do to you?

653
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,640
As soon as my dad was hospitalized,

654
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,640
she ran off with some pretty boy.

655
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,480
How did you meet Chen Tao?

656
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,119
Na-jie introduced us.

657
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,759
How did you meet Li Na?

658
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,000
We met at an internet café.

659
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,119
Na-jie is like a goddess to me.

660
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,720
When I get married, I want someone like Na-jie.

661
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
Li Na introduced you to Chen Tao,

662
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,480
and you just went along with him?

663
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,319
Yeah.

664
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,440
Tao-ge treats me really well.

665
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,160
He spoils me more than my dad ever did.

666
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,480
How does he treat you so well?

667
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,680
He celebrates my birthday.

668
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,160
Buys me phones and computers.

669
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,920
Basically, everything I have

670
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,200
was bought by Tao-ge.

671
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,759
I remember once when I had a fever,

672
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,279
he tucked me into bed

673
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
and stayed with me the whole night.

674
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,599
Things my parents never did for me in their whole lives,

675
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,079
he did them all for me.

676
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,880
Brother

677
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,240
Did you guys arrest Tao too?

678
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,880
Can you let him go?

679
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,759
He's really a good person.

680
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
Everything was done by us.

681
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,359
It has nothing to do with him.

682
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,480
He didn't—he didn't force me either.

683
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,240
Really.

684
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,720
But the others have already confessed.

685
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,799
They said

686
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,440
you were the one who ordered it.

687
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,519
I ordered it?

688
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,920
That's what they just said, right?

689
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,160
He did it all.

690
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,880
I just felt sorry for them.

691
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,039
Wanted to make friends.

692
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,640
I just gave them a place to stay.

693
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,839
How could they turn on me like this?

694
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
Isn't this just like

695
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,960
the story of the farmer and the snake?

696
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,599
Even though the face isn't clear,

697
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,279
but from the car,

698
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,039
Brother Dali,

699
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,799
both Chen Tao and Li Na have criminal records.

700
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:35,599
Tell me.

701
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,079
Look.

702
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,720
Chen Tao was convicted of theft the year before last

703
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,640
and sentenced to eighteen months.

704
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,000
He was only released at the end of last year.

705
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,440
His girlfriend isn't simple either.

706
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,119
Li Na, a few years ago,

707
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,119
was arrested during an anti-vice operation.

708
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,000
Now she's out.

709
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,640
She has recruited more than twenty women under her.

710
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,720
They use this chat app to commit online fraud.

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,680
Let's go meet Li Na.

712
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,359
Taozi's situation has nothing to do with me.

713
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,960
I don't know anything.

714
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,000
Alright.

715
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,759
Then let's talk about your own situation.

716
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,799
What situation do I have?

717
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,559
Chen Tao treats you well.

718
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,759
Your outfit isn't cheap, is it?

719
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,480
He bought all of it for you.

720
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,480
I bought these clothes myself.

721
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,519
Really?

722
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,359
So what do you do for work?

723
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,000
How much do you make a month?

724
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
There are over two hundred people in the QQ group.

725
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,160
There are three groups in total.

726
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,759
You must type a lot every day, right?

727
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,200
I didn't send that.

728
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,920
Even if I did send it,

729
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,640
is chatting with people a crime?

730
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,519
If you think I'm guilty, then sentence me.

731
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,759
Anyway, I don't know anything about Taozi.

732
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,800
You're really protecting Chen Tao.

733
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,639
I think you're someone who values relationships.

734
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,199
But while you protect him,

735
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,639
does he protect you?

736
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,559
I don't know if he protects me or not.

737
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,320
He's pretty good to me.

738
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,079
If he truly cared about you,

739
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,079
he wouldn't have let you get involved.

740
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,400
Renting these two apartments.

741
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:26,760
Because if something happens,

742
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,000
you won't be able to get away.

743
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,760
You're providing a place

744
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
for a robbery gang to commit crimes.

745
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Do you really not understand this yourself?

746
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,679
Brother Li

747
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,599
Big Brother Li

748
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,400
Look at that expression.

749
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
He hasn't opened his mouth.

750
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,079
If you have something to say, just say it.

751
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,440
I have a lead here.

752
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,760
Li Na has a subordinate named Liu Liping.

753
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,039
She used to be a hostess too.

754
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,280
The two of them were very close.

755
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,519
But because of this Chen Tao,

756
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,199
he bought Liu Liping a phone.

757
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,360
The two of them fell out.

758
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,840
They still don't talk to each other.

759
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,679
This is Liu Liping's statement.

760
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,920
You found this lead?

761
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,679
I found it.

762
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,920
I helped him find it.

763
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,000
I knew it, with your brain...

764
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,119
Alright, continue questioning Li Na.

765
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,679
Or should we let her cool off for a bit first?

766
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,519
Why?

767
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,519
I think...

768
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,599
The interval between the two interrogations is too short.

769
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,679
It might not be effective.

770
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,679
That's true.

771
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,679
Alright.

772
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,679
Then let's let her cool off for now.

773
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,559
We'll talk to her after she's cooled off.

774
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,039
Okay.

775
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,039
Thanks for your hard work.

776
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,119
It's nothing, just doing my job.

777
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,840
I think you're right.

778
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,880
There will be cake later.

779
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,360
The cake you ordered.

780
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,079
Thank you.

781
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:44,719
Don't eat it.

782
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,159
You're welcome.

783
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,920
Okay.

784
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,519
How have you been feeling lately, sis?

785
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,840
I heard you're still coughing.

786
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm almost recovered.

787
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,840
Can we go inside and play for a while?

788
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,320
Where have you been lately?

789
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,639
I don't believe you went abroad.

790
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,360
I didn't go abroad.

791
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
I was hiding out in a hotel.

792
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,360
I just wanted some time alone.

793
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,239
To really think things over.

794
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,079
I've figured things out.

795
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,400
And I've made my decision.

796
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
What's your decision?

797
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,519
Sis, let me ask you.

798
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,840
Do you love Li Wei?

799
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,280
I... actually,

800
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,320
When I first got together with Ziming,

801
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,400
I didn't even know what it meant to love someone.

802
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,559
I didn't know if I loved him.

803
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,760
But after a few months together,

804
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,760
One of his colleagues, Lao Ma, passed away.

805
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,920
He went to the funeral.

806
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,760
When he came back, he broke up with me.

807
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,199
I knew he was doing it for my sake.

808
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,760
From that moment on,

809
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,960
I truly, deeply loved him.

810
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:06,039
So when did those feelings start to fade?

811
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,599
Feelings like that don't just disappear all at once.

812
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,800
So many things have happened over the years.

813
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,400
It's just...

814
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,159
They slowly faded away, little by little.

815
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,840
Was it because of the last surgery?

816
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,360
That's one of the reasons.

817
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,800
I hope you'll think it over again.

818
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,480
Think more about the child, too.

819
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,280
Mm.

820
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,960
I don't want to eat.

821
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,119
If you don't want to eat, then don't.

822
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,360
Sis, can we still be friends in the future?

823
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,840
We checked Chen Tao's bank transfer records.

824
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
Several transfers were made to someone

825
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,679
named Liu Liping.

826
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,800
Who is Liu Liping? Do you know her?

827
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,280
I knew something was going on between them.

828
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,159
He also said

829
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,199
most of the money is with you.

830
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,039
Where did you put it?

831
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:25,760
Nonsense.

832
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,800
He never gave me a single cent.

833
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,079
Even if a meal is a bit expensive, we have to split it evenly.

834
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:32,679
Liu Liping said you've been with Chen Tao for four or five years.

835
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,760
But he still won't marry you.

836
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,880
Is it because you have a child?

837
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,320
Liu Liping doesn't have a child.

838
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,119
What do you mean?

839
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,880
Your son should be starting elementary school in September, right?

840
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,519
He's living with his grandparents in the northeast.

841
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,880
It's not easy, is it?

842
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,719
Does he know what you do?

843
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,719
What do I do?

844
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,119
He'll find out sooner or later.

845
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,519
If I tell you everything, how many years will I get?

846
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:16,920
Grandma

847
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,320
Grandma

848
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,079
Grandma

849
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,880
Mom, Diandian

850
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
Why are you here?

851
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,519
I brought Diandian to see Dad.

852
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,199
I went to the hospital but couldn't find him.

853
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,920
He's already gone.

854
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,000
Gone? Where did he go?

855
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,199
He went abroad for treatment.

856
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,039
They said there's some kind of clinical miracle drug.

857
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,119
I don't really understand either.

858
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,639
Anyway, it's just trying anything at this point.

859
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,599
What about Tingting?

860
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,480
She went with him.

861
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,480
Alright.

862
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,159
You can go back, just leave the child here.

863
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,239
No, no, that's not necessary.

864
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,320
Come on, Diandian, stay with Grandma.

865
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,679
No, come on, don't.

866
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:09,679
Say goodbye to Grandma.

867
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,840
You're leaving?

868
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,599
Yes, I'm leaving, Mom.

869
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,800
I'm leaving.

870
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,199
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

871
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,679
How did you know I live here?

872
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,639
My sister told me.

873
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,320
Is something wrong?

874
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,079
I'm in a hurry to go out.

875
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,840
I want to talk to you.

876
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,840
Just five minutes.

877
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,599
What do you want to say?

878
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,320
Go ahead.

879
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,800
You always say I don't care about you.

880
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,199
I've thought about this for a long time.

881
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,599
Now I know the answer.

882
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,039
What answer?

883
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,599
What do you want to tell me?

884
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,400
That you actually care about me.

885
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,800
You just don't know how to express it.

886
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,840
Because I'm a selfish person.

887
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,400
You've worked so hard all these years.

888
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,559
You're a good wife.

889
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
Really, you're wonderful.

890
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,079
But I don't know

891
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,000
how to be a good husband.

892
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,280
I don't have a good relationship with my dad.

893
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,000
And my mom passed away too early.

894
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,199
My sister is good to me,

895
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,199
but

896
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,400
she's much older than me.

897
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,480
So I basically grew up alone.

898
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,360
It's been like this since I was a child.

899
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,400
Every time I have a problem,

900
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,239
I don't know who to talk to.

901
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,199
Or how to talk about it.

902
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,519
I've let you down.

903
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,119
I want to change. I want to learn.

904
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,519
I hope you'll give me a chance.
