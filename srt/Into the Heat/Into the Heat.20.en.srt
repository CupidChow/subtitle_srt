1
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,040
You don't know anything, do you?

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Let me tell you.

3
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,200
I have all their information.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,359
Aren't you just taking advantage of others being too embarrassed to report it?

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,640
It's fine if you don't say anything.

6
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,439
We can go talk to them.

7
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,560
They're embarrassed.

8
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,400
We can persuade them until they're willing.

9
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Do you think we're pushovers?

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,239
That's quite a lot of money.

11
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,599
How about I add a bit more for you?

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
You know the sentencing for fraud, right? You understand?

13
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,199
A little more and you'll move up a level.

14
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,120
Think carefully—how many years do you think you'll get?

15
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,199
Come on, don't scare me.

16
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,039
This is no joke.

17
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,520
Your attitude is much better now than before.

18
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,639
You understand a lot more now.

19
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,840
We're done talking about the fraud.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
That's a minor issue.

21
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,400
But a death is a big deal.

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,120
What death?

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,439
After you went to Professor Yang's house,

24
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,080
Professor Yang died. You didn't know?

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
I didn't know.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,240
You really didn't know?

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,280
I really didn't know.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,599
Cheng Xi.

29
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,639
Huzi, Xige.

30
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,000
If you didn't kill anyone, why do you have so many names?

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,439
I just use those to bluff and scam people.

32
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,039
What's with the knife?

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,240
And the blood on the knife?

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,639
One time I pretended to commit suicide.

35
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,000
I smeared some blood on the knife.

36
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,240
It was chicken blood.

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,240
That was for tricking people too.

38
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,000
We'll investigate whether it's chicken blood.

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Let me ask you,

40
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,439
why did you go to Professor Yang's house?

41
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,280
I just went with Dong Chunni.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,439
I was just there to keep her company.

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
We've already asked Dong Chunni.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
The time Dong Chunni took you there,

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,599
you both stayed in the living room.

46
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,240
Why did you go into the bedroom?

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,039
I didn't go into the bedroom.

48
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,960
We've already examined the scene.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,879
If you don't explain, you're the prime suspect right now.

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
I... I remember now.

51
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,439
I was the one who went there.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,960
Didn't Dong Chunni give me money?

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
She wanted me to deal with Professor Yang, right?

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,639
Since I took her money, I had to do the job for her.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
But when I went to stake out the place,

56
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,000
I realized that Professor Yang

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
didn't seem easy to mess with.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,039
So I started to back out.

59
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,639
I figured if he fought back,

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
I might not even

61
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,639
be able to take him.

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,560
But then I noticed the old man

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,639
had a pretty valuable watch on his wrist.

64
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,439
I was short on money at the time.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,439
So I thought I'd just swipe the watch.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,319
And help Chunni vent her anger at the same time.

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
If you wanted to steal, just steal.

68
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
Why did you kill someone?

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
I... I didn't kill anyone.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,920
When I got there, he was already dead.

71
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
Start from the beginning.

72
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,480
One night, I went to stake out the place again.

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,480
But I found the door wasn't locked.

74
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,839
I figured at this hour,

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
he should be out for a walk.

76
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,519
Maybe he just forgot to lock the door.

77
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,839
So I went inside.

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,519
I searched the living room thoroughly.

79
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,959
But I still couldn't find that watch.

80
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,399
Then I went to search other rooms.

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,519
As I turned a corner, I saw something on the floor.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,959
It was pitch black.

83
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,839
I didn't know what it was.

84
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,120
I shined my flashlight on it.

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,279
It almost scared me to death.

86
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,360
There was someone lying there.

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,319
The floor was covered in blood. I, I...

88
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,839
I was about to run.

89
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,639
But I thought I should tough it out.

90
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,399
Since I was already there.

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I searched the bedroom thoroughly.

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
I found the watch.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,319
After finding it, I grabbed the watch and ran.

94
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,439
What was the date that day?

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't remember.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
I really don't remember.

97
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,319
Did you go in to steal the watch at that time?

98
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,680
Was the person already dead at that time?

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,079
We will continue to investigate.

100
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,199
Think about it carefully again.

101
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,399
Is there anything you haven't told us?

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I really didn't kill that person.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
I wouldn't dare do something like that.

104
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,279
Was the person lying there Professor Yang?

105
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,439
I don't know.

106
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,879
I didn't see clearly either.

107
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,279
Cheng Xi, let me tell you this.

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,920
There's no case we can't solve here.

109
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
It's just a matter of time.

110
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,279
We'll give you a bit more time.

111
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,079
Think it over carefully.

112
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,240
Is there anything else you haven't confessed?

113
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,399
I'm really not lying.

114
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,759
Let me say this.

115
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,920
Can you stop pretending here?

116
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,120
And just work the case with me?

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
First, tell me what's really going on with you lately.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,959
About Cheng Xi,

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,639
without anyone's permission,

120
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,600
he entered the room

121
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,040
and stole property.

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,439
We've already tracked down where the stolen goods went.

123
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,560
The evidence is solid.

124
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,600
The amount is significant.

125
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,720
It's enough to file a case.

126
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,240
So you're just ignoring me?

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,560
Fine, fine, fine.

128
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's get to the point.

129
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,639
Then how can you

130
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,759
be sure that Cheng Xi is telling the truth?

131
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,240
That's why I think we can't rule him out as a suspect.

132
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,720
But

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,319
he's not the only suspect.

134
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,360
Be more specific.

135
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,759
A couple and two kids,

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,879
living so close together,

137
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,160
haven't seen each other for over half a year,

138
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,800
not even a single phone call.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,759
Someone died in the house and no one noticed.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
That's not normal, is it?

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,920
What are you doing?

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,439
I'm looking for Fang Tingting from Mantianxing.

143
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,240
Fang Tingting? She's not here.

144
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,079
You can't force your way in. If you do, I'll call the police.

145
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
I really have something important to discuss with her.

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Either let her know,

147
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,199
or I'll wait for her here.

148
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,639
Don't move.

149
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:46,920
Hello

150
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Is this Mantianxing Education?

151
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,279
Is Fang Tingting there?

152
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,639
I already told you

153
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,600
Fang Tingting really isn't here

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Where did she go?

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Where did she go?

156
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,720
Alright

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,279
She resigned

158
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,240
Sorry

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,920
The person you are calling is not answering at the moment

160
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,519
Please try again later

161
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,879
Sorry

162
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,560
The person you are calling is not answering at the moment

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,160
Please try again later

164
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,759
Mom

165
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,519
Where exactly did Tingting go?

166
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
Stop looking for her

167
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,039
She went abroad on a trip

168
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,799
Abroad?

169
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,279
With whom?

170
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,679
Don't shout, Diandian is already asleep

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
Where exactly is Tingting now?

172
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,559
Call her back

173
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,480
I have to see her

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
Don't argue with me here, it's useless

175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
Then I'll take Diandian with me

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,159
You take her?

177
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,360
Can you really take her?

178
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,360
Are you even home all day?

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
If you had just taken care of Tingting a little

180
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,039
Would things have ended up like this between you two?

181
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,679
Grandma, Dad

182
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,919
Don't fight

183
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,000
Diandian, come see Grandpa.

184
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,279
Good girl, Diandian.

185
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,720
Ziming.

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
If you ask me,

187
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,159
you should let Diandian stay here for a few days.

188
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,759
Don't worry.

189
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,559
When Tingting comes back, I'll talk to her.

190
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,360
If there's anything, talk it over at home.

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,440
Discuss it again.

192
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,360
Ziming.

193
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,799
Tingting packed a bag of your things.

194
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
She put it over there.

195
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Are you picking it up today?

196
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,840
Ziming, Ziming.

197
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,639
Take it easy on the way.

198
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,360
If Mom were still alive

199
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,080
she would be sixty today.

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,279
This woman

201
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,279
is hard to persuade once she makes up her mind.

202
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,080
Tingting usually seems easygoing,

203
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,519
but deep down, she's a lot like you.

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,159
She's stubborn.

205
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,879
Have you seen her?

206
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,320
I called her, but she didn't answer.

207
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,360
You need to think it through.

208
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,080
What's truly best for Diandian?

209
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,960
Do you think she acts like a real mother?

210
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,840
Then what about your brother-in-law?

211
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,039
Does he seem like Nizi's real dad?

212
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,960
What do you really want to do?

213
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,639
I don't know either.

214
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,399
Why don't you take Diandian and move back?

215
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,240
Live with Dad.

216
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,519
That's impossible.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If it hadn't been for him back then,

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,360
he got drunk and hit the factory director, enough.

219
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,120
He didn't hit the director because he was drunk.

220
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,000
It was because that old scoundrel bullied our mom.

221
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,360
Would I lie to you in front of Mom?

222
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,360
But the day Mom passed away,

223
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,519
he still went out drinking.

224
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,399
Yes, he did drink that day.

225
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,519
But do you know why he went drinking?

226
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,120
Because a boss promised to find him a job.

227
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,600
Once it was settled,

228
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,519
they wouldn't have to drive at all hours anymore.

229
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,919
But that was the day the accident happened.

230
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,960
He felt worse than anyone.

231
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
Really?

232
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,200
Why didn't he tell me himself?

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,919
How could he tell you?

234
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,519
Have you ever treated him kindly all these years?

235
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,200
Since you were little,

236
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
Mom spoiled you, Dad spoiled you,

237
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
and I spoiled you too.

238
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,519
But Tingting doesn't have to spoil you.

239
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,240
No matter what the two of you

240
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,679
end up deciding in the end,

241
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,759
think about Diandian.

242
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,200
Ziming, why are you just standing here?

243
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
They say knowledge changes fate,

244
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
and that's really true.

245
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,600
I just handled a provocation case,

246
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
and my knowledge saved me from trouble.

247
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,440
See?

248
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,120
Hey, I'm talking to you.

249
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,120
Had a fight with your wife?

250
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,720
That's nothing.

251
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,000
Your sister-in-law and I,

252
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,919
ever since she joined the army with me,

253
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,159
and I transferred to the criminal police,

254
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,039
we've had countless arguments.

255
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,200
I've never won a single one.

256
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Wives, this kind of creature,

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
remember, you have to coax them.

258
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,240
If you can't coax her,

259
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,120
get a basin of water, kneel in front of her,

260
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,200
wash her feet and press them gently.

261
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,720
A grown man admitting fault to his wife,

262
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,919
it's nothing.

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,919
Is it more serious than this?

264
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,120
Are you getting divorced?

265
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,840
That's a big deal.

266
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,320
Wait a minute.

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,559
I'll go ask Lao Huang for leave for you.

268
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,840
Take a couple of days off and sort it out.

269
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,919
No, no, no need.

270
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,960
You go ahead, I'm fine.

271
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,519
I...

272
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,960
Why would I ask for leave?

273
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,120
I didn't even have a fight.

274
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Wu Hai

275
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,639
No organization, no discipline.

276
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,519
Now he doesn't even answer the phone.

277
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,440
I can't explain this to the bureau either.

278
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,600
About Director Liu...

279
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,559
Deputy, deputy.

280
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,240
Deputy Director Liu.

281
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,399
Deputy Director Liu.

282
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,200
What do you think about Ziming?

283
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
You know him quite well.

284
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,240
Usually, he doesn't have any issues.

285
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,320
But recently,

286
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,399
he's had some family matters.

287
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,200
You know about it too.

288
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
He and that...

289
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,480
Isn't it just a marriage problem?

290
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,399
Every family has its own troubles.

291
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,039
He should deal with difficulties himself.

292
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,799
If he really can't handle it,

293
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,559
he can come to me.

294
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,840
I think,

295
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,000
we should mainly look at his long-term performance.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,559
Plus,

297
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,200
this case is indeed a bit special.

298
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,000
Captain Huang,

299
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,480
you are my former leader,

300
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,960
and Ziming is my colleague.

301
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,599
But just because he's my colleague,

302
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,680
you shouldn't feel uncomfortable.

303
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,319
Criticize when criticism is needed.

304
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,680
Educate when education is needed.

305
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,319
Guide when guidance is needed.

306
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,039
You little brat

307
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
I've put up with you for a long time, let me tell you

308
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
Now you're even peeking through the door crack

309
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
Instead of doing real work, you're just yapping here

310
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
Is this any of your business?

311
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,960
Can't you do something useful?

312
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,519
Captain Huang

313
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,759
You’re not talking to me, are you?

314
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,400
Of course not

315
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,519
You're the boss, right?

316
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,359
Deputy Director Liu

317
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,440
Let me tell you

318
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,319
Get lost

319
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,160
Replace him

320
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,000
Switching people on a case like this

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
is the biggest humiliation for a cop

322
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Not what you said

323
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,680
What's up with the boss lately?

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,960
He hasn't been himself

325
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
I have a guess, but I'm not sure if it's right

326
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,200
Go ahead, there's no one else here

327
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,359
I think the boss

328
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,000
is dealing with some personal stuff at home

329
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,920
With his wife

330
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,279
Family matters

331
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,640
Haven't you heard him always yelling on the phone?

332
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,359
With his wife

333
00:17:59,359 --> 00:17:59,960
Yeah

334
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,440
Just a guess, not sure

335
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,720
So is the case more important

336
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
or his personal matters?

337
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
It's really hard to say

338
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,160
The boss told me last night

339
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,359
that if we have time, we should check

340
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,559
if Yang Mo has come back

341
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,160
Just call him

342
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,559
We don't have any other leads right now

343
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,759
Make sure you heard everything clearly.

344
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,359
You all scolded me.

345
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:35,839
Hello?

346
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,000
Yang Mo, right?

347
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,160
Hello.

348
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,559
I'm from the Xiangyang District Criminal Police.

349
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,079
Sorry.

350
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,799
I'm really sorry.

351
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,160
Um...

352
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,000
Actually, I came back last night.

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,759
I originally wanted to talk to you.

354
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,559
Sit down and talk.

355
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,079
About your father's situation

356
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
Did your mother tell you about it?

357
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,079
My mom didn't tell me.

358
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,160
But with something like this,

359
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,680
how could you possibly keep it a secret, right?

360
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,440
I found out a while ago.

361
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,480
I knew earlier.

362
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,720
How did you find out? Who told you?

363
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,240
At that time, I was on a business trip in Guangdong.

364
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,920
Our supervisor at work probably heard about it.

365
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,680
They called to tell me.

366
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,119
Your supervisor called to tell you?

367
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,960
So after you came back,

368
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,880
what did you say to your mother?

369
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,720
I arrived last night.

370
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,920
It was already quite late when I got here.

371
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,640
My mom was already asleep by then.

372
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,119
We did talk a bit this morning.

373
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,920
When I saw my mom's reaction,

374
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,640
she was pretty emotional.

375
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:53,920
Then

376
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,839
I didn't say much either.

377
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,839
And then something urgent came up at work.

378
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,440
So I came to the office.

379
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
You went back to the office?

380
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,160
Yes.

381
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,559
How is your relationship with your father usually?

382
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,359
My relationship with my dad is very good.

383
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,480
Maybe even better than with my mom.

384
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,839
And with something like this happening,

385
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
it's been a big blow to me.

386
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,519
I'm sorry, officer.

387
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,079
I still haven't recovered from it.

388
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,720
What I really wanted

389
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,119
was to talk to you as soon as possible.

390
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,279
Maybe I can help in some way.

391
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,240
So we can solve the case as soon as possible.

392
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,559
We've already asked all of Professor Yang's relatives,

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,400
friends,

394
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
and colleagues around him.

395
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,759
We've questioned everyone in his social circle.

396
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,119
We didn't get any useful information.

397
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,000
Except for his daughter.

398
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,839
Everyone else has been questioned.

399
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,240
Then why not ask his daughter?

400
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,799
His daughter is studying in Jiangning.

401
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,519
She's preparing for her PhD entrance exam.

402
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,640
Mrs. Yang doesn't want us to tell her.

403
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,279
She says it might affect her studies.

404
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,279
She said she'll find a suitable time to tell her herself.

405
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,000
What kind of time would be suitable for that?

406
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,920
Is taking the PhD exam more important than her own father's death?

407
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,440
So we still need to ask her.

408
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,720
You,

409
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,279
you still need to meet his son.

410
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,160
Go ask him about his father and the erhu.

411
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,680
Yugang,

412
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,039
hurry and make a trip to Jiangning.

413
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,799
Go see his daughter.

414
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,880
But don't tell her about her father's accident yet.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,799
Just say that there have been student complaints.

416
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,880
You want to understand the situation.

417
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,000
Go ask her.

418
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,480
Okay.

419
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,400
I'll buy a plane ticket right away.

420
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Alright.

421
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,359
Um,

422
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,079
don't forget to inform your mentor.

423
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,599
Okay.

424
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,079
We're here today

425
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,960
mainly because your father at the university

426
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,079
has received some complaints.

427
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
We want to understand some basic information.

428
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,440
Just answer truthfully.

429
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,039
How is your relationship with your father?

430
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,759
Those things your father did at school

431
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,359
Your mother should know about them, right?

432
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,799
How is their relationship?

433
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,640
You can't help someone like my mom.

434
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,759
Really.

435
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,799
You can never wake up someone who pretends to be asleep.

436
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,160
How should I put it...

437
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,079
She used to be a teacher too.

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,359
After she got married, she completely lost herself.

439
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,160
She gave up everything.

440
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,759
She became a housewife.

441
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,279
Every time he hit her,

442
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,240
she would always wonder

443
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,000
what she had done wrong,

444
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,599
how she made him angry.

445
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,359
Even with a bruised and swollen face,

446
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,160
she still worried about whether he had eaten.

447
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,279
Did he ever hit you or your brother?

448
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,279
He hit her.

449
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,319
He hit her.

450
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,880
So your mother was beaten.

451
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,759
You and your brother both saw it with your own eyes, right?

452
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,599
We've seen it since we were little.

453
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,960
We told her to get a divorce, but she just wouldn't.

454
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,240
Even though this man was absolutely terrible,

455
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,559
she was completely obedient to him.

456
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,559
Even though he never treated her well,

457
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,359
she still tried to please him, no matter how cold he was.

458
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,559
What about after they separated? Did it get any better?

459
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,680
My mom went to see him.

460
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,960
She even took me with her.

461
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,759
I saw him raise his hand and slap my mom.

462
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,279
I asked my mom, "What are you getting out of this?"

463
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,680
You don't make any money.

464
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,880
My brother and I are grown up now, we can take care of you.

465
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
But she just wouldn't listen.

466
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,160
She even made excuses for him.

467
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,400
She said every family is like this.

468
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,160
Men are the backbone of the family, they have a lot of pressure.

469
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
I said, do you really have to wait until the day

470
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
he beats you to death?

471
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,680
Guess what she said.

472
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,079
She said, "No, Yiyi, that won't happen."

473
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,240
He's getting older and older.

474
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,559
He doesn't have the strength to hit anymore.

475
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,359
You must be feeling really upset.

476
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,559
What can I do about feeling upset?

477
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,160
I'm desperate too.

478
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,839
I can't stand to watch.

479
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,160
So I just leave.

480
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,359
You should know what kind of person your father is.

481
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't want to cover for him at all.

482
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,359
If it doesn't work, you can just arrest him.

483
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,839
That's the kind of person he is.

484
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,559
He either hits or yells at my mom.

485
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,160
He was caught having an affair at school.

486
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,799
He harassed female students.

487
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,960
It's not some other problem with him.

488
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
He objectifies women.

489
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,240
He looks down on women to his core.

490
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,160
He really has a problem, he needs help.

491
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't get too worked up.

492
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,599
Leave this matter to us.

493
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,759
You just focus on your studies.

494
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,920
Alright?

495
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,480
Your brother—

496
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
How does your brother feel about your father?

497
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,079
My brother—

498
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,599
Cowardice

499
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,880
He never dared to go against my dad.

500
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,839
He would only choose to avoid things.

501
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,880
Did the two of them ever argue?

502
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,920
No.

503
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,839
He would hide as soon as he saw my dad.

504
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,559
According to your sister,

505
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,680
when you were kids,

506
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,359
your dad used to hit you often?

507
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,599
Yes, he did.

508
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,279
But that was many years ago.

509
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,480
I can't even remember why he hit us.

510
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,839
Why didn't you mention it last time?

511
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,759
You didn't ask me last time.

512
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,759
You didn't say it just because I didn't ask? Are you trying to hide something?

513
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,119
I'm not trying to hide anything, I...

514
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,359
I wasn't in a good state last time either.

515
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,559
Maybe I just didn't remember.

516
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,000
Did your dad ever hit your mom?

517
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,640
I don't know about that.

518
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,160
I've never seen it with my own eyes.

519
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,880
Besides, as a married couple,

520
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,079
they would argue and fight sometimes.

521
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,799
That's normal, right?

522
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm not sure.

523
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,079
So they still argue?

524
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,160
Do they argue often?

525
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,759
Occasionally.

526
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,480
Sometimes.

527
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,279
A few times a month.

528
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,960
Once, twice, or three times.

529
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,759
My dad moved out a long time ago.

530
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,559
I don't live with them.

531
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,400
Aren't you clear about that?

532
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,440
Are you clear about it or not?

533
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,119
We don't live together.

534
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,799
How could we even argue?

535
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,240
Why did you say you weren't sure just now?

536
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
Are you clear about it or not?

537
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,519
I'm not sure.

538
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,160
I don't live with them.

539
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,559
We don't live together.

540
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,279
So do you usually go visit your dad?

541
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,160
I've visited him a few times since he moved out.

542
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,599
I've brought him food a few times.

543
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,359
If I remember correctly,

544
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,880
last time you said you had a good relationship with your father.

545
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,359
Then why, in the past six months,

546
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
have you hardly visited him?

547
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,680
Answer.

548
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,480
What do you mean?

549
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
What do you mean, why are you getting so worked up?

550
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,960
We're just asking about your family, why are you so anxious?

551
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,839
My dad is dead.

552
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,160
Aren't you hurrying to solve the case?

553
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,799
Every day you're here,

554
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,119
watching us family members.

555
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,480
What are you asking for? What do you mean by this?

556
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,759
I'm begging you,

557
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,240
can you let us have some peace?

558
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,960
My dad's body still hasn't been buried.

559
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,039
Whose fault is that?

560
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,160
Isn't it your fault?

561
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:07,839
Everything I know,

562
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,160
I can tell you all of it.

563
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,799
I've been fully cooperating.

564
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,359
What are you doing? What do you mean by this?

565
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,559
I'm begging you two, please hurry up and solve the case.

566
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,079
Why are you questioning me here?

567
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,640
There's been progress in Old Yang's case.

568
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,759
A little.

569
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,000
What's the result?

570
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
There's no result yet.

571
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,160
So, you came today...

572
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,680
I was just passing by, came to check on you.

573
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,000
You and Professor Yang...

574
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
You haven't been in touch for such a long time this time.

575
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,240
Has that happened before?

576
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,680
You call this a long time?

577
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
When he was up for a promotion,

578
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,680
he didn't come back for over a year.

579
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,599
I originally

580
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,839
wanted to go clean up and cook for him.

581
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,000
He even got mad at me.

582
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,160
He thought I was disturbing him.

583
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,160
He even got really angry.

584
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,079
Professor Yang

585
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,559
seems to have had an affair.

586
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:32,880
You know,

587
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,000
we are husband and wife.

588
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,960
How could I not know?

589
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,359
Besides, when he does these things,

590
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,160
he doesn't really hide it from others.

591
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,039
Is this why you are separated?

592
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,160
That's probably one of the reasons.

593
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,559
That's why I never go to his place.

594
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,960
I can't bear to lose face like that.

595
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,880
Hello

596
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:00,799
One hundred yuan

597
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,039
Thank you

598
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,599
Hold on to it

599
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,759
What time do you want

600
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,599
The two o'clock one

601
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,119
Hello

602
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,359
One hour earlier than the previous one

603
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,519
An hour earlier

604
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,079
Okay

605
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,160
Hello, Master.

606
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,720
Yang Mo bought two tickets at the ticket office.

607
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,880
We're following him right now.

608
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,960
We don't know if he's going back to work or going home.

609
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,119
Okay, got it.

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,799
What did Master say?

611
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,160
Let him notice.

612
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,279
Let's listen to Master. Let's go.

613
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Sorry to trouble you, Master. Please go a bit faster.

614
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,480
What do you mean?

615
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,880
Stay here and don't move.

616
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
It's been all night.

617
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,400
Why do you think he hasn't come home?

618
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,519
Follow him.

619
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:07,759
Stay there.

620
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,519
Don't move.

621
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,280
Hello, it's me.

622
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,840
I can see you've been working hard too.

623
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,320
Don't you want to know the truth?

624
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,519
I did it.

625
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,119
I wrote everything in the letter.

626
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,239
It's on the coffee table in my room.

627
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,480
Go get it yourself.

628
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,639
You two can go, I won't go.

629
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:51,960
What about the chives?

630
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,079
The chives are six yuan.

631
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,119
Let's call it a day.

632
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,800
Take care of yourself. I'll be leaving now.

633
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,960
Take it easy.

634
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,760
Hello, Master.

635
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,920
Yang Mo bought two tickets at the ticket office.

636
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,239
We're following him right now.

637
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,679
Let him notice.

638
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,840
I know it wasn't you.

639
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,679
Just tell me,

640
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,559
was it Yang Mo?

641
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,159
If you won't say,

642
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,199
we'll have to ask Yang Mo.

643
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,559
Sit properly.

644
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,119
Wait, officer,

645
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,320
why did you bring me here?

646
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,400
No reason, you just need to sit here.

647
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,119
Understand?

648
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,360
Wait, on what grounds?

649
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,840
Aren't you just here to ask me some questions?

650
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,519
Aren't you just here to get information from me?

651
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,280
Listen to me.

652
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,960
I'll answer you in a moment, okay?

653
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,000
Just sit here for now.

654
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,639
Let me explain to you.

655
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,039
Take a good look.

656
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,440
Summons.

657
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,679
We are now summoning you according to the law.

658
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Take a look first.

659
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,639
Then sign here.

660
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,559
Why are you summoning me?

661
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,559
No particular reason.

662
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,360
I won't sign.

663
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,360
Not signing.

664
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,440
If you don't sign now, you'll sign it yourself later.

665
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,880
Not signing.

666
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,360
Talk, tell us what's going on.

667
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,280
What situation?

668
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,559
You tell me what situation.

669
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,840
You bought a ticket, right? Where are you going?

670
00:38:58,719 --> 00:38:59,679
What ticket?

671
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,079
We saw you buy a ticket.

672
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,440
Didn't you see us too?

673
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,840
Just say it directly.

674
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,639
Why did you buy two tickets?

675
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,719
I bought it for a colleague.

676
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,719
He needs it for a business trip.

677
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,400
Which colleague did you help?

678
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,159
What's their name? Let me verify.

679
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,800
This is an internal matter of our company.

680
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
I don't need to report it, do I?

681
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,159
I called your company.

682
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,239
No one has been on a business trip recently.

683
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,400
Are you hungry?

684
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,840
Do you want to eat something first?

685
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,119
Ma'am.

686
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,159
It's not good for you to keep silent like this.

687
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,159
Right?

688
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,159
Sir.

689
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,239
Looks like she's getting nervous.

690
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,079
Give her a bit more time.

691
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,320
Officer, what do you mean?

692
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,559
I still have work at my office.

693
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,840
I need to hurry back now.

694
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,719
Sit back down.

695
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,679
Please, sit down first.

696
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm telling you to sit down.

697
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,719
Didn't you just ask me

698
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,119
what this room is for?

699
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,719
And who this chair is for?

700
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,800
Let me tell you now.

701
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,320
This chair is for suspects.

702
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,760
What do you mean by that?

703
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,559
What are you trying to say?

704
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:41,800
We don't mean anything by it.

705
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,119
I'll say it again, listen carefully.

706
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,920
This chair is for suspects.

707
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,119
You're sitting here now.

708
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,119
That means you're the suspect, understand?

709
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
What do you mean?

710
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,719
Go ahead, speak.

711
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,519
You can't hide it anymore.

712
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,480
Do you know why we called you here?

713
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,440
You still don't understand?

714
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,800
Just say it.

715
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,199
I think if you say it,

716
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,239
it will be a relief for you too.

717
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,800
If you don't say it now,

718
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,639
when we investigate later,

719
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,679
and find out the truth,

720
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,000
it won't just be you in trouble, understand?

721
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,519
Fine, if you won't talk,

722
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,480
then we'll have to ask your mother.

723
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,039
After you killed someone,

724
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,800
you came home covered in blood.

725
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,199
There's no way she didn't see it.

726
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,800
You were extremely tense at the time.

727
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,199
There's no way she didn't notice.

728
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,320
If she found out and didn't say anything,

729
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,599
that could be considered harboring a criminal, you understand?

730
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,840
Harboring me?

731
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,000
You must be joking.

732
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,880
She would never cover for me.

733
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,280
Why would she?

734
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,639
She doesn't care about me at all.

735
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,960
How does she not care about you?

736
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,199
If she cared about me,

737
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,480
she wouldn't have let my sister and me

738
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,039
grow up in a family like this.

739
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,559
If she cared about me,

740
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,400
she wouldn't have let us live like this.

741
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,039
If she cared about me,

742
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,199
she would have gone to talk to my dad about the house long ago.

743
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,000
My girlfriend wouldn't have broken up with me.

744
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,719
She's just a loser.

745
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,519
I look down on her.

746
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,239
A loser.

747
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:39,880
That's right.

748
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:41,920
I look down on her.

749
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,079
I look down on her.

750
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,039
Your mother wrote this herself this morning.

751
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,519
After she finished writing,

752
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,480
she went to jump into the sea.

753
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,320
Take a good look at it.
