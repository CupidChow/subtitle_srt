00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,599
Hello, Mr. Liu.

2
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,200
Were you calling me?

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,680
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
Can't help it, have to keep up with the times.

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,159
The company wants us to learn English.

6
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,879
In case foreign friends come to visit our city,

7
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,959
we can't mess up.

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,200
Where are you going, Mr. Liu?

9
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,560
Going home, hurry up.

10
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright, brother.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,080
Brother.

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,599
Let's go.

13
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,599
Your brother-in-law now runs three branch offices.

14
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,719
He's in the tourism business.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,719
Think about before,

16
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,840
everyone was just driving taxis around.

17
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
How did he suddenly become so successful?

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,919
You have the nerve to say that?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,639
My brother-in-law used to be worse off than you.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,159
You had a license from the very beginning.

21
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,919
But he was working in a scenic area.

22
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,360
He was pulling a rickshaw.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,439
He did that for several years.

24
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,039
He saved up money to get a license.

25
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,639
Now you're not as good as him.

26
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,280
Shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,080
Reflect on it.

28
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Reflect deeply.

29
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,319
That's why people say he's smart.

30
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,960
Brother-in-law, my friend

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,039
My friend

32
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,759
Brother-in-law

33
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,240
You tell me

34
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,719
If someone is your enemy

35
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,039
then they are my enemy too

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,639
You are my best friend.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,039
Let me do a throw, I've been practicing lately.

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,719
Don't do it, you might hurt yourself.

39
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,759
Don't throw.

40
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,240
Look, look, look.

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,280
How old are you? Aren't you being childish?

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
Are you okay? Your back.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
That scared me.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,919
How did you practice?

45
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,159
Don't strain your back.

46
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,639
How did you do that just now?

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
I didn't throw you, you slipped by yourself.

48
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,199
You still remember it's Dad's birthday today.

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
It's great that you came back.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,919
Look at how your brother-in-law made those dumplings.

51
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,280
They'll all fall apart when we boil them.

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Come over and help out.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm not eating.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,919
I'm just grabbing my clothes and leaving.

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
I already have clothes.

56
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,879
My master insisted I come back to change.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
Why are you leaving so soon?

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
You can't leave today.

59
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,800
We have a mission.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
What mission?

61
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,439
Can't say.

62
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,680
Did they make you come back to say your last words?

63
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,479
Don't talk nonsense.

64
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,199
How am I talking nonsense?

65
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,599
That's how it always goes in TV dramas.

66
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,039
Before carrying out an important mission,

67
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,039
they always come back to see their family one last time.

68
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,639
It's your dad's birthday.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
And you're cursing his son.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,759
He's not your dad.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,199
You're not allowed to leave.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,919
Call them and ask for leave.

73
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,240
Just say it's your dad's birthday.

74
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,040
It's a special situation.

75
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,240
What's wrong with having a birthday?

76
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,639
Is a birthday more important than a mission?

77
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,160
No, that's enough, sis.

78
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,399
You're pregnant, can you please be careful?

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,199
Brother-in-law, hurry up!

80
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,839
Yeah, you're pregnant.

81
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,439
Be careful.

82
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:28,800
We can't let him leave.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,759
Hurry up and tell him.

84
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,120
All the dumplings are falling apart.

85
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,720
Leaving now.

86
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,800
Brother-in-law, eat some more.

87
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,319
Hurry up and wrap them, it's already mealtime.

88
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,839
Just leaving like this.

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,560
Sir, please wait for me a moment.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,439
I'll be out right away.

91
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,920
What do you want?

92
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:17,920
Hello.

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,279
I'm looking for Fang Tingting from Mantianxing.

94
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,839
She went out at noon.

95
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,920
She hasn't come back yet.

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,439
Tingting

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,319
You're not at the office?

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm outside.

99
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,399
I'm at the entrance of your office.

100
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,879
Is something wrong?

101
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
It's nothing.

102
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,319
I just wanted to see you.

103
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,959
Um, I'll head back now.

104
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,839
Twenty minutes.

105
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,480
It's okay, let's meet another day.

106
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,319
Okay.

107
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,399
Sir

108
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,199
Could you please give this to Fang Tingting for me?

109
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,000
Sure, don't worry.

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,279
Thank you.

111
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,079
You're welcome.

112
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,279
Let's talk this over.

113
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,279
Can you stop following me all the time?

114
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,480
Why are you following me?

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
You never want to discuss anything.

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
I don't have anyone, no one.

117
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,680
I've told you several times, I have no one.

118
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,639
What do you mean you have no one?

119
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,000
No, that's not it.

120
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,319
Even if I had someone, I wouldn't lend them to you.

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,399
At least you're being honest, I'll give you that.

122
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,759
Zhao Dali, stop pretending.

123
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm not pretending.

124
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,399
Let me tell you something.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Last time when we caught Big Bucktooth,

126
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,240
If I hadn't lent you two guys,

127
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
Would you still be standing here in one piece?

128
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,079
Are you saying you've never borrowed from me?

129
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,480
Hurry up.

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,519
Aren't you a bit old to be acting like a kid?

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,639
If you're going to bring that up,

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
what about last time when you and Liu Ziming took my car without asking?

133
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,079
I didn't say anything about that, did I?

134
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,519
No, nothing happened with the car.

135
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,120
What I need now is people.

136
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,079
Well, uh, this...

137
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,600
Stop bringing up old wounds.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,759
We're talking about people now, people.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,279
Hurry up.

140
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,160
No, that's not it.

141
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,120
Aren't you just watching one suspect?

142
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,800
What if there are a couple more?

143
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,920
What are the odds of that?

144
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,079
My two guys are still working on a case.

145
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,000
I really don't have anyone right now.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,079
Just hurry up.

147
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,800
What if I have to find it for you?

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,600
That's not a person.

149
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
No, it's not. It's not.

150
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,519
Wait a moment.

151
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Wu Hai, come here, come here.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,199
You wash those two hairs every day.

153
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,920
What's wrong, Master? Wei.

154
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,879
From now on, you go with him.

155
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,279
Return it to me when you're done.

156
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,759
Just use it for two days, that's enough.

157
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,319
Alright.

158
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,240
Isn't this a person?

159
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,360
Drive.

160
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,800
Thanks.

161
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,519
You're welcome.

162
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,680
Hurry up, stop dawdling.

163
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,439
Get in the car, let's go.

164
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,879
Master, have some water.

165
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,079
Can you drink it? You go ahead.

166
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
Brother Hai, do you want some water?

167
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm not thirsty. You should drink more.

168
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Are you getting in or not? Hurry up.

169
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Hurry up.

170
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,399
Go get some sleep.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,799
Master, I'm not sleepy.

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm excited.

173
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,000
Really excited.

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I'll get some sleep first.

175
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,759
Keep a close watch.

176
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,960
It could show up at any time.

177
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,480
Understand?

178
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Got it.

179
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,720
These little brats

180
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,200
Master

181
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,879
Cooking here again? The smoke is suffocating.

182
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,200
Master

183
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,519
Let me wipe it for you.

184
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,279
Don't move.

185
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
From 1954.

186
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,120
It's even older than my mom.

187
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,279
Wei, can we stop eating instant noodles?

188
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,360
The smell alone is disgusting.

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,519
After we solve the case,

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,080
I'll treat you to dinner at Wanghailou.

191
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,360
Which Wanghailou?

192
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,639
You don't even know Wanghailou?

193
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,679
Tell him about it.

194
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,679
It's the one with the big seafood tanks right at the entrance.

195
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,519
The place with huge lobsters and king crabs inside.

196
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,200
Yeah, if this batch isn't fresh, they'll swap it for another.

197
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,120
A meal there

198
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
would probably cost me half a year's salary.

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,240
Don't even think about that.

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
Just think about what you want to eat.

201
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Decide in advance.

202
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,120
Really, boss?

203
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,879
You're messing with us, right?

204
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,279
Why would I lie to you?

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,720
I'll definitely treat you, don't worry.

206
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Then I want the big lobster.

207
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,679
Right.

208
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,320
Grouper.

209
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
That's right, yes, okay.

210
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,159
I want king crab, just the legs for me.

211
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,320
Yes, yes, we've all decided.

212
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
Don't get flustered when the time comes.

213
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,559
Got it? Decide in advance, decide in advance.

214
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,120
Boss.

215
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,679
It's been four days for us.

216
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,720
What should we do?

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,720
Just keep waiting, what else?

218
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,559
So we just keep waiting here?

219
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,440
What if they never come back?

220
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,799
Then we keep waiting.

221
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,039
Young master, what are you busy with?

222
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,519
I can't send the message.

223
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,279
You're stating the obvious.

224
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
Can there even be a signal in the basement?

225
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,720
Wait, that's not right.

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,840
Didn't you say you couldn't afford it?

227
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
A friend gave it to me.

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,720
What kind of friend is so generous?

229
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,200
Why don't I have a friend like that?

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,320
Don't worry, it's not a bribe.

231
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,639
Who is it?

232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,639
Probably Tingting.

233
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Anyway, don't worry about who sent it.

234
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,519
They insisted I take it, I couldn't refuse.

235
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,120
You're doing pretty well.

236
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,279
Master.

237
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,080
I'm going out to buy something.

238
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,720
I'll be back soon.

239
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes, yes, I think you should go out too.

240
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,519
Go ahead, go ahead.

241
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,399
Thank you, Master.

242
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,399
Wait for me to come back.

243
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,320
I'll bring you something tasty.

244
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,440
Take care.

245
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,200
What are you thinking about?

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
You don't even have this kind of friend.

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,480
Just have some instant noodles.

248
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,639
Eat? I'll eat in a bit.

249
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,799
King crab.

250
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:17,759
Brother Wei

251
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,879
You said there's instant noodles with king crab flavor?

252
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,159
When you eat it, just think of king crab.

253
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:23,840
Then that's the taste you'll get.

254
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,480
You get it, right?

255
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Come on, come on, come on.

256
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,159
No need to be polite, no need to be polite.

257
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,360
There are so many tenants here.

258
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,399
You're the only one who keeps things clean.

259
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,039
Everyone else makes it really dirty.

260
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,519
It's not easy for you to go out. Take care of yourself.

261
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:13,960
Boss.

262
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,679
I need to check out of my room. I'm in a hurry.

263
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Please wait a moment.

264
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm processing the check-out.

265
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,559
Didn't I tell you I'm in a hurry?

266
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,799
I know.

267
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,120
Go back and pack your things first.

268
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
I'll help you check out in a bit, okay?

269
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,799
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

270
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,759
Bro, don't be so anxious.

271
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,039
Let me finish helping her first.

272
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,200
I'll help you right after, okay?

273
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,159
Go pack your things first.

274
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,919
I'll go check the lock.

275
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,799
I'll come find you in a bit.

276
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,519
A few people came. I think it's them.

277
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,360
How many?

278
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,720
Five.

279
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,759
What are they doing?

280
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,799
Checking out.

281
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,120
They're trying to run.

282
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:42,919
Call the team right away.

283
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,600
Request backup, quick!

284
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Got it.

285
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,000
Master

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,519
How is it?

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
About twenty minutes or so

288
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,639
There's no time

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,679
If he runs out, it'll be hard to catch him

290
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,000
Get ready to move now

291
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,600
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

292
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,639
They only have one gun and two pairs of handcuffs.

293
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
The other side has five people.

294
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,279
Don't move! Police!

295
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Hands on your head! Get down!

296
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,399
Get down! Get down! Get down!

297
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,440
Hands on your head! Get down!

298
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,039
Hands on your head!

299
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,039
Keep your head down!

300
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,639
Hands on your head!

301
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,519
Ziming.

302
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,240
Be careful, don't let the gun go off.

303
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,480
Hurry, cuff him.

304
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,120
Lower your head.

305
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,759
Untie his shoelaces, quick.

306
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,799
We got the right person. Don't move.

307
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,039
No one asked you. Shut up.

308
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,119
Hurry up.

309
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,960
Hurry up, hurry up.

310
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,440
Hurry up, don't move, hurry up.

311
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:14,960
Let's go.

312
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,039
Nice, well done.

313
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Captain Huang, I just saw my master's hand shaking a bit.

314
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,920
What did you say?

315
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,200
That's your face shaking.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,799
He's getting anxious.

317
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,160
What's your name?

318
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,720
You arrested me without even knowing my name?

319
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,599
Behave yourself.

320
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,680
What are you acting tough for now that you're here?

321
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,279
What's your name?

322
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Your dad.

323
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,200
Turn around.

324
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,000
Aren't you supposed to be the boss?

325
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,599
You dare to do it but not admit it?

326
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,680
You're the boss, so just be straightforward.

327
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,599
Do you dare to say it?

328
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,519
Is there a case you guys can't solve?

329
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,119
Are you looking for someone to take the fall?

330
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:21,680
Let me tell you,

331
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,559
Your grandpa has been admitted again

332
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,440
to the intensive care unit.

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
That's great.

334
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,279
Then he'll be able to see my grandma soon.

335
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,119
Hurry up and die.

336
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,519
Take a good look. Do you know this person?

337
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,279
I don't know.

338
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
Where did you go after drinking?

339
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,440
I don't know.

340
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
Do you know your own last name?

341
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,400
I don't know.

342
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
How did you meet Jin Di?

343
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,480
I don't know him.

344
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,119
Look, take a good look.

345
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,440
I really don't know him.

346
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,079
You're so skinny and small,

347
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,319
yet you stabbed someone over a dozen times by yourself.

348
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
You must be hungry.

349
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,920
Here,

350
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,079
do you provide meals?

351
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,279
Depends on what you want to eat.

352
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,680
Pour him a glass of water.

353
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,039
You've got quite a temper.

354
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
Let go of me and let's see what happens between us.

355
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Master

356
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,759
So, did he talk?

357
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,680
Still not talking.

358
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,599
Wei, there’s less than two hours left.

359
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,880
The detention time will be up.

360
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,720
If we can’t get a confession, we’ll have to let him go.

361
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,720
Captain Huang

362
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,200
I just got a call from Director Zhou.

363
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,720
This case has now been classified as a major case.

364
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,559
We have to solve it.

365
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
So many people were arrested, and they even had guns.

366
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,079
If we can't get a conviction for this,

367
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,119
It's him.

368
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,599
If it's not him, you can arrest me.

369
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,279
Are you out of your mind?

370
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,119
What good would it do to arrest you?

371
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,400
I think that kid Kanzi,

372
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
Don't underestimate that guy.

373
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Shen Fu has really been brainwashing him.

374
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
After all, he's still young and inexperienced.

375
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,559
Let's catch him off guard.

376
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
In a bit,

377
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,039
take him to the interrogation room.

378
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,480
Don't ask him anything.

379
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,839
Just chat with him, talk nonsense.

380
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,079
Try to get close to him.

381
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,880
Confuse him.

382
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,880
Then, when you think the time is right,

383
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,079
you go in.

384
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,279
Look,

385
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,559
on your side, you're the youngest.

386
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,680
On our side, I'm the youngest.

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,799
If something goes wrong,

388
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,359
it's us, the youngest ones, who get in trouble.

389
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,000
When something happens on your side, they blame you.

390
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,240
If we run into problems on our side,

391
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,039
I have to tough it out.

392
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,400
That's what happens when you're the youngest.

393
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll stick with you.

394
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,200
I'll eat with you, it's fine.

395
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,640
Come on, it's just having a drink.

396
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
Right? Just have some fun.

397
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,960
Those two have their own issues.

398
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,759
What does it have to do with you?

399
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,039
Is it worth worrying about it for them?

400
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
That Xiao Li from Wild Wolf Bar,

401
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
said you look pretty sharp.

402
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,920
I didn't believe it at first.

403
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,240
But you really do look sharp.

404
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,480
Isn't it a pity?

405
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,880
Let me tell you something.

406
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
If you tell the truth,

407
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,480
you still have a chance.

408
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,319
But if you take all the blame,

409
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,599
your life will be ruined from now on.

410
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,960
And let me tell you,

411
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,039
you can't handle it alone.

412
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,880
Loyalty is good,

413
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,480
but everyone has to be loyal, not just you.

414
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,680
If everything is pinned on you alone,

415
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,920
do you think we’ll believe it?

416
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,599
More than ten stab wounds.

417
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,160
You did it all by yourself? Stabbed him alone?

418
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Do you think we’ll buy that?

419
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,200
We’re not stupid, right?

420
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
You don’t seem like the type who could do something like this.

421
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,920
Why put yourself through this?

422
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,880
It's gone.

423
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,680
You don't even have a chance to redeem yourself now.

424
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,400
Where's the knife?

425
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,880
Where's the murder weapon?

426
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm asking you—hurry, where's the knife?

427
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,319
Still not talking? Where's the knife?

428
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,519
No, I didn't hide the knife.

429
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,440
Shen Fu buried the knife.

430
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,680
I don't know where the knife is.

431
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,960
Come, sign here.

432
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,559
Master

433
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,839
Captain Huang, the checkpoint has been set up.

434
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,039
That day, after leaving the Wild Wolf Bar

435
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,039
Jindi said he hasn't had enough to drink and wants more.

436
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,279
He also said he wants to take us out for some good drinks.

437
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,640
We were all extremely happy at the time.

438
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,440
But Shen Fu seemed a bit unwilling.

439
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,960
Why was he unwilling?

440
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
I don't know either.

441
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,839
Go on.

442
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,200
Then

443
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,599
Then we went to the Mermaid Palace

444
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,839
As soon as the drinks arrived

445
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,599
Shen Fu looked at the drink menu

446
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:03,440
and said, "Why is this lousy alcohol so expensive?"

447
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,599
Let's go together

448
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,559
Why is your alcohol so expensive?

449
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll pay the bill

450
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,200
The alcohol is definitely authentic

451
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,640
Later, I don't know why,

452
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,319
they started arguing about real and fake alcohol.

453
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,000
Shen Fu was really angry at that moment.

454
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
What do you mean?

455
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,200
Are you saying the drinks I brought you before were all fake?

456
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,319
They were as fake as can be.

457
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,599
Jin Di didn't let him off either.

458
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,200
He even smashed a glass.

459
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,720
Waiter!

460
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,559
Coming!

461
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,480
Check, please.

462
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,839
After we left there,

463
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,319
Shen Fu said he wanted to take a walk by the river.

464
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,880
He said, "What's a little pain in the wind and rain?"

465
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,720
"Wipe away your tears, don't ask why."

466
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,519
Brothers, did you have fun tonight?

467
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,200
Yeah, we had fun.

468
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,400
You just won't stop tonight, will you?

469
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,160
If you've got guts, go ahead and kill me.

470
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,279
In the end, after that, he...

471
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,480
He, he...

472
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,200
He just kept stabbing Jin Di.

473
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,079
Jindi tried to resist at first.

474
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,079
Then Shen Fu stabbed him several more times.

475
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,519
Jindi stopped moving.

476
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,519
Shen Fu handed the knife over.

477
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,359
He said each of you must stab him three times.

478
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,200
Come on.

479
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,000
Each person, stab him three times.

480
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,880
I didn't want to either.

481
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,880
But I was too scared.

482
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,839
Kan Zi.

483
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,160
Show us how tough you are.

484
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,920
No, big brother.

485
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,839
Fine, give me the knife.

486
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,039
No, big brother, big brother—

487
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,359
Big brother, no.

488
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,039
No, big brother.

489
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,880
I—I—

490
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,119
Let me not do it.

491
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,240
Let me skip it.

492
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,720
Shen Fu pointed the knife at me.

493
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,200
If you don't stab him, I'll stab you to death.

494
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,039
The knife, the knife.

495
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm really afraid of him.

496
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
Who stabbed him in the genitals?

497
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,559
Ding Bao.

498
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,400
Why?

499
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,920
Big brother, I really don't know.

500
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,519
Jin Di is always really nice to us.

501
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,160
He often treats us to meals and drinks.

502
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,559
Even this piece of clothing I'm wearing

503
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,839
was bought for me by Jin Di.

504
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,960
I just don't get it.

505
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,759
If you don't like him,

506
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,680
why not just beat him up?

507
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,680
Why did you have to stab him?

508
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,559
I used to always take them to play at Wild Wolf Bar.

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That was my turf.

510
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,839
But he always said it wasn't fun.

511
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,640
That day he insisted on dragging us to Mermaid Bar.

512
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,720
Then he said the drinks I took him to have before were fake.

513
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,559
He embarrassed me.

514
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,559
All my guys were there.

515
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,559
He humiliated me.

516
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Did he earn that money himself?

517
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,960
Isn't it all his dad's money?

518
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,640
Your guy said,

519
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,839
Jindi treats you pretty well.

520
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,119
He buys you gifts for every holiday.

521
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,160
He doesn't just buy for me.

522
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,079
He buys for whoever he runs into.

523
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
What does that mean?

524
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,079
He's trying to win people over.

525
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
He wants to be the boss.

526
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,400
Then why not just beat him up?

527
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Kill him?

528
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,880
Is it really necessary?

529
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,240
You're my brother.

530
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,960
I'm fine with taking you out.

531
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,319
But you climbed on my head and disrespected me.

532
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,160
How could I not go after you?

533
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,480
If I don't deal with him, who will listen to me in the future?

534
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
Does anyone listen to you now?

535
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,799
I still have to take him down.

536
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,400
Shen Fu and Kanzi have both confessed.

537
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,200
Do you have anything to add?

538
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,400
They've already confessed, why are you still asking me?

539
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,519
Why did you stab him in the groin?

540
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,240
I just do whatever the boss tells me to do.

541
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,960
Really?

542
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,759
That's not what your boss said.

543
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,720
That day, after Jin Di had some drinks,

544
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,640
he asked me to go to the restroom with him.

545
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,160
He peed on my shoes.

546
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,759
I immediately wanted to swap shoes with him.

547
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,960
But he wasn't willing.

548
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,559
After we got back, I told Shen Fu about it.

549
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,839
Shen Fu was pretty upset too.

550
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,519
He said, "Why wouldn't he be willing?"

551
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,079
"If he peed on your shoes, he should compensate you."

552
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,240
Is it this one?

553
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,440
Alright, take him away.

554
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,920
Let's go.

555
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's eat at Wanghailou tonight, my treat.

556
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,519
Master, master, I'm not going.

557
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,279
I have plans tonight, so I can't make it.

558
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,000
You guys go ahead and eat.

559
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,079
Mrs. Jin

560
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,440
I'm here to inform you

561
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
We've solved the case

562
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
We've also caught the culprit

563
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,319
What do you want?

564
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,359
Do you want us to thank you?

565
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,759
Are you done yet?

566
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,640
Go. Don't come back.

567
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,839
Don't come back again.

568
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,720
You don't want us to live, do you?

569
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,680
Do you want us to thank you?

570
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,480
Come here.

571
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,240
Let me tell you something.

572
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,400
Even if you execute him a hundred times,

573
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
will my son come back?

574
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,720
Tell me, can he come back?

575
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,319
Come

576
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Why are you in such a bad mood, senior brother?

577
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,839
The case will end

578
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,920
but the pain won't.

579
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,039
Your drink.

580
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Okay, thank you.

581
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
Enjoy your drink.

582
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,440
Hello?

583
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,759
I'm here.

584
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,960
Across from the Wanghai Bay Seafood Restaurant.

585
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,799
There's a barbecue stall.

586
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,559
Where are you?

587
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm at the one without a sign, it's easy to find.

588
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,960
I can't see where you are.

589
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,440
I'm here, here, here, here!

590
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:15,960
Master

591
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,159
What a coincidence.

592
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,000
Isn't it?

593
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,239
See, I told you.

594
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,800
No need to look, sit down, right here.

595
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,400
Wei just asked me to eat.

596
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
And you asked me to eat too.

597
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,440
Let's all eat together.

598
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Do you think you did a great job keeping it secret?

599
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,400
Did you two finish that case?

600
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,800
It's done, come on.

601
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,599
Eat this.

602
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,639
Looks good.

603
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,159
Why did you suddenly think of

604
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,559
having me meet your sister today?

605
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
We've known each other for so long.

606
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,679
We should meet at least once, right?

607
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,079
Then you should also meet my classmates when you have time.

608
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,159
I'm afraid I won't have anything to talk about with them.

609
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Aren't you worried I won't have anything to talk about with your sister?

610
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,360
Then just don't talk.

611
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,920
Just focus on eating later.

612
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Let's go, let's go.

613
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,039
Boss

614
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:48,519
Akiko

615
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,320
Have a seat, quickly.

616
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,960
Sis

617
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,159
Why is it...

618
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,719
Oh, it's you! It's you, sis!

619
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,239
Thanks for last time.

620
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,000
What a coincidence!

621
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,159
You two know each other?

622
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
Not really, not exactly.

623
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,719
Liu Ziqing.

624
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,719
Fang Tingting.

625
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,480
Hello.

626
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,159
Have a seat, have a seat.

627
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,119
Sit, sit, sit.

628
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,800
I'll sit here.

629
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,119
Okay.

630
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,199
Look at the place you picked.

631
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,079
I don't even have a place to put my bag.

632
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,519
I've been holding it the whole time.

633
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,239
And I'm not even making you pay, seriously.

634
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,960
It's close to the station, we come here a lot.

635
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,119
Alright, let's order.

636
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,880
Tingting, take a look.

637
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,639
You order.

638
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,960
Order whatever you like.

639
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,559
You order, my treat.

640
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,559
Sis, you order.

641
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,039
I won't order.

642
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,039
I don't even know what's good here.

643
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:24,400
Then I'll order.

644
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,239
Just order whatever you want to eat.

645
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:25,920
Alright, alright.

646
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Order more meat, boss.

647
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,239
Sweet and sour pork. Sis, last time I saw you,

648
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,320
you were still pregnant.

649
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,079
Shredded pork in Beijing sauce.

650
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,400
You've recovered really well. Braised ribbonfish.

651
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,519
Crispy fried pork intestines.

652
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,679
All the meat is hidden here. Alright.

653
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,679
What staple food do you want?

654
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,880
Noodles.

655
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:38,760
Noodles.

656
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Pork chop noodles are delicious. Okay.

657
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,360
Pork chop noodles.

658
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,079
I... I won't eat, I'm on a diet.

659
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,480
I've got fat here, here, and here.

660
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,159
I'm already chubby here.

661
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,320
Two bowls of pork chop noodles.

662
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,280
So how many months is the baby now?

663
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,960
Seven or eight months. Hurry up.

664
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Seven months.

665
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:50,880
Girl or boy?

666
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,519
Girl.

667
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,280
Girls are great.

668
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,760
Where's the baby?

669
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
The baby is at home with the nanny.

670
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,559
If it hadn't been for you that day,

671
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,199
wouldn't I have been at a disadvantage?

672
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,400
We really have a connection.

673
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,119
Brother Yang,

674
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,760
How long have you two been together?

675
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,880
Not yet, we just ordered.

676
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,880
We've known each other for so long.

677
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,199
He never told me either.

678
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
Alright, I'll head over now.

679
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,480
You remember it so clearly.

680
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,400
I have a task to do, I need to head over.

681
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,519
Alright, go ahead.

682
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,119
Leave the person to me, don't worry.

683
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,480
You haven't eaten yet.

684
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,599
I'll skip eating for now.

685
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,400
I'll go over first.

686
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,599
Okay.

687
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,480
Grab something to eat at the entrance.

688
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,480
Have a good chat with my sister.

689
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,920
Get a drink or something.

690
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,280
It's fine.

691
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,719
Put it on my tab.

692
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,559
Alright.

693
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,639
Acting generous, putting it on his tab.

694
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,280
Nobody come over here.

695
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,840
The suspect is hiding behind the seat.

696
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,079
The sniper can't find an angle.

697
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,480
Everyone, stay calm for now.

698
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,400
Wait for an opportunity to act.

699
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:39,159
If you come any closer, I'll blow up the hostage.

700
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,840
Nobody make any sudden moves.

701
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Don't come over here.

702
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,159
Let us go.

703
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,960
Nobody move.

704
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,719
Don't come any closer.

705
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,400
All units, provide cover.

706
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,599
Snipers, get ready.

707
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,360
Step back.

708
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,480
Everyone, turn away.

709
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,320
Don't move.

710
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,960
Go!

711
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,920
Don't move.

712
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,639
Let go of me.

713
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,360
I'll blow you all up!

714
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,480
You didn't see it.

715
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
My heart almost jumped out just now.

716
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
My master reached up with one hand in a flash.

717
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,199
He pulled out the fuse right away.

718
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,400
Then his other hand shot up.

719
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
He pressed the gun right against that guy's forehead.

720
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,199
Yeah, don't be fooled by his age.

721
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,440
He's really fast.

722
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,679
No, I—

723
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,280
I'm not reporting work.

724
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,880
I just wanted to chat with you.

725
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:13,800
Let me tell you,

726
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,159
my master has an illegitimate daughter.

727
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,079
That girl, let me tell you—

728
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,119
Alright.

729
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,079
Master, you’ve learned to talk behind my back now, huh?

730
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,280
No, no, I was praising you.

731
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,840
And what’s with “in a flash”? Tell me, what does that even mean?

732
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
I was complimenting you.

733
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,480
Master, master, master, take it easy!

734
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,599
Come here, come here—ow, ow, ow!

735
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,159
Explain yourself, make it clear!

736
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,199
You’d better explain this illegitimate daughter thing!

737
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:30,840
I really was praising you!

738
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,199
Old Wei.

739
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:31,880
You still—

740
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,119
I was just looking for you.

741
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,000
Come here for a second.

742
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,639
Stand right here.

743
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,920
Captain Huang

744
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,039
Talking about me behind my back?

745
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,920
Are you going to do something about it?

746
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,239
Serious business—talking about me behind my back.

747
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,440
The bureau just called.

748
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,320
They gave an order.

749
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,280
They want you to report to the city bureau.

750
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
Report for what?

751
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,599
To join the special task force.

752
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,280
Hurry home and change your clothes.

753
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,079
Go quickly.

754
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,239
We’ll talk about other things later.

755
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,519
Yes, sir.

756
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,119
Go on.

757
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,039
Did you hear something again?

758
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,639
Stand up straight.

759
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,719
You—

760
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,320
Master

761
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,519
You're joining the task force?

762
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,159
Yeah.

763
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,320
The illegitimate daughter task force.

764
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,719
You're really going?

765
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,599
Are you really going to go?

766
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,679
If I leave, you'll talk about me behind my back.

767
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,119
Didn't say when he'd be back.

768
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,480
Didn't say.

769
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,199
What case is it?

770
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
Didn't reveal anything.

771
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,159
Some special task forces last ten days or half a month.

772
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,400
Some last a year or two.

773
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,760
Now that the boss is gone,

774
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,199
no one's watching the three of us.

775
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,239
No one's watching? You are.

776
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,519
No, no, no.

777
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,199
I can't do it.

778
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,800
Even if the boss doesn't come back,

779
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,880
even if he does come back—

780
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,559
P-Phone, phone!

781
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:19,800
Hello?

782
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,880
Okay, I'll be right there.

783
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,800
Garden Community.

784
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,480
A man reported

785
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
that an old lady died in the downstairs neighbor's apartment.

786
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
Excuse me, please let me through.

787
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:45,119
Director Zhang.

788
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:46,719
You’re here.

789
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,079
Brother Cao.

790
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,920
Oh my god.

791
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,000
Brother Zhang

792
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,360
Can the cause of death be determined?
