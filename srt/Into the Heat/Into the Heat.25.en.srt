00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
Honey

2
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,479
Honey

3
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,960
Honey

4
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,039
Honey

5
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,520
Honey

6
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,759
Honey

7
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,919
What are you doing?

8
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,240
Boss

9
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,319
Have you ever delivered flowers to Yujing Yayuan?

10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,479
Is that the villa area?

11
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,719
Yes

12
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,599
Number 2-1, the recipient is Zhao Hongxia

13
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,080
How would I remember the recipient's name?

14
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,719
But I have delivered goods there

15
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,759
What kind of flowers did you deliver?

16
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,919
Was it a big bouquet?

17
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,599
Yes

18
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,159
How many times did you deliver?

19
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,080
Ninety-nine flowers, that kind of packaging

20
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,400
Thank you

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,159
Sister Jun

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,800
There's a lead

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,439
We have a lead

24
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,120
Hello

25
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Does their house have a yard with a white fence?

26
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,759
Yes

27
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,960
What kind of flowers did you deliver?

28
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,199
These flowers, dahlias

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Mainly, very few people buy this kind of flower

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,479
So I remember it very clearly

31
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,719
He came by just a couple of days ago.

32
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,520
Then he bought a big bunch.

33
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
And took it with him.

34
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,159
He even asked me to restock.

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
I figure

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,159
he might come again in the next few days.

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,879
Did he leave any personal information?

38
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,120
Did he leave a phone number?

39
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,520
No.

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
But I remember what he looks like.

41
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,719
Take a look, are these his ears?

42
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,319
What do you think, does it look like him?

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,479
What on earth did you draw?

44
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,879
It doesn't look like him at all.

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,520
No, he has a face like a mouse.

46
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,800
But you said before he had a round face.

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,079
How did it turn into a mouse face now?

48
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,959
No, I mean he just looks like that.

49
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
That's just how he looks.

50
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,040
Honestly,

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,879
I don't really know how to describe it anyway.

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,519
Can you adjust it to look more like a mouse face?

53
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,240
Okay.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,759
Then I'll change the face shape for him.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
Make it a bit slimmer.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
Make the eyebrows a bit thinner.

57
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,079
Slim this part down a bit more.

58
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,319
Let the lips droop down a bit more.

59
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,600
What do you mean by "droop down"?

60
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,399
Speak standard Mandarin.

61
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,160
Do you mean thin or thick lips?

62
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
Or what do you mean?

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,680
No, just adjust the lips downward a bit more.

64
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,720
You mean the corners of the mouth down?

65
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,519
Right.

66
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,199
Okay.

67
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,120
Are there any other features?

68
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,079
For example, facial features like this.

69
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,879
Look at me.

70
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,920
My face is long.

71
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,279
But don’t look at me, I don’t have any distinctive features.

72
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,399
That’s true, Junjie. Get to the point.

73
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,120
She’s quite pretty.

74
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
But doesn’t have any special features.

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
Just facial features like these.

76
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,319
There’s also a mole here.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,439
Here, here, and here.

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

79
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,240
So does he know what illness he has?

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,639
If he knows, then he knows.

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
He knows now.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,160
But he’ll probably forget in a couple of days.

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,759
It’s fine.

84
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,759
He’s still in good spirits.

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
He even beat me to the medicine today.

86
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,439
You only see him when he’s doing well.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
But a couple of days ago, when he left the dance hall,

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,759
he didn’t know where home was.

89
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,079
Luckily, the security guard at the entrance called me.

90
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,240
I brought him back home.

91
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,759
Why didn’t he call me?

92
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,199
My name is easy to find, daughter.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,720
You little rascal.

94
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,240
Xia Yu.

95
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
Someone sent you flowers.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,839
They’re for me?

97
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Let me see.

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
It must be your girlfriend.

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,680
Just now.

100
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,199
Your girlfriend’s name is Just Now?

101
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,800
Thanks.

102
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,439
This person looks...

103
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,439
Why does he look so much like one of our residents?

104
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,319
Which resident?

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,079
He looks just like the one from Building 16.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,879
Building 16?

107
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,279
Is it the one who always keeps the curtains closed?

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
The one who lives across the street from Zhao Hongxia's place?

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,439
Yes, yes, that's right.

110
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,240
How tall is he?

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
He's not very tall.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,480
A little over 1.7 meters, but not quite 1.8.

113
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,879
What's his name?

114
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,959
I actually don't know his name.

115
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,000
I just remember what he roughly looks like.

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,480
How many people live in his household?

117
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,680
I remember there was a woman living with him at first.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,439
I haven't seen them around lately.

119
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,399
Are they home now?

120
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,759
He just drove out not long ago.

121
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,639
Which direction?

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,959
To the north.

123
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,079
What car is he driving?

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
A black Volkswagen Tiguan.

125
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,480
Do you remember the license plate number?

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,720
Hai A65428.

127
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,360
Sister Jun,

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
I'll go to the property management to verify his identity.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
Wait for my call.

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Gangzi,

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Report to the team.

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Call the traffic police and request assistance.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,879
Check where this car is headed.

134
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,600
Okay, thank you.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,399
Thank you, take care.

136
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,480
Hello, Sister Jun.

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I was just driving.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
The owner of Building 16 is named Tian Li.

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,639
Born in 1975, a local.

140
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,279
He registered his ID with property management.

141
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,480
Take a look at the photo first.

142
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll keep investigating.

143
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,240
The traffic police called and said

144
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,639
Tian Li's car, five minutes ago,

145
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,440
was at the Bayi intersection

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
and turned into a small road to the east.

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
Boss, I've been there before.

148
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,559
There's a village inside, next to the river.

149
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,600
Let's go quickly and check it out.

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,879
Sister Jun, we're heading over there now.

151
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,080
Hello

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,639
Tian Li has a criminal record.

153
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,399
He was sentenced to two years at the beginning of 2005.

154
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,399
He was released in 2007 for indecent assault.

155
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,559
Who did he assault?

156
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,919
He met a girl online.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,559
After meeting, he went against her will.

158
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,720
He tied her up.

159
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,080
The girl escaped and called the police.

160
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,879
Guess how he tied her up.

161
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,759
With her hands behind her back.

162
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,600
Right. Also, he was involved in illegal sand mining.

163
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,200
He might still be doing it secretly.

164
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Remember?

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,919
There was river sand under Zhao Hongxia's fingernails.

166
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,919
Report to Captain Huang.

167
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
List him as a key suspect.

168
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,240
Aren't we arresting him yet?

169
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,759
What's going on inside?

170
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,000
No one knows how many people are in there.

171
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
Keep watching for now.

172
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,879
Let's go, follow him.

173
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,080
Don't follow too closely.

174
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,600
Okay.

175
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
Captain Huang.

176
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, we're following him now.

177
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,919
Looks like he's heading home.

178
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,399
About twenty minutes.

179
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,000
Understood.

180
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,080
Don't move.

181
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,799
What are you doing?

182
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Who is it? Who is it?

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't move. What are you doing?

184
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,320
Don't move. Behave yourself.

185
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,000
Who is it? Calm down.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,799
Cuff him.

187
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,879
Tian Li, right?

188
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,480
We're from the Haiming City Public Security Bureau.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,960
You are suspected of a serious crime.

190
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,240
We are summoning you according to the law.

191
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,320
And we will search your residence according to the law.

192
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,360
Take a good look.

193
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
This is our witness. Take him away.

194
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,600
Keep your head down.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,879
How's the search going?

196
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,240
It's done.

197
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,080
Master.

198
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,399
You're back.

199
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,399
I'm discharged.

200
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
If I stayed in the hospital any longer, I'd really go crazy.

201
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,919
Then go upstairs and have a look later.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,559
Okay.

203
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,480
Why are all these women's clothes?

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,879
Exactly.

205
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,559
I see there's a third floor.

206
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,440
Have you checked the third floor?

207
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,679
Not yet.

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,279
Alright, you guys go ahead.

209
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:40,799
Okay.

210
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,159
What is the hook for?

211
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,480
Master.

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Look at this piece of clothing.

213
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,200
It's the same as the one Zhao Hongxia wore to the convenience store.

214
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
Exactly the same.

215
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,720
And this rope.

216
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
It's also the same as the one at the scene.

217
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,799
The way it's tied is just like the one on the victim.

218
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,960
The style is also very similar.

219
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,799
This nightgown.

220
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,240
It's exactly the same as the one Zhao Hongxia was wearing.

221
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,759
It just seems a bit larger in size.

222
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:12,679
The size is bigger.

223
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,480
Check the shoes.

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,799
Size forty-three.

225
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,879
Open it and take a look.

226
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,440
Okay.

227
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
Whose hair is this?

228
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,759
During the autopsy,

229
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,480
did you find that Zhao Hongxia was missing any hair?

230
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,879
No.

231
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,799
Then whose is this?

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,320
Call the forensics department.

233
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,759
Okay.

234
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,879
Do you know why you were arrested?

235
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm not really sure. Why don't you tell me?

236
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,879
What have you been busy with lately?

237
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Not much.

238
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,200
Just keeping myself busy.

239
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,240
Even if it's just keeping busy, it's still something.

240
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,240
Be specific, what exactly have you been busy with?

241
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,919
Are you asking about the sand yard?

242
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,480
The sand yard isn't just mine.

243
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,799
We're not talking about the sand yard today.

244
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,120
That's a minor issue.

245
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,399
Take a look at this.

246
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
All of this was found in your house.

247
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's talk about your hobbies.

248
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,599
What hobbies?

249
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,400
What do you mean?

250
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
Wasn't it because of something last time that you got locked up?

251
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,319
I forgot.

252
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,480
You have no idea?

253
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,200
I do know.

254
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,039
I changed after that.

255
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:17,759
I changed.

256
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,119
Tell me, where did this hair come from?

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm asking you, whose hair is this?

258
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,200
I picked it up, from a hair salon.

259
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Which hair salon?

260
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,079
What's the name of the salon?

261
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,079
What day did you pick it up?

262
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,640
Say it.

263
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
Gangzi, write this down.

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,759
Check it out later.

265
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,440
No, no, no.

266
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,640
It's my girlfriend's—my ex-girlfriend's.

267
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Where is she?

268
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,440
She left. We broke up.

269
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,920
You broke up, but you still have her clothes at home?

270
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,880
I haven't had time to pack them up.

271
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,880
Did you kill her?

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,079
Officer, please don't joke like that.

273
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,799
I wouldn't dare.

274
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
Then tell me where she is.

275
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,279
Where is she?

276
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,200
I really don't know where she is.

277
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,799
We broke up.

278
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,599
She just left.

279
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,960
Why did you break up?

280
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,279
We kept arguing, just incompatible personalities.

281
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,599
Why did you argue?

282
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,119
We argued over trivial things.

283
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,279
We just couldn't go on.

284
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,319
How long has it been since you broke up?

285
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,480
It's been about half a month.

286
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
Have you seen her since the breakup?

287
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:21,279
No.

288
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:22,039
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

289
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,200
I haven't seen her at all.

290
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,400
It's been half a month, I haven't seen her.

291
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,680
Then whose hair is this?

292
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
You don't have hair that long, do you?

293
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Whose hair is this?

294
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,039
Did you hide her in the warehouse? Tell me.

295
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,519
Here, over here.

296
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,359
There's someone tied up inside. Go in quickly.

297
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:50,799
Miss.

298
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,480
Miss.

299
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,480
Wake up.

300
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,880
Wake up.

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,039
What's your name?

302
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,920
Call an ambulance.

303
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:04,799
Don't be afraid.

304
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,119
Don't be afraid, we're the police.

305
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,200
We're here to rescue you.

306
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
You're safe now.

307
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Very safe.

308
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,039
Physically,

309
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,559
other than malnutrition,

310
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,799
there are no other issues.

311
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,440
But she's suffered a lot of psychological trauma.

312
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
We've given her some sedatives.

313
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
She should feel better soon.

314
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I didn't expect that either.

315
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,640
Let's just call it my... my problem.

316
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,799
She found out about it.

317
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,920
So you locked her up after she found out?

318
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,319
I actually hadn't thought it through.

319
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,920
I thought I'd just keep her locked up for a couple of days.

320
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,240
Let her calm down a bit.

321
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
Mainly, I was afraid she'd tell on me.

322
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,799
Tell us about Zhao Hongxia.

323
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,759
Who?

324
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
Zhao Hongxia.

325
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,200
I don't know her. Never met her.

326
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,359
Xuanxuan

327
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
Remember to take Diandian to school.

328
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,480
Got it, we're having breakfast now.

329
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,279
That's good.

330
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,799
He just told me

331
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,440
not to take him to school anymore.

332
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,119
He wants to walk there by himself.

333
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,000
He also said not to pick him up after school.

334
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,119
It's not far from home anyway.

335
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,880
Then do this:

336
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,640
Let him go by himself,

337
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,240
and you follow him secretly from behind.

338
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:00,759
That's what I was thinking too.

339
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,240
Keep an eye on him.

340
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,279
Don't lose him.

341
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,799
It's been a whole day.

342
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,680
Stop dragging it out.

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,319
It's time to come clean.

344
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,119
Do you know what this is?

345
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,759
From Zhao Hongxia's fingernails

346
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,480
we extracted skin tissue.

347
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,640
After DNA comparison,

348
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,480
it matches yours.

349
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,400
Speak.

350
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,000
It was purely an accident.

351
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,839
I really didn't mean to kill anyone.

352
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,319
Be clear.

353
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
You didn't mean to kill whom?

354
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,799
I didn't mean to kill her.

355
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,720
I don't know her name.

356
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,279
Then how do you know her?

357
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,079
I've seen her in the neighborhood, a few times.

358
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,079
We don't really know each other.

359
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,759
Start from the beginning.

360
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,200
How many times did you send flowers to Zhao Hongxia?

361
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,440
About five or six times.

362
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,839
Just five or six times.

363
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,519
She never accepted them.

364
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,000
She didn't even look at them, just threw them away.

365
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,279
I got a little angry.

366
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,640
I thought she was too arrogant, needed to be taught a lesson.

367
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,480
Tell me what you did on the night of March 4th.

368
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,319
That day, I came back from the sand yard.

369
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,039
I happened to see her coming out of the supermarket.

370
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,160
I saw she was wearing pajamas.

371
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,319
Exactly the same as mine.

372
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,480
I thought she was

373
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,680
doing it on purpose.

374
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,960
I thought she wanted to show me.

375
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,240
She was hinting at me.

376
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,839
Then I followed her.

377
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,519
I followed her all the way to the grove.

378
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,240
Don't argue, don't argue.

379
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
Don't fight, don't fight.

380
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,839
You buried her on the night of the 4th.

381
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Then why, in the early hours of March 6th,

382
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,960
did you dispose of the body again?

383
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,039
What happened in between?

384
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,279
Nothing happened.

385
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,240
I was scared.

386
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,319
Really, I was terrified.

387
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,119
I was afraid I hadn't buried her deep enough.

388
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,839
So I went back the next morning.

389
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,119
I saw that an arm had already come out.

390
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,359
So I dug her up again.

391
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,119
Was she still alive when you went this time?

392
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,119
No.

393
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,400
No, she was dead this time.

394
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,960
Completely dead.

395
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,200
Then I

396
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,799
took her home.

397
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
Why did you take her home?

398
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,079
I couldn't bear to bury her.

399
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,160
What did you do after bringing her home?

400
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,400
Nothing.

401
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Just left her there and looked at her.

402
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,839
Gave her flowers.

403
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,799
This time, she accepted them.

404
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,640
Captain Liu, we found evidence.

405
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,640
Ming.

406
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,000
Whose phone is this?

407
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,599
It's hers.

408
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,839
Take him back to the station.

409
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,640
Yes.

410
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Boss.

411
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,839
The case is closed.

412
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,920
Shouldn't I get some credit for this?

413
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,359
Then you can write the closing report this time.

414
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,480
Who are you?

415
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,640
My sister said you went dancing again a couple of days ago.

416
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,240
Who's your sister?

417
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,680
And who are you?

418
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,279
You don't recognize me?

419
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,400
No, I don't.

420
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,400
Old man, are you messing with me?

421
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
I'm your son.

422
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
Stop fooling around.

423
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
How could I not recognize my own son?

424
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,799
That little rascal.

425
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,119
I'd recognize him even if he were skinned or turned to ashes.

426
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,400
Everyone says he's a cop, thinks he's something.

427
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,359
But he's not doing as well as I am.

428
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,319
He even lost his wife.

429
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,720
So what if he did.

430
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,000
He still comes to bother me from time to time.

431
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,519
You mustn't be like him.

432
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm just venting to you.

433
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,480
But don't go telling him what I said.

434
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,480
That kid...

435
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,319
has a bad temper.

436
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,799
Why are you crying?

437
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,559
Dad.

438
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,599
Who are you?

439
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,359
Are you here looking for someone?

440
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:15,839
Don't cry.

441
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,039
Are you having some trouble?

442
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,319
Dad.

443
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,400
I'm sorry.

444
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,000
All these years,

445
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,240
I haven't really talked to you properly.

446
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,359
Actually, I have so much I want to say to you.

447
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,359
And so many things

448
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,599
I want to do together with you.

449
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,079
Please don't forget me, Dad.

450
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,359
Don't cry.

451
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,640
Why are you crying?

452
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:21,440
This...

453
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,119
You...

454
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,359
I'm not dead or anything.

455
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm just pretending.

456
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,759
I'm hungry.

457
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,279
Can you buy me something to eat? Where's my wallet?

458
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,559
Enough, stop pretending.

459
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,359
You and my sister are teaming up to fool me.

460
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
What you just said counts, right?

461
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,680
What did I say?

462
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,200
You said...

463
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,079
You'd be willing to do a lot of things with me.

464
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,119
Did I say that?

465
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,400
No.

466
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,559
You must have misheard.

467
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,319
You were confused just now.

468
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,160
I've got a lot to do. I'm leaving.

469
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,160
Go ahead, keep acting.

470
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't take this off.

471
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,440
And don't drink any more alcohol.

472
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,359
Teacher Xiao

473
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,799
Is there anything I should pay attention to?

474
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,559
What about the other parents?

475
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,640
They all share based on their own professional experience.

476
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,319
For example, a photographer

477
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,640
would talk to the kids about optics.

478
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,039
Someone in finance

479
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,880
would give the kids a simple explanation

480
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,039
of economic theory.

481
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,480
Your profession is a bit special.

482
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm not quite sure how you should present it.

483
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,320
In any case, you can't talk about anything violent or bloody.

484
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,159
You also can't mention crime details.

485
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,079
Anything that might have a negative impact on the children

486
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,119
shouldn't be mentioned.

487
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,760
So what should I talk about?

488
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,559
Promoting good and punishing evil, upholding justice.

489
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
Go on in.

490
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
Kids,

491
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,039
today we've invited

492
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,719
an honorable police officer.

493
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,800
This is Officer Liu, the parent of Liu Yidian.

494
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,079
Officer Liu

495
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,760
will tell us stories about being a police officer.

496
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,719
Let's give a round of applause.

497
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,000
Hello, kids.

498
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,320
My name is Liu Ziming.

499
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,239
I am a police officer.

500
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,440
My job is

501
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,000
to promote good, punish evil, and uphold justice.

502
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,440
Simply put, I catch bad guys.

503
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,639
So if you have any questions,

504
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,159
feel free to ask me.

505
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:17,800
Uncle, have you caught a lot of bad guys?

506
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
A lot.

507
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,280
Don't move! Police!

508
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,719
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

509
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,119
Hands on your head! Hands on your head!

510
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,119
What did the bad guys you caught do?

511
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,239
For example, murd—

512
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,119
Armed robbery

513
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,599
And then there's drug dealing

514
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:44,760
Run

515
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,559
Don't move! Don't move!

516
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,559
Police!

517
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,159
Hands!

518
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,119
Don't move! Hands up!

519
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,079
Police!

520
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,480
Overall,

521
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,760
The things bad people do are all illegal.

522
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,920
Uncle, have you ever fired a gun?

523
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:04,719
Yes, I have.

524
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,079
Did you shoot any bad guys to death?

525
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,119
No, I missed.

526
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,760
Uncle.

527
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,119
Police only come after bad people do bad things.

528
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,360
Is that true?

529
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,400
A lot of the time, yes.

530
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,519
Because police can't prevent crimes from happening.

531
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,199
Especially criminal cases.

532
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,039
So we usually arrive after the incident happens.

533
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,400
That's when we get to the scene.

534
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,440
Why can't you go there before it happens?

535
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,079
If you went earlier, they wouldn't be able to kill anyone.

536
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,679
Superman and Ultraman are never that late.

537
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,679
They don't even give bad guys a chance to act.

538
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,920
Even kittens and puppies wouldn't get hurt.

539
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,440
Hulu Brothers are even better than the police.

540
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,360
They even have clairvoyance.

541
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,480
Ultraman is the best.

542
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,599
Ultraman is the best.

543
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,000
Everyone, quiet down.

544
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,559
Do you still remember what your teacher taught you?

545
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,239
If you encounter danger,

546
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,400
what should you do?

547
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,920
Call 110.

548
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,519
Good.

549
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:09,599
Let's give Officer Liu another round of applause.

550
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,079
What's wrong, son?

551
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,440
You're not happy?

552
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,559
How about Dad takes you to the amusement park tomorrow?

553
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,559
Do you want to go?

554
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,000
Do you want to go?

555
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,159
Bumper cars.

556
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,679
Come here.

557
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,159
Let's go bump into him.

558
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,039
I want to play that one.

559
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,440
Let's play this one first.

560
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,000
I want to play that one later.

561
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,079
You're not 1.2 meters yet.

562
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,639
You're getting taller.

563
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,920
Son.

564
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,760
Did you have fun today?

565
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,719
Yes, I did.

566
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,000
We're here, son.

567
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,679
Come on.

568
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,800
Come on.

569
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:23,840
Dian Dian.

570
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,760
Dad will pick you up the afternoon after tomorrow, okay?

571
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,920
Listen to your mom.

572
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,559
If you miss Dad, just call me.

573
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,119
Okay?

574
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:31,840
Okay.

575
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,119
I'm leaving.

576
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,280
Dian Dian.

577
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,519
Bye, Dad.

578
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,159
I can make a new plan for you.

579
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,960
Let me confirm how many people are going.

580
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,920
Five people.

581
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,360
Okay.

582
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,840
It's to the seaside.

583
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,960
Our Lao Cao Home-style Cuisine restaurant

584
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,159
will follow a chain store model in the future.

585
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,760
It won't just be this one location.

586
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,639
We'll also open in every district.

587
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,159
Every district,

588
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,360
in every district, we'll add

589
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,199
our restaurant's logo.

590
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,800
It will be displayed on the main streets.

591
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,239
Master.

592
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,519
Whose car is this?

593
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,400
Mine.

594
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,079
Are you called Xia Yu?

595
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,519
I bought it for him.

596
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,280
Nonsense.

597
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,920
Really.

598
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,519
About us dating,

599
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,119
when are we telling my mentor?

600
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,480
Stop talking nonsense.

601
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,119
What? I still have to marry you someday.

602
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,320
Say that again, I dare you.

603
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,000
I'll hit you.

604
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,119
Go ahead, hit me again.

605
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,320
I really feel like hitting you today, go on.

606
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,719
What? What's wrong if I hit you?

607
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,880
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,760
Is there a problem?

609
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
No problem, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

610
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,320
That's more like it.

611
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,119
I got paid today.

612
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,320
I'll treat you to a meal.

613
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,079
How about Wanghailou?

614
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,360
Hello, Xia Yu?

615
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,519
Dinner at Wanghailou.

616
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,199
Are you coming?

617
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,079
I'll pass.

618
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,679
I've already made plans to eat with someone.

619
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,639
Maybe another day.

620
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:34,920
Bye.

621
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
It's about that last case, right?

622
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,719
I have another question.

623
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,760
With so many traces and fingerprints at the scene,

624
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,599
your forensics team,

625
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,400
how did you manage to

626
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,000
find the most crucial evidence so quickly?

627
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,400
So you came to discuss the case with me.

628
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,199
Happy retirement, Captain Huang.

629
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:35,639
Come here.

630
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,880
Come to Grandpa.

631
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,199
Grandpa will take you to play.

632
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,239
Dad, why did you become a police officer?

633
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,239
At first,

634
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,440
I wanted to uphold justice and eliminate crime.

635
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,440
Can crime really be eliminated?

636
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:19,840
No, it can't.

637
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,400
Dad is a police officer.

638
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:25,639
A police officer

639
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,719
is not just one person.

640
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,480
It's a group of people.

641
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,599
The existence of this group

642
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,960
may not be able to completely eliminate crime,

643
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,920
but because this group exists,

644
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,280
those who want to commit crimes will think about the consequences.

645
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
And those who have already committed crimes

646
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,800
will pay the price.

647
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,880
That is the meaning of your dad and his colleagues' existence.
