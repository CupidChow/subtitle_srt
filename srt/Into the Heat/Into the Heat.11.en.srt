1
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,719
Brother Dali

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,079
Did you get the photo?

3
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,680
I got it.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,519
Check it quickly.

5
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,879
Is that person Sun Haixing?

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,159
Yes, where are you?

7
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,400
Are you sure?

8
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm sure.

9
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,319
I'm at Qian Ferry in Ancheng.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,719
Notify the local police right away.

11
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay.

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Hello.

13
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,319
From Haiming.

14
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,959
Okay.

15
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,799
A wanted criminal was found inside.

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,400
We need your cooperation.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,520
Brother Sun

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
Where are you going? Who is it?

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,680
You've got the wrong person.

20
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,400
Boss

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,240
Grab him!

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,759
Boss

23
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,280
Boss

24
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,800
Don't move.

25
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,639
Don't move! Stay still!

26
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,280
Number Two

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,039
Number Two

28
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,520
Crouch down.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
Number Two

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,120
Number Four

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Sun Haixing

32
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,039
Someone was stabbed at the Arirang nightclub.

33
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,159
Thrown down from the fourth floor.

34
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,319
You did it, didn't you?

35
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,759
No, I didn't.

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,680
Look, this is you, right?

37
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,080
Still trying to deny it?

38
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,039
Take him away.

39
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,759
Let's go.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Behave yourself.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,479
It was nothing.

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,599
Stick it on.

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,439
Come on, let's move this.

45
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,759
One, two, three.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,319
What's this for?

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,439
It's a one-way mirror.

48
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,199
Watch your hands, be careful.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,360
Okay.

50
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,039
Which side is the interrogation room?

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
Which side is the observation room?

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,599
Interrogation is on this side, observation is on that side.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,199
Take a good look—who's observing whom?

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,159
It's reversed, it's reversed, it's reversed.

55
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,000
Adjust it, it's reversed.

56
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
Where did everyone go to work?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,639
The interrogation room has been turned into an office.

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Where is Captain Huang?

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,439
In the meeting room.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
Go. We went the wrong way.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,719
It's changed so much I don't even recognize it.

62
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,840
I thought it was the restroom.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,400
Alright.

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,759
Acting alone like this is actually pretty fun.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,319
Is it fun?

66
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,479
You've been doing well lately.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,680
As long as I don't see you getting on my nerves,

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,919
I'm doing just fine.

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,680
I quit.

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,040
Good for you.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
I'll quit too, soon.

72
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,240
You can't quit.

73
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,519
You just can't sit still, can you?

74
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,079
Tell me,

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
have you bothered all of Yu Peng's contacts

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,279
by now?

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
One moment you're looking for the kid,

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,600
the next you're after that fugitive.

79
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,959
Should I apply to the higher-ups

80
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,360
to give you a first-class merit?

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
Then I...

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,759
Did you suddenly

83
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,560
remember you're still a cop?

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Shouldn't I remember that?

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Who knows?

86
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,560
Do you think

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that catching a fugitive

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,959
makes up for your attitude problem?

89
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,360
No.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,399
Then why haven't you handed in your self-criticism yet?

91
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,600
I wrote it a long time ago.

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,160
You really came prepared.

93
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,079
Brother Ming

94
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,439
Practice your handwriting, this, this...

95
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,519
Alright.

96
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,560
Since your attitude has changed,

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,399
and you've written the self-reflection,

98
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,279
go back and wait for further notice.

99
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,720
Wait for notice.

100
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,319
What else can you do?

101
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,720
What more do you want?

102
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,680
Big brother

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
There are so many pens here, and you don't take any.

104
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,439
You said to just leave one here.

105
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,360
It's so obvious.

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,399
Isn't it out of reach over there?

107
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,959
My fault, my fault.

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,319
Next time, I'll put it somewhere easier to find.

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,959
Oh, right.

110
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,120
By the way, just letting you know.

111
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,439
They found Cheng Yunhao.

112
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,519
He was sent home.

113
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,519
Really?

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,879
Where did they find him?

115
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,800
Not telling you.

116
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,480
No, come on, tell me.

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm working.

118
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,079
Hurry up and go.

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
Alright, I'm leaving then.

120
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,560
Bye.

121
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll wait for your notice.

122
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,120
Just wait.

123
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,160
Yu Peng returned to the rented apartment.

124
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,879
He didn't know what to do with Cheng Yunhao.

125
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,279
He thought about finding a place to deal with it.

126
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,439
So he put the child in the car.

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
He drove along the ring road for a while.

128
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
He arrived at Mapo.

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,839
He took the child out and threw him into a well.

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
He had just walked a few steps away

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,720
when he heard the child crying from the well.

132
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,319
He realized this wouldn't work.

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
There was a risk of being discovered.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,439
He thought about making more money with the child.

135
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,199
So he sold the child to a family in the mountains that very night.

136
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,560
When the child was found the day before yesterday,

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,720
that family still wouldn't admit it.

138
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,600
They insisted the child was their own.

139
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,879
Blood and DNA samples were taken on the spot.

140
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,120
Only then did they finally admit it.

141
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,600
Have some water.

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,079
Can you wash this bowl for me?

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,879
Hurry up.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,879
There are so many—wash them all?

145
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,160
The dish soap is on the cabinet.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Ziming

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Thanks for your hard work.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,720
I asked Lao Lu to make two bowls of noodles.

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,920
Let's just make do with this for now.

150
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,360
Brother Lei

151
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,399
Your desk looks familiar.

152
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,959
I've gotten used to using it.

153
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,120
I swapped one from the team.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Brother Lei

155
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,720
Do you know Yu Peng?

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,959
I know.

157
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,399
Then do you know about the child?

158
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,439
I was just about to tell you this in person.

159
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,959
Let me tell you some good news.

160
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,799
Your sister-in-law is pregnant again.

161
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,399
Really?

162
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
How long has it been?

163
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,000
Three months.

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,799
Come on, come on.

165
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,039
We have to drink to this.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,279
You're still amazing.

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,000
Cheers!

168
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,399
Come in.

169
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,759
Captain Huang.

170
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,720
Ziming.

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,519
You wanted to see me?

172
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,519
You seem to be in a good mood today.

173
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,600
Rewrite this self-criticism.

174
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,320
How else am I supposed to write it?

175
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,840
Wait, didn’t you call me back to work?

176
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Yes.

177
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,200
But work is work,

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,960
and self-criticism is another matter. They’re separate things.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Then, um...

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,879
So, how should I write it?

181
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,799
Like this—

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,399
You need to—

183
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,159
Make it more insightful.

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,759
And more sincere.

185
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,240
Really pour your heart out.

186
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,080
It should be no less than five thousand words.

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,279
Five thousand words?

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,440
Ten thousand would be even better.

189
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
What’s wrong, feeling a bit emotional?

190
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,039
Not satisfied?

191
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,600
I wouldn’t dare.

192
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Hurry up and go.

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
What are you standing here for?

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,720
Waiting for me to give you

195
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
a banner for your glorious return to the team?

196
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
No, Captain Huang.

197
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,759
I’m the only one left in our team now.

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,679
What am I supposed to do?

199
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,000
How am I supposed to do it?

200
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,440
This is easy. Come on.

201
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,320
Look.

202
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,559
The team just recruited two rookies a couple of days ago.

203
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
This one is in training right now.

204
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,559
This kid

205
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,519
is following Zhao Dali for field practice.

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,159
You can go to Zhao Dali's place.

207
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,559
Help him out with his case.

208
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,600
And mentor him a bit while you're at it.

209
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,600
Alright, got it.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm heading out then.

211
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,679
Go ahead.

212
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,519
Don't forget to write your self-reflection.

213
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,879
I'll write it, for sure.

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm off, Captain Huang.

215
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,519
Five thousand words!

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,320
It's 4:30 in the afternoon.

217
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,960
And look at this.

218
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
Are you crazy?

219
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
What are you looking at?

220
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,759
You're back.

221
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Yeah, I'm back.

222
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,759
Now I'm working under you.

223
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
Not too happy about it, huh?

224
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,600
I wouldn't dare.

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,399
It was Old Huang who insisted on bringing you in.

226
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,159
Actually, I need to go to the victim's house.

227
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:55,919
Let's go together.

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,480
Why are you just standing there? Call him over.

229
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,080
Brother Ming.

230
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,879
Brother Ming.

231
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,399
Li Yugang, just graduated from the police academy.

232
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,519
You know.

233
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,519
This is his first case.

234
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
Why don't you show Brother Ming the video first.

235
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
Wu Hai and I will go over there first.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,960
You two come over together in a bit.

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,600
Alright.

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,519
Tell me about the case.

239
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
A man from Pacific New City reported a case.

240
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,080
He said his wife was missing.

241
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,720
But then suddenly,

242
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,120
they found his wife's body.

243
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
He instantly went from being the victim's family

244
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,879
to being a suspect.

245
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,759
Hold on a second.

246
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,919
Start from the beginning.

247
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,600
Okay.

248
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,000
From where?

249
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,720
Start from when she was reported missing.

250
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,600
What day was that?

251
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,799
October 5th, about two weeks ago.

252
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,320
When was the body discovered?

253
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,840
The body was found yesterday.

254
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Where was it found? How did she die?

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
In a remote bush in Dongqing.

256
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
The autopsy report isn't out yet.

257
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,919
But there was a blunt force injury on her head.

258
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,399
The estimated time of death is about five days ago.

259
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,399
What was said on the day the case was reported?

260
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,600
We went to collect evidence that night.

261
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
We collected traces inside and took blood samples.

262
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,039
Where was the blood sample taken from?

263
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,240
From the corner of their kitchen counter.

264
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,440
And from the floor.

265
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,240
It was later confirmed

266
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,440
that it was the victim's blood.

267
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,399
What about footprints? Fingerprints?

268
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,320
No other footprints or fingerprints were found.

269
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,480
What did Dali just tell you to show me?

270
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,200
This.

271
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,200
This

272
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
The last time she entered the residential complex

273
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,360
was at 4:30 in the afternoon

274
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,720
After that, she took the elevator home

275
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,840
and never came out again

276
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,600
Were there any other suspicious people coming or going?

277
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
We checked everyone, there were none

278
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,080
No

279
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,600
So that means she stayed at home

280
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
and then just vanished into thin air

281
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
Brother Dali and I have watched this video over and over.

282
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
But we still didn't see how she got out.

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,799
At first,

284
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,440
we suspected it was a kidnapping for ransom.

285
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,039
Because her husband, although young,

286
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,159
is actually quite wealthy.

287
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
He started a big company in the internet industry.

288
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,399
He's working on getting it listed.

289
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,399
So kidnapping for money made sense.

290
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,799
But we never got any ransom calls.

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,960
Later, Brother Dali found something on their home computer.

292
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
He discovered some suspicious browsing history.

293
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,279
Things like "killing wife," "hiring a hitman,"

294
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,200
and "how to make someone disappear without a trace."

295
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,080
Also, the person who reported the case—

296
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,919
her husband's Baidu account—

297
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,559
had logged into forums about hiring hitmen.

298
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,000
What's her husband's name?

299
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Tang Lin.

300
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,000
Ming, fasten your seatbelt.

301
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,840
Hold on tight.

302
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,399
Don't worry about me, I know this car better than you.

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,039
Slow down, slow down.

304
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,480
You bought your driver's license, didn't you?

305
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,720
Brother Li

306
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Brother Li

307
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
Here he comes.

308
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,039
This is the study.

309
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
This is the bedroom.

310
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,080
How many years have they been married?

311
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,480
Ten years.

312
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,480
Ten years.

313
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,240
They don't even have a single wedding photo.

314
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,919
I guess intellectuals aren't into that kind of thing.

315
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,639
And over here,

316
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,200
there are two bloodstains here.

317
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,159
One is on this corner.

318
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,879
And another one is on the floor here.

319
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,159
Looks like there was a struggle here.

320
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,039
Li Yugang.

321
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,919
Let me use your head for a second. What for?

322
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,679
Just for a moment.

323
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,320
A bit lower.

324
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,519
Be gentle, man.

325
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,559
That's about right.

326
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,200
This mark looks

327
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,639
like someone grabbed another person's head

328
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,159
and slammed it.

329
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,720
That's why we suspect it's a kidnapping.

330
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,559
You can get up.

331
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,600
What do you think?

332
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,759
In cases like this, it's usually the husband.

333
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,919
Let's see.

334
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,279
That's a lot of blood.

335
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,639
Then it's very likely the body was dismembered right here.

336
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,159
What's the rush? We don't even know if it's human blood yet.

337
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,759
That's true, he was going to dismember the body here.

338
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,879
He cleaned up this place thoroughly.

339
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,039
The kitchen should be cleaned as well.

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,480
Think about it again.

341
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,679
He graduated from a prestigious university.

342
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,039
He's not lacking in intelligence, right?

343
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,240
He's definitely smarter than me.

344
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,360
If you had killed someone,

345
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,919
wouldn't you delete your browsing history on your computer?

346
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,919
He studied the internet field himself.

347
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,879
Brother Li, what do you plan to do?

348
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,440
Anyway, he's the prime suspect right now.

349
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,879
I'll go back to the station and ask the boss for a summons.

350
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,679
Summon Tang Lin.

351
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,279
Then you go back first.

352
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,240
I'll look around a bit more.

353
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,720
Alright, thanks for your hard work.

354
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
What about me, Brother Dali?

355
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,679
You? Stay here and keep Ming company.

356
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,919
Don't follow me, okay?

357
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,559
Come on, Brother Dali.

358
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,360
Brother Dali and I have already checked this area.

359
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,320
There are no signs of a body being dragged.

360
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,720
We also checked the surveillance footage on the first floor.

361
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
There's no sign of a body being moved either.

362
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,799
Unless he dismembered the body.

363
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,080
Everything has been checked over here as well.

364
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Everything is normal.

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,600
The property manager said this neighbor has been away on a business trip for a while.

366
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,440
Did they say when they'll be back?

367
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,440
I don't know.

368
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
I couldn't get through when I called.

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,320
The phone was out of service.

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,639
Then you all showed up.

371
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,039
Go on.

372
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
I thought it was a kidnapping.

373
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,839
So I waited at home every day for a call.

374
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,240
But the kidnapper never called.

375
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,680
Instead, I got a call from you.

376
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,319
You said a body had been found and asked me to identify it.

377
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
I have a really good relationship with her.

378
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,559
We were college classmates.

379
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,559
I have no reason to kill her.

380
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,519
You've already asked me many times.

381
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,119
First of all,

382
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,759
I want to thank my team.

383
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,319
Thank you all

384
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,119
for always standing by me through thick and thin.

385
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,119
Secondly,

386
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,519
I want to thank my investors.

387
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,960
Thank you

388
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
for always trusting me.

389
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Next,

390
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,319
I want to thank my wife.

391
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,920
Thank you for your endless understanding and support.

392
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,119
Without you,

393
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,359
I wouldn't be who I am today.

394
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,359
Zhang Fan

395
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,519
Thank you.

396
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,000
They look like a couple, but they're not really close.

397
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,519
Really?

398
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,519
The forensics department has finished the analysis.

399
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,480
The blood in their bathtub isn't human.

400
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,319
How does Tang Lin explain that?

401
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,519
He said he doesn't know.

402
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,119
That's strange.

403
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,079
You know, they don't even have kids.

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,559
So why did she become a full-time housewife?

405
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,039
He said it was her own choice.

406
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,680
To take care of his career and the family, I guess.

407
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
No elderly people, no children.

408
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,519
Tang Lin doesn't go back often either.

409
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,480
What is she taking care of, then?

410
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,920
That's why he's the biggest suspect.

411
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,880
You think Tang Lin did it.

412
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
You think he didn't do it.

413
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,920
But if he did do it,

414
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,880
how did he move the body out?

415
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,839
He must have his own way.

416
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,480
Has the autopsy report come out?

417
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,240
Three o'clock, right?

418
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,119
Okay, got it.

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,200
Alright.

420
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,160
Li Yugang

421
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
They found that classmate Zhang Fan.

422
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
They arranged to meet at a café in the afternoon.

423
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,519
It's at 3 p.m., just right for you to go.

424
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,799
You can take the opportunity to learn from Ziming how to conduct an interview.

425
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,359
Okay.

426
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,240
Try not to talk too much later.

427
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Be steady.

428
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,799
Okay.

429
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
Between her and Tang Lin, who pursued whom?

430
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,440
She liked Tang Lin first.

431
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
Back then, so many people were after her.

432
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
Writing her love letters and all that.

433
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,839
But she didn't even bat an eye.

434
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,640
She only had eyes for Tang Lin.

435
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,200
Why?

436
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,400
Because he's handsome.

437
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,640
And he's refined.

438
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
He's different from other guys.

439
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,480
As it turns out,

440
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
she didn't choose wrong.

441
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,039
Among all of us,

442
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
she's living the best.

443
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,799
Do the two of them usually have any conflicts?

444
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
I haven't heard of any conflicts.

445
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,160
She said the two of them are quite loving.

446
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,839
Tang Lin is indeed very good to her.

447
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Occasionally at class reunions

448
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,559
you can tell as well.

449
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,960
Tang Lin takes good care of her.

450
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,119
Sorry.

451
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,440
I should get back to work.

452
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,559
They'll dock my pay if I'm late.

453
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,559
Alright, thank you.

454
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,839
If you need anything else, just let me know.

455
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,079
Hello?

456
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,440
Yes?

457
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,839
The bill, please.

458
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,559
Alright.

459
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,400
Were you just talking about Zhang Fan?

460
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,079
You know her?

461
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,839
She often comes here alone.

462
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,960
She sits by the window.

463
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,319
She'll sit there all afternoon.

464
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,519
Have you ever talked to her?

465
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,480
Yes, I have.

466
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,000
After she found out my daughter was a test-tube baby,

467
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,359
she kept asking me about it.

468
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,599
But that was a long time ago.

469
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,680
How long ago was that?

470
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,559
It must have been a year or two.

471
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,119
Brother Ming, pretty steady, right?

472
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,480
Super steady.

473
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,799
He doesn't even get up to pay the bill.

474
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,400
The community police called.

475
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,119
They said Tang Lin's neighbor is back.

476
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,759
Let's go take a look.

477
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,200
Let's go.

478
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,200
Who is it? Coming.

479
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,160
Hello.

480
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:30,440
We're from the criminal police.

481
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,640
We'd like to ask you about the neighbors next door.

482
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,440
Please cooperate with us.

483
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,640
Officer,

484
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,799
I want to ask,

485
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,720
what exactly happened to their family?

486
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,480
Several groups of police have come recently.

487
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,720
Weren't you on a business trip?

488
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
How do you know several groups came?

489
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,319
Um, um...

490
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,799
Our house...

491
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,799
has, has surveillance cameras.

492
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,599
What's in this suitcase?

493
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,400
A corpse.

494
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,279
Are you stupid?

495
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,160
If she disappeared that night,

496
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,680
and was killed here,

497
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
then who was the person who just died in the bushes?

498
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:29,920
That's true.

499
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,279
It's been such a long time.

500
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,880
Also,

501
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,519
let me ask you,

502
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,519
how much does an average adult weigh?

503
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,480
At least a hundred jin, right?

504
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,039
At least a hundred jin.

505
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,799
A person that heavy

506
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,720
packed into a suitcase like this,

507
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,559
could you really lift it so easily

508
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,519
with just two hands?

509
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,039
Probably not.

510
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,039
And also,

511
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,880
look at the height of this peephole.

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,319
I noticed it at the time.

513
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,079
A normal peephole is about this high, right?

514
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,440
About right.

515
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,200
How high is this?

516
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,480
One meter seventy.

517
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,799
A little over one meter sixty-five.

518
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,799
Now look at that person's shoe heels.

519
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,000
At least three to five centimeters.

520
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,799
So how tall is this person?

521
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,599
With shoes on, this person is less than one meter eighty.

522
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,799
How tall is Tang Lin?

523
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,240
Tang Lin is over one meter eighty.

524
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,960
If he wears these shoes,

525
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,079
he'd be almost one meter ninety.

526
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,039
How tall is his wife?

527
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,799
His wife is a little over one meter seventy.

528
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,079
So this person isn't Tang Lin.

529
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,039
It's Zhang Fan.

530
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,079
But Zhang Fan is dead.

531
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,400
Tang Lin identified the body.

532
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,799
It's easy for someone to change their appearance.

533
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,799
The hard part is changing their height.

534
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,640
It's obvious that this person isn't Tang Lin.

535
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,119
So I suspect

536
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,279
that Zhang Fan knew the neighbor had installed a security camera

537
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,759
and therefore staged the scene.

538
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,839
Also, at the entrance of the residential complex,

539
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,039
the surveillance footage shows that at 9:15,

540
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,319
this person appeared.

541
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,519
But there's no footage of them in the elevator.

542
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,960
Because she went in the direction of the stairs.

543
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,440
If, as you said,

544
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,640
she staged the scene herself,

545
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,559
then what happened next makes even less sense.

546
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,519
How did she die?

547
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,799
Did she crush herself to death?

548
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,839
In any case,

549
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
we still can't rule out Tang Lin as a suspect.

550
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,400
We also can't rule out the possibility of robbery and murder.

551
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Here.

552
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,720
I bought some buns, hurry up and have a bite.

553
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,839
Alright, alright, have a sip too.

554
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
Is that really necessary?

555
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,559
There's a lead from Hongqi Village.

556
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,359
Someone saw our investigation notice.

557
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,279
They said a woman some time ago

558
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,559
rented a house in their village.

559
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,440
She looked like Zhang Fan.

560
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,680
Then let's go right away.

561
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,480
Captain Zhao

562
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,039
Captain Zhao

563
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
The victim's ID card

564
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,079
There's still a train ticket.

565
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,039
This number is a real-name SIM card from Guangdong.

566
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,440
The owner of the phone is Yu Hailin.

567
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,480
This number previously

568
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,559
Called Zhang Fan's phone three times before.

569
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,640
There are call records.

570
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,000
Has been living here for almost half a month.

571
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Five hundred a month.

572
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,559
There haven't been any incidents.

573
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,359
Talk.

574
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,200
How did you meet Zhang Fan?

575
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,799
Huh? What do you mean?

576
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,799
I don't understand.

577
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,759
Zhang Fan

578
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
We met online.

579
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:12,920
Start from the beginning.

580
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,200
How did you meet online?

581
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,279
We met in a chatroom last October.

582
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,119
I thought she was interesting to talk to.

583
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:22,839
And then?

584
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,200
La-later on...

585
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,720
We just chatted.

586
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,759
The two of us would chat when we had nothing to do.

587
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,559
We'd chat whenever we were free.

588
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,440
And then...

589
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:31,880
We started an online relationship.

590
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,640
Have you two met before?

591
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,000
No, we haven't.

592
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,359
We've never met in person.

593
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,880
We just exchanged photos in a chatroom.

594
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,079
What did you two talk about?

595
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Just talked about things going on in her family.

596
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
She said—

597
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,599
She said she wasn't happy with her husband.

598
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
And wanted to live somewhere else.

599
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
So then, the two of us—

600
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,720
We decided to run away together.

601
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,000
What day did you plan for?

602
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,960
The eighteenth.

603
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,000
I waited for her at the station for two days.

604
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,720
I didn't see her at all.

605
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,000
When was the last time you two were in contact?

606
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,599
Let me think, the last time—

607
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,000
It was the thirteenth.

608
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,799
She contacted me using a landline.

609
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,839
Think carefully again.

610
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,640
Between the thirteenth and the eighteenth—

611
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,960
Did you two have any contact?

612
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:20,880
No.

613
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,079
She told me not to contact her.

614
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,559
She told me her previous phone number—

615
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,480
She wasn't using it anymore.

616
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,359
After that, she didn't want me to reach out to her.

617
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,160
She told me, she wanted me—

618
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,119
She wanted me to just wait.

619
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,359
Then she contacted me first.

620
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Does she know what you do?

621
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,640
I...

622
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,279
I told her I do business.

623
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,920
You knew she had a husband.

624
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,960
And you still wanted to elope with her.

625
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,599
Well, I thought she had money.

626
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,000
I... I need money for my business.

627
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,119
So I told her,

628
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,000
"Why don't you come and invest in me?"

629
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,079
It's just that simple.

630
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,480
I didn't do anything else.

631
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,960
No, she told you I was here.

632
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,559
She tricked me into coming here.

633
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,160
I'm the victim.

634
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,319
I don't know anything.

635
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,119
You're Tang Lin's assistant.

636
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:08,839
Yes.

637
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,279
I've worked with Mr. Tang for seven years.

638
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,839
Where was Mr. Tang on the 13th?

639
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,960
The 13th?

640
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,640
Mr. Tang and I were at the company the whole time.

641
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
The whole day?

642
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:20,680
Yes.

643
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,440
Who else was there?

644
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,279
And also Xiao Liu from the sales department

645
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,440
What about after work? At night?

646
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,920
At night

647
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,440
We were also at the office at night

648
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,640
We were working overtime that day

649
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,799
Who else was there?

650
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,799
Just the two of us

651
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,640
Just you two?

652
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
That day, Mr. Tang

653
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,680
Was there anything different from usual?

654
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,000
Nothing was different, everything was normal

655
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,519
Alright, thank you

656
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,480
If we need anything else, we'll contact you

657
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,359
Please go ahead with your work

658
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:47,680
Okay

659
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,680
Ming, I really need to use the bathroom.

660
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
Why are you making such a fuss? Hurry up.

661
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,279
Brother Ming

662
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,279
Why did you take so long in the bathroom?

663
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:07,880
They caught him.

664
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,599
Caught who?

665
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
They caught the culprit.

666
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,359
What? What culprit?

667
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,680
The one who killed Zhang Fan.

668
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,240
Who did it?

669
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,480
A drifter.

670
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,759
The Xiushan District Criminal Police caught a robber.

671
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,720
While questioning him,

672
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,319
he confessed to this.

673
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,400
What happened?

674
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,720
According to his own confession,

675
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
on the night of October 13th,

676
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,759
he wanted to commit another crime.

677
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,920
He was wandering around near Dongqing.

678
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,400
Let go

679
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,519
You bitch

680
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,079
I'll kill you

681
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
I'll kill you.

682
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:44,599
Brother Ming

683
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,960
Go ahead.

684
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,480
She risked her life to protect these things.

685
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,359
Was it worth it?

686
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,519
Was she really protecting just these things?

687
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,599
These things are her future.

688
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,759
They're her days to come, her hope.

689
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,119
That's true.

690
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,960
Other than these, she has nothing left.

691
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,799
Is this person connected to Tang Lin?

692
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,359
We investigated, there's no connection.

693
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
I think she just wanted to get back at her husband.

694
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,000
And in the end...

695
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,039
She got what was coming.

696
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,240
Why would she want revenge?

697
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,039
I treated her so well.

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
But she wanted to hurt me.

699
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,039
She wanted me dead.

700
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:18,720
So...

701
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,119
Why do you think she did it?

702
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,160
She was your wife, after all.

703
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,880
She got killed.

704
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,279
Aren't you sad?

705
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
She was with someone else.

706
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,200
And I should feel sad for her?

707
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,799
Why was she with someone else?

708
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,559
Don't you know the reason?

709
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,799
What do you mean?

710
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,799
You really want us to spell it out?

711
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
If you won't say it,

712
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,599
the autopsy report will.

713
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,759
Do you know why she hated you?

714
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,440
You lied to her and used her.

715
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,799
Why do you have to marry her?

716
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,480
I met Zhang Fan back in college.

717
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,200
She was the one who pursued me.

718
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,079
At that time, I thought

719
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,720
maybe I should try dating someone.

720
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,640
Once I started, it lasted for several years.

721
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,160
In the end, I reached the age to talk about marriage.

722
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,880
But both sets of parents were pressuring us.

723
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,160
At that time, I was starting my own business.

724
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,319
I thought the timing was right.

725
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,079
But on our wedding night,

726
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,880
I still couldn't get over that mental hurdle.

727
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,039
Gradually, our feelings faded.

728
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,680
But I didn't dare get a divorce.

729
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,920
But I was really good to her.

730
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,319
She had trouble finding a job.

731
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,680
So I told her I would support her.

732
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,000
She liked shopping, spending money, and going out.

733
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,319
I satisfied all her wishes.

734
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,319
I even gave her a credit card of her own.

735
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,720
If she wanted the moon,

736
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,920
I would never just give her stars to fool her.

737
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,519
I did everything a husband should do.

738
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,799
But it's true,

739
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I let her down.

740
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,599
Five thousand two hundred characters, huh?

741
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,200
You can tell you put effort into it.

742
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,000
Look, this is clearly handwritten.

743
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,440
Your previous one looked like it was written with your feet.

744
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
Come, let me introduce you.

745
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,079
Liu Ziming.

746
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,920
This is the Xia Yu I told you about last time.

747
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,000
Just finished his internship.

748
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
Hello, Ming, I'm Xia Yu.

749
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,199
No need to call me Ming.

750
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,360
From now on, you and Li Yugang will follow Ziming.

751
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
The three of you will be a team.

752
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,559
Take good care of them.

753
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,199
Don't embarrass your mentor.

754
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,320
Hello, mentor.

755
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,679
Well, I...

756
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,239
I'll head out.

757
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,119
I'm leaving now.

758
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,639
Go find your mentor.

759
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,239
You two, listen up.

760
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,639
There are two kinds of people.

761
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,239
One kind

762
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,519
doesn't know what they should do.

763
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:42,679
They just muddle through.

764
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:44,480
The other kind

765
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,360
works diligently

766
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,039
and digs deep into their work.

767
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,920
If you want to just muddle through here with me,

768
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,400
then get lost right now.

769
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,039
Find somewhere else as soon as possible.

770
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,920
Let's not waste anyone's time.

771
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,239
Li Yugang, you've been following me for a few days now.

772
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,280
You know as well

773
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,639
that with me,

774
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,440
Liu Ziming.

775
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,199
What are you doing, acting like Brother Wei?

776
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,320
You actually do look quite like him.

777
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,639
Why are you here?

778
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,199
I want to show you something.

779
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,639
An admission letter.

780
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,119
Shanghai Media University.

781
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,599
Not bad, you.

782
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,599
Of course.

783
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,920
Who is this? He's pretty handsome.

784
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,119
Aren't you going to introduce him?

785
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,239
Oh, him?

786
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,239
That's Xia Yu.

787
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,199
I'm pretty handsome too.

788
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
You could ask about me as well.

789
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,800
My name is Li Yugang.

790
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,199
We're both his apprentices.

791
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,280
Alright, enough joking around.

792
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Come on, let me treat you to a meal.

793
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,199
Let's celebrate.

794
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:32,679
That's so nice.

795
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,440
Let's go, let's go.

796
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,280
Master, take us with you.

797
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,480
Come on, let's go.

798
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,760
The dishes you ordered

799
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,519
are all things your master doesn't like.

800
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,880
Then Lei, could you help us order a couple more?

801
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,159
Alright.

802
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,280
Here, let me wipe that for you.

803
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,199
Here.

804
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,599
Don't invade other people's privacy.

805
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,679
Let me take a look.

806
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,280
Can I borrow a light?

807
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,000
What for?

808
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,280
I got into college.

809
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,639
Shouldn't I at least tell my mom?

810
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,800
I want to ask you something.

811
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,440
Do you hate your dad?

812
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,000
I really want to hate him.

813
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,239
They both have reasons to be hated.

814
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,679
My mom's side hates my dad.

815
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,199
My dad's side hates my mom.

816
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,519
But I just can't hate anyone.

817
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,239
When I think about it, I just feel sorry for everyone.

818
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,119
My mentor once told me something.

819
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,119
The case will end.

820
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,119
But the pain won't.

821
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
The day it happened,

822
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,480
my mom was dragged away with a sack over her head.

823
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,519
My dad was taken away too.

824
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,239
At that time, only a neighbor stayed with me.

825
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:06,800
Later, he even fell asleep.

826
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,800
I saw blood all over the floor and walls.

827
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,280
I started wiping it with a rag.

828
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,800
I could wipe it off the floor.

829
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,800
But no matter what, I couldn't get it off the walls.

830
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,480
Then I took a knife.

831
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,800
I scraped the paint off the wall bit by bit.

832
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,719
The next morning, Lao Wei came to see me.

833
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,039
He said a lot to me.

834
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,280
But I couldn't listen to anyone at that time.

835
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,280
Every day I just fought and skipped school.

836
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,239
Did nothing decent.

837
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,239
But he still kept looking after me.

838
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,360
Always looking after me.

839
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,880
On the day the college entrance exam results came out,

840
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,199
he didn't sleep the whole night.

841
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,960
Master, why don't we just go up and catch him?

842
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,360
He has a gun and he's in a residential area—how can we catch him?

843
00:38:59,159 --> 00:38:59,760
What are you doing?

844
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,599
Bottle.

845
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,440
Aren't you disgusting?

846
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
Didn't you already throw it up ahead?

847
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,360
He’s coming down.

848
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,360
Follow him, quickly!

849
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,480
This operation to capture An Pinghai

850
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,199
is highly prioritized by the city bureau.

851
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,400
Our team has been specially assigned

852
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,840
to fully assist the city’s anti-narcotics unit.

853
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,400
Everyone, stay alert.

854
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,519
We must complete the mission.

855
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:51,599
Drive faster, keep up with him!

856
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,719
Don’t worry, watch me.

857
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,639
Driving skills don’t determine speed.

858
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,280
Engine displacement determines speed.

859
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:58,760
I don’t buy that.

860
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,360
You two

861
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,079
Are you ready to get scolded?

862
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,519
Go ahead, being scolded doesn't hurt.

863
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,599
The car isn't good enough.

864
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,000
We lost him.

865
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,079
We tracked him for over two years and he just showed up.

866
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,599
And you actually lost him.

867
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,760
Unbelievable.

868
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,239
It's not that we didn't follow, Captain Huang.

869
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
It's our car that's the problem.

870
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,119
Besides, we only had a sketch.

871
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,119
We might not even know if it was really him.

872
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,559
Did we lose everything then?

873
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,320
I... I...

874
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,840
Did you spot him or not?

875
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,639
Did you blow your cover?

876
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,039
With our car, it's hard to blow our cover even if we tried.

877
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,039
Seriously, we can't even shift past second gear.

878
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,519
Is it something to be proud of that it's hard to blow our cover?

879
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,800
So it's an honor not to blow our cover, right?

880
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,119
Just one person like that,

881
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,840
and you still lost him.

882
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,480
These are the trainees you brought up?

883
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,840
This is how you carry out a mission?

884
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,440
Why don't you just tell those two to stop following me?

885
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,400
Captain Huang, Captain Huang

886
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,239
Don't be angry, don't worry.

887
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
I'll go to the traffic police to get the surveillance footage.

888
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,000
We'll track his movements.

889
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,280
Let's go.

890
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,639
Go where?

891
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,280
I'm not done scolding yet.

892
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,280
Alright, alright, I'm coming right away.

893
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,760
Weren't you just going to scold them? Why did you get physical?

894
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,679
Let me show you two how to relieve stress.

895
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,280
From Captain Huang's team.

896
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,400
Come.

897
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:55,679
Come on.

898
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:57,840
Watch closely.

899
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,320
You two go to the traffic police team first.

900
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,239
I'll come over in a bit.

901
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,239
What do you mean?

902
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:11,920
Idiot.

903
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,519
Sir, this way.

904
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,800
Please come in.

905
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,599
Come on, sis.

906
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:26,719
Sixth Brother.

907
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,239
Weizi.

908
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Sixth Brother, Sixth Brother.

909
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,880
Sixth Brother, I missed you so much.

910
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,920
You're sweating so much.

911
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,280
Come here, Weizi.

912
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,079
Good stuff.

913
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,480
What is it?

914
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,719
Sixth Brother

915
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,559
I don't touch this

916
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,679
candy

917
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,760
With this, drinking is even more fun
