1
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,280
Get in.

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,079
What are you doing? Don't move! What are you doing?

3
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,079
What are you doing?

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,560
Don't move.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
What are you guys doing?

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560
Is this how the police arrest people?

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,719
Move, move, move. Get over there.

8
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,599
Get up, get up! What are you doing?

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
What do you mean "what are we doing"? You know exactly why.

10
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm just waiting for a ride here.

11
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,799
You—you must have the wrong person.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,159
I'm telling you, cooperate.

13
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,039
Cooperating is one thing.

14
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,599
Not cooperating is a whole different matter.

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong person.

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,479
Let me tell you something.

17
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,360
Think carefully about it yourself.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,919
Which is better, which is worse?

19
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm not going to waste words with you.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,879
Open the car window.

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Come on, take a look.

22
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,280
You understand it clearly this time, right?

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,360
Do you know that person just now?

24
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,199
No, I don't.

25
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,280
Alright, I'll tell you.

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,479
His name is Ge Xiaohui.

27
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,120
He knows you.

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,159
He said An Pinghai sent him to deliver goods to you.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,159
An who? I don't know him either.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
Huang Xin, let me be clear with you.

31
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,719
Whether you admit it now or not,

32
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,639
or whether you cooperate or not,

33
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,199
it doesn't matter to us anymore.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680
Ge Xiaohui is cooperating with us now.

35
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,240
An Pinghai is already our target.

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
We'll arrest him sooner or later.

37
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,120
Do you think he can get away?

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
I'm giving you a chance right now.

39
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,360
If you cooperate,

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,960
just tell An Pinghai the goods have been received.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,159
If you don't cooperate,

42
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,000
we'll take you away right now.

43
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,479
Are you taking it or not?

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,199
I'm asking you one last time.

45
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,479
Are you taking it or not?

46
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll take it.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Speak properly.

48
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,520
If you mess this up, it's all on you.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,280
Do you understand?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Hello?

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,000
What took you so long?

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,879
I was in the bathroom and didn't hear.

53
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,919
I got the stuff, it went pretty smoothly.

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Next time, even if you're peeing, you have to answer my call.

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,319
I checked the number. It's useless.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,519
How are things on An Pinghai's side?

57
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,480
Has his suspicion been cleared?

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Hard to say.

59
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,879
I think he'll look for Ge Xiaohui again soon.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
He'll have him deliver goods to Zhang Shengli.

61
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,639
First, to test him further.

62
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,680
Second, to prepare for his next move.

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,399
Hurry and bring Zhang Shengli over too.

64
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,279
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

65
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,000
Understood.

66
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,639
Old Ge

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
Don't move, don't move.

68
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,680
Who is it?

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't move.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,000
Get up, get up.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
What's going on?

72
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
What are you doing?

73
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,199
Why are you shouting?

74
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,360
What are you doing?

75
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,240
Master

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,920
What's your name?

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,920
What's your name?

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Zhang Shengli

79
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,439
It's you. Come, take him away.

80
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,120
Go, go.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,399
Take it back.

82
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,959
Don't move. Don't move.

83
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,519
Still not talking, huh?

84
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,079
Don't pretend to be mute here.

85
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,079
I'm telling you,

86
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,360
we know everything that's going on.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,120
Do you understand?

88
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,759
You can choose not to cooperate with us.

89
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,079
But that won't stop me from handing you over to the authorities.

90
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you get it?

91
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,000
But if you're smart,

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,120
you'll choose to help us catch An Pinghai.

93
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,680
When the judge sentences you,

94
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,800
we can choose to help you get a lighter sentence.

95
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,600
Do you understand?

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Although in every stage of An Pinghai's drug trafficking operation

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
each of you had your own responsibilities,

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,519
there are still main offenders and accomplices.

99
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,319
Our main target is An Pinghai,

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,519
not a small-time player like you.

101
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,639
Think about it yourself.

102
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,319
Are you still trying to hold out?

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,160
Do you know how we caught you?

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
I'll be honest with you.

105
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,399
We've already arrested Ge Xiaohui.

106
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,959
He’s cooperating with us now.

107
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,879
Impossible.

108
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
That guy’s a bigger deal than me.

109
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,480
Loosen up, will you? Don’t move.

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,360
I can’t run. Don’t move.

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,120
The more you move, the tighter it gets.

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,959
I can’t run.

113
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,000
Where do you think you are?

114
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,839
Do you know someone with the last name Huang?

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Who? Huang Xin?

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,519
Arresting you, arresting those two,

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,439
it’s all to catch An Pinghai.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,959
Let me tell you,

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
An Pinghai might call you soon.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you cooperate, it’ll count as a merit for you.

121
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,560
If you don’t cooperate,

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,759
we’ll catch An Pinghai sooner or later anyway.

123
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,079
Because those two have already cooperated.

124
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,959
I’m giving you a chance now.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,959
It’s up to you whether you seize it.

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,959
Do you hear me?

127
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,120
We’re definitely going to catch An Pinghai.

128
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
It’s just a matter of time.

129
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,959
If it’s sooner, you can get leniency.

130
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,920
If it’s later, you’ll both go down together.

131
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,199
Have you made up your mind?

132
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,519
I'm asking you one last time—have you decided?

133
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,079
Hello, we've got the goods.

134
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,720
We can't take these three back yet.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
An Pinghai could contact them at any time.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,480
He might call them to get in touch.

137
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,560
I suggest

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,639
we temporarily detain these three at the hotel.

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,720
Just in case.

140
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes.

141
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,240
Understood.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,519
Master.

143
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,439
Master, um, Master—

144
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,959
Can I go wash my hair?

145
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,680
Forget it.

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
My head itches.

147
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,720
An Pinghai could contact you again at any time.

148
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I know what to say.

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,919
Xia Yu, the food is here. Let's eat first.

150
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,440
Thank you.

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,120
No problem.

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Come on.

153
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,279
Master, let me add this for you.

154
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,200
Isn't there rice? Why make instant noodles?

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,480
Longevity noodles—instant noodles count as longevity noodles too.

156
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,600
Happy birthday.

157
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
I was wondering why your shimu called me.

158
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,720
Happy birthday.

159
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,720
Stop messing around.

160
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,039
Let's eat.

161
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,879
Nothing good here.

162
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,559
Let's just make do with this.

163
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,879
Once we catch An Pinghai and get back to the station,

164
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,720
I'll pay to get you something better.

165
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,080
Can I have a pair of chopsticks?

166
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,200
How about I feed you?

167
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Didn't school teach you what a criminal suspect is?

168
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,559
Chopsticks won't work.

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,559
Let's just make do with a spoon.

170
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
Bring some noodles.

171
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,360
Eat some more.

172
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,399
I'll have to trouble you again in a bit.

173
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,679
After you finish eating, get a good rest.

174
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:13,960
Thank you.

175
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,559
Are you two having noodles?

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,799
Give me some, too.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,799
That's enough, just leave me some soup.

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,039
Master

179
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,080
Get ready.

180
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,679
I'll be back soon.

181
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,519
This time, I hit the jackpot.

182
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,679
Okay, Brother Hai.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Then when you come back, we'll throw you a welcome party.

184
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,639
No need, let's keep it low-key.

185
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,960
I don't even know what's going on.

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
My right eyelid has been twitching a lot these past couple of days.

187
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,519
Maybe you're just happy.

188
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,519
No, I have a bad feeling about it.

189
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,639
It's fine, um...

190
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,039
I'll go to the Dragon King Temple and burn two sticks of incense for you.

191
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,279
They say it's really effective there.

192
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,080
Alright, wait for my call for the details.

193
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,360
Okay.

194
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,360
Not bad.

195
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,320
Officer Liu

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
When you arrest Lao An this time,

197
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,480
you need to be careful.

198
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,639
Why?

199
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,879
Actually, before he left this time,

200
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,279
he was always suspicious and paranoid.

201
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,799
He was constantly uneasy.

202
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,080
He didn't just go back to his hometown to deliver goods this time.

203
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,000
He also went to get some weapons.

204
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,720
Really?

205
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,799
He's pretty ruthless.

206
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,639
Yesterday, he kept ordering me around.

207
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,799
That shows he's become even more suspicious.

208
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
So this time when he comes back,

209
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,600
he'll definitely be carrying a weapon.

210
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,440
If you try to catch him,

211
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,799
he'll fight to the death for sure.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,639
He's not that skinny, he should be a bit fatter.

213
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,759
And his mouth should be a bit bigger.

214
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,919
Go to the hotel and book me a new room.

215
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,159
On a different floor.

216
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,519
Okay.

217
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,559
That's about right.

218
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,559
Hello

219
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,679
Get me a car rental.

220
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:01,720
What kind of car do you want?

221
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,159
I'll give you a number. You'll know when you get there.

222
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,919
So where should I deliver the car?

223
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,600
Just keep it for now and wait for my call.

224
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Wait, you—

225
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,840
Ziming, hurry over here.

226
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,320
Our people are all around.

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,120
Don't get any ideas.

228
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,720
Don't make trouble for yourself.

229
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,519
I'll give you at most two minutes.

230
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,519
Get the key and come out immediately.

231
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,759
Do you understand?

232
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,720
Understood.

233
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,559
Captain Liu, things have come to this.

234
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,600
Of course I'll cooperate.

235
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,559
It's too tight.

236
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,039
Wait a moment.

237
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,759
Put this on first.

238
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,039
I'll loosen the cuffs for you when I get back.

239
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,639
Thanks.

240
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,359
Captain Huang

241
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,079
An Pinghai just called.

242
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,640
He said that after 7 p.m. tonight, Ge Xiaohui

243
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,200
shouldn't go anywhere.

244
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,359
He should stay in his room.

245
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,319
Okay.

246
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,960
What about Zhang Shengli?

247
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,759
No movement.

248
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:37,880
Here's what you do.

249
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,240
Go back and keep a close eye on him.

250
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,480
I'll report to the bureau now.

251
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,039
We'll try to take him down as soon as he enters the lobby.

252
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,759
Understood.

253
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,799
Welcome.

254
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,160
All spotters, stay alert.

255
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,279
Pay special attention to entrances and exits, especially those with stairs.

256
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,160
Keep a close watch for me.

257
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,680
Welcome.

258
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,720
Master.

259
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,480
Once this case is closed,

260
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,039
We should have a good meal together.

261
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,839
All you ever think about is eating.

262
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,799
Once we finish our task later,

263
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,519
Master has to hurry back.

264
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
He can still celebrate his wife's birthday, right?

265
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,039
That's true.

266
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,759
We really should have a good meal.

267
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,480
Otherwise, there won't even be energy left to kneel on the washboard at home.

268
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,519
Manager, what is this place?

269
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,519
The heat pump room.

270
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,519
Can someone get in there?

271
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,079
It's possible.

272
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,160
Zhao Dali, Zhao Dali.

273
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,119
Quick, send two people.

274
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,640
Go take a look at that heat pump room.

275
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Don't get exposed.

276
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,160
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

277
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,160
Captain Huang, there really is a pipe here.

278
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
It leads inside.

279
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,400
Hurry, hurry, move in!

280
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,160
Shoot! Shoot! Don't move!

281
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,240
Shoot!

282
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,079
Don't move.

283
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't move.

284
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,160
There's another gun.

285
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,039
Search him! Search him! Cuff him!

286
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,440
Don't move.

287
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,799
Cuff him!

288
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,920
Take away

289
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,359
Where did you come up from?

290
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,359
The ventilation duct.

291
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,960
They fired a gun.

292
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,960
Who opened it?

293
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,400
Anpinghai.

294
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,759
Don't move.

295
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,079
Turn around.

296
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,920
Are you okay?

297
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,839
I'm fine.

298
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,279
Okay.

299
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,480
That's good.

300
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,559
Alright.

301
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,359
Um...

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,680
Oh, right.

303
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,680
I'm still the only one on our team

304
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,839
who's ever been shot.

305
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,480
What did that cough just now mean?

306
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,119
You knew there was a vent there all along, didn't you?

307
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,839
I underestimated you, Ge Xiaohui.

308
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,839
Mission complete. Return to base.

309
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,599
What result?

310
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,000
You know it too.

311
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,720
Just come clean and confess.

312
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,400
Either way, it's a dead end.

313
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,279
Confess my ass.

314
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
Now that we're here, stop acting tough.

315
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,200
Just now,

316
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,079
I zoned out for a second.

317
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,079
If I hadn't zoned out, you'd be on the ground.

318
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,960
You wouldn't be sitting here talking to me.

319
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,799
You call that zoning out?

320
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,559
I had you pinned.

321
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,079
You didn't even shoot.

322
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,720
You just missed, that's all.

323
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,599
Don't act tough with me either.

324
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,519
I'm tougher than you.

325
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,880
You've got two guns in your hands.

326
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,519
I'm unarmed.

327
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,680
But I'm not the one lying down.

328
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
You're the one sitting here.

329
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
So what are you bragging about?

330
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,640
Kid, you're tougher than me.

331
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,599
Then let's each take two guns and see who's better.

332
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,720
Let's see who's scared.

333
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,400
To be honest,

334
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,319
I was afraid to arrest you.

335
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
But I was confident.

336
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,359
Because I'm a cop and you're a criminal.

337
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't believe you're not scared inside.

338
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,720
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here now.

339
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,880
Today you attacked the police with a gun.

340
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,319
There were 860 grams of meth in your bag.

341
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,200
And 2,240 grams of magu.

342
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Plus your previous cases.

343
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,720
We've been after you for two years.

344
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,359
There's nothing about you we don't know.

345
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,519
Just execute me, then.

346
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Wang Dejun.

347
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,519
That's on record too.

348
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
The cases you're carrying,

349
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,720
none of them are minor.

350
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,759
Let me interview you for a moment.

351
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,279
You were hiding so well.

352
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,759
Why did you suddenly show up?

353
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Is it all because of An Pinghai?

354
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,880
You two have a good relationship, right?

355
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,799
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

356
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
This time, he got off at Weicheng.

357
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,720
He said he needed my help with something.

358
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,279
He called you, and you came right away.

359
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,359
That means you two are still pretty close.

360
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,880
When a brother calls, you have to show up.

361
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,039
That's real loyalty.

362
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,599
True brotherhood.

363
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,000
I know you're not afraid of death.

364
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,559
But think about it.

365
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,519
You've done something so big.

366
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,200
You're already risking your life.

367
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,119
If you take it to the grave, no one will ever know.

368
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,079
So what are you after?

369
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,319
You won't be remembered as a legend.

370
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,799
But being infamous for ages is better than no one knowing at all, right?

371
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,720
Wang Dejun confessed.

372
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,079
He confessed everything.

373
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:55,880
He confessed everything.

374
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Confessed to what?

375
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:00,799
Confessed to what?

376
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
Your business, what did he confess to?

377
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,759
Just over three hours ago,

378
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,359
he asked me to come and chat with him.

379
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,880
What does he even know to confess?

380
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,759
What do you think he confessed to?

381
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,599
I can't tell you that.

382
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,000
Get as far away as you can.

383
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,279
You'd better stop playing these little tricks.

384
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,480
Hey, kid.

385
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,400
What you just said was right.

386
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,200
My little bit of glory

387
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,880
can't be buried.

388
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
This deserves to be written in a book.

389
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,079
Bro, make sure you record this well.

390
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,599
Don't miss anything.

391
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,079
Where should I start?

392
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,119
Start from the beginning.

393
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,119
Go in chronological order.

394
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Tingting

395
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,759
We made the arrest yesterday and interrogated through the night.

396
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,680
I really couldn't call.

397
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,319
Alright.

398
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,319
There's no surprise at all.

399
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,440
What should we eat later?

400
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,039
Or should we eat the same as before?

401
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,440
Tingting, the place we ate at last time—

402
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,799
I'm not eating with you guys.

403
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,519
Slow down.

404
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,759
Slow down.

405
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,480
Why are you here?

406
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,640
Aren't you afraid of embarrassing yourself?

407
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Have I ever been afraid?

408
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,920
Bye, bye.

409
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,279
I wanted to let you know I'm pregnant.

410
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,359
I couldn't find you anywhere.

411
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,039
My coworkers all tried to talk to me.

412
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,359
They said a husband like this isn't worth keeping.

413
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,119
Might as well get a divorce.

414
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,240
Keep dreaming.

415
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
I'd never divorce, not even if you beat me to death.

416
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,880
Hurry, hurry, it's cold, let's go.

417
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,119
Where? Which one is my son?

418
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,759
It's only forty days, what can you even see?

419
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,599
Wait, wait a second.

420
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,519
There, is that it?

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,119
This is the gestational sac.

422
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,160
Why do you keep saying it's a son?

423
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,720
Is a daughter not good enough?

424
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,960
A daughter is good too.

425
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,279
I'd want it even if it were a monkey.

426
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,079
You think you could give birth to a monkey?

427
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,480
There are five phones in total, take a photo.

428
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
The suspect has been

429
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,160
The criminal suspect has been taken into custody.

430
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
Captain Huang

431
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,640
These are all really good things.

432
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,519
They're all high-end models.

433
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,279
Seriously, this is better than the one we have at the station.

434
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,920
This one definitely won't lag when working.

435
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,279
Ours always lags as soon as we start working.

436
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:32,559
I don't mean anything else by it.

437
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm just worried it affects our work efficiency.

438
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,039
Aren't you worried it affects me memorizing my lines?

439
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,119
How many times have I told you?

440
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,519
Don't talk to me, don't talk to me.

441
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,039
You gave it to me, and now I don't even know where I was memorizing.

442
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,160
An Pinghai and his gang have now been arrested.

443
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,839
5,326 grams of drugs have been confiscated.

444
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,880
A huge amount of illicit money and goods has been seized.

445
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,799
A drug trafficking gang has been dismantled.

446
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,599
A drug trafficking network has collapsed.

447
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,640
Come on, lift your head, look here.

448
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,000
Come on, look up for a second.

449
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,720
For a period of time,

450
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,839
what awaits them will be the full force of the law.

451
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,279
This development is a pre-sale property.

452
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,079
Its main selling point is this.

453
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,000
A small unit of just over eighty square meters.

454
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,200
It will be delivered fully furnished.

455
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
But the delivery will be a bit late.

456
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,240
It'll be the year after next.

457
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,720
Mr. Liu, you know this business

458
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,000
even better than I do.

459
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,400
Master, I think this layout is pretty good.

460
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,400
It makes good use of the space.

461
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,559
It does use the space well,

462
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,880
but overall, it's still small.

463
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,880
I actually want to buy a bigger one.

464
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,440
There are villas further back.

465
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,559
Are you paying for it?

466
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,279
If I had the money, I'd definitely get it for you.

467
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,640
Master, you've looked at this place so many times.

468
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
Is there anything you're not satisfied with?

469
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,839
I want to buy a unit on a higher floor.

470
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,119
But they said there aren't any left.

471
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,480
When I first asked, they said they were all sold out.

472
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Only these lower floors are left.

473
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,119
That's right.

474
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,000
Our prime floors

475
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,680
were snapped up right from the start.

476
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,319
Could you ask again for me?

477
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,319
Just ask.

478
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,000
Your properties sell that well?

479
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
Not even a single unit has been returned?

480
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,799
There really aren't any left.

481
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,759
How about considering the eighth floor?

482
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,839
They say mosquitoes can only fly up to the seventh floor.

483
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,960
Dude, stop messing around.

484
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,880
But people can take the elevator.

485
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,759
So can mosquitoes.

486
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,039
Master, I'm going to make a phone call.

487
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,799
Mr. Liu,

488
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,359
You've already come here so many times.

489
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,000
If there were any available,

490
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
I would have introduced them to you long ago.

491
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,000
If there were high floors, I would immediately—

492
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,279
Now, there are only a few mid- and low-floor units left.

493
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,319
How about—

494
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:45,880
Hello

495
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,079
Okay, okay

496
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,440
Alright

497
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
Mr. Liu

498
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,200
If you know our boss, you should've said so earlier

499
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,519
Here's the thing

500
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,400
Our boss just called directly

501
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,880
He said the two penthouses

502
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,000
You can pick whichever you like

503
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,160
Let's talk in the lounge

504
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,119
Come on, let's go

505
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,079
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

506
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,039
Who does he know, really?

507
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,680
Wait, you know their boss?

508
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,160
My mom knows them

509
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,440
What does your aunt do?

510
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,640
She works in real estate too, I think

511
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,240
Real estate

512
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
Then why not just buy from your aunt?

513
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,119
They only deal with office buildings

514
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,640
Not residential properties like this

515
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,039
Office buildings? The police department should buy one

516
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:36,839
Use it as an office

517
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,400
You really have some ideas

518
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,680
Go tell my mom that

519
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,920
Then introduce your aunt to us first

520
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
Look at you grinning, so happy

521
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,880
What time is it?

522
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,640
It's probably nine o'clock.

523
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,039
I slept for eight hours.

524
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,559
Are you hungry? I'll go make you something to eat.

525
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
No, no, don't move.

526
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,639
I'll cook today.

527
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,360
I'll make you something to eat.

528
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,440
You're not going to work today?

529
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,480
I took the day off.

530
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,440
Lie down quickly.

531
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
What's wrong? What's going on?

532
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:58,920
No, no, no, don't come over here.

533
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,639
It's fine, it's fine.

534
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,840
You didn't cut your hand, did you?

535
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,679
No, no, don't touch it, don't touch it.

536
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,840
What's wrong?

537
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,559
It's nothing.

538
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,679
No, no, no.

539
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
The egg exploded.

540
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,800
I thought it was a gunshot.

541
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,880
How about I do it instead?

542
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,920
No, no, no, you stop.

543
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,079
Come on, listen to me.

544
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,440
Did you use your guns on this mission?

545
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,599
No, do you think this is a movie?

546
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,519
It's not that easy to use a gun.

547
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,480
Hurry, go out, come on.

548
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,079
It's rare for me to spend time with you.

549
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,440
Let me show off a little.

550
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,880
Go lie down and rest.

551
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,480
Go, go, go.

552
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,800
Well, um...

553
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,639
Isn't your brother-in-law really rich?

554
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,119
He's in rehab.

555
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,079
I forgot, drugs.

556
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,679
Right, right, right.

557
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,079
What about that senior guy?

558
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,199
His business is doing great now.

559
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,079
As soon as Lei heard I wanted to buy a house,

560
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,079
he transferred the money to me without hesitation.

561
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,480
Is it inconvenient for you?

562
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,679
If it's inconvenient, just forget it.

563
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,000
Don't get upset.

564
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,719
How much are you short?

565
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,480
Fifty thousand.

566
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
There's nothing left from Tingting either.

567
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,800
I haven't told Tingting about this.

568
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,679
She doesn't know.

569
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,239
I want to tell her when we get the house.

570
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,000
Good, that's good.

571
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,039
Give her a surprise.

572
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,639
Well, um...

573
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,679
There's nothing I can do with my in-laws either.

574
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,119
Alright, alright.

575
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:33,599
Send me your bank account number.

576
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,360
I knew you had some secret savings.

577
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,039
Don't tell your wife about this.

578
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,639
Don't worry, I won't see her.

579
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,440
It's over now.

580
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,920
This afternoon, I'll transfer it this afternoon.

581
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,199
Don't worry, Brother Yang.

582
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,880
I'll pay it back monthly.

583
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,320
Every month, as soon as I get my salary,

584
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,880
I'll give it to you first, okay?

585
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,800
No rush, no rush.

586
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,440
Um, why don't you ask Master to lend you some more?

587
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,679
Master? I wouldn't dare.

588
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,519
Besides, he's not here.

589
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,400
I just went to look for him.

590
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
It seems he went out of town.

591
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm leaving now.

592
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,800
Alright, no rush to pay it back.

593
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
I know, I know there's no rush.

594
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,679
No rush.

595
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,679
No rush, really.

596
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,519
Who is it?

597
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,159
It's me.

598
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,000
Sis.

599
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,639
I'm here.

600
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,679
Don't move, let me do it.

601
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,480
Where's Nizi?

602
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
She went to kindergarten.

603
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

604
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,519
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

605
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,440
That day, I...

606
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,960
I spoke a bit harshly.

607
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,079
Don't be mad, okay?

608
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,400
I came to tell you

609
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,320
there's closed-off management at my brother-in-law's place.

610
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,519
The conditions are pretty good.

611
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,159
There's plenty of food and drink.

612
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:11,920
If things go quickly,

613
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,679
you could be out in about three months.

614
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,760
Maybe by then you'll have quit smoking, too.

615
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,000
And quit drinking as well.

616
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,760
Isn't that a good thing?

617
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,039
Alright, I got it.

618
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,199
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

619
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,480
I'll go get you something to eat.

620
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,679
Don't bother.

621
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,960
I just came to see you for a moment.

622
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,320
Tingting is still waiting for me.

623
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,519
I need to go back and take care of her.

624
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,480
You haven't even had any water.

625
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:39,559
I'll take a sip.

626
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,199
Don't be upset.

627
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,360
I'm not upset, why would I be?

628
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,719
If you're not feeling well, take some medicine.

629
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,559
Alright, alright.

630
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,480
Okay.

631
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:50,719
I'm leaving now. Go on.

632
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,760
I won't see you out.

633
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,880
Get in the car.

634
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,079
You really made me your driver, huh?

635
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,000
Unbelievable.

636
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,039
You even brought your own relatives in.

637
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,239
Only you would do something like this.

638
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,039
I've thought it through.

639
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,079
I don't blame you.

640
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,840
Why are we stopping here?

641
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,199
Where are you going?

642
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm going to take a walk.

643
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,559
There's a restroom over there.

644
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,760
Why did you come all the way here?

645
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,440
I want to go to the bathroom.

646
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,239
Every day you act like you're sick or something.

647
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,519
You made Vasily like this.

648
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,119
Impressive.

649
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,239
Why do you keep coming here for no reason?

650
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,480
Wait a minute.

651
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,719
Speak properly.

652
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,920
I have something to do, so I'll head back first.

653
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,559
Call me if you need anything.

654
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,559
Okay.

655
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,239
You're back. Go take a shower quickly.

656
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,840
Dinner will be ready soon.

657
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
There are still two more dishes.

658
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,199
Ni Zi, Daddy's home.

659
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,719
Dad!

660
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,239
Come here!

661
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:51,679
Let me take a look at you.

662
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,559
You've gotten heavier.

663
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,239
Daddy, you're finally back!

664
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,079
Take me out to play for a while, please.

665
00:41:59,079 --> 00:41:59,760
Where do you want to go?

666
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,440
No, you can't go out to play.

667
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,239
You only have to learn six words.

668
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,079
You haven't learned them yet.

669
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,400
Let Daddy teach you.

670
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,039
You can play after you finish learning.

671
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:07,599
Oh no.

672
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,880
I can't go out now.

673
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,679
Then I'll teach you some words.

674
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,559
a b c d

675
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,400
d t n l

676
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,679
g k h

677
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,639
Mom, I'm full. I want to go watch cartoons.

678
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,519
Go ahead.

679
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,239
Let me wipe your mouth.

680
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,119
Go on.

681
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:54,800
Ziqing

682
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,239
I need to apologize to you.

683
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,960
I'm sorry.
