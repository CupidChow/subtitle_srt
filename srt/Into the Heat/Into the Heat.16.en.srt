1
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,120
I have a rough idea why you’re here to see me.

2
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,120
I also deeply sympathize with that lady’s situation.

3
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,359
I feel sorry for her.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
But you’ve misunderstood.

5
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,640
I don’t know her.

6
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,640
I’ve never contacted her either.

7
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,519
From the 20th of last month

8
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,000
until 6 a.m. the day before yesterday,

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,319
I wasn’t in the country.

10
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Any other questions?

11
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,039
Are you sure you don’t know her?

12
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,120
Let me show you something.

13
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,319
This is you, right?

14
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,639
Does it matter?

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
How did he know

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,479
we’re investigating this case?

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
He clearly came prepared.

18
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Doesn’t he have a secretary?

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,599
That secretary does more than just secretarial work.

20
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,639
She also acts as a pimp.

21
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,159
She has to gather all kinds of inside information too.

22
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,960
That’s exhausting.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
Alright.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Let’s go.

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
Can you sleep now?

26
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,599
I can’t sleep.

27
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
The more you talk, the less I can sleep.

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,479
How about you sing me a song?

29
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,199
Sing?

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
I don’t know many songs.

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Just sing one for me.

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,280
Alright, alright.

33
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
Okay, okay, I’ll sing.

34
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:40,000
So many storms, so many springs and autumns...

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,479
If you sing that, I’ll be even less able to sleep.

36
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,599
Then what should I do?

37
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,560
I told you, I don’t know many songs.

38
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,520
Pick another one.

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,000
Sing a children’s song instead.

40
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,360
A children’s song?

41
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,840
The moon is bright, the wind is still

42
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:18,160
Leaves cover the window lattice

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,319
Crickets chirp with a metallic sound

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Just like the sound of zither strings

45
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,399
Tingting

46
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,360
Are you asleep?

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,839
Good night

48
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,199
Awake again

49
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,120
Hello

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,079
Another one of my people has gone missing

51
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,720
It must be that bastard's doing

52
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,920
Where are you?

53
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,560
What's going on?

54
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
Someone named Wang Hui has gone missing again

55
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,480
It's been over two hours

56
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,879
What exactly happened?

57
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,279
Let's hurry right now

58
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't rush, explain the situation first

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Yes, here's what happened

60
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,319
I've been telling them not to go out these past two days

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,120
But Wang Hui

62
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,360
She wouldn't listen, insisted on going out

63
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm going to the bathroom

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,879
Did she go out to get her bag?

65
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,720
How would I know?

66
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,360
Turns out,

67
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
she got into a cement mixer truck.

68
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,000
Go.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,759
Wang Hui.

70
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,519
I ran after her as fast as I could.

71
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,040
Wang Hui.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,439
Wang Hui.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
I ran a long way, but I couldn't catch up.

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,680
I thought to myself,

75
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,800
if she left, then she left.

76
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,240
So I went back first.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,959
But I kept thinking,

78
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,319
it's been over two hours.

79
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,800
She should be back by now, right?

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,839
But I haven't seen her.

81
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,199
So I called her.

82
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,759
Her phone was off.

83
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,800
Did you check at home?

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,519
I haven't had the chance yet.

85
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Did you see clearly?

86
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,519
It was a cement mixer truck.

87
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,399
A cement mixer truck.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you remember the license plate number?

89
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
Hai A 99875.

90
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,000
Repeat it.

91
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,879
Hai A99 99875, that's right.

92
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,279
You two, check the license plate number.

93
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,000
See which concrete mixing station it belongs to.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
If you find anything, don't act rashly.

95
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,519
Wait for instructions from the team.

96
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:02,959
Did you hear me?

97
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,439
Yes, yes.

98
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
Hurry up and go.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,680
Where is her home?

100
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,959
Wang Hui.

101
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,319
Is Wang Hui at home?

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,879
Who are you looking for?

103
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,600
Hey, kid.

104
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,199
Is Wang Hui here?

105
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,040
She’s not here.

106
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,199
Where did she go?

107
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,279
She’s working the night shift.

108
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Kid, I’m a police officer.

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
Can you open the door for me?

110
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,480
You say you’re a police officer—do you have a badge?

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,199
Look.

112
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,439
You really are a police officer.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is Wang Hui your mom?

114
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,560
She’s not home.

115
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,439
She’s not home, she’s working the night shift.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,399
Can we come in and have a look?

117
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,240
Are you home alone?

118
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,240
Yes.

119
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,560
Let me take a look, okay?

120
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,639
Is this your mom’s room?

121
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,600
Hey, kid.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,799
When your mom left today,

123
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,600
was there anything different from usual?

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
Nothing was different.

125
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,759
Qianqian.

126
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,879
Can you bring me that yellow floral jacket?

127
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,559
Okay.

128
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,279
Go do your homework now.

129
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:00,960
Okay.

130
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,480
If I do my homework, she’ll make me food.

131
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,799
Qianqian, eat first, have your meal.

132
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,039
Do your homework after you finish eating.

133
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,559
Tidy up over there.

134
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,960
I ended up eating the meal I cooked.

135
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,039
She didn't eat a single bite and left in a hurry.

136
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,000
After you finish eating, quickly finish your homework.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mom is going out.

138
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,200
She also told me to close the door tightly.

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Bye, Mom.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,919
Don't let strangers in.

141
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
Do your homework properly.

142
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,120
After I leave in a bit,

143
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
lock the door well.

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,600
Lock up and go to bed early. I'm leaving.

145
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,279
Did anyone come to the house today?

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,559
No.

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,879
You're a police officer too.

148
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,279
You've always lived here with your mom?

149
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,600
Yes, my mom works the night shift.

150
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,919
She's not home at this time.

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,720
Alright, we'll head out first.

152
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,600
Listen to your mom.

153
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Lock the door in a bit.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Don't open the door to strangers.

155
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,399
Uncle.

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,399
Did something happen to my mom?

157
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,080
Your mom has to work overtime.

158
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,039
She'll be back a bit later than usual.

159
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,879
So, come with me.

160
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll take care of you today.

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
You haven't shown me your police badge yet.

162
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,960
The badge is in my bag.

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,360
How are you going to take care of me?

164
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,039
Don't worry about it. I have a child too.

165
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,000
She's a girl as well.

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,399
And she told me before,

167
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,159
she's wanted to change jobs for a while.

168
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,799
I was the one who convinced her to stay until the end of the month.

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,919
I owe her for that. Come on.

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,840
This way, put it on your back.

171
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
You're "Dog Thing," aren't you?

172
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,559
What?

173
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,919
In my mom's phone,

174
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
your name is "Dog Thing 515."

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,360
What's 515?

176
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,320
My birthday.

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
How about this:

178
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,639
You two come with me.

179
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,759
Put the clothes on the child.

180
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,240
Come on.

181
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,039
Dong Xiang.

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
Turn yourself in after sunrise.

183
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,279
What's wrong? No one's answering?

184
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,159
The phone's off.

185
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,399
Let me see what his name is.

186
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,440
Chen Jian.

187
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,480
Attention to everyone on the road, attention.

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,960
Report immediately if you see car number seven.

189
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,519
Report immediately if you see car number seven.

190
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,519
Do you have a photo of him on file here?

191
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,399
ID card photo.

192
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,039
Yes.

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,399
Here.

194
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,000
Chen Jian, born in 1976.

195
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,399
Where does he usually live?

196
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,240
Here.

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,000
There's a window in the back.

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,919
Ziming.

199
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,799
What's up? What do you mean? Come on.

200
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,360
Lei, sorry to trouble you.

201
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,600
Take care of them.

202
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,919
No problem.

203
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,240
You go ahead and do your thing, hurry.

204
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,080
Alright, you don't need to worry about this.

205
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,960
Get them something to eat.

206
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,679
Don't worry.

207
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,399
Um, sit here.

208
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,159
Sit wherever you like.

209
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,519
It's already this late.

210
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,240
I'll just make you something simple.

211
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,200
Don't go to any trouble.

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Alright, alright.

213
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,960
You guys keep watch near his house.

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,840
Are you cold? Let the team know.

215
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm not cold.

216
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
Don't make any moves until we know the situation.

217
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm coming over right now.

218
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,080
There's someone inside.

219
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,639
What's going on?

220
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,200
I'll go take a look.

221
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,759
Be careful.

222
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,440
What's going on?

223
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,759
Did he find something?

224
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,080
The master hasn't arrived yet.

225
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,840
If we wait for the master, he'll run away.

226
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,679
Let's take him down.

227
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Open the door.

228
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,639
Is there a gas leak in your place?

229
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,639
We can all smell it in our place.

230
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,919
Gas.

231
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Hurry, hurry, open the door!

232
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,240
Don't move, police!

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Help!

234
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,000
Someone help! Help!

235
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,240
Help! Who are you? Don't move!

236
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,559
Don't move, police!

237
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,600
Chen Jian, right? Where is Wang Hui?

238
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,039
Who's Chen Jian?

239
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,679
Making it up.

240
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,639
Where is Wang Hui?

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,080
Who's Wang Hui?

242
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,919
I'm Yu Baiping.

243
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,240
If you don't believe me, check my ID.

244
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,120
Under the pillow.

245
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,600
Look for it.

246
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,879
You really are Yu Baiping.

247
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,559
What's going on?

248
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,720
Isn't this 902?

249
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,279
This is 901.

250
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,759
902 is next door.

251
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,799
Who changed my door number?

252
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,480
Then why do you keep turning the lights on and off in the middle of the night?

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
Can't I have insomnia?

254
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,159
Don't move.

255
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,159
The police are hitting people!

256
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,200
Don't move! Help!

257
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,480
What are you standing there for? Call and check!

258
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,039
Okay.

259
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,080
Liu Ziming

260
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,840
How do you manage your team?

261
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,440
Who allowed them to act on their own?

262
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,799
Captain Huang, please don't worry.

263
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,759
How can I not be worried?

264
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,840
It's lucky no one got hurt.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,879
What if someone had been injured?

266
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,600
Arrest them first.

267
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,639
Have them write a self-criticism when we get back.

268
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,000
Handle it as it should be handled.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,240
You think you can get away?

270
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,159
Captain Huang

271
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,799
The foreman said he saw that car.

272
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,679
It's on National Highway 108.

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
It's currently stopped at the 503 section, heading east to west.

274
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,639
Let's go.

275
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,159
Get in the car.

276
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,359
Let me go.

277
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,319
I have a child.

278
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,759
Help!

279
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,799
Help!

280
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,559
Help!

281
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,119
Help! Help!

282
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,079
Up ahead, hurry!

283
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,480
Help!

284
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,279
Help!

285
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,119
Don't move.

286
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,519
Police! Don't move!

287
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,640
Don't move, don't move! Get up, get up!

288
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
Cuff him! Cuff him! Cuff him!

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,640
Don't move.

290
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,359
Don't move.

291
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,559
What's your name?

292
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Speak! What's your name?

293
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,519
What's your name?

294
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,279
Take him away. Go!

295
00:18:59,359 --> 00:18:59,960
Don't move.

296
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,559
Are you okay?

297
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,279
Take them to the hospital first.

298
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:06,759
Okay.

299
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,759
Take them to the hospital first. Keep them safe.

300
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,279
A lot has happened.

301
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,119
How many did you kill?

302
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,599
Killed.

303
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,079
Four.

304
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,279
Which one is this?

305
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,279
How could I remember clearly?

306
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,920
Killed too many.

307
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,079
Can't remember, right?

308
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,559
What about the first one you killed?

309
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,359
You must remember that one.

310
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,000
Tell us about the first one.

311
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,160
You mean Qiu Jie, right?

312
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,480
I was supposed to marry her.

313
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,880
Why did you kill the two of them?

314
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,240
No reason.

315
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,319
I often walk around the Jianshe Road area.

316
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
I always saw them coming out.

317
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,680
I just went after whoever I ran into.

318
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,680
The things in their mouths,

319
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,200
did you put them in while they were alive

320
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,400
or after they died?

321
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,400
Before they died.

322
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:05,920
Why?

323
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
I didn't want them to talk.

324
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
I didn't want them to talk.

325
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,400
What do you mean?

326
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,039
Women like that,

327
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,920
I kill every one I see.

328
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,440
The kind of women you're talking about,

329
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
who do you mean?

330
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,359
It doesn't matter.

331
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,359
They all look down on me anyway.

332
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,319
How do they look down on you?

333
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,559
They just look down on me.

334
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,319
Why?

335
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,319
They all look down on me.

336
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,680
Even my mom looks down on me.

337
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,359
My dad was a college student.

338
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
At that time, he was sent down to the countryside.

339
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,680
They had been married for less than a year.

340
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Then my dad went back to the city.

341
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,960
I never even met him.

342
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,440
I heard that in the city,

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,880
he found another wife.

344
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,480
My mom hit me all the time.

345
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,480
She said I looked like him and found me annoying.

346
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,440
If you find me so annoying, why did you have me?

347
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,000
You might as well have

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,839
just strangled me at birth.

349
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
My wife also looks down on me.

350
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,759
She scolds me all the time for no reason.

351
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,160
Fine, let her scold me.

352
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,319
But in the end, she ran off with someone else.

353
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,640
If you look down on me, why did you marry me?

354
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,400
In a bit, an auntie will come to pick you up.

355
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,799
She'll take you to your mom.

356
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,240
And I have to go turn myself in.

357
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,559
Turn yourself in?

358
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,160
What does "turn yourself in" mean?

359
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,119
It means

360
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,759
when you make a mistake at school,

361
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,400
you have to go and admit it to the teacher yourself.

362
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,759
Let's go.

363
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,880
Are you Dong Xiang?

364
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,160
Hello.

365
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,319
Hello.

366
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

367
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,960
Okay.

368
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,119
Let's talk over here.

369
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,519
Are you Qiu Jie?

370
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,519
Yes.

371
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,559
Do you know this person?

372
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,720
Don't be afraid.

373
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,119
We've already taken him into custody.

374
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,039
Did he ever attack you?

375
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,359
He almost strangled me to death.

376
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,920
This scar on my face—

377
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,880
I got it when I was escaping that time.

378
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,279
Can you tell us exactly what happened?

379
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,319
At that time—

380
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,640
He came to see me a few times back then.

381
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,839
I don't even know how,

382
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,279
he somehow thought we were in a relationship.

383
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,880
Later, during one of our conversations,

384
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,160
I said a couple of things to him and made him upset.

385
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
He went crazy and started strangling me.

386
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,640
At that moment, I thought he was going to kill me.

387
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,119
When I woke up later,

388
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,240
I was already dumped in a small ravine.

389
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,240
Did you see him again after that?

390
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,240
No.

391
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,039
Officer,

392
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,039
I'm begging you,

393
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,559
I stopped doing that a long time ago.

394
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,960
And look,

395
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm already married now.

396
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,000
Please, you absolutely can't let this get out.

397
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,640
If my husband finds out,

398
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,720
I wouldn't be able to face anyone anymore.

399
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
Please, don't tell anyone for me.

400
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,079
Don't worry about that.

401
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,960
We won't say a word.

402
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,680
The first time,

403
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,079
I remember it was raining that day.

404
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,559
At first, I dragged her.

405
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,720
I was afraid of leaving traces.

406
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,880
Later, I carried her on my shoulder.

407
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,640
I was really scared at the time.

408
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,640
I kept feeling like nowhere was safe.

409
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,920
So I carried her from over there to here.

410
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,200
I saw

411
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,960
that there was no one here.

412
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,720
There happened to be a well here.

413
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,039
So I threw her into the well.

414
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,640
Later, with the second one,

415
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,480
I didn't look for another place either.

416
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,039
I threw her in too.

417
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,799
Please identify it again.

418
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,240
Is he handsome or not?

419
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,559
Handsome.

420
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,519
Thank you for your hard work, honey.

421
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
It wasn't hard.

422
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,400
Give me a hug.

423
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,720
About giving birth,

424
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,640
men really can't go in to help.

425
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,440
If they do, they just make things worse.

426
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,319
It can even leave aftereffects.

427
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,720
I was in so much pain inside, I almost hit the wall.

428
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,960
If you were in there, I'd have to take care of you too.

429
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,400
Thank you for your hard work.

430
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,200
Alright, alright, alright.

431
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,319
Don't touch him.

432
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,039
Did you wash your hands?

433
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:23,920
Did you wash your hands?

434
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,440
I did.

435
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,000
What are you doing?

436
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,559
Hurry and find a doctor, go get disinfected.

437
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,319
Hurry, hurry.

438
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,440
Go find a doctor and get disinfected.

439
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:28,920
Stop looking.

440
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,799
Come back and look later.

441
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,839
Go on, out, out, out.

442
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,759
Hurry up.

443
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,720
Mom.

444
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,319
Qianqian.

445
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,519
Who brought you here?

446
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,960
Come here, take off your backpack.

447
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Mom, what's wrong?

448
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,000
Mom's fine.

449
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,359
Come here, take off your backpack.

450
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,960
Have you eaten?

451
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,519
Mom, I want to confess something to you.

452
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,519
Confess?

453
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,319
Confess what?

454
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,759
I didn't finish my homework.

455
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
It's okay.

456
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,920
Just finish it later, that's fine.

457
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,759
The criminal suspect Chen Jian

458
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,839
is suspected of murdering several women

459
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
and was recently apprehended by police in Haiming City.

460
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
Since the case occurred,

461
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
the police have attached great importance to it.

462
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,039
A special task force was quickly assembled with elite officers.

463
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:44,839
Did you see that?

464
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,799
Yes, I posted it.

465
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,319
After several months of continuous efforts,

466
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,000
the task force officers conducted extensive interviews and investigations,

467
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,440
reviewed the case, and used technological methods,

468
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
gradually narrowing down Chen Jian's whereabouts.

469
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,640
He was eventually brought to justice.

470
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,200
According to the police,

471
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,920
Chen Jian's methods were extremely cruel

472
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,759
and the nature of his crimes was particularly vile.

473
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,480
This caused great fear and unease in society.

474
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,759
During the arrest,

475
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,880
the police overcame many difficulties

476
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,039
and finally brought Chen Jian to justice.

477
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,200
This demonstrated the authority of the law and the power of justice.

478
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,839
Ni Zi, stop playing.

479
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,880
Change your clothes.

480
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,319
Mom will take you to find your little brother.

481
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,519
Got it.

482
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,000
Okay.

483
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,240
Why are you here?

484
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,920
I came to see my sister-in-law and my nephew.

485
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
You had a son and didn't even tell me.

486
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,119
That's not cool.

487
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,279
How did you find out?

488
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,000
Come on, it's me. How could I not know?

489
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,319
Even if you don't know, I have to know.

490
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,599
Such disrespect.

491
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,720
Why did you bring your silly apprentice?

492
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,799
Where's the handsome one?

493
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,599
Watch your mouth.

494
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,400
Are you leaving now?

495
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,160
I'm hurrying to the station.

496
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,960
I took time off to come here.

497
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,039
Hurry up and see me off.

498
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,160
I haven't even gone up to see them yet.

499
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,079
See them when you get back.

500
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,680
Hurry up.

501
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,759
What if I run into bad people on the way?

502
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,200
It'd be a miracle if you didn't bully the bad guys.

503
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,119
You hit me!

504
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,200
Believe it or not, I'll catch you.

505
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,440
Catch me then! Over there!

506
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,720
Alright, that's enough.

507
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,039
If you keep this up, you'll scrub your skin off.

508
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,519
Uncle

509
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Son

510
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,440
How many times has Mom told you?

511
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,200
These little hands can't touch your brother's face.

512
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,000
What's his name?

513
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,160
We haven't named him yet. Why don't you pick one?

514
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:58,599
Does he have a nickname?

515
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,599
Diandian. His mom picked it.

516
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,480
Liu Yidian

517
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,160
What does it mean?

518
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,240
Leave a little in everything you do and in how you act.

519
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,599
He's crying.

520
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,759
Let me, let me, let me.

521
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,920
Let me do it. I'll do it, I'll do it.

522
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,519
Look at the name you picked.

523
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Isn't this a good name?

524
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
Is he hungry?

525
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
Here you go, sir.

526
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,960
Thank you.

527
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,160
Come on.

528
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,359
Right here.

529
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,240
Do you see that building?

530
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,440
I see it. What's up?

531
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,960
Count from the bottom up to the nineteenth floor.

532
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,920
How many floors are there in total?

533
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,640
Twenty.

534
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,559
Then you could've just had me count from the top down.

535
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,599
No, you have to count from the bottom up.

536
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,200
One, two, three, four, five...

537
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,039
What are you doing, making me count to the nineteenth floor?

538
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,680
You brought me here

539
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,400
just to look at a construction site?

540
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,279
That's our home.

541
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,839
We'll get the keys next month.

542
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,079
The deed is in your name.

543
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,960
I promised you when we got married

544
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,960
that when we had money, we'd buy our own place. Did you forget?

545
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,960
When did you buy it?

546
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,279
It's been over a year.

547
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,079
Every time, I came to check on it by myself, in secret.

548
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
From laying the foundation, to building up to the third floor,

549
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,559
then the fifth floor,

550
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,559
then to our floor,

551
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,559
and now it's finally topped out.

552
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,359
Where did the money come from?

553
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,680
I borrowed it from Cao Lei, Liu Yang, and the others.

554
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,000
Every month when I get paid, I pay them back a little.

555
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,279
There's not much left to pay off.

556
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,279
No crying.

557
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,039
You just finished your postpartum recovery.

558
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,839
If your mom finds out, she'll kill me.

559
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,039
You've worked so hard.

560
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,719
It's not hard at all.

561
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,280
Ziming is back.

562
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,760
Mom.

563
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,480
You're back.

564
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,039
You're back.

565
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,119
Wash your hands and hold the baby.

566
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,800
All the guests have left.

567
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,440
They've left.

568
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,039
If they didn't leave, would they stay here for the New Year?

569
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,880
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

570
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,800
Have some cake to tide you over.

571
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm not in a hurry.

572
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,559
I'll wash my hands first.

573
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,480
Let me hold the baby.

574
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,360
Son.

575
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,599
Ziming, Ziming.

576
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,800
I have something I want to ask you to help me with.

577
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,320
Go ahead.

578
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,119
That dog from Sister Wang's house next door—

579
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,679
It was taken away by the dog-catching team.

580
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,000
Can you help me get it back?

581
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,519
Did the dog have a license?

582
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,199
If it had a license, they wouldn't have taken it.

583
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,719
Just get a license and that's it.

584
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
It's an old dog.

585
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,599
It's over ten years old.

586
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,320
It might die in a few days anyway.

587
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,480
Why bother getting a license?

588
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,119
Ziming, don't listen to your mom.

589
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,639
Their dog not only doesn't have a license,

590
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,559
it also bites people when it goes out.

591
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,679
Someone called the police to have it taken away.

592
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,639
Nonsense! So what if it bit someone?

593
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
The dog didn't do it on purpose.

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,039
If a dog doesn't know better, do people not know better either?

595
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:15,239
Ziming, Ziming, you have to help me with this.

596
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,639
I've already promised them.

597
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,719
Mom, you have to do me this favor.

598
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:18,840
Mom, I can't handle this.

599
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,400
Mom, don't make things difficult for Ziming.

600
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,960
Daddy, hug.

601
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,519
You can't even handle people, and now you want to take care of a dog?

602
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,079
Happy birthday, son.

603
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,039
Hold it up, hold it up.

604
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,239
Just say that's our own dog.

605
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Dian Dian, say "Daddy."

606
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Say "Daddy," say "Daddy," say "Daddy."

607
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,519
Such a good kid.

608
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,400
He calls everyone "Daddy" when he goes out.

609
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,480
Why doesn't he call you when he sees you?

610
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,679
Dad, stop talking nonsense.

611
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,960
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

612
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,559
Come here, come here.

613
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,679
See, you’re never home, so he’s become shy around you.

614
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,800
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

615
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,039
Alright, alright.

616
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,320
Captain Huang,

617
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,800
You mean

618
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,480
you want us to drop everything

619
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,960
and go investigate a stolen manhole cover?

620
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,480
It's not just one stolen manhole cover.

621
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,159
There are a lot, okay?

622
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,159
This is a series of cases.

623
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,039
Just last Friday,

624
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,920
a whole row of manhole covers disappeared along Yanhe East Road.

625
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,920
And just a few days later,

626
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,000
the manhole covers on Hongtai Road were stolen too.

627
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Didn't you see it online and in the newspapers?

628
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,719
Public opinion is blowing up.

629
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,840
If you want to calm public opinion,

630
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,880
shouldn't we do something about it?

631
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes, yes, yes.

632
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
After all that you said,

633
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
isn't it just asking us to investigate the stolen manhole covers?

634
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,000
But usually, investigating stolen manhole covers

635
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,719
is the job of the local police station, right?

636
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,360
Yeah, just let them handle it.

637
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,920
What kind of attitude is this from you three?

638
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,159
What kind of attitude is that?

639
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,920
I'm embarrassed for you.

640
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,119
What's wrong?

641
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,239
The police station and the criminal investigation team

642
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,559
aren't they both part of the public security system?

643
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,119
If the police station doesn't have enough people,

644
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,760
should the criminal investigation team just sit by and do nothing?

645
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,280
But we don't have enough people either.

646
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,599
We have five cases, look.

647
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,199
Just last month's cases alone...

648
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:50,960
Are we investigating or not?

649
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,639
Investigate.

650
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,840
If it needs to be investigated, then investigate.

651
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:14,920
Sir,

652
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,079
May I ask how many have gone missing around here?

653
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,679
Twenty-one on this road.

654
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,760
Twenty-one?

655
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,840
Sir,

656
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,039
Why don't we try to check the nearby surveillance cameras?

657
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,519
How many people in the group?

658
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,679
They were pushing carts and wearing hats, couldn't see their faces.

659
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,559
Sir, you saw them?

660
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
Yes, I have "Sky Eye" (surveillance access).

661
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,880
Should we stake out the intersection tonight?

662
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,480
Go on, don't come back.

663
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,960
Ziqing, I...

664
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,039
Sir, can I make one more call?

665
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:30,679
No problem.

666
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,480
Thank you.

667
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,679
Is the boss here?

668
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,440
What's up? Is there something you need?

669
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,679
Do you take scrap iron?

670
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes, how much do you have?

671
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,239
About ten tons.

672
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,199
Wait a moment, I'll make a call.

673
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,599
Our boss is here.

674
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,639
Hello.

675
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,400
Who did you sell to before?

676
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,440
Qi River Steel Market.

677
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,719
Do you want manhole covers?

678
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,679
Yes, but they need to be broken up.

679
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,079
No need to register, right?

680
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,320
Don't worry, no need.

681
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
Just deliver them here after ten o'clock.

682
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,719
Okay, I'll come find you tonight.

683
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,360
Alright.

684
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,519
Who is this?

685
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,519
Ziming.

686
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,920
I'm still in debt right now.

687
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,440
So I can only find you something like this.

688
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,679
Once things get a bit better for me, I'll get you a better one.

689
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,519
This is pretty good.

690
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,119
I'll just take a few days to rest.

691
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,079
Um...

692
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,760
Your sister is really nice.

693
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,239
She's nice.

694
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,880
I want to apologize to her in person.

695
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,760
If you really care about her,

696
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,679
don't contact her again.

697
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,760
You just don't trust me, I...

698
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,119
Yes, the things I did before,

699
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,559
I really wasn't worthy of your trust.

700
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,480
So what are your plans next?

701
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,880
I'll just see what comes up.

702
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,480
Um...

703
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,320
Those old friends who do business,

704
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,159
I'll see if there's anything I can do.

705
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,159
A few days ago, I asked a friend.

706
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,920
He opened a restaurant.

707
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,960
He needs a lobby manager.

708
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,639
That's not for me, I can't do that.

709
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,159
Me, working as a lobby manager for someone else?

710
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,559
What else can you do?

711
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm used to being the boss.

712
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,920
Now you want me to work for someone else?

713
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,000
I still have to start my own company.

714
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,599
Do you have the capital?

715
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
I'll raise the capital.

716
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,880
I was just too conservative before.

717
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,239
What are you laughing at?

718
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
You don't believe in me.

719
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
This is the phone Tingting used.

720
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,519
I put a new SIM card in it for you.

721
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,079
Charger.

722
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,199
Brother-in-law.

723
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,119
Don’t contact those old friends anymore.

724
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,920
Don’t worry, don’t worry.

725
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,280
Report to the police station on time.

726
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,440
I have something to do, I’ll go first.

727
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,800
I’ll treat you to a meal another day.

728
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,000
Goodbye.

729
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,440
Boss.

730
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,480
Boss.

731
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,079
Coming.

732
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:13,880
Here I am.

733
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,679
Where’s the goods?

734
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,960
They’re in the back, the truck will be here soon.

735
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,920
Where are you unloading this time?

736
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,079
Right here.

737
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,000
How is that possible?

738
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,559
Where are you putting it? You have to tell me.

739
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,960
See if the vehicle can get in.

740
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,760
Don’t worry.

741
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,320
Here.

742
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,920
Even a tricycle can get in here.

743
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,679
We’ll put it here in a bit.

744
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,400
They’re all smashed up, right?

745
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,840
Did you smash them all?

746
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,760
Yes, all smashed.

747
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,559
As long as they’re smashed, that’s fine.

748
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,480
There are also cables.

749
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,159
Where did all this come from?

750
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,199
Our industry rules—

751
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,800
We only ask about the price of what we buy,

752
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,760
not where it came from.

753
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,880
Understood.

754
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,280
Hey, hurry up and call to check on it.

755
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,239
I still have things to do.

756
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,480
Alright, got it.
