1
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,439
Brother Cao

2
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,400
Oh my god

3
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,560
Brother Zhang

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,719
Can the cause of death be determined?

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,359
There are multiple stab wounds on the body

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
There are also strangulation marks on the neck

7
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,239
So we can't rule out

8
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,640
the possibility of mechanical asphyxiation

9
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,319
We still need to go back and confirm

10
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,359
Brother Zhang

11
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
Please speed up the autopsy report for us

12
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:04,920
Thank you

13
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,200
I'll treat you to mutton soup next time

14
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,319
Where's Old Wei?

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
My mentor has other matters to attend to

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,199
He won't be back for a while

17
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,919
Central crime scene

18
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,199
Sharp object, ligature marks

19
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,360
Person who reported the case

20
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,599
Where is the person who reported it?

21
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,000
Upstairs

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,919
Neighbor from 301, named Lu Bing

23
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,120
Thank you, thank you

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't need it

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Could you please say that again?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
How did you find out?

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,840
I went to knock on the door this morning

28
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,439
No response

29
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,159
I opened the door with the key and found out

30
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,360
Why did you go knock on her door?

31
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,479
I needed to talk to her

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
Aunt Wang gets up early every day

33
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,560
She brings me breakfast

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
She leaves it on the table and goes

35
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,080
I got up today and saw there was none

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,000
I got worried

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,080
I was afraid she might not be feeling well

38
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,280
You two are really close, huh?

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Actually, I used to live with her

40
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,439
For about ten years

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,319
I only moved out in the past two years

42
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
You used to live together?

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,199
My parents passed away when I was eight

44
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,560
Aunt Wang raised me

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,039
What is her relationship with your parents?

46
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,240
Old classmates.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Then why did you move out later?

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
Aunt Wang goes to bed early every day.

49
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,560
I get off work late.

50
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,719
I was afraid of disturbing her.

51
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,120
I also wanted to have some personal space.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
It just so happened that the apartment upstairs

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,319
had just been vacated by the previous tenant.

54
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,080
I discussed it with Aunt Wang.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,439
So I bought it.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,039
Aunt Wang,

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
she doesn't have any children herself.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,639
No.

59
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,520
Have you ever heard of her having conflicts with anyone?

60
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't think so.

61
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,199
Aunt Wang is really

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
really kind.

63
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,920
I've never seen her argue with anyone.

64
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,360
She never fights or competes with anyone.

65
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,759
When was the last time you saw her?

66
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,600
Last night.

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
I had just come back from a business trip.

68
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
Aunt Wang told me that she

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
she had made a table full of delicious food.

70
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,680
She invited me to have dinner.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Was there anything unusual at the time?

72
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,240
No.

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,839
What time did you leave her house last night?

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,759
About

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,759
Not quite ten o'clock, I think.

76
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,600
Do you think

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,240
anyone could be a suspect?

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,240
I can't think of anything.

79
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,720
Can I, can I...

80
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,040
If it's convenient, could I change her clothes?

81
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,680
Aunt Wang is very particular about cleanliness.

82
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,120
That's enough.

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,560
You should get some rest first.

84
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,000
We'll let you know when the time is right.

85
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,120
The person who reported the case is named Lu Bing.

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Twenty-eight years old.

87
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,959
Works at Summit Securities

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
According to him

89
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,079
He was raised by the deceased

90
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,959
She was his adoptive mother

91
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,879
I've asked about the same on my end

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,480
Lu Bing attended top schools all the way

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,319
Very obedient

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,160
After starting work, he treated the old lady very well

95
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
Took great care of her

96
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,639
Based on the scene

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
I think the likelihood of a home invasion robbery is high

98
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,360
Although there were signs that the scene had been searched,

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,839
there's no evidence to show

100
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,040
that anything was stolen.

101
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,079
They were caught right after entering.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,079
They didn't have time to act—killed and then ran.

103
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,160
Wouldn't a home invasion require scoping out the place first?

104
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,279
According to property management,

105
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,920
no suspicious people were seen coming or going.

106
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,279
But sometimes there are random robberies without scoping.

107
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,720
Master once said,

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
don't make assumptions.

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,079
Anything is possible before the case is solved.

110
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
Any preconceived notions

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,079
could affect the direction of the investigation.

112
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,439
So what do you think we should do?

113
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,720
Second Senior Brother, what would Master do if he were here?

114
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,800
He would definitely start by investigating social connections.

115
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,120
Colleagues at school,

116
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,959
friends, and neighbors would all be checked first.

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,319
She often complained that breakfast places outside

118
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,279
weren't clean.

119
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,680
So she would get up at four in the morning

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,240
to make soy milk and fried dough sticks for Lu Bing.

121
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,720
Even in the office,

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,759
she loved to study her collection of recipes whenever she had free time.

123
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,519
It seems it's because Lu Bing had to work overtime.

124
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,680
He got home quite late.

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,240
So Teacher Wang had to watch him eat to feel at ease.

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,800
Let me show you.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,040
This is Mr. Wang when he was young.

128
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,879
The one next to him is Lu Bing.

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
He was well-mannered and very obedient.

130
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,600
In what way was he obedient?

131
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,439
When Lu Bing was a child, his digestion wasn't very good.

132
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,959
So Teacher Wang asked him

133
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,240
to chew twenty-one times every time he ate.

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,759
She said it would help with digestion.

135
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,079
He still remembers it to this day.

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Remembers what? Chewing twenty-one times?

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,439
Yeah.

138
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
So how did Lu Bing react?

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,800
He didn't really react.

140
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,240
He just acted normal.

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,000
Teacher Wang really put all her energy

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
into Lu Bing.

143
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,959
Who are these people next to him?

144
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,639
This is Mr. Wang's wife.

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,240
But she passed away a long time ago.

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,120
I don't know the others.

147
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,240
How did she pass away?

148
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,240
Mr. Wang never talked about that.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
So we didn't feel comfortable asking.

150
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,600
This is Senior Sister Wang Yun's husband.

151
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,560
Chen Tongsheng.

152
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,480
This is me.

153
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,160
And these two people,

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,839
are Lu Bing's biological parents.

155
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,959
Their two families were very close.

156
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
They often did things together.

157
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,480
On the day of the accident,

158
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,639
Senior Sister Wang Yun's husband, Chen Tongsheng, borrowed a car.

159
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,439
There were five people in total.

160
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,560
They went to the reservoir for a spring outing.

161
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,120
That evening, we got the news

162
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,759
that the car had driven straight into the water.

163
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,360
At that time, this child had just started elementary school.

164
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,040
So back then,

165
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,720
who was driving the car?

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
I don't know about that.

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
Only Senior Sister Wang Yun and this child were rescued.

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,799
At the time, Senior Sister Wang Yun was pregnant.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,480
What about Teacher Wang's own child?

170
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,840
The child didn't survive.

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,919
It's here.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,799
April 6, 1982.

173
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,480
A jeep drove into the reservoir.

174
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,120
Two people were rescued, three drowned.

175
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,799
How did it happen? Who was driving?

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,120
Drunk driving caused the car to go out of control.

177
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
The driver was Chen Tongsheng.

178
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,240
Let me take a look.

179
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,919
Mom

180
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,200
Mom

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Okay, thank you.

182
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,639
I think so too.

183
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,399
Wang Yun has taken care of him for so many years.

184
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,399
And has been so good to him.

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,039
Even an iceberg would have melted.

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,279
Where are you going?

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm going to report to Captain Huang.

188
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,919
Report about what?

189
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,559
There's no progress at all.

190
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,879
Let the captain cover for us.

191
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,519
Sit down.

192
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,759
That's true.

193
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I always feel

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,320
there's something off about Lu Bing.

195
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,559
What do you mean?

196
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,360
I can't really say either.

197
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
But for something this serious,

198
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,440
and with this kind of relationship,

199
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
he said it himself.

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,559
It's like with his own mother.

201
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,559
He answers every question smoothly.

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,879
That kind of logic,

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
I think it's normal.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,080
He's highly educated.

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
He has a graduate degree.

206
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,639
Alright, let's stop with the "I think, you think."

207
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,080
Let's discuss what to do about this.

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,559
I think we should go to Lu Bing's workplace.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,679
He definitely won't be at work these days.

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,039
Wouldn't we just be wasting our time going?

211
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,720
That's exactly the point.

212
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,279
If our mentor were here,

213
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,120
he would definitely do this.

214
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,440
Sounds good. Let's go together in a bit.

215
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,639
Alright.

216
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,639
Then I'll go to the police station.

217
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,039
And look into Wang Yun's social connections.

218
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,440
As for Lu Bing,

219
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,679
how does he get along with his colleagues?

220
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,720
Lu Bing is a pretty gentle person.

221
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,960
He's also quite warm to others.

222
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,799
But as a person,

223
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,279
he doesn't like to share much about himself.

224
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,639
Also,

225
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,279
with certain colleagues,

226
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,679
he doesn't get along well.

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,080
It's not that it's bad.

228
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
It's that they get along too well.

229
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,200
What do you mean by "get along too well"?

230
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,279
Lu Bing has been at the company for over two years.

231
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,879
Not long after joining, with our boss...

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,080
You know, that thing...

233
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,279
With whom?

234
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,639
Boss Luo.

235
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,440
Do you know Lu Bing's adoptive mother?

236
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes, I do.

237
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,000
How did you meet her?

238
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,559
She often comes to our company to make trouble.

239
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,720
Every time she comes, she wants to talk to me.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,720
What do you talk about?

241
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,759
She says Boss Luo isn't suitable for her.

242
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,440
One already has a family.

243
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,759
The other just entered society.

244
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,759
So what does this old lady want you to do?

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,320
She wants me to give Lu Bing's salary directly to her.

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
That's not acceptable.

247
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,240
That doesn't comply with company policy either.

248
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
Alright, I understand.

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,039
So, in other words,

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Teacher Wang knows about Boss Luo and Lu Bing.

251
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,320
Yes, she doesn't approve.

252
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,679
And how does Lu Bing feel about this?

253
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,679
Lu Bing?

254
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,759
He told me at the time

255
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,879
He promised me

256
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,080
that he would focus on his work from now on

257
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,919
and definitely not get involved in office romance again.

258
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,159
For the details

259
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,759
you'll have to ask Boss Luo.

260
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,919
I'll take you to find her. Come on.

261
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,639
How about this:

262
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,559
You invite Boss Luo here.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,559
Mr. Luo

264
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,000
These two are here to see you.

265
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,679
And you are?

266
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,240
Police.

267
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,360
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

268
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,440
Please, have a seat.

269
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,240
Alright.

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,840
What is this about?

271
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,000
How is your relationship with Lu Bing?

272
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
He's my colleague.

273
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,080
Our relationship is okay, I guess.

274
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,840
From what we know,

275
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,240
you two aren't just ordinary colleagues, are you?

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm actually his supervisor.

277
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,240
We often work overtime together and such.

278
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,240
Over time,

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,519
Some people might be talking nonsense behind your back.

280
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,559
You know Lu Bing's foster mother, right?

281
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,559
Aunt Wang, I know her.

282
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,799
She was killed yesterday.

283
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,960
She died at home.

284
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,919
Lu Bing has been on a business trip recently.

285
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,440
Last Monday.

286
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,320
What day did he come back?

287
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,559
I don't know.

288
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,039
Your subordinate—

289
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
He doesn't report to you after returning from a business trip?

290
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,919
Well, since we travel for work a lot,

291
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,919
so,

292
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,320
he doesn't tell me every time he goes on a trip.

293
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,799
Whether for work or personal reasons, he should at least inform you, right?

294
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,919
He hasn't been at work these past couple of days.

295
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
He didn't tell you?

296
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,120
He did.

297
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,519
He said he wasn't feeling well.

298
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,600
Did he tell you in person or over the phone?

299
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:08,720
On the phone.

300
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,879
He said he had a fever.

301
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
He might get better in a couple of days.

302
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,240
I see, Ms. Luo.

303
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,480
Because this is a criminal case,

304
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,039
all of Lu Bing's social connections

305
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,600
will be thoroughly investigated by us.

306
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,519
It's just a matter of time.

307
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,320
We hope you won't hide anything from us.

308
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,399
He and I really are just colleagues.

309
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,440
I don't know much about his personal life.

310
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,799
Do you have any other questions?

311
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,399
I have to go pick up my child.

312
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,799
That's all for today, then.

313
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,919
Please keep your phone available.

314
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,039
We'll contact you whenever we need to.

315
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay.

316
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,399
Alright, we'll leave last.

317
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,279
Let's go.

318
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Who is it?

319
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,039
Is it Brother Bing?

320
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,080
No, Tiantian, you go inside.

321
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,080
How did you find this place?

322
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,000
What I learned today

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
I've already told you everything.

324
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,879
If there's nothing else, don't come looking for me.

325
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,919
If it's not convenient for you right now,

326
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,279
we can come back later.

327
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,879
Then please come in.

328
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,559
Sorry to bother you.

329
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,519
Tiantian.

330
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,759
Come on, let's go to the inner room.

331
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,200
Why don't you go watch a cartoon?

332
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,519
Mom has something to discuss with these two uncles.

333
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,600
You already know why we're here.

334
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,759
We just want to know more about Lu Bing.

335
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,000
Go ahead and ask.

336
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,440
I see your child seems pretty close to Lu Bing.

337
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,159
He keeps calling him "Brother Bing" over and over.

338
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,360
Does he come here often?

339
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,200
My husband

340
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,919
is even busier at work than I am.

341
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,799
After I gave birth,

342
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,519
I was a full-time mom for several years.

343
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,519
It wasn't until my daughter started kindergarten

344
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
that I started working again.

345
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,680
It was around that time that I met Lu Bing.

346
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,240
Did Wang Yun know about this?

347
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,359
Yes.

348
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
It drove her crazy.

349
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,400
She confiscated Lu Bing's car.

350
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,920
She took away his salary.

351
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,119
In the end, she even stopped him from coming to work.

352
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
She practically wanted to lock him up.

353
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,519
And watch him every day.

354
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,839
Lu Bing tried to argue with her.

355
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,799
But in the end, he couldn't win against her.

356
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,839
Actually,

357
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
I eventually came to my senses too.

358
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,559
We couldn't go on like this.

359
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,799
So did you ever clearly break up with him?

360
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,880
Yes.

361
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,599
Tell me the details.

362
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,920
It was just last month, I think.

363
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,720
One day he asked me to go to his place.

364
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,759
That night, around seven or eight o'clock,

365
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,880
the two of us were watching TV in the living room.

366
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,119
Suddenly, we heard someone unlocking the door.

367
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,799
What's wrong?

368
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,599
Xiaobing.

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

370
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,200
Isn't it Aunt Wang?

371
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,519
What are you doing?

372
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,839
Get out, get out, get out!

373
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,640
Get out!

374
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,519
Go hide outside for a while.

375
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,440
Go out through here.

376
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Hurry, hurry!

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Then he forced me to climb out through that window.

378
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,599
I was standing in that little enclosure outside.

379
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
That iron fence.

380
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,839
I felt

381
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,079
I felt like I was an animal.

382
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,400
I was so afraid that down below,

383
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,559
the neighbors passing by would see me.

384
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,359
I felt so ashamed.

385
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,640
I have my dignity too.

386
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,759
I made up my mind back then.

387
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,440
I had to break up with him.

388
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
When was the last time you two were in contact?

389
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,000
When was it?

390
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,079
Last Friday, I think.

391
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,640
He suddenly called me.

392
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,400
He said

393
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,240
that I must wait for him.

394
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,400
He promised he wouldn't let me or Tiantian down.

395
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,400
He said he was sure he could

396
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,599
convince Aunt Wang.

397
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
Where were you on Sunday night?

398
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,759
This Sunday night?

399
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,400
Yes.

400
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,519
I was at home.

401
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,920
Tiantian and I were at home.

402
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,440
We will verify that.

403
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,599
The person who suddenly came in through the door

404
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,160
Was it Wang Yun?

405
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,880
Yes, I heard her voice.

406
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,720
This is my phone number.

407
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,519
If you remember anything

408
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,799
be sure to let us know.

409
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, Lu Bing is young,

410
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,839
handsome, and wealthy.

411
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,759
He makes over two hundred thousand a year.

412
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,680
There must be tons of young girls who like him.

413
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,000
So why does he insist on being with a married woman?

414
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,759
And she's so much older than him.

415
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
It's because his family was strict with him growing up.

416
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,000
He just went back and forth between home and school.

417
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,839
All he ever focused on was exams and studying.

418
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,519
Now that he's finally entered society,

419
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,799
suddenly there's an older woman taking care of him.

420
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,960
He eats her food, drinks what she provides.

421
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,559
It's like discovering a whole new world.

422
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,240
How could he not get hooked?

423
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,519
People like me, who grew up without anyone looking after us,

424
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,359
can't really feel what this new world is like.

425
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Lei, this is the autopsy report Zhang gave us.

426
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,000
It says the time of Wang Yun's death

427
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,039
was roughly between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.

428
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,279
But Lu Bing said

429
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,720
he left that night

430
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,440
at around ten o'clock.

431
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,839
So the time of Wang Yun's death

432
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,920
was it before ten

433
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,000
or after ten?

434
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't overthink this.

435
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,960
Just go ask Old Zhang and you'll know.

436
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,759
Your assessment result

437
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,759
for the time of death

438
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,880
is between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.

439
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,640
Can you be more specific?

440
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I can't be more specific.

441
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,279
That's just the time range.

442
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Zhang, can you narrow it down a bit more?

443
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,519
Was it before or after ten?

444
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,880
No, I can't.

445
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,039
There's always some margin of error.

446
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,119
If I guarantee it for you,

447
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,599
wouldn't that be irresponsible of me?

448
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,599
We just can't determine it.

449
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's it.

450
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,039
Officer Liu, why don't you give it a try?

451
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,960
Captain Huang

452
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,079
What are you doing?

453
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,279
Great, just in time. Come on, come on.

454
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,319
Put it here for me.

455
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Just leave it here for now.

456
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,799
I can't sleep.

457
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I was just thinking,

458
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,440
can we try to reconstruct the crime scene?

459
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,559
No wonder it was so noisy.

460
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,759
Let's say, hypothetically,

461
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,319
Lu Bing is the suspect.

462
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,240
What would he do?

463
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,160
Lu Bing takes the key and opens the door.

464
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,480
"I'm coming in," and then closes the door.

465
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,319
Didn't say anything, went to the kitchen.

466
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,599
Wang Yun could tell right away it was someone familiar.

467
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,440
Guessed immediately it was Lu Bing.

468
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
Called out at the door, "Xiao Bing, is that you?"

469
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,839
Lu Bing took a knife.

470
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,359
Wang Yun saw the knife.

471
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,079
Said, "Xiao Bing,"

472
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,519
"What are you doing with the knife?"

473
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,519
Then got scared.

474
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
Instinctively should have run to the bedroom.

475
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,839
Lu Bing rushed over and stabbed once.

476
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
Then stabbed again.

477
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,519
Then she

478
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,319
should have headed for the door, "Help!"

479
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,160
Stabbed again.

480
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
"Help!"

481
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,200
Stabbed again, "Help!"

482
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,960
"Help!"

483
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,319
Stabbed five or six times.

484
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,039
And then?

485
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,000
He also strangled her.

486
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,519
"Help!" Lu Bing was afraid she wasn't dead yet.

487
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
Took the bath towel.

488
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,119
And strangled her.

489
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,000
That's way too cruel.

490
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Strangled her to death.

491
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,000
Captain Huang, Captain Huang

492
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Are you okay?

493
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,559
I'm fine.

494
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,519
Come on, get up quickly!

495
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,279
I thought you really fainted.

496
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,200
I was just lying there to rest for a bit.

497
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,240
I actually find lying down pretty comfortable.

498
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,680
You think so?

499
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,039
Is that so?

500
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,240
I think so.

501
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
It makes sense in theory.

502
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,039
It's quite possible.

503
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,279
But there's no evidence right now.

504
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,039
What should we do?

505
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,160
If you do this

506
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,240
You still need to go find Lu Bing

507
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,599
Just keep asking him

508
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Ask relentlessly, ask about every detail

509
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
What time, down to the minute and second

510
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,680
What he ate

511
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,759
Where he went, and with whom

512
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,599
The more detailed your questions, the better

513
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,240
Let me tell you, this person

514
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,640
It's easy to make up lies

515
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,759
But to make them consistent

516
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,920
Especially the details, those are easy to forget

517
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,039
If it really is him

518
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,640
He'll slip up soon enough

519
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,279
Got it

520
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,880
What time did you say you left that night?

521
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,839
Around ten o'clock

522
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,119
Left or right?

523
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:14,960
I can't remember

524
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,559
What dishes did you have that night?

525
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,759
Stir-fried eggs with green peppers

526
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,359
Boiled sliced pork

527
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,759
Didn't you say there was a whole table of dishes? Just two?

528
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
What do you mean by this?

529
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
We don't mean anything

530
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,759
We just want to

531
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,319
learn more about the details

532
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,759
This morning you said

533
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,880
What did you eat that night again?

534
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,200
Stir-fried pork with green peppers

535
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,680
Wasn't it stir-fried eggs?

536
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,880
Right, stir-fried eggs with green peppers

537
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,240
So was it pork or eggs?

538
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,960
Eggs

539
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,319
Do you usually drink alcohol?

540
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,680
No.

541
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,160
So what time did you get home after drinking that day?

542
00:25:57,839 --> 00:25:58,839
Around two o'clock.

543
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,519
Can anyone confirm that?

544
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,839
No one saw me when I came back.

545
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
No one can confirm it.

546
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,519
What did the security guard say?

547
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,039
He said he seemed to see you a little after midnight.

548
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,599
That's impossible.

549
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,440
At that time,

550
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,079
I was drinking with Han Xiaowei.

551
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,000
He can vouch for me.

552
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,119
Didn't you just say no one could vouch for you?

553
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,319
He... he left first, around one thirty.

554
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,400
I just didn't remember earlier.

555
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,079
Han Xiaowei, male or female?

556
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,759
Male.

557
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,680
Who asked whom out?

558
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,759
He asked me out.

559
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,720
What did you talk about?

560
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,039
We talked about work.

561
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,839
What time did he call?

562
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,519
He did.

563
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,519
A little after seven.

564
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,440
Seven o'clock.

565
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,799
Are you sure it was seven?

566
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,400
I can't remember exactly.

567
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,359
Anyway, it was before I went to Aunt Wang's for dinner.

568
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,160
Maybe it was a little after six.

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,920
You have the call log, right? Let me see it.

570
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,440
He called the landline.

571
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,640
Do you have caller ID?

572
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,359
I haven't activated it.

573
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,440
You must have Han Xiaowei's cell number.

574
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
I didn't save it.

575
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
Where does he work?

576
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Tianhe Securities.

577
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,200
You know Lu Bing, right?

578
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,119
Yes, we were graduate school classmates.

579
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,079
When was the last time you contacted him?

580
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,640
The last time?

581
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,440
It's been several months.

582
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,880
About when was that?

583
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,160
If I had to guess,

584
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,599
it was probably at the beginning of the year.

585
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
The beginning of the year.

586
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,519
Hello

587
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,480
Brother Bing, this doll can't talk anymore.

588
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,160
Lu Bing, where are you taking me and Tiantian?

589
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,079
Why do I feel like we're almost out of the city?

590
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
Why are you in such a hurry?

591
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,319
You're always so busy and rushed at work.

592
00:27:58,759 --> 00:27:59,519
The three of us as a family

593
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,880
finally managed to go on a vacation together.

594
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,319
Just relax for a while.

595
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,279
You don't need to worry.

596
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
Leave everything to me.

597
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,240
Can you check what's wrong with Tiantian's doll?

598
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,799
I have so much to do right now.

599
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
You're in such a rush

600
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
and insisted on taking us out.

601
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,000
You two suddenly came to find me

602
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,960
and gave me quite a scare.

603
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,079
That's because you didn't answer your phone.

604
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,599
I was in a meeting at that time.

605
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,640
I never thought you'd actually go to the kindergarten

606
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,920
and pick her up.

607
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,799
You really are bold.

608
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,759
Mom, please help me!

609
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,960
Are we almost at Yunqing?

610
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,000
Almost.

611
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,880
Yang, hurry up!

612
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,599
Thanks.

613
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
Captain Huang, Luo Meihua called for help.

614
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,880
She said Lu Bing is taking her and the child out of the city.

615
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,079
That's right.

616
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,200
They're currently on Yunqing Road, National Highway 101.

617
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,000
Understood.

618
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,400
Head toward Yunqing.

619
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay.

620
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,079
Hello, comrade.

621
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,680
Please show your vehicle registration and driver's license.

622
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Step out of the vehicle for inspection.

623
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,400
What's wrong?

624
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,920
Do you know you were speeding?

625
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,519
I didn't notice.

626
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,079
Where are you going?

627
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,680
We're going on an outing.

628
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,720
There are kids in the back.

629
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,920
Why are you driving so fast?

630
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,119
You'll get a fine.

631
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,160
Be honest. Cuff him.

632
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,920
Do you know why you're being arrested?

633
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,559
Xiao Xu

634
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,359
Captain Huang

635
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,119
Are you okay?

636
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:48,880
Tiantian

637
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,559
What are you doing?

638
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,119
Tiantian

639
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,039
Let go of Brother Bing, fall back.

640
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,759
Tiantian

641
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,119
Tiantian

642
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,400
Tiantian

643
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,359
Tiantian

644
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,000
What are you doing?

645
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,519
My life

646
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,039
began when I met Meihua.

647
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,319
How should I put this?

648
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,319
Before I met her,

649
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
I couldn't really call myself a person.

650
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,640
I was like a machine.

651
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,240
Every day of my life was just

652
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,440
going from one class to another,

653
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,319
from one exam room to the next.

654
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,319
It was her presence that made me human.

655
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
She trusted me so much.

656
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,960
She let me handle everything on my own.

657
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,720
Cleaning the house,

658
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,599
putting on duvet covers,

659
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,559
going on business trips—

660
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,200
these were all things I'd never experienced before.

661
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
She even let me pick up Tiantian after school.

662
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,839
At that moment, I felt like I'd grown up.

663
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,599
I was an adult.

664
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,039
Life turned out to be so interesting.

665
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,079
But you don't have to

666
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,079
kill Wang Yun.

667
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,279
If I don't kill her,

668
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,599
I can't go on living.

669
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,240
But according to what we know,

670
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,119
She's really good to you.

671
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Good to me?

672
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,400
She always says she's good to me.

673
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,720
Good to me...

674
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,720
That's the phrase I've hated most since I was a kid.

675
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,880
Ever since I was little.

676
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,720
She has to control everything I do.

677
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,200
She even tells me how many times to chew my food.

678
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,119
Don't swallow yet.

679
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,680
You just chewed twenty times, one more to go.

680
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,559
Why do I have digestive problems?

681
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Because I never enjoy my meals.

682
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,319
So you never thought about trying to talk to her?

683
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,279
I gave up a long time ago.

684
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,800
I liked singing when I was a child.

685
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,920
She forcibly pulled me out of the choir.

686
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,920
She made me attend math classes.

687
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,559
I couldn't even go hang out at a classmate's house.

688
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,360
She was afraid others would lead me astray.

689
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,800
It was so hard for me to get into college.

690
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,199
I thought I could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

691
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,119
She rented an apartment right next to my school.

692
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,239
Every day she watched what time I finished class and left school.

693
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,519
I'm a person.

694
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,239
I'm not her personal property.

695
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,480
If my parents were still alive,

696
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,599
they would never treat me like this.

697
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,679
Have you ever thought about

698
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,559
that Teacher Wang treats you this way

699
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,760
because she sees you as her own son?

700
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,119
I'm not her son.

701
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,280
What right does she have?

702
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,239
Do you think

703
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,039
Wang Yun's husband caused your parents' death

704
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,360
Have you been holding a grudge against her

705
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,440
No

706
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,800
That was a long time ago

707
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,280
It has nothing to do with this

708
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,360
Then why is that

709
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,960
What exactly happened that night

710
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,119
She crossed my line

711
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,079
Early that morning

712
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,119
I saw her

713
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
holding my phone

714
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,679
sending a message to Meihua

715
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,119
Why are you using my phone

716
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,119
I don't hate her. I hate you.

717
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,840
I don't resent her. It's you I resent.

718
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
There's no way I'll cut ties with her.

719
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,679
If you can't make up your mind, I'll do it for you.

720
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,320
What gives you the right to decide for me?

721
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,480
Don't touch my phone from now on.

722
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,400
Stand up.

723
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
Let me tell you something.

724
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,599
If you don't send it today,

725
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,079
I'll go to your workplace tomorrow.

726
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,400
Why would you go to my workplace?

727
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,239
I've printed a hundred copies.

728
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,760
I'm not just going to your workplace.

729
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,480
I'll also go to her building.

730
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
And to her daughter's kindergarten.

731
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,800
I want everyone to know.

732
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,079
Let them all see.

733
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
This woman.

734
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,280
How she ruined you.

735
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,480
What gives you the right to treat me like this?

736
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,639
What right do you have to control me?

737
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,960
You're not even my real mother.

738
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Go ahead, tear them up.

739
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,079
It won't help, even if you tear them all up.

740
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
After you tear them up, I'll just print more.

741
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,119
I finished drinking at the bar.

742
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,280
Then I bought a few more bottles at the convenience store.

743
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,599
I finished drinking downstairs at my building.

744
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,079
I went upstairs and used my key to open the door.

745
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,320
I thought she was already asleep.

746
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,639
So I went into the kitchen first and took a knife.

747
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,800
Xiaobing, is that you?

748
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,960
Why are you holding a knife?

749
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
She froze when she saw me with the knife.

750
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,960
I lunged at her and stabbed her.

751
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,719
She tried to run.

752
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,440
She also tried to scream.

753
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,960
I strangled her with a scarf.

754
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn't move at all.

755
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,000
Yesterday, you

756
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,480
Where did you want to take Luo Meihua and her daughter?

757
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,679
I just wanted to take them away.

758
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,960
So they could have a better life.

759
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,960
I feel sorry for Meihua

760
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,159
and for Tiantian too

761
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,039
I want to start my life over

762
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,639
a kind of

763
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,360
a different life for the three of us together

764
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,719
free

765
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,639
and happy days

766
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,840
Did I do something wrong?

767
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,880
Alright, your skills are pretty good now.

768
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,599
Practice makes perfect.

769
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,880
Brother Yang

770
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,639
I'm busy.

771
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,000
Alright, it's done.

772
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,880
Come, take a look.

773
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,280
This is really well written.

774
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,960
You’ve worked hard. Take a break first.

775
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,360
I’ll go hand it over to Captain Huang.

776
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,880
You’re going too?

777
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,679
Does it matter who delivers it?

778
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm leaving, Lei.

779
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,440
I'm going to have dinner with Tingting.

780
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm going to be late. Bye!

781
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,039
Silly.

782
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,079
There's a movie coming out soon.

783
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,519
Let's go see it together.

784
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,880
See what?

785
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,840
Spider-Man.

786
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,480
Starring Tobey Maguire.

787
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,320
They say it's really good.

788
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
He plays a spider?

789
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:50,880
What?

790
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,639
Those Hollywood blockbusters

791
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,239
are about a high school student

792
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:55,280
who gets bitten by a spider

793
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,840
and then gains superpowers

794
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,320
like climbing walls and jumping across rooftops

795
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,880
What are you looking at?

796
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,199
Nothing

797
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,320
Boss

798
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:05,880
Check, please

799
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,199
Twenty-two

800
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,199
That expensive?

801
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,559
You think twenty-two is expensive?

802
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,880
Sit still for a moment, okay?

803
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,880
That's thirty, here's eight back

804
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,000
You still think twenty-two is expensive?

805
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:21,800
Then don't eat out anymore

806
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,679
Are you crazy? Who are you talking about?

807
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,880
I'm talking about you, so what?

808
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,519
What are you looking at? Not happy about it?

809
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,559
Bro

810
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,800
Mind your own business.

811
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah, I look down on you. So what?

812
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,599
If you don't have money, don't come out to eat next time.

813
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,679
What are you looking at? Call the police!

814
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,320
We only stole these things.

815
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
What else did you do?

816
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,960
We just snuck around and stole something.

817
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,079
We really didn't do anything else.

818
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,360
You even dared to use a knife, huh?

819
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,639
You've got a lot of nerve.

820
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,639
Ziming.

821
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,320
Brother Cui.

822
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,800
You caught them?

823
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,079
Aren't these the golden partners? Got caught again.

824
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,519
Take them away, take them away.

825
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,119
Get up.

826
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,400
Ow, ow, ow!

827
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,719
Be gentle.

828
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,119
There's also a knife.

829
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,159
Impressive. How did you figure it out?

830
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,800
The phone was too expensive.

831
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:36,840
The bag was heavy.

832
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,320
I remembered the notice you sent out a couple of days ago.

833
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,880
A few electronics stores had been broken into.

834
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,719
So I decided to check.

835
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,840
Turns out I was right.

836
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,800
Go take care of your wound quickly.

837
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,199
It's fine. Thanks for your hard work.

838
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,519
You go ahead, I'll head back to the station.

839
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,280
Let's go, to the hospital.

840
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,599
No need to go to the hospital.

841
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,440
Why go to the hospital?

842
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,280
Hurry up.

843
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:57,239
It's a common thing.

844
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,199
Go, go, go! Move!

845
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,480
Can you feel anything?

846
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,639
No, I can't.

847
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,519
That's right, you shouldn't feel anything.

848
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:11,880
Dr. Wang

849
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,639
The director needs you for something urgent. Please come out.

850
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,239
Please wait for me a moment.

851
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,239
Please hurry.

852
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,840
Injured again?

853
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,199
Aren't you on day shift today?

854
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:31,039
Our shifts aren't fixed.

855
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,320
What?

856
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,559
You didn't come because you knew I was on duty?

857
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,719
No.

858
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,159
Still working as a cop, huh?

859
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,639
Still not tired of it?

860
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,840
I don't know how to do anything else.

861
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
With your hands and feet, why not do something else?

862
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,320
Why insist on a job that's never-ending and keeps you away from home?

863
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,599
Watch your words.

864
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,000
Plenty of people want this job but can't get it.

865
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,639
How about you?

866
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,239
Me?

867
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,880
I'm great.
