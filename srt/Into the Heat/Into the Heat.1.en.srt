1
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,760
The last chime just now

2
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,879
was exactly 7:00 a.m. Beijing time.

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,879
Hello.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,519
Hello.

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,239
You know you can't park here for long, right?

6
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,680
Did you see the sign?

7
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,239
I'm a police officer too.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
Can you make an exception?

9
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,599
Then maybe you can call our chief.

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,000
Why would I call him about this?

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's such a minor thing.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,159
Just a few minutes, I'll leave as soon as I'm done.

13
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,439
Then please cooperate.

14
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,520
Driver's license and registration.

15
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,120
Alright.

16
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,400
Okay, okay, I'm leaving.

17
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,080
Liu Ziming

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Liu Ziming

19
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Liu Ziming

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,639
Liu Ziming

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Liu Ziming

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
What are you doing?

23
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,240
Stop the bus.

24
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,240
Driver

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,039
It's a bus, you should stop at the station, I'm saying.

26
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,400
No, the traffic police won't let me stop.

27
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,520
Wait, where are your shoes?

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
When I opened my eyes, both were gone.

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,639
I searched the whole bus and couldn't find them.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Did someone put on the wrong shoes?

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,360
If they did, they should at least leave theirs for me.

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,719
They didn't even leave me a pair of slippers.

33
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,840
Master, come here.

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,639
Wait, hold on.

35
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,719
Your door is automatic?

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,479
Can you request to the team

37
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,759
to get us a better car?

38
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,560
The car won't move.

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,639
But the door is automatic.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,919
What is this?

41
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,120
Hurry, hurry, call a car!

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,120
Where to?

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,919
Hello.

44
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,759
Xia Village.

45
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,159
It's just up ahead, you just—

46
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,919
We have an emergency, please help us.

47
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:43,560
Okay.

48
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,360
Why do your police cars always break down?

49
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,040
Excuse me, please let me through.

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,560
Coming through, coming through.

51
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Please make way, make way. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,279
Thank you, thank you.

53
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,800
Thanks.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,240
What are you so excited about?

55
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,639
Make sure you watch carefully in a bit.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,360
Master

57
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,639
Brother Lei

58
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,839
I'll ask you again later.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,399
Okay.

60
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:13,879
Master

61
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,959
What did you see? Tell me.

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,480
Female, around fifty years old.

63
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,560
Head to the south, feet to the north.

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
Lying on her side.

65
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,560
What else?

66
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,680
Also,

67
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,680
There are cast-off bloodstains.

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,279
The bed is messy.

69
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,399
There may have been a struggle.

70
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,560
That's all.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,120
Did you check the pillowcase?

72
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Take note.

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,519
Okay, thank you.

74
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,839
Come here, you two.

75
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,639
A little closer.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
Tell me what you saw.

77
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,639
Master.

78
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,199
The badge.

79
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,439
Looks sharp.

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
Your sister-in-law bought it for you.

81
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,079
Hurry, tell me what you saw.

82
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,319
The scene is located in the urban village of Dongfang Township.

83
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,680
Okay, thank you.

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,319
It's right next to Xingfu Road.

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
It runs north to south.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,759
After investigation,

87
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,480
the door and lock were intact.

88
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,079
The window was open by fourteen centimeters.

89
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,360
The double bed was placed at an angle.

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,720
The body was lying on its side, head to the south, feet to the north.

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,759
There was a pink floral quilt next to the body.

92
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
It's about 1.8 by 2.2 meters.

93
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,120
Twenty centimeters from the foot of the bed,

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
there was a red brick.

95
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,199
The brick had bloodstains on it.

96
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,279
Another red brick was forty centimeters away.

97
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,040
After comparison,

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,879
the two red bricks could form a whole brick.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,680
The body was wearing red pajamas.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,279
There was a blunt force wound on the left side of the forehead.

101
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,720
On the left side of the chest and lower left abdomen,

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
there were multiple stab wounds.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
That's all we've learned so far.

104
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,759
Did you hear that?

105
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, I heard.

106
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,000
Brother Ma

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,480
Brother Ma is here.

108
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
Brother Ma

109
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,519
The full set, huh?

110
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,399
This is the landlord.

111
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,560
He was also the one who called the police.

112
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,199
What time did you discover it?

113
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,279
It wasn't me who found it.

114
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,519
It was her neighbor, he saw it.

115
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,639
He insisted that I make the call.

116
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,079
That's why I called 110.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,120
Which neighbor? Where is he?

118
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,399
He's over there.

119
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,279
Little Sichuan

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,759
Wait a moment.

121
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:30,839
You

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
Come, you come.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
Did you know the deceased?

124
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,240
I've seen her a few times, but we're not close.

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
When did you find out?

126
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Just after six o'clock, I think.

127
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,959
How did you discover it?

128
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,040
She said she would help me with the skewers.

129
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,000
This morning, after I finished shopping, I called her.

130
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,199
I called her over to help.

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
But I called her several times and she didn't respond.

132
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,839
So I took a look through the window.

133
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,879
And I saw a lot of blood.

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Did you hear anything last night?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,560
I didn't hear any sounds last night.

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,040
There was a murder next door and you didn't hear anything?

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
The person is right next door to you.

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
Can't you hear?

139
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,759
Let me ask you again, can you hear it?

140
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,399
Yes.

141
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,840
What did you hear?

142
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
I just heard...

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,279
I just heard...

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,639
the sound of that kind of thing.

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,559
What do you mean by "that kind of thing"? Be specific.

146
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,320
What thing?

147
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,360
She was selling herself.

148
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,919
Master.

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,559
I’ve seen that everyone’s crocodile faces right.

150
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,080
Why is yours facing left?

151
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,759
Theirs is fake.

152
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,559
What did that person say?

153
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
They said the deceased was a streetwalker.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Is that possible?

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,360
Why wouldn’t it be possible?

156
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,200
Police.

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,799
Come on, don't be nervous.

158
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,039
We just want to ask you a few questions.

159
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,480
Please, have a seat.

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
Is this your shop?

161
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,279
Yes, yes, it is.

162
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,519
How late do you usually stay open at night?

163
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,440
Until two or three in the morning.

164
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,080
But it's not always the same.

165
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Whenever the customers finish drinking,

166
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
that's when we close.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
What time did you close last night?

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Around two thirty.

169
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,960
Did you see anything?

170
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,120
Did you see anyone?

171
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,879
Go ahead, say it. Why are you so nervous?

172
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,320
No, I'm not nervous.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
I really don't know them.

174
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,679
He looked like a migrant worker.

175
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
He came out of the house.

176
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
The two of us turned around.

177
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,279
He almost bumped into me.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,159
What did he look like?

179
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,279
I didn't see clearly.

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
He was covered in blood and you didn't see clearly?

181
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,080
I really didn't see clearly.

182
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,879
Then how do you know he was a migrant worker?

183
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,240
That's not a migrant worker.

184
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
No one can go looking for her.

185
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:38,960
Which way did he run?

186
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,720
That way, that way.

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
Alright.

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,559
Just trying to get some information.

189
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,159
Don't be nervous.

190
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,039
It's okay, it's okay.

191
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,200
Alright, go ahead with your business.

192
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,399
Thank you.

193
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,039
Old Wei

194
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,840
Judging by the rigor mortis

195
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,000
the time of death

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,440
should be between 1 and 3 a.m.

197
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,240
There are both blunt and sharp force injuries

198
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,200
By the way

199
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,159
Besides that brick at the scene

200
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,279
did you find any other weapons?

201
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,799
No, just the brick

202
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,879
Alright, I still need to go back and do the autopsy

203
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,720
Do you have a lot of work right now?

204
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,720
Don't try that with me.

205
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,480
You're using all your scheming on me.

206
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,639
You've worked so hard, have some mutton soup.

207
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,279
You think you can cut in line with just a bowl of mutton soup?

208
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,200
You, you...

209
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,320
Hey, you, come here.

210
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,399
Master.

211
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,000
Call him Brother Zhang.

212
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,879
Brother Zhang.

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,159
From now on,

214
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,639
wherever Brother Zhang goes, you follow.

215
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,480
Don't leave his side for even a step.

216
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,279
Not even a meter away.

217
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:36,919
Do you understand?

218
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,639
Understood.

219
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,480
How long do I have to follow him?

220
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,679
Don't ask stupid questions.

221
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,480
As long as Brother Zhang is here.

222
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,879
When the autopsy report comes out,

223
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,720
that's when you can leave.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,879
Is that right, Brother Zhang?

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,960
That's right.

226
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
That's right, that's right.

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,320
I understand, Master.

228
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,440
You're something else.

229
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,080
No.

230
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,960
How should I address you?

231
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,399
Liu Ziming.

232
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Officer Liu.

233
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,440
You go first.

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,879
No, you go first. Please, you go first.

235
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,000
Wait, whose apprentice is this?

236
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,000
Who brought this apprentice?

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,679
What? I didn't hear you. Speak up.

238
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,480
I'll hurry up for you.

239
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,960
Alright, got it. I'll be quick.

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,279
Master, I...

241
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,080
You really got to go up there? Come here.

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
You go east.

243
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,679
You go west.

244
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,200
You go south.

245
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,200
The three of you check each house one by one.

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
See if there are any suspects.

247
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,399
Pay special attention to any weapons left behind.

248
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,000
Understand?

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,440
Understood. Got it.

250
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,200
Alright, hurry.

251
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,919
What kind of life are you thinking about here?

252
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,639
Master, I just don't understand what you're saying.

253
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
You're already over fifty.

254
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,159
Why not do something else?

255
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,320
Why do you have to do this?

256
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,919
What are you thinking?

257
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,039
You came all the way here to be a detective.

258
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,200
You should have stayed at the police station for two more years.

259
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,080
Do you understand?

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,039
Why would I go to the police station?

261
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,720
Get lost.

262
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,960
Why isn't that fool back yet?

263
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,159
Which fool?

264
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,039
Captain Huang.

265
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,799
You mean the one who does wrestling throws?

266
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Better watch out for a big suplex next time.

267
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,360
He'll slam you down and you'll behave.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
Autopsy report.

269
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,639
That came out pretty fast.

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
The victim had sexual activity before death.

271
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,679
The stab wound to the outer left atrium was fatal.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,960
Master, Captain Huang

273
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,679
Where the hell have you been?

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
Went to the police station.

275
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,759
Checked Lin Chunmiao's household registration records.

276
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,039
Here they are.

277
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,840
I know.

278
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,639
Brother Ma said he sent them over.

279
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,039
Alright, stop flipping through that old notebook.

280
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,039
No one can read your handwriting anyway.

281
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,879
Just report directly, hurry up.

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,639
Lin Chunmiao's usual clients

283
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,960
are mostly local migrant workers.

284
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,559
She often disturbs the neighbors late at night.

285
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,159
If someone knocks on her door, she curses them out.

286
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,480
A street vendor said

287
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,679
she once went to buy cucumbers

288
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,759
and got into an argument over twenty cents.

289
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,879
She cursed out the person's entire family.

290
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,879
But I don't think anyone would kill her over that.

291
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,039
No one would kill her for that, right?

292
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,320
Also,

293
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,960
Did you go to all the places I told you to?

294
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,000
I did, I even went to a few extra.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,080
That's not what I asked.

296
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,000
How did you get back?

297
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,440
By bus.

298
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,799
By bus?

299
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,639
What about our own car?

300
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,080
No, boss.

301
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,919
Didn't you contact the repair shop?

302
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
It's in for repairs again.

303
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,039
Yeah.

304
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,519
The repair shop said it'll take several days.

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,759
We don't have a car to use now.

306
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's all share our thoughts.

307
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,519
What do you think about this case?

308
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,440
What do you mean by "let's all share"?

309
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,320
He pretends not to hear when he should. Did you see that?

310
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,159
Why are you pretending to be clueless?

311
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,480
We're talking about serious matters.

312
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,279
Hurry up.

313
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,879
Speak, go on.

314
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
There are no signs of a struggle inside the house.

315
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,960
The money in the wallet hasn't been touched.

316
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,080
Her financial situation

317
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,879
also makes it unlikely she was targeted for robbery.

318
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,480
The initial assessment suggests it might have been done by a migrant worker.

319
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,960
Has the murder weapon been found?

320
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,960
We checked in front of and behind the house, and along the road.

321
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
No knife was found.

322
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,879
Have the victim's family members been contacted?

323
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,639
Brother Ma has contacted her daughter.

324
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,120
She said she's on her way here from Fujian.

325
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't stay silent, Wei.

326
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,559
Tell us, what are your thoughts?

327
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,159
Captain Huang, here's what I think.

328
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:22,799
I think

329
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,679
we should intensify our investigation.

330
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,519
Go through each one, one by one.

331
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,360
Be sure to use the bus.

332
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,639
To improve efficiency,

333
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,159
everyone, line up quickly, okay?

334
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:33,960
Let's move quickly.

335
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,240
Captain Huang, I'm taking the bus now.

336
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,879
Very good.

337
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,919
You're setting a great example, Wei.

338
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,559
Consider this a verbal commendation.

339
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:54,080
The late emperor passed away before he could finish his great undertaking.

340
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Shut up.

341
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,519
Huang Zihong, Wang Chunyong.

342
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,399
They took leave yesterday.

343
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,679
They still haven't come back.

344
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,200
Huang Zihong.

345
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,159
Go back.

346
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,600
Let me see where you think you're going.

347
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,080
Why would I run?

348
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,720
You look like a cop to me.

349
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,440
What do you mean "like"? I am.

350
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,519
I didn't gamble.

351
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,639
If you didn't gamble, why are you running? Did I say you gambled?

352
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,240
Come here and stand properly.

353
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,879
Do you know why we're looking for you?

354
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,840
No, I don't.

355
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,919
Where were you last night?

356
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,200
Didn't do anything.

357
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,120
Nothing? Then why did you take leave?

358
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,200
I went... I went to an internet cafe.

359
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,279
Which internet cafe?

360
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
Boss, Huang Zihong was at the internet cafe from ten last night

361
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,200
until six in the morning.

362
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,240
Yes, he stayed all night.

363
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:40,639
Did he leave at any point?

364
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,480
No.

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
The manager got sleepy at night and locked the door.

366
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,200
If anyone wanted to leave,

367
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,279
they had to ask him to open the door.

368
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,279
So no one left.

369
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,679
There's no problem with Wang Chunyong either.

370
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,919
I'm waiting for you at the No. 2 construction site on Lingyun Road.

371
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,360
Okay, I'll be right there.

372
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,080
Whose is this Xue Hui?

373
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,320
It's Brother Yang's.

374
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,000
This Xue Hui is really stubborn, Master.

375
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,160
Can you not put it over by me?

376
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,039
One moment he says he went drinking,

377
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,200
the next he says he went to see a doctor.

378
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
Not a single word of truth.

379
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,200
So what happened after that?

380
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,119
He took out the handcuffs and put them down.

381
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,039
Where did he go?

382
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,599
He rented a room by the hour with a coworker's wife.

383
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
A coworker's wife?

384
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,960
Then where was the coworker's wife’s husband?

385
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,400
He went dancing with someone at the dance hall.

386
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,039
Master, are the noodles too hot?

387
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,480
No, they're not too hot.

388
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,920
You cooked another one for me again.

389
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,400
Master doesn't like eating egg yolks.

390
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,759
Master.

391
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,839
When will we ask the cafeteria

392
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,680
to make us some late-night snacks?

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,319
Even some dough drop soup would be fine.

394
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
Is dough drop soup okay?

395
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,440
When I become the director someday,

396
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,039
I'll open a restaurant just for you, right?

397
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,960
We'll have a few hot dishes stir-fried,

398
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,720
and some beer.

399
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,960
Dough drop soup is nothing compared to that.

400
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,880
That sounds great.

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,759
Liu Ziming

402
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,519
I'm going on a blind date tomorrow, Xiaoqing.

403
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,920
Got dumped again.

404
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
Is it really over this time?

405
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,319
I really can't stand you anymore.

406
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,759
I can't stand her either.

407
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,319
Yeah, washing so much every day, my skin's peeling.

408
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,400
No one could put up with that.

409
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,200
Alright, just wash if you want.

410
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,480
You smell like a corpse every day.

411
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,759
Covered in bloodstains, washing is good.

412
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,319
Alright, enough joking around.

413
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,400
After eating, take a quick nap.

414
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
You two

415
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,200
Check the rest for me.

416
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,680
You, come with me to the construction site by the Lei River.

417
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,400
Boss, that's far from the crime scene.

418
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,680
You're right, it's too far.

419
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,519
Alright, forget it.

420
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,160
Then you don't have to go.

421
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,319
Get some good rest.

422
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:49,920
Sleep well.

423
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,720
Wake up naturally.

424
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,559
Boss, I'll go with you.

425
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,039
Alright, alright, alright.

426
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,000
No need, no need, no need.

427
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,279
I'm not tired, I can go right now.

428
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Now you can go again.

429
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,640
I can go.

430
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,559
Then go, go ahead.

431
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,559
Who are you looking for?

432
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,319
I'm looking for Liu Ziming.

433
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,119
Please come with me, this way.

434
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,960
Ziming

435
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,960
Ziming

436
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:24,720
Ziming

437
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:26,720
Ziming

438
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,400
Where's Liu Ziming?

439
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,200
He was just here a moment ago.

440
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
What's going on?

441
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,599
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

442
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,839
Aren't you going to your blind date?

443
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,920
Why are you looking for me?

444
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,519
What if I really end up with someone else?

445
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,440
As long as you're happy.

446
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,759
I'm happy—happy for you.

447
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,839
I don't want to break up anymore.

448
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,519
Let's get back together.

449
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,400
Weren't you the one who said we weren't right for each other?

450
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,200
I've thought it through.

451
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,799
I don't look for someone suitable.

452
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,319
I just look for someone I like.

453
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,759
I just have to make things hard for myself.

454
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,519
There are so many suitable ones.

455
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
But only a few I actually like.

456
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,440
I just went to a crime scene this morning.

457
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,799
I didn't even have time to change my clothes.

458
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
I still smell like a corpse.

459
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,279
Smell for yourself if you don't believe me.

460
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,720
Why don't you just change jobs then?

461
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,839
There are so many other things you could do.

462
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,720
Or go back to the wrestling team and be a coach.

463
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,640
You think being a coach is that easy?

464
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,400
No, no, no.

465
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,200
And being a cop is easy?

466
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,480
Let me tell you,

467
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
When I joined the force, I took an oath.

468
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,039
To dedicate myself to the noble cause of public security.

469
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,200
I will never resign in my life.

470
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,160
Why not?

471
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,160
There are so many cops, it wouldn't matter if you left.

472
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,680
Alright, alright, just hurry home.

473
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,559
It's dangerous to be alone.

474
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm not going back—wait,

475
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm not done talking to you.

476
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,720
Think it over again.

477
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,839
I—

478
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,519
Bye.

479
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,160
I—

480
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,279
Sir,

481
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,039
Please make sure she gets home safely.

482
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:22,599
Okay.

483
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,000
Alright.

484
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,960
Fine, then I'll find someone else to marry tomorrow.

485
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,640
Alright, alright, I wish you happiness.

486
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,720
Bye.

487
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,559
Senior Brother

488
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,640
Let me do it.

489
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,680
No, I can't let you delay your important work.

490
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,119
Listening to success lectures again?

491
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,200
What's today's topic?

492
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Success, my foot.

493
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,440
You say that every day.

494
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,720
Who knows when you'll actually succeed.

495
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,079
Six, five, four, three, two

496
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:18,960
One

497
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,880
Good morning, Master.

498
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,720
Hey, who woke up that fool?

499
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,759
I patted him twice, but he wouldn't wake up.

500
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,200
I'll go.

501
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,799
Alright.

502
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,440
All is peaceful.

503
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
The phone rings less often.

504
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,599
We have fewer callouts.

505
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,440
You keep talking about it.

506
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,839
The more you talk about it, the more cases we get.

507
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,279
Thanks.

508
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,400
Master, he's awake.

509
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,279
Master.

510
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,920
He's up, young master.

511
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,839
He's up, let's go.

512
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,279
You two go check the remaining construction sites.

513
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,279
Did you hear that? Got it.

514
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,119
Let's go.

515
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,079
This is Li.

516
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,039
Which Li is this?

517
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:21,720
Li Gang.

518
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,480
It's pronounced "Gang"?

519
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
Check if Li Gang is here.

520
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,240
Li Gang.

521
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,920
Do you know where Li Gang went?

522
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,880
I saw him go out.

523
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,400
He didn't tell me.

524
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,440
He just took a half-day off.

525
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,200
He still hasn't come back.

526
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,920
Three people took leave today.

527
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,559
Two came back, one hasn't.

528
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,440
You don't know?

529
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,400
Don't you check attendance every day?

530
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,039
You do attendance, but now he's gone.

531
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,559
I can't find him either, what can I do?

532
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,440
Why did he take leave?

533
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
I don't know.

534
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,000
Which room does he live in?

535
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,119
Which room?

536
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,240
Probably the third room in the fourth row.

537
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,759
Alright, thank you.

538
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,240
This is the visit report you wrote?

539
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,279
Even if you wrote it with your feet, it couldn't be this bad.

540
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,440
Who could even read this?

541
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,240
Rewrite it for me tonight, word for word.

542
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,039
Who are you looking for?

543
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,480
May I ask your surname?

544
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,240
My surname is Zhang.

545
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,039
Then it must be you.

546
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
Engineer Cao is calling for you.

547
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,640
We haven't finished eating yet.

548
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,920
To the office, to the office.

549
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,200
Let me ask you something.

550
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,960
Which one is Li Gang's shop?

551
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,640
That one.

552
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,440
This one, right?

553
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,519
Alright, thank you.

554
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,039
Master

555
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,119
Cast-off bloodstain

556
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,160
It really is him

557
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
What's there to get excited about?

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,920
Fights break out all the time at construction sites

559
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,720
Is there a knife?

560
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,720
Alright, stop looking.

561
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,839
Hurry up.

562
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,920
Take this to the forensics department.

563
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,839
Got it.

564
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Sir, you really work hard.

565
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,559
Have a cigarette, have a cigarette.

566
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,920
Hey, I want to ask you something.

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,720
That Li Gang who lives three doors down.

568
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,799
Do you know him?

569
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,279
Why are you looking for him?

570
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
He owes me some money.

571
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,920
Do you know where he went?

572
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,759
I haven't seen him for several days.

573
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,319
Does he usually have any

574
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,559
friends or acquaintances who come to see him?

575
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,799
There's a fellow townsman who comes often.

576
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,920
They seem pretty close.

577
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,720
What does he do?

578
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,400
There's a place called Shanqi Building Materials Market.

579
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,759
He opened a shop there selling building materials.

580
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,279
Li Gang calls him "Mouse."

581
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,240
Mouse.

582
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,319
You don't know the name of the shop either?

583
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,319
No, I don't know.

584
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,759
Alright, thank you.

585
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,559
Go ahead, don't let me keep you.

586
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,279
Mouse, Mouse.

587
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,599
Mouse, Mouse.

588
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,920
Mouse, where are you, Mouse?

589
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,279
Over here.

590
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,039
Why are you shouting? Who is it?

591
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,799
It's nothing.

592
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:40,839
Police.

593
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,720
We want to ask you a few questions.

594
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,039
Wait, did I do something wrong?

595
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,920
Come on, let's go.

596
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,839
No, no, let's not do this.

597
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,680
There are a lot of people here, it doesn't look good.

598
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,079
Okay, okay, I'll go with you.

599
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,880
Alright, let's talk somewhere else.

600
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,200
What's your name?

601
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,039
Mouse.

602
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,119
Zhang Hao.

603
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,119
From Wu County, right?

604
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,440
How did you know that?

605
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,880
Hasn't Li Gang contacted you these past couple of days?

606
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,720
Li... Li Gang?

607
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,200
Wait, which Li Gang?

608
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,440
Lei He construction site, your fellow townsman.

609
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,400
You always go to see him.

610
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,119
Him? He hasn't forgotten, not at all.

611
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,160
It's been a long time since we last met.

612
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,920
When was the last time you saw him?

613
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,920
Uh, uh...

614
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,519
A month ago.

615
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,559
We had drinks together.

616
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,480
To be honest,

617
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,039
Did he come looking for you?

618
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,519
Where is he now?

619
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,319
No.

620
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,119
I... I...

621
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,279
I really haven't seen him.

622
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,640
I don't know anything.

623
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,839
We police can't wrongly accuse good people, right?

624
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,559
As you can see, my shop is still busy.

625
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,839
If there's nothing else, I'll head back first.

626
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,880
Alright, you go ahead.

627
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,200
Then I'll let you get back to work. See you.

628
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,319
Keep an eye on things here.

629
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,400
I'll go to the station and find out where he lives.

630
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,920
Boss, the blood type matches.

631
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,319
Call Liu Yang and ask where he is.

632
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
Hello, this is call nine five zero three.

633
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,079
Mr. Liu,

634
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,559
please return the call to the team as soon as possible.

635
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,079
Thank you.

636
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,240
Speak.

637
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Master, I followed them to a billiard hall.

638
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,119
No. 93, East Honghua Road.

639
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,799
Stay there and don't move.

640
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Don't move, do you hear me?

641
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,599
Let's go.

642
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,119
Master, wait a moment.

643
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,519
You've gone bad.

644
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,240
Wu Hai

645
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,640
Wu Hai

646
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,960
Can you sleep a little quieter?

647
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,880
Lying next to you is like sleeping in a pigsty.

648
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,240
Where are my car keys?

649
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,240
Brother Dali is still reading.

650
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,319
He bought it several years ago.

651
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,960
When he first bought it,

652
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,160
he thought it was about police officers.

653
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,680
So what is it about?

654
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,480
It is about police officers—about you.

655
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,799
What are you wearing?

656
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,839
Which girl gave it to you?

657
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,160
My mom left it for me.

658
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,039
My sister insisted I wear it.

659
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,319
She said it's for protection.

660
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,839
Got it.

661
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
Hold on a moment, master.

662
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,559
Master.

663
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,680
Checked, there's no one at home.

664
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:12,960
Okay.

665
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,039
Where are you going?

666
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,039
He can go, that's enough.

667
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,319
Alright.

668
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,920
Come on, master, whose turn is it?

669
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,279
Don't move.

670
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,720
Don't move, don't move. Hang in there, hang in there.

671
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,079
Boss, open up a table.

672
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,240
Table three.

673
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,440
Don't move, don't move.

674
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,200
I'll pull out your tongue next.

675
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,880
Got any cavities you want out?

676
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,440
Come on, come on, keep going.

677
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,000
Hao, Hao, Hao.

678
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,240
Can you pull this side out too?

679
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,640
Then can I not pay back the three hundred?

680
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,359
No way.

681
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,759
What if you win?

682
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,119
If I win, I don't have to pull it out, right?

683
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,279
Come on, let's start.

684
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,759
Come on, set up the balls.

685
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,960
Stop staring.

686
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,720
Give it to me.

687
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,759
Show him what you've got.

688
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,599
How could I?

689
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,359
Figure it out yourself.

690
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,920
Break shot.

691
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,279
Playing? What game?

692
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:14,839
It's in.

693
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,839
It's in, all of them.

694
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,200
All of them.

695
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,400
Let's play a round.

696
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,599
Go for the corner pocket.

697
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,000
I'm breaking first.

698
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,119
Watch me.

699
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,359
Here it comes.

700
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,759
Shoot for that corner pocket.

701
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,559
It's the eight ball!

702
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,640
What are you doing?

703
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,079
What are you doing?

704
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,880
Are you blind? You bumped into me.

705
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,359
You bumped into me, do you know that?

706
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,160
Big bro

707
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,680
Get him

708
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Just get him

709
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,599
There's a fight in the room again

710
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,000
It's fine

711
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,319
Did you see the guy who just went in?

712
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,440
He's from the wrestling team

713
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,000
Big brother

714
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,680
General

715
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,480
Did you switch my piece?

716
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,880
Admit defeat or not? Come on!

717
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,640
I admit defeat

718
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:26,880
Let go

719
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,519
What are you doing?

720
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,359
Step back

721
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,960
What are you doing? Who are you?

722
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,359
What is that thing?

723
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,279
Are you blind? Police

724
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,880
Po- Police

725
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,079
He hit me first

726
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,640
Squat down there

727
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,279
Squat down there

728
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:46,880
Does it hurt?

729
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,599
No, it doesn't.

730
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,079
If it doesn't hurt, why didn't you fight back?

731
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,039
What do you have hands for?

732
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:51,720
Hit him.

733
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Don't you know how to fight back?

734
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,279
He's even armed now.

735
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,559
How could you let him pull out a knife?

736
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,480
I didn't see him pull out a knife.

737
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,359
Do you admit defeat?

738
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,720
Shut up.

739
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,000
Take that thing off for me.

740
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,519
Why are you leaving him a handle to grab?

741
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,159
It's off.

742
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,920
The police are here now. Let's see how arrogant you are.

743
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,199
Squat down there.

744
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,280
Who told you to get up? Stay squatting.

745
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Where is he?

746
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,639
Who?

747
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,039
You’re pretending with me, huh?

748
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,920
What he did is serious.

749
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,840
If you cooperate, it has nothing to do with you.

750
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,239
If you don’t talk,

751
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,239
it counts as covering for him.

752
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,480
Plus what just happened,

753
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
you could be covering for him for ten or twenty years.

754
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,039
Can you handle that?

755
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,480
Can you handle that?

756
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,079
I-I-I can’t handle it.

757
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,880
That Li Gang,

758
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,039
what exactly did he do?

759
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,400
He killed someone.

760
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,360
Killed someone?

761
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,639
Wasn’t it just a fight?

762
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,519
No, no, no.

763
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,760
My horse is here.

764
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,280
How did it end up here?

765
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
Your horse jumped over from here.

766
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
Look, I was just here.

767
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,840
I took one step and jumped over.

768
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,039
Jumped over—checkmate.

769
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,280
No, no, no.

770
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,360
Next time, boss.

771
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,440
You left before we finished the game.

772
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,559
Brother Dali,

773
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Officer, you don’t need to hold me, I can walk myself.

774
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Enough talk, enough talk.

775
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,320
Look, there’s so much here.

776
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,519
Alright, stop talking.

777
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,760
Go, go, go. I don't have it.

778
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,000
What's wrong, bro?

779
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,119
Here, here, here.

780
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:47,719
Here you go.

781
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,360
Alright, alright, alright.

782
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,280
Master, what does he mean?

783
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,679
He means to say

784
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,440
he's the only one in our team who's been shot.

785
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:58,599
Pry open

786
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,960
Didn't your coach teach you how to control your strength?

787
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,199
Fall to your death again.

788
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,599
Don't move! Police!

789
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,119
I'm asking you, is your name Li Gang?

790
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,920
That's right.

791
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,840
Do you know why you're being arrested?

792
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,639
No, I don't.

793
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:36,800
You've got the wrong person.

794
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,360
With that accent of yours,

795
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,840
you must be from the same place as a rat.

796
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,159
Take him away. Get up.

797
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,159
Move.

798
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,079
Go ahead, talk.

799
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,599
It's good that you caught me.

800
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,960
I don't have to hide or run anymore.

801
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,800
I feel relieved.

802
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Being relieved is good.

803
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,320
Then you go first.

804
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,199
What’s your relationship with Lin Chunmiao?

805
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,760
Who is Lin Chunmiao?

806
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:17,679
The one you killed.

807
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,960
I don’t know her.

808
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,320
If you don’t know her, why did you go to her?

809
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,559
It was my first time looking for her too.

810
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,360
Who introduced you?

811
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,679
No one introduced us.

812
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,840
I just walked around there.

813
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,840
She came up to me on her own.

814
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,199
What did you do before that?

815
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,320
What did you do after that?

816
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Be specific.

817
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,960
It’s the same every day.

818
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,039
There’s nothing much to say.

819
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,599
I waste my days at the construction site.

820
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,320
The site stopped work.

821
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,880
So I went to unload beer for people.

822
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,760
I also want to find a factory job screwing parts together.

823
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,320
But they don't want me, they say I'm too old.

824
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,519
I'm a person too.

825
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,679
I need to vent too.

826
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,280
You vented by killing someone.

827
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,599
My foreman is from the same village as me.

828
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,000
He even calls me uncle.

829
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,719
But after I got here,

830
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,199
he kept scolding me.

831
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,039
That day,

832
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,039
just because I spent a bit longer in the bathroom,

833
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,400
he scolded me again.

834
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,360
And he did it in front of everyone.

835
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,119
He even slapped me.

836
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,440
So I wanted to find a woman to let off some steam.

837
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,599
You killed someone just to vent your anger?

838
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,559
We agreed on twenty-five.

839
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,119
I gave her thirty.

840
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,079
She wouldn't give me change.

841
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,239
She insisted I was dirty.

842
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,519
She wanted five more.

843
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,599
That made me really angry.

844
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,880
So I did it to her.

845
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,840
You killed her over five bucks?

846
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,840
I didn't mean to kill her.

847
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,880
She kept cursing at me.

848
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,800
I hit her with a brick.

849
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,159
She kept cursing.

850
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,960
Not just cursing, she slapped me too.

851
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,480
She slapped you, so you killed her?

852
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,239
Your foreman slapped you too.

853
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,519
Are you going to kill him as well?

854
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,920
A slap I could let go.

855
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,199
But her insults got worse and worse.

856
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,400
She even cursed that I'd never have children.

857
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,440
And then?

858
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,400
I saw a fruit knife nearby.

859
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,760
I picked it up and stabbed her.

860
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,559
Where's the knife?

861
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,800
I threw it in the trash pile.

862
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,079
How far did you go to throw it away?

863
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,320
Was it a garbage pile or a trash can?

864
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,159
It could have been a can.

865
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,079
I don't remember.

866
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,159
Brother Dali

867
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,320
I just finished writing the case report.

868
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,960
Can you take a look at it for me?

869
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,400
Who said you could drive my car?

870
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,599
Our car broke down, didn't it?

871
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,679
You should have told me your car broke down.

872
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,159
But weren't you sleeping?

873
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,840
You were even snoring, I didn't wake you up.

874
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,960
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

875
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,360
Eat, eat—what meal?

876
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,440
Your mentor has totally led you astray.

877
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,480
Take a look, hurry up and look.

878
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,239
Not bad, the format is all correct.

879
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:20,679
Your handwriting is even messier than mine.

880
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,679
Practice it later.

881
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,840
As long as it's readable.

882
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,760
Dali

883
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,760
Is that book really that interesting?

884
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,280
I always see you keeping it on the dashboard.

885
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,400
It's a classic.

886
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,679
But the character names are so hard to remember.

887
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,840
Do you know the author's name?

888
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,440
Isn't it Dostoevsky?

889
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,480
The full name.

890
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,840
The full name is

891
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,119
Fyodor Mikhailovich

892
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,360
Dostoevsky.

893
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Such a long name, it's really hard to remember.

894
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,679
And you still read it?

895
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:50,800
Dali

896
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,960
This gunshot wound

897
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,880
what happened?

898
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,320
No, no, let's not talk about it.

899
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,159
No, come on, tell me about it.

900
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,239
It's all in the past.

901
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,840
What case was it? How did it happen?

902
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,480
We can't keep bringing it up, or I'll keep thinking about it.

903
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:02,880
Master.

904
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,079
Don't listen to him brag.

905
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,239
He burned that himself with a cigarette.

906
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,480
Old Wei, you're a veteran detective too.

907
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,159
Can you be a bit more responsible with your words?

908
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,000
This is a through-and-through wound.

909
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,119
What kind of cigarette could make such a big scar?

910
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:13,960
A cigar.

911
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,199
There's another burn on the back.

912
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,280
Who burned it? Me.

913
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,719
Next time, line them up. They're not even straight.

914
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,840
Take a look when you shower.

915
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,559
They're crooked.

916
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:21,440
One's higher, one's lower.

917
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,480
Crooked.

918
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,880
Uneducated.

919
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,360
I'm not going to argue with you.

920
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,639
I was going to burn four characters too.

921
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,639
But I forgot about it.

922
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:29,159
I'll burn four characters for you next time, you'll see.

923
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,800
Master, the case report.

924
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:33,880
You—

925
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,000
Who said the case is closed?

926
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,440
I did.

927
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:37,800
Where's the knife?

928
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,559
You must have eaten the knife.

929
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,199
Remember this.

930
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,960
A fruit knife with a black handle.

931
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,159
Twenty centimeters long.

932
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:49,360
Head east from the crime scene, out the east gate.

933
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,440
It's in a trash can, about three hundred meters away.

934
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,559
Go look for it.

935
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:55,599
Old Wei.

936
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,199
Brother Ma.

937
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,639
Lin Chunmiao's daughter has arrived.

938
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,360
Ziming, hurry up.

939
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,239
Go over there, quickly.
