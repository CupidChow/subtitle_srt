1
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,640
You think this person could be a

2
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,879
fishing enthusiast?

3
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,159
This might just be a lead.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
But that's not the key point.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,719
The key point is,

6
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,719
I checked the victim's account activity.

7
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,719
I found that her money was moving in and out in large amounts.

8
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,319
Someone transferred 7.8 million to her.

9
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,840
Less than two weeks later, another 2 million was transferred to her.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Right after that, this money

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,519
was sent to several other accounts.

12
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,760
What's this person's name?

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
Let me check for this person.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Here.

15
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,519
Liu Jun.

16
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,760
Liu Jun again?

17
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,120
You guys found Liu Jun too?

18
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,360
Should I give him a call?

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,879
I found his company number.

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,560
Don't.

21
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,680
Let's surprise him and go straight to him.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,639
Let's go.

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
Put your friend away properly.

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Don't scare anyone.

25
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,319
Okay.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
Don't forget your bag.

27
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,719
Hello.

28
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,400
Hello.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,719
Is Liu Jun, your boss, here?

30
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,120
Do you have an appointment?

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,520
No.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
We want to ask him about something.

33
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,000
Our boss is in a meeting right now.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't know when he'll be done.

35
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,080
Would tomorrow work for you?

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,919
I can help you make an appointment.

37
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,719
No need to wait until tomorrow.

38
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,439
We'll see him as soon as his meeting ends.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,319
Okay, I'll go ask for you.

40
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,280
Boss.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,439
His company seems to be doing pretty well.

42
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,840
When will our police department have an environment like this?

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
What are you thinking about?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,199
Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,080
I really couldn't get away from business matters.

46
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,000
And you are?

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
We're from the Haiming City Public Security Bureau.

48
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,280
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
Sure, go ahead.

50
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,439
You know Zhao Hongxia, right?

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
Why? Did she...

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,439
Get caught gambling?

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,520
Or was she kidnapped by debt collectors?

54
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,560
She was murdered.

55
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,280
Really?

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,680
You don't seem very surprised.

57
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,919
It's about Hongxia, right?

58
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,280
It's complicated.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,919
As for me and her,

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,039
we used to date.

61
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,240
Later on,

62
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,399
we broke up on good terms.

63
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,319
So how did you two get back in touch?

64
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,199
She saw online that I had returned to the country.

65
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,160
Liu Jun.

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,079
She waited for me at the airport for three whole days.

67
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,920
She would go look for every flight arriving from the US.

68
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,920
She kept waiting until she finally met me.

69
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,959
She heard I was starting a business.

70
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,399
At that time, it seemed like

71
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,759
she had already broken up with that Hong Kong tycoon.

72
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,199
She had some spare money.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,399
So she said she wanted to invest.

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,399
Where were you the day before yesterday?

75
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,839
No,

76
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,000
there have been too many meetings lately.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,959
I really can't remember clearly.

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,439
How about this:

79
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,240
Come back to the station with us.

80
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,439
You can take your time to remember there.

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me take care of some things at the company first.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,879
Then I'll go with you.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,079
Liu Jun! Liu Jun!

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,399
Why are you running?

85
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,040
What are you doing?

86
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,600
Why are you running? Don't move!

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm not running, I'm standing right here.

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,160
Isn't the office over there?

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
Sir, I just...

90
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,240
Take him away.

91
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,120
Don't go through the office.

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,800
There's a door over there too.

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,759
Enough with the nonsense.

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,639
Thanks.

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,040
Lower your head. Stop talking nonsense.

96
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,759
Go on.

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,279
What happened between you two after you came back?

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,399
At first, things were pretty good.

99
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,199
It felt a bit like the old days.

100
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,199
But then we started arguing all the time.

101
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,279
I've never argued so much in my life.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,560
Why did you argue?

103
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,079
She kept bringing up marriage.

104
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,399
She mentioned it so often,

105
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,399
I got annoyed too.

106
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,639
Then why didn't you marry her?

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I was divorced.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
But she was with someone else for so many years.

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
I just couldn't accept it emotionally.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,399
Later, Hongxia changed.

111
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,160
Some young guys started showing up out of nowhere.

112
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,480
She was flirting with them.

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,040
There was one she called Chenchen.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,040
She kept saying how good Chenchen was to her,

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,959
how considerate and caring he was.

116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,759
She was just trying to get under my skin.

117
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,000
In my opinion,

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,759
it was that Chenchen who led Hongxia astray.

119
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,800
At first,

120
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,800
it was drugs and pills.

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,759
Later, she took her to Macau, China to gamble.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
The first couple of times, they could still win some money.

123
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,319
But after that,

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,959
it was just losing non-stop.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,839
She told you all this?

126
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,800
Why did she tell you these things?

127
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,279
She couldn't take losing anymore.

128
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,959
So she came to me for money.

129
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,680
Zhao Hongxia asked you for money?

130
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,279
How did you handle it?

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,279
I told her,

132
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,759
I said I didn't have that much money to cover her debts.

133
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,639
And she couldn't keep living like this.

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,399
She argued with me.

135
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,240
I couldn't stand her always causing trouble at my company.

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,639
And then I thought,

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,759
she was already in such a bad state,

138
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,839
if I didn't help her, who would?

139
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,600
So I sold a commercial property.

140
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,240
I sold it for 7.8 million.

141
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,560
I gave her all the money.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,560
I told her this was a one-time thing.

143
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,800
She couldn't go gambling again.

144
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,759
What did she say?

145
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,279
She took the money

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
and left.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,160
I thought after this sacrifice, she would leave me alone.

148
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,959
But I was completely wrong.

149
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't know if she used the money to pay off her debts.

150
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,639
Less than three months later,

151
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,279
she came to me again.

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,519
Sigh.

153
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm in a meeting right now.

154
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,879
What do you actually want?

155
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,440
Let's settle our accounts.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,240
Fine, let's do it, let's do it.

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
I gave you a thousand before.

158
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,000
You paid me back seven hundred eighty last time.

159
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,320
We've known each other for so many years.

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,960
I won't charge you high interest.

161
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,960
How about this:

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
You give me another three hundred.

163
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,759
Then we're even.

164
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,960
I paid you back seven hundred eighty.

165
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,440
We agreed it was an investment at the start.

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,399
That seven hundred eighty last time,

167
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,559
that was my personal money to help you out.

168
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
All these years, I've given you your share of the profits.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,559
I never shortchanged you a single cent.

170
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,759
How can you even say

171
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,639
that I should give you another three million to settle things?

172
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Are you withdrawing your shares?

173
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
I don't care.

174
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,679
You just have to give me the money.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Otherwise, you can forget about running this company.

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
How did you become like this?

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,399
What about me? What's wrong with me?

178
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,480
It's none of your business.

179
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
Just give me the money.

180
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,159
Hongxia.

181
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,960
Can we stop gambling?

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,159
Marry me.

183
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,679
If you marry me, I'll stop gambling.

184
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,440
I don't have any money.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,399
If you don't have money, sell a house.

186
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:49,759
How about this,

187
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
I'll give you another two million.

188
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,639
I'll figure out a way for the rest.

189
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,720
Can you wait a little longer?

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,399
No, why should I wait?

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,039
I own half of all your properties.

192
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,480
I invested in all of them for you.

193
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,600
Saying I only have half is me being polite.

194
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,600
Anyway, I don't care.

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,799
You should at least sell me another house.

196
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,279
Later, I really had no choice.

197
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,080
So I scraped together another three million for her.

198
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
When did this happen?

199
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
January 19th, two months ago.

200
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,799
You remember it that clearly?

201
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,759
That was my birthday.

202
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,960
It was also the last time I saw her.

203
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,399
Are you telling the truth?

204
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,960
It's one hundred percent true, officer.

205
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,159
After that, I didn't even contact her.

206
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,799
The next time I heard about her

207
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,799
was when you came to find me.

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,399
Between 9:30 and 11:00 p.m. on the 4th,

209
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,639
where exactly were you?

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,799
At the office.

211
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
You just said you were at home.

212
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,480
Then I must have gone home.

213
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,799
It's been too long, I can't remember.

214
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,799
You can't remember?

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
You remember what happened two months ago so clearly,

216
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
but you forgot what happened just a few days ago?

217
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,399
I've just been too busy.

218
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,000
You can't recall, right?

219
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,279
We'll help you remember.

220
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,679
Take a good look.

221
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,159
I'm telling you.

222
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,399
We've already checked.

223
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,039
You weren't home that night.

224
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,440
That night,

225
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,240
Did you go near Zhao Hongxia's house that night? Speak.

226
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
It wasn't me.

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,879
I didn't kill anyone.

228
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,679
If it wasn't you, why did you run?

229
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,200
I...

230
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,879
Where exactly were you that night?

231
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,399
Where exactly were you that night?

232
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,440
I...

233
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,759
I went to see a prostitute.

234
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,440
See who?

235
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,159
I went to see a prostitute.

236
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
Why didn't you say so earlier?

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,159
I was afraid it would get out.

238
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,879
It could affect my company's financing.

239
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,960
Where did you find them? What's their name?

240
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,879
The exact location.

241
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,120
I think he's probably telling the truth.

242
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,279
Master, should we go look for this Tongtong?

243
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,600
Where would you even start looking?

244
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,039
There are so many people coming and going at Shengli Bridge.

245
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,080
Is it really that easy to find someone there?

246
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,000
That's true.

247
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,480
That place is basically

248
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,200
a hub for transient people.

249
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,679
At this hour, people are eating, meeting up,

250
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,960
shopping, or just strolling around.

251
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,320
Finding someone there is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

252
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,799
Even if we know who it is,

253
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,720
if we go straight up to them,

254
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,519
won't they just run away when they see us?

255
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,960
Master, I remember you're pretty good at this kind of thing.

256
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,120
Come in.

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,080
Captain Huang.

258
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Ziming.

259
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,639
I want to find someone around Shengli Bridge.

260
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,000
Who?

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
Someone who works the street.

262
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,320
I only know their nickname.

263
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,240
I don't know their real name.

264
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,000
Then do this—

265
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,120
Go contact this person.

266
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,159
Maybe they can help you.

267
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,200
Xia Yu.

268
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,480
You're always hanging around the city bureau's records room.

269
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,799
Do you know someone named Wen Jun there?

270
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,080
Wen Jun?

271
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,679
Never heard of them, I don't know.

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,279
Is it a man or a woman?

273
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
How would I know?

274
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,600
Captain Huang didn't say either.

275
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,559
Hello?

276
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,519
Are you Wenjun?

277
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,399
Oh my, it's so cold outside.

278
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
Please pour me a cup of hot water, thank you.

279
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
Who are you looking for?

280
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
W-What do you mean, who am I looking for?

281
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,000
Aren't you the ones who called me?

282
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,159
So you are Wenjun.

283
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,759
You...

284
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,039
I was in such a hurry when I left just now.

285
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,320
I just threw on some clothes and came out.

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,399
Come, come, have a seat. Sit, sit.

287
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,639
Take a break, sit down.

288
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Wait, you don't recognize me?

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Haven't we met before?

290
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,399
Have we?

291
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,480
Do we know each other?

292
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,960
I remember now.

293
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,320
You're that girl from the archives room, right?

294
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
What do you mean, "girl"?

295
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
Call me "sister," that was ten years ago.

296
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,159
Here, have some water.

297
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,600
Thank you, thank you.

298
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,480
It's warm, it's warm.

299
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,279
Thank you.

300
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,320
It's so cold.

301
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Captain Wen, I've heard a lot about you.

302
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,279
You must be Liu Ziming.

303
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:33,639
Yes.

304
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,399
I know you.

305
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm older than you.

306
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,320
You should call me "Sister" too.

307
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,000
Sister.

308
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,399
Li Yugang.

309
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:39,440
Xia Yu.

310
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,120
Sister.

311
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,279
Sister.

312
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,519
As expected from someone in the archives.

313
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,200
Sister Jun.

314
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,080
You're in the archives.

315
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,639
Why did Captain Huang have us look for you?

316
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,279
You know what we're here for, right?

317
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,279
I know.

318
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,039
I used to be in the task force.

319
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,879
The Organized Crime Division.

320
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,080
Later, our department was disbanded.

321
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,600
Then I worked in vice for a few years.

322
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,960
Then why did you go to the records room again?

323
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,080
Well, seeing that I have a family to take care of, look after me, will you?

324
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,840
The boss said you were looking for someone.

325
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, we're looking for a middleman in a case.

326
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,000
What's the name?

327
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,960
I don't know the real name.

328
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,480
I only know he operates around Victory Bridge.

329
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,720
What's the nickname?

330
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
Tongtong, Tongtong, Tongtong.

331
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,639
Tongtong.

332
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,320
That's him. He's useless.

333
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,039
From what time to what time?

334
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,200
Around nine in the evening.

335
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,440
He left at dawn.

336
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,240
Around seven or eight in the morning, I think.

337
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,200
What did you do?

338
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,279
What could we have done?

339
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,279
He was completely useless.

340
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,600
Wasted a whole night for nothing.

341
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,279
How much did he pay you?

342
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,879
He didn't pay me.

343
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,440
To be honest,

344
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,799
Money or no money,

345
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,759
we're all friends here.

346
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,639
Why even mention money?

347
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,639
He really didn't pay.

348
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,679
How do you have so many friends? Friends, friends...

349
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,440
Boss.

350
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,639
Liu Jun's statement doesn't match Tongtong's.

351
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,320
One says he solicited.

352
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
The other says he didn't.

353
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,200
What should we do?

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,679
No evidence, so let's release them for now.

355
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,440
Let the anti-vice team know.

356
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,519
That there's such a person.

357
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,000
What about Liu Jun?

358
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,039
Release him too for now.

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,200
Mom

360
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,759
Mom

361
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,480
What's wrong, Diandian?

362
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,080
What's wrong, son?

363
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,080
What's wrong?

364
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,799
Mom's here.

365
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,679
Mom's here.

366
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,000
Mom's here.

367
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,120
You had a dream.

368
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,559
Be good, Diandian.

369
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,799
Come on, go back to sleep.

370
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,319
Did you two notice something?

371
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,319
When Zhao Hongxia was found...

372
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,839
Boss

373
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,279
Someone came to claim Zhao Hongxia's insurance.

374
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:10,839
Look.

375
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,720
I checked last night.

376
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,279
Zhao Hongxia has a commercial insurance policy.

377
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:17,880
And the beneficiary...

378
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,000
It's neither her family

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,640
nor a public welfare organization.

380
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Fei Bin

381
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,200
Go in.

382
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,720
Sister Jun

383
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,279
Get a stool.

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,279
Sit.

385
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,799
Come.

386
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,799
Here, thank you.

387
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,880
Okay, I brought the person.

388
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,759
You guys talk.

389
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Just say what you know.

390
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,759
Sister Jun, wait, you need to stay here.

391
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,880
I'll take you back later.

392
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't joke around.

393
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,240
If you don't explain everything clearly today,

394
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,079
you won't be sitting in this chair, you know?

395
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,440
I'm leaving.

396
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,119
Fei Bin

397
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,079
Who is this person?

398
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,559
I know.

399
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,880
You’re here to talk to me about Zhao Hongxia.

400
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,839
He’s one of my guys, his name is Xu Chen.

401
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,079
He’s pretty close to Zhao Hongxia.

402
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,680
What are your people responsible for?

403
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,160
Bringing in clients.

404
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,440
How do you bring them in?

405
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,640
Just keep the clients company.

406
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:25,960
Make them happy.

407
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:26,880
You tell us.

408
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,079
Actually, my job is pretty simple.

409
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,799
It’s just to make the clients happy.

410
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,839
If they’re happy, they’ll order drinks.

411
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,559
Then we get a commission.

412
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,079
When we meet—

413
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,000
Why do you keep staring at me?

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,319
Didn’t you hear what was just said?

415
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,160
Just say what you know.

416
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,680
If you meet the right one, you have to stick with them and keep them company.

417
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,440
Then develop things further.

418
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,680
How do you develop things further?

419
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,480
Be specific.

420
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,799
That depends on what they like.

421
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
If they just like to party, then go that route.

422
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,160
If they like sex, then go that route.

423
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
If they like gambling, then go that route.

424
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:06,960
Some people—

425
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
They don’t even know what they like.

426
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Then it depends on who’s leading them.

427
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,559
They’ll do whatever you tell them to do.

428
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,960
So which route did you take with Zhao Hongxia?

429
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,079
I took her to Macau, China.

430
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,960
But I only made a commission.

431
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Fei Bin.

432
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,200
You were the one who bought life insurance for Zhao Hongxia.

433
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,559
I really had no choice.

434
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:30,480
She owed me money.

435
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,559
You guys are ruthless.

436
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,799
Even after someone dies, they still have to pay you back.

437
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
How did she owe you?

438
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:36,839
You lent her money, right?

439
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,559
Brother.

440
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,880
I don't own the casino.

441
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,559
If you win, you take the money and leave.

442
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,160
If you lose, you have to accept it too.

443
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,359
Besides,

444
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,680
All my lending procedures are compliant and legal.

445
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,039
I know they're compliant and legal.

446
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,359
But you two have a debt relationship.

447
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,759
You're a major suspect now, you know that?

448
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,400
No, no, officer.

449
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's really not like that.

450
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,200
Chen'er, you know about this.

451
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
Tell them quickly, hurry.

452
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
The money Zhao Hongxia borrowed

453
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,680
mostly came from me.

454
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,200
She was a heavy gambler.

455
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
Once she started gambling, no one could stop her, right.

456
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
She never seemed that happy when she won.

457
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,079
But when she lost, she'd make a scene.

458
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,640
Plus, she did drugs and drank heavily.

459
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,359
She often had hallucinations.

460
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,440
She scared me several times.

461
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,599
Sis, what are you doing?

462
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,839
This kind of thing has happened many times before.

463
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,640
I'm afraid she might actually die one day.

464
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,240
Then we won't be able to pay back those three or four million.

465
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,480
To be on the safe side,

466
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,640
my brother bought her a commercial insurance policy.

467
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
But Zhao Hongxia knew about this.

468
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,559
Sis.

469
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,160
How is it? Does it still hurt?

470
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,759
Sis.

471
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm begging you.

472
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,359
Please just sign it.

473
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,839
Otherwise, Mr. Fei won't let me off.

474
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,359
With your personality,

475
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,559
if there's another problem with your account,

476
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
I really can't cover for you. I'm scared.

477
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,079
You guys bought this insurance.

478
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,799
Now something's happened to Zhao Hongxia.

479
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,599
I don't need to explain the logic to you, do I?

480
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,359
No, this really has nothing to do with us.

481
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,880
For us,

482
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
she's definitely worth more alive than dead.

483
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,240
That little bit of insurance compensation

484
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,799
isn't even enough for me to cover the loss.

485
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,880
Would I kill someone for that amount of money?

486
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,759
Is it worth it?

487
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,680
Go ahead, talk.

488
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,160
Where were you on the night of the 4th?

489
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,119
The 4th?

490
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:16,799
In Macau, China.

491
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,839
Yes, in Macau, China.

492
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,759
We were both there.

493
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,559
We came back yesterday morning.

494
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,960
You can check as much as you want.

495
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,559
The customs stamp

496
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
can't be faked, right?

497
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,440
Come on, just do as it says here.

498
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,599
Sign your name, come on.

499
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:48,880
Master

500
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,079
We've found the whereabouts records of Fei Bin and Xu Chen.

501
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,079
During the time when Zhao Hongxia may have been killed,

502
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
they were indeed in Macau, China.

503
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,359
Master

504
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
You mentioned something strange this morning.

505
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,880
When Zhao Hongxia was found,

506
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,119
she was wearing long black stockings.

507
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,759
But she wasn't wearing them at the convenience store.

508
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,079
Also,

509
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,920
there wasn't a single pair of stockings in her wardrobe at home.

510
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,839
Not even long ones,

511
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,119
not even short ones.

512
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,039
So,

513
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,240
the killer must have put the stockings on her.

514
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Does that mean this person has

515
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,079
some kind of special fetish?

516
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,559
By the way,

517
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,240
Lai Hongchuan's computer desktop

518
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,079
is a pair of women's legs in black stockings.

519
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,240
I saw it that day.

520
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,400
We need to talk to him again. Let's go.

521
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
Have you had dinner yet?

522
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,680
If not, I can have my chef prepare something for you.

523
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,359
No need, don't trouble yourself.

524
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,480
Here's the thing.

525
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,119
That day, you also saw the photo.

526
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,799
Zhao Hongxia was wearing black stockings when she died.

527
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,599
But at her home,

528
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,079
we didn't find any of those items.

529
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,960
As far as you know,

530
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,599
did Zhao Hongxia usually like to wear stockings?

531
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,319
Especially long black ones like these?

532
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,200
She never wore them.

533
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,079
Then who is the person on your computer screen?

534
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,119
I’m not afraid you’ll laugh at me.

535
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
This is just a personal fetish of mine.

536
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,680
So that photo was of Zhao Hongxia?

537
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,000
No.

538
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,880
I found it online.

539
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,119
There are plenty more.

540
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:40,960
Do you want to see them?

541
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,200
No, that’s not necessary.

542
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,599
Did you ever ask Zhao Hongxia

543
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,240
for something like this?

544
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,240
Yes.

545
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,000
I brought it up when we first met.

546
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,000
She didn’t like it and refused.

547
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,039
That day,

548
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,359
when you showed me her photo,

549
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,279
I thought it was strange.

550
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,240
Not to mention stockings,

551
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,000
she usually didn’t even wear socks.

552
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,359
Why didn’t you mention this last time?

553
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,079
We’d been apart for a while, after all.

554
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,839
I didn’t know if she’d changed her habits.

555
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,119
I knew you’d come to see me.

556
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,319
I already asked my secretary

557
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,440
to prepare a record of my whereabouts.

558
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,519
Take a look.

559
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,359
The reason I’m being so honest

560
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,279
is that I hope the police can solve the case soon.

561
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,599
And give Xiaoxia an explanation.

562
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,240
Thank you.

563
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,599
Alright, take care, everyone.

564
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,039
Thank you.

565
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:47,640
You’re welcome.

566
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,880
Master, I’m hungry.

567
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,400
Let’s go to Brother Lei’s place.

568
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,240
Master, why isn’t it open?

569
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,680
I’ll go check.

570
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
It's a huge bull market.

571
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,039
Why did it have to be the one I bought?

572
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,079
Over two million.

573
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,519
Gone just like that.

574
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,039
Where do you think all the money went?

575
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,640
What about the shop?

576
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,440
It's all been transferred.

577
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,400
Even so, it can't fill this hole.

578
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,200
I really don't know

579
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,319
how to explain this to my wife and kids.

580
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,079
Maybe I should sell the house.

581
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,599
If I sell the house, maybe I can catch the next wave.

582
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
I could make a comeback.

583
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,039
Don't you dare touch the house.

584
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,279
Sell yourself if you have to, but not the house.

585
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,759
If you dare sell the house,

586
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
I'll really be mad at you.

587
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,319
I'm leaving.

588
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,400
Master

589
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,799
I checked the hotel surveillance.

590
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,599
During the time of the incident,

591
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,200
Lai Hongchuan was indeed in Qingdao.

592
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,079
Once Lai Hongchuan was ruled out as a suspect,

593
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,960
the trail went cold again.

594
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This photo of the tied-up person—

595
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
Here, at the neck—

596
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,400
Is there a clearer angle?

597
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,680
You can't see it clearly.

598
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,960
No need for the photo, Sister Jun.

599
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,640
Wait for me, wait for me, I'll be right there.

600
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,799
Sister Jun, wait for me, wait for me.

601
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,039
I'll wait for you.

602
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,759
But you have to tell me where you're going.

603
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,960
Sister Jun, I—

604
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:38,839
Here.

605
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,039
You, put it there.

606
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,119
Come.

607
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,279
Your apprentice is really talented.

608
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,680
It's because the master teaches well.

609
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Don't talk nonsense.

610
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,119
Where's the photo?

611
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,960
Let me see.

612
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,799
Look here, everyone.

613
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,119
The way the neck is tied

614
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,400
is different from how the other parts are tied.

615
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,119
The knot on the neck is a slipknot.

616
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,559
The other parts are all tied with reverse dead knots.

617
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
A slipknot like this is usually used for tying oneself.

618
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,559
It's not used to tie up others.

619
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,839
If the purpose was simply to secure the body,

620
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,960
it should have been a dead knot.

621
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,000
So I think the suspect

622
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,359
did it out of habit.

623
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,680
He probably ties himself up often.

624
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,400
To achieve a feeling of suffocation.

625
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,440
So what is he after?

626
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,319
It's a sexual fetish.

627
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,440
He's seeking excitement.

628
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,440
To put it simply,

629
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,319
judging by his technique,

630
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,200
he's clearly experienced.

631
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,759
He definitely ties himself up often.

632
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,119
If this person really has this fetish,

633
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,400
with the internet being so advanced now,

634
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,000
it's easy to

635
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
find others online who share his interests.

636
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,559
So did he know Zhao Hongxia beforehand,

637
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,920
did they arrange to meet online,

638
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,440
or was she a random target?

639
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,359
That makes the range of possibilities much wider.

640
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,960
The way it's tied is indeed like this.

641
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,559
Hey.

642
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,039
Isn't this just a reverse handcuff?

643
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:07,920
Yeah.

644
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,039
What's wrong, Diandian?

645
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,519
Is Grandpa not home?

646
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,119
Put on your clothes and wait for me at the door.

647
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:17,960
Dad will be back soon.

648
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,599
Master, do you need us to go?

649
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,799
Ziming, what's wrong?

650
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,440
Is there anywhere else you feel unwell?

651
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
No, that's all.

652
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,960
Here, drink more water.

653
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,599
Why is the door open?

654
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,759
Don't close the door.

655
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:34,960
What's wrong?

656
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,559
Where did you go?

657
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,559
I went for a walk.

658
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,759
You went for a walk for four hours?

659
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
You went for a walk and didn't turn off the stove?

660
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,279
If Diandian hadn't woken up feeling unwell,

661
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,759
the child might not even be here now.

662
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,240
I remember, I turned off the stove.

663
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
What did you turn off? You didn't.

664
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,039
Did you go drinking again?

665
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,200
No, I was just walking around nearby.

666
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,200
You can walk around nearby for four hours?

667
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,680
You left the child home alone and went drinking.

668
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,119
What kind of grandpa are you?

669
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,039
Mind your own business.

670
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,559
Even Qin Fenglian doesn't meddle with me.

671
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,480
Sis,

672
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,039
Why do I feel like Dad is acting a bit strange?

673
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
No,

674
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,440
It's been many years

675
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,039
since I last heard him call Mom by her name.

676
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,400
The brain damage is caused by an ischemic stroke.

677
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Simply put, it's a lack of blood flow to the brain.

678
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,759
Its symptoms

679
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,599
may include reduced attention span,

680
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:48,559
impaired initiative and executive function,

681
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,359
and declining memory.

682
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,359
Can it be cured?

683
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,839
The progression of this condition

684
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,000
could be progressive, getting worse over time,

685
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,440
or it could fluctuate,

686
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,759
sometimes better, sometimes worse.

687
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,039
It varies from person to person.

688
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,680
Doctor,

689
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,200
what's the worst possible outcome?

690
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,640
What did the doctor say?

691
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,680
Do I have some serious illness?

692
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
No, it's just because you're getting older.

693
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,119
You're already doing quite well for your age.

694
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,559
Just take some medicine first, it's nothing serious.

695
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,640
Just take him for a walk around the botanical garden.

696
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,599
Don't let him touch things randomly.

697
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,200
After a walk, it'll be about noon.

698
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
Then take him to have a meal.

699
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:44,960
And in the afternoon...

700
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,359
Alright, alright, I got it.

701
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,680
Before going to bed at night,

702
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,119
I promise from start to finish,

703
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,519
I'll bring him back safe and sound.

704
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,240
Alright.

705
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Here.

706
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,839
Take this.

707
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,759
Here.

708
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,279
No need.

709
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,359
Take him to a restaurant.

710
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,440
Don't eat at street stalls.

711
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,839
Do you know how much I make a month now?

712
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,680
How much?

713
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,559
About four or five times what you make.

714
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,599
That much?

715
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
What are you doing?

716
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,839
Say that again.

717
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,240
I am Wang Xuanxuan.

718
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,519
A well-known model.

719
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I've already signed with an agency now.

720
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,599
Do you even care about me or not?

721
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,839
You don't even know this.

722
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,039
Usually, with that resident Zhao Hongxia,

723
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,960
what's your relationship like?

724
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,279
I rarely see her.

725
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,279
Our relationship is just average.

726
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,440
When we greet her, she ignores us.

727
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:36,960
I think she's pretty arrogant.

728
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,279
Alright, thanks.

729
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,920
Sister Jun, Sister Jun.

730
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,680
Wait, you ran here?

731
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,759
Why didn't you drive?

732
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,039
I don't have a car.

733
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,880
Get to the point, what do you need me for?

734
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
Let's go to the property management office first.

735
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,680
Then have Li Yugang

736
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,000
go around and ask the neighbors on both sides.

737
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,400
Okay.

738
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,119
Wait, why not?

739
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,359
I'm going to the property office with Sister Jun?

740
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:51,880
Stop talking nonsense.

741
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,759
Hurry up.

742
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,680
The property office is over there.

743
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,279
Take good care of Sister Jun.

744
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,119
It was at the beginning of this month.

745
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,240
One day I was strolling in the yard.

746
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,279
I saw a big bouquet of flowers at her doorstep.

747
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,240
At first, I didn't pay much attention.

748
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,679
It was a cleaning lady who asked me what kind of flowers they were.

749
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,039
I didn't know either.

750
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,880
Are you sure that was Zhao Hongxia's house?

751
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,440
Yes.

752
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,079
Did you see who delivered them?

753
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:16,960
No, I didn't.

754
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,559
Did she come out to take the flowers in the end?

755
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,840
No, I didn't see that either.

756
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,679
What kind of flowers were they? Can you describe them?

757
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,480
I can't really say.

758
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,960
Anyway, they looked different from the usual ones.

759
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,679
They didn't look like roses.

760
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,920
Nor did they look like chrysanthemums.

761
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
What color were they?

762
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,199
Red.

763
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
With individual petals.

764
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,400
Zhao Hongxia, beginning of the month, red flowers.

765
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Are you writing a poem?

766
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,679
The property management said

767
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
that at the beginning of the month, in Zhao Hongxia's backyard,

768
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,960
they saw a big bouquet of flowers.

769
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Red ones, over a hundred blooms.

770
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,679
But they didn't know what kind they were.

771
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,559
No, where was it?

772
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:48,960
In the backyard.

773
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,440
That's right.

774
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,920
But that's not what the cleaning lady said.

775
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,239
She said they were in the trash can.

776
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,840
Do you think these flowers could have been sent by the killer?

777
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,039
Maybe he tried to pursue Zhao Hongxia but failed,

778
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,559
so he killed her.

779
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Let's check the backyard.

780
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,920
Call the community security guard over.

781
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,480
Got it, let's go.

782
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,679
Come on, let's go.

783
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,960
No, I'm not hungry.

784
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,679
Iron Man.

785
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,880
Then could you please get us something to eat?

786
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,239
I want to eat a pancake.

787
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,119
Thank you, Sister Jun.

788
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,920
You look like a pancake to me.

789
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,039
Do you still remember

790
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,960
if anyone has ever delivered flowers to this house?

791
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,920
I really don't remember.

792
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,519
Wait, at your place,

793
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,760
do all incoming cars have to register?

794
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,679
But flower and food delivery people don't register?

795
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:28,639
Cars definitely have to register.

796
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,679
But as for people,

797
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,480
we really can't keep track of everyone.

798
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
You see, besides wealthy people living here,

799
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,840
there are also a few actors.

800
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,800
Flowers, gifts, cakes, and so on—

801
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,079
there are tons of them.

802
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,480
We don't dare ask too many questions.

803
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,440
If we ask too much, people get upset.

804
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,280
Then they might turn around and scold us, right?

805
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,559
Now,

806
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,360
if I see someone delivering flowers at the gate,

807
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,679
I just let them in directly.

808
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,679
Among all the flowers delivered,

809
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,199
were there any especially large bouquets?

810
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:53,880
With really big buds?

811
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,840
Or different varieties?

812
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,079
I didn't really pay attention to that.

813
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,280
Alright, you go ahead and get busy. Thanks.

814
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,039
Okay, no problem.

815
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,800
Goodbye.

816
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,440
Master, what should we do next?

817
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,480
Check all the flower shops

818
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,920
within a thirty-mile radius.

819
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,880
See who sent flowers to Zhao Hongxia's house.

820
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,400
Understood.

821
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,119
Here, have a bite.

822
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,679
I just ate.

823
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,480
Pancake.

824
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,880
Sister Jun.

825
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,079
Do you want to go home and take care of your child?

826
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,880
It's fine, I'll just go home a bit earlier tonight.

827
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,079
You really bought pancakes.

828
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,280
Eat up. Thank you, Sister Jun. Thank you, Sister Jun.

829
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,880
So what are you planning to do next?

830
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,480
The doctor said to observe more.

831
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,079
I'll just stay at home more from now on.

832
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,800
So am I still taking care of Diandian tomorrow?

833
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,639
I promised him.

834
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,599
This is for you.

835
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,320
What is this?

836
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,840
Today I took Diandian to my friend's studio.

837
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
We took a set of portraits.

838
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,760
They were really happy. This is the commission.

839
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,440
There's even money.

840
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,480
The photos turned out pretty well.

841
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,199
Right? Diandian was very cooperative.

842
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:07,280
If you take him somewhere else,

843
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,920
shouldn't you let me know?

844
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,119
Is it too late to tell you now?

845
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,679
Okay, I'll keep the photos.

846
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,840
Here, you take this money.

847
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,920
You'll need it to take him out tomorrow.

848
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,119
Then I won't be polite.

849
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,280
Alright, I'm leaving.

850
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,920
Okay.

851
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,079
Bye-bye, Diandian.

852
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,239
Did you have fun at the botanical garden today?

853
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,840
It was alright.

854
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:33,960
Just alright?

855
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,960
Then let your aunt take you out again tomorrow.

856
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,639
How about that?

857
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,519
To the amusement park.

858
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,280
I want to play with Dad.

859
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,320
Then I'll take you another day.

860
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,880
How about Dad plays with you?

861
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,760
Grandpa hasn't been feeling well lately.

862
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,599
Don't bother him too much.

863
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,599
Let him get some good rest.

864
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,480
Did you hear me?

865
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,360
Okay.

866
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,679
Good kid.

867
00:37:59,440 --> 00:37:59,920
Sister Jun,

868
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,559
How did it go yesterday? Any luck?

869
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,360
I asked more than ten places.

870
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,679
They all said they never delivered flowers to Zhao Hongxia's family.

871
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,519
Here, have a bite first, get something in your stomach.

872
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,239
It's not pancakes this time.

873
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,000
It's lamb soup.

874
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,920
Lamb soup is fine too.

875
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,280
I have something at ten.

876
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,960
Forget it, I'll eat on the way.

877
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,360
I'll eat on the way.

878
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm running out of time.

879
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,079
You guys eat, go ahead.

880
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,679
I'm leaving. If he won't eat, I will.

881
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm off.

882
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,239
Let's go, let's go.

883
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:20,960
Bye-bye.

884
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,679
Tastes good.

885
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,360
What does he mean?

886
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,920
Is he afraid I'll poison him?

887
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,480
No.

888
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,760
He's not afraid of being poisoned.

889
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
There's cilantro in here. He doesn't eat cilantro.

890
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,039
Here.

891
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,320
Boss

892
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,000
Hello

893
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:39,800
I’d like to ask

894
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,239
Have you recently delivered

895
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,519
to the Yujing Yayuan community

896
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,679
with the recipient named Zhao Hongxia

897
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,599
I’d like to ask

898
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,119
Have we recently delivered

899
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,360
to the Yujing Yayuan community

900
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,840
with the recipient named Zhao Hongxia

901
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,559
No

902
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,559
Boss, add more chili

903
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,400
Hello

904
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,880
Give me one, please

905
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,679
Alright

906
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,559
No cilantro

907
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,639
Have you recently delivered

908
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,079
to the Yujing Yayuan community

909
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,360
with the recipient named Zhao Hongxia

910
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,440
Have we recently delivered

911
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,519
to that Yujing Yayuan community

912
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
with the recipient named Zhao Hongxia

913
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,039
No

914
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,559
Young man

915
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,079
What’s wrong

916
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,280
Are you okay

917
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,559
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

918
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,760
Hello, I’m here to pick up Liu Jianlin’s medicine

919
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,480
Okay

920
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,679
Thank you.

921
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,480
You're welcome.

922
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:02,679
Hello?

923
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,679
Which hospital?

924
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,079
I'm coming over now.

925
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,079
This is just

926
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,280
dehydration caused by acute gastroenteritis.

927
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,559
He needs to stay in the hospital for a few days.

928
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:19,280
And these are the foods he usually avoids.

929
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,679
And his allergy medicine.

930
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,280
Please give these to the nurse for me.

931
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,679
Okay.

932
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,480
The doctor said your eating habits are irregular.

933
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,000
Master.

934
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,440
Master, you got here really fast.

935
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
How did you get here?

936
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
I flew over.

937
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:35,760
How are you feeling?

938
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,400
Much better.

939
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
By the way, I haven't finished checking out the flower market.

940
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,360
I've only visited five stalls.

941
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,119
I've written down the stall numbers here, take a look.

942
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,239
Give them to me quickly.

943
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,480
You should focus on recovering now.

944
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,679
Master, if you're busy over there,

945
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,320
you can go take care of your things.

946
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,480
Sister Jun and I can handle it.

947
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,480
You two go ahead.

948
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,679
I'm going home to bring some medicine to the old man.

949
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,119
I'll meet up with you after that.

950
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:56,800
Alright.

951
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,679
Wait, wait, let me check the instructions.

952
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,480
Can you understand them?

953
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,679
I can't just take medicine randomly.

954
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,840
It's used as a brain metabolism enhancer.

955
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,280
It's suitable for acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases.

956
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,880
Brain injuries.

957
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,280
Various toxic encephalopathies, and so on.

958
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,519
Caused by various reasons.

959
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,880
Memory decline and mild to moderate

960
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,079
brain dysfunction.

961
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,239
It can also be used for children with delayed intellectual development.

962
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,239
You make me take all these medicines every day without telling me anything.

963
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,880
I don't even know what illness I have.

964
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,679
Which one am I?

965
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,119
Is it dysfunction or delay?

966
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,079
Are you a child?

967
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,880
Then it must be poisoning.

968
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,480
You must have poisoned me.

969
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm not taking it.

970
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,880
I think your mind is still pretty clear.

971
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,679
You're not sick.

972
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,880
This is a timer.

973
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,480
It's to remind you to take your medicine.

974
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,280
These are your sorted medicines.

975
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,239
Once every six hours, don't forget.

976
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:51,440
It's for detoxification.
