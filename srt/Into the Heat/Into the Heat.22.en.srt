1
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,840
After meeting you,

2
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
my selfishness didn't get any better,

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,159
it actually got worse.

4
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,680
I know how to deal with criminals,

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,920
how to communicate with them,

6
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,159
but

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
I don't know how to communicate with you.

8
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,959
I want

9
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,639
to keep you by my side,

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,599
I don't want you to leave,

11
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,680
but I don't know what to do.

12
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,400
All these years, I've always

14
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,639
taken your kindness to me

15
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
for granted.

16
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,800
I've treated your patience and tolerance

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,919
as something normal.

18
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,319
I've let you down.

19
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,919
I want to change, I want to learn.

20
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,319
I hope you'll give me another chance.

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,759
Don't rush to make a decision yet.

22
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,400
Think it over.

23
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,719
If you're willing to give it some thought,

24
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,840
I'd already be very grateful.

25
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Let's get a divorce.

26
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,120
Weren't you the one who said it?

27
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,959
I can do whatever I want.

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,920
I'll do whatever makes me happy.

29
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,160
Besides,

30
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Have you ever cared about what I do?

31
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,160
He specifically targets those from single-parent families or high school dropouts.

32
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,000
Runaways.

33
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,160
Kids whose parents don't care about them.

34
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,439
He says they're easy to control and manipulate.

35
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,439
He buys them the best phones and computers.

36
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,759
Lets them play games.

37
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
He also gives them

38
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,920
lectures about family values.

39
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,519
Says it's for their development.

40
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm sick of hearing it.

41
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,040
Li Na.

42
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,120
Be more specific.

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
What does this Chen Tao usually

44
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
do to "develop" them?

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,879
I have a phone recording on my phone.

46
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
You can listen to it.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,639
Cheng Liang.

48
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't just stand there.

49
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,759
Take a knife and go practice.

50
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,959
It's been so long.

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
You should have made something of yourself by now.

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,560
Let me tell you all,

53
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,360
If you're not ruthless, you won't keep your place.

54
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,920
We're a family.

55
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,399
Everyone has to contribute.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
That's the only way we can all have a good life.

57
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,959
Did you all hear that?

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,839
We heard.

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,000
That damn woman.

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,879
Why did it stop?

61
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,160
There are several more parts after this.

62
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,279
Don't worry, I'll play the rest for you.

63
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,360
Damn woman.

64
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,959
It’s not that bad.

65
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,040
Look at these kids,

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,879
being manipulated by someone like Chen Tao.

67
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,800
Do you think it has something to do with being from single-parent families?

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,519
I definitely think there’s a connection.

69
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,639
If their families were more involved, this wouldn’t happen.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,079
And then there’s Li Na.

71
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,560
She can be really ruthless when she wants to be.

72
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,519
Once she turns on you, she shows no mercy.

73
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,759
Even our teacher’s wife is like that.

74
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,439
What does psychology call this again?

75
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,480
Is it related to human reproductive instincts?

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,079
Since when do you know psychology?

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,439
Do you even have a heart?

78
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
I have plenty of heart now.

79
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,399
Really.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,319
I’m actually worried about Diandian right now.

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,680
If our teacher really gets divorced,

82
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,519
then Diandian

83
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,480
will become a child from a single-parent family.

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Alright, enough.

85
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,079
I’m telling you,

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,480
don’t let our teacher hear you say that.

87
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Of course not.

88
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,600
Go, collect evidence from the trash can.

89
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,639
Brother Zhang.

90
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:43,839
I'm here.

91
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,680
Time of death is no more than three hours ago.

92
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,560
Just one stab.

93
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,920
To the heart.

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
What's your name?

95
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:56,959
Lin Jing.

96
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
Who is he to you?

97
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,920
My husband.

98
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,639
Why did you kill him?

99
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,319
No rush.

100
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,160
Take your time and tell us.

101
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,639
Ever since we started dating,

102
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,160
he wouldn't let me talk to anyone else.

103
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,759
Every time I got home, he would interrogate me.

104
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,360
It wasn't just men I couldn't talk to,

105
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,679
I couldn't talk to women either.

106
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,840
Sometimes I secretly called my mom.

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,759
If he found out,

108
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,200
he would drag me over and beat me.

109
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,120
He even hit me for talking to the neighbors.

110
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,440
I love drinking cola.

111
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
But I haven't had a sip in three years.

112
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,759
He never let me drink it.

113
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,559
Just because it was endorsed by a male actor.

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
So what happened today?

115
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,720
This afternoon, I went out to buy groceries.

116
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,360
When I got back, I lay down on the sofa and took a nap.

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,159
When I opened my eyes,

118
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,679
he was holding a knife to my neck.

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
He asked me again,

120
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,960
"Who did you go out to see?"

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,039
"Why were you gone so long?"

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,679
"Did you go buy groceries or cheat on me?"

123
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,960
I really couldn't take it anymore.

124
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,639
I grabbed the knife from him.

125
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,360
I just...

126
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,399
Go on.

127
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,600
Then I took a shower,

128
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,559
changed my clothes,

129
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,000
and called the police.

130
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,919
Take her away.

131
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,919
Thank you.

132
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,720
This is spicy, let Auntie eat it.

133
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,840
What did Auntie say?

134
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,320
Look, such a good child.

135
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,440
Daddy.

136
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,039
I miss Mommy.

137
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,120
I want to play with her.

138
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
Diandian, eat your meal nicely.

139
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
Who does Auntie like the most?

140
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,759
Isn't it Diandian that Auntie likes the most?

141
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,600
How about eating this big piece of meat?

142
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Can you eat it?

143
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,840
This potato.

144
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
The shredded potatoes are a bit spicy, right?

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,399
Auntie will pick them out for you.

146
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,960
Just eat rice and meat.

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
Is this bite okay?

148
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
Good child, good child.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
Going downstairs to buy a pack of cigarettes.

150
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,240
Such a little mouth.

151
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm back.

152
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,279
The thing you asked me to think about,

153
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,480
I've thought it through.

154
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't want to go through it again.

155
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,039
How is your dad?

156
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,840
He's still recovering.

157
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
He's stable for now.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,279
You should find a lawyer too.

159
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,080
Just tell me,

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,480
What do you plan to do about Diandian?

161
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Diandian will stay with me.

162
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,960
But you can visit him anytime.

163
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,279
If Diandian stays with me, I'll sign anytime.

164
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,360
That's not possible.

165
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,480
Have you thought about the fact that you have to work?

166
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,679
How will you take care of him?

167
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,799
Think it over carefully.

168
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,320
Let's not meet again until you've made up your mind.

169
00:12:59,399 --> 00:12:59,960
Captain Liu

170
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,679
The body was discovered by that cleaning lady.

171
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,480
She called the police as soon as she found it.

172
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,080
You two go over there first.

173
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,759
Okay, understood.

174
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,639
Let's go.

175
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,519
Excuse me, please make way here.

176
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,080
Thank you, please make way.

177
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,799
Ma'am, this is our Captain Liu.

178
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Hello.

179
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:18,840
Hello.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,879
Did you report the case?

181
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Yes.

182
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,840
Did you find it?

183
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,480
Yes.

184
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,519
When did you find it?

185
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,720
A little after four o'clock.

186
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,120
It was still dark then.

187
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,159
The hallway sensor light wasn't working well.

188
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,919
At first, I thought someone was just drunk.

189
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,080
But when I got closer, I saw a pool of blood.

190
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,519
It scared me.

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,240
Is the deceased a resident here?

192
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,039
Do you know them?

193
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,879
No, I don't.

194
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,240
Alright.

195
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Please come with my colleague

196
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,000
to the station to make a detailed statement.

197
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Sorry for the trouble.

198
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,720
Hello?

199
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
When do you have time?

200
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
I want to talk to you.

201
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,360
Have you thought about the situation with Diandian?

202
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,519
It's about Diandian.

203
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,159
Okay.

204
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,919
Then let's do tonight.

205
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,799
At Brother Lei's restaurant.

206
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,600
The one we used to go to.

207
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,919
Can we change the place to Yuge Restaurant?

208
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:20,960
Alright.

209
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,159
You didn't hear anything else, right?

210
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,919
Master.

211
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,480
How is it?

212
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
The deceased is the owner of 401.

213
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,000
His name is Zhao Tiancheng.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,279
Forty-one years old, divorced five years ago.

215
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:30,879
No children.

216
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,639
His ex-wife is currently abroad.

217
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
His mother is in a nursing home.

218
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,320
What does he do?

219
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,600
He opened a golf course in the eastern suburbs.

220
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
He also drove a Land Rover.

221
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,519
The license plate ends with 79.

222
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,600
The car is currently in the parking garage.

223
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,080
Brother Ming

224
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
We're done collecting, let's go straight up.

225
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Be careful, stay on this side.

226
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,080
Coming.

227
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:37,720
Brother Zhang

228
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,960
Time of death is less than six hours ago.

229
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,399
There are three stab wounds, all very deep.

230
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
The last stab was here.

231
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,799
A triangular blade.

232
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,159
Haven't seen one of these in years.

233
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
This is a strictly regulated weapon.

234
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,679
Each edge has a blood groove.

235
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,879
When it enters the body, it quickly brings in air.

236
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,519
It's very easy to pull out.

237
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,799
Basically, anyone stabbed by this

238
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,759
dies from excessive blood loss.

239
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,879
Do you want to keep looking?

240
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,080
That's enough.

241
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,159
Go get the body bag.

242
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Boss, the two of us will go check downstairs.

243
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,039
See if any neighbors heard anything.

244
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,679
Master

245
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,200
What's going on upstairs?

246
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,119
In this unit,

247
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,279
there are a total of twenty-one households.

248
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,359
Because of planning issues,

249
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,559
many people have moved out.

250
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,759
There aren't many people left.

251
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,799
I knocked on seven doors in total.

252
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,519
They all said they didn't hear anything unusual.

253
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,400
As for their neighbor,

254
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,039
they're not familiar with him either.

255
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,119
They rarely interact.

256
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,319
Is there surveillance in the basement?

257
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,799
There are two scanners at the entrance,

258
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,559
and two more cameras inside the basement.

259
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,400
That's all there is.

260
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
You two go to the property management in a bit.

261
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,359
Check what time this car came back.

262
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,400
Okay.

263
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,480
Sis

264
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Uncle, my mom passed out.

265
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,359
Ni Zi, there's a lot of blood on her.

266
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,559
Don't panic yet.

267
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,279
Where are you now?

268
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,400
At home.

269
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,839
Okay, I'll come over right away.

270
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,440
You two go to the property management and get the surveillance footage.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
Understood, Master. You go quickly.

272
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,319
Qiangzi, you know where my sister's house is, right?

273
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes, yes, go over there quickly.

274
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
Right, there are two kids at home too.

275
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,559
Check what's going on.

276
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm on my way there now.

277
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
About half an hour.

278
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,680
Okay.

279
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,359
What's wrong?

280
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,440
Where are you now?

281
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,400
What? Tell me what's going on.

282
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,599
I... I don't know what's happening either.

283
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,279
When I walked in, there were several pools of blood in the living room.

284
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,440
Is she still breathing?

285
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
Ask Nizi if she called 120.

286
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,599
Nizi and Diandian both have blood on their clothes too.

287
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know either.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,880
Don't move her. Has the ambulance arrived?

289
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,720
Because the patient previously took medication and had her stomach pumped,

290
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,880
the ulcer was probably left from that time.

291
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:40,680
And this time?

292
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,920
This time, she went into shock due to gastric bleeding.

293
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,319
Because the amount of bleeding was too great.

294
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,359
We need to stabilize her vital signs first.

295
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,480
Then we'll locate the bleeding point and operate.

296
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,799
Then hurry, please.

297
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,720
Right now, she needs a blood transfusion.

298
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,880
But our hospital's blood bank

299
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
really doesn't have that much blood.

300
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,160
She's lost at least

301
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,519
one thousand to fifteen hundred milliliters.

302
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,519
What should we do?

303
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,519
Take mine.

304
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,480
You can take as much as you need.

305
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,119
No, no, that's not what I meant.

306
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:03,799
Mutual blood donation means she can only receive as much as you donate.

307
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,720
The maximum for mutual donation is four hundred milliliters.

308
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,480
Given the urgency of the situation,

309
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,039
let's both try to find a solution.

310
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
We'll also contact other hospitals.

311
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,519
We will do everything we can to save her.

312
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,000
Alright.

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,559
Okay, thank you, doctor.

314
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,759
Hello?

315
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:40,799
Xiaoqing.

316
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
My sister is being resuscitated at the Second Hospital.

317
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,200
She urgently needs one thousand milliliters of type O blood.

318
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,039
Can you help me?

319
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Can we lose?

320
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,039
Everything is ready, don't worry.

321
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,319
Wait outside.

322
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,039
You made me wait for you for another hour and a half.

323
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,240
My sister is being resuscitated.

324
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,200
Can we do this another day?

325
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Mom.

326
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:10,799
Comrades.

327
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,519
The vehicle has arrived. Secure the scene.

328
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,160
Roger.

329
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,759
Mom.

330
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,039
Mom.

331
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,119
Mom.

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
Alright, don't be too sad.

333
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,000
About this, we police officers

334
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,279
will take care of it for you.

335
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,799
Little girl.

336
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,039
Uncle, what happened to my mom?

337
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,960
This is quite serious.

338
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,559
Can I speak with you privately?

339
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
Although this happened suddenly,

340
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,240
we still need you to identify the person.

341
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,960
Please come with me.

342
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:47,200
Okay, be good. Don't get down.

343
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,079
What exactly happened to my mom?

344
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,039
Calm down, calm down.

345
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,279
Secure the scene.

346
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,119
What exactly happened to my mom?

347
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,079
Mom.

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,559
My mom.

349
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,799
Go back and take good care of your little brother.

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,680
Ziming.

351
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:45,519
Mom.

352
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,720
Doctor, how is it?

353
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,640
The situation is stable now.

354
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,000
Go ahead with the procedures.

355
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Prepare for surgery.

356
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,640
Okay, thank you.

357
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:58,839
Thank you.

358
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,720
You should be at home watching the kids. Why did you come here?

359
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,039
They're all asleep now, don't worry.

360
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,039
I came to check on you.

361
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,680
I'll go back home in a bit.

362
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,920
What did the doctor say?

363
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,119
They're still trying to save him.

364
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,039
Take this.

365
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,079
What is it?

366
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
A hundred thousand yuan.

367
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Where did it come from?

368
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,640
Fang Tingting gave it.

369
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,119
This ten thousand is mine.

370
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,839
Actually, it's not really mine.

371
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,119
I owe it to you.

372
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,359
Last time, you asked me to give money to Li Wei.

373
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,039
I couldn't find him.

374
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,039
I lied and told you I gave it to him.

375
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,319
Actually, I used it for gambling.

376
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,319
I've quit.

377
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,440
I really have quit.

378
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,480
All these years I've been driving a taxi,

379
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,079
it was so hard to save up some money.

380
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,960
I lost it all.

381
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,799
Lost everything overnight, back to square one.

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,519
I'm keeping this ten thousand.

383
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,119
This one—

384
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,559
Please help me return this to her.

385
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,799
Keep it, you need the money right now.

386
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,519
Even this might not be enough.

387
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
If it's really not enough,

388
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,799
let me know.

389
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:17,839
I'll figure something out.

390
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,359
I'll borrow it if I have to, I can get it for you.

391
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,039
Take it.

392
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,839
Hold on to it. I'm leaving now.

393
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:32,839
By the way,

394
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,440
if my sister wakes up,

395
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
give me a call, okay?

396
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,440
Okay.

397
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,000
These next couple of days, wait until you’ve settled things at home.

398
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,440
I’ll turn myself in.

399
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,839
Take it slow.

400
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,920
Someone stay behind.

401
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,000
Sis.

402
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,960
Nurse, how is it?

403
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
We've already saved them.

404
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,039
Don't worry.

405
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,640
Okay.

406
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,720
Feeling better now?

407
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:28,599
It's fine, sis.

408
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,279
Everyone's doing well.

409
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,599
Ni Zi and Dian Dian are both fine too.

410
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,559
So don't worry.

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,359
Just focus on recovering.

412
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,960
Let's go, let's go. Take it slow.

413
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,559
Okay.

414
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,279
Take it easy.

415
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,519
A family member, please stay.

416
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I'll come over in a bit, sis.

417
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:47,759
Doctor.

418
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,640
I advise you not to overthink it.

419
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,880
The person has been saved.

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
From now on, take good care and treat properly.

421
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,359
Thank you, thank you.

422
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,200
You're welcome. But next time, someone must stay.

423
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,640
If it happens again, it'll be troublesome.

424
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,759
Understood, understood.

425
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,640
Go pay the bill.

426
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,359
Okay, thank you, doctor.

427
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you.

428
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,680
Nurse.

429
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,039
I have a green tote bag.

430
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,160
Have you seen it?

431
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,319
I haven't seen it.

432
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,839
Master, Master

433
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,640
Master

434
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,480
Why are you here?

435
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,400
I came to see you and my sister.

436
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Where are you going?

437
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,480
What's wrong?

438
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,839
I... I lost my money.

439
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,359
You lost your money?

440
00:27:59,359 --> 00:27:59,720
Yes.

441
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,440
What money?

442
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,720
Just...

443
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,720
A green... a green bag.

444
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,279
Inside it...

445
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,480
There was 110,000 inside.

446
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,680
Don't worry, sit down and tell me. Sit down.

447
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,240
Let me see your receipt.

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,799
Surgery fee.

449
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,119
Don't worry for now.

450
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
I'll have Li Yugang check it out.

451
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,039
Hello, come to the Second Hospital first.

452
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Second Hospital, Master lost his money.

453
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,559
Hurry, hurry!

454
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Master, don't worry.

455
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,160
I'll think of something first.

456
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Let's pay the money first.

457
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
Go find... go check the surveillance.

458
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,960
I understand, the main thing is to check the surveillance.

459
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay.

460
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,559
He'll come and check soon.

461
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:55,440
That's him.

462
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,920
Master, the camera angle isn't good.

463
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,720
You can't see the face.

464
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,440
But don't worry.

465
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
He definitely hasn't gone far.

466
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I'll check the city surveillance.

467
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Don't bother.

468
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,519
No, that's not okay. If I can't catch a thief, I...

469
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I shouldn't be doing this job.

470
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,039
Why did it take you so long to withdraw the money?

471
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,960
Don't mention it. The hospital doesn't accept cards.

472
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,039
You have to make an appointment to withdraw a large amount of cash at the bank.

473
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,319
So I could only use the ATM.

474
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,559
I had to use one card after another.

475
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,640
Why did you withdraw so much?

476
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:27,839
I was afraid it wouldn't be enough.

477
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,680
And what if I lost it again?

478
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,880
As for my situation,

479
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,240
just leave it to the police station.

480
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,319
You two don't need to worry about it.

481
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,559
How is Zhao Tiancheng's case going?

482
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,640
So far, we've learned

483
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,440
that his debts

484
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,039
and social connections are very complicated.

485
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,880
We're still investigating.

486
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,079
Any other leads?

487
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,839
The forensic doctor estimates his time of death was

488
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,039
between 11 p.m. the night before last

489
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,160
and 3 a.m. yesterday.

490
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,240
His car entered the underground garage

491
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,119
at 11:55 p.m.

492
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,559
He most likely parked his car

493
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,920
and was attacked while going upstairs.

494
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
Also, his employees reported

495
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,920
that he had a mistress named Qin Lu.

496
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,119
We've arranged to meet her.

497
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,279
Okay, keep investigating.

498
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,559
Also,

499
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,119
that knife is quite unique.

500
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,200
Lei knows a few military enthusiasts.

501
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,720
You can ask him for information.

502
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,880
See if there are any leads.

503
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,000
Alright, got it.

504
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,240
We're leaving.

505
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Master, you should rest first.

506
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:25,759
Then we'll get going.

507
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,640
We're off, bye.

508
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,119
We invited you here today

509
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,920
because we want you to cooperate with our investigation.

510
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,160
Is it about Zhao Tiancheng?

511
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Yes.

512
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I heard

513
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,119
he died.

514
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,400
What was your relationship with him?

515
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,440
We were friends.

516
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:06,640
What kind of friends?

517
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,920
Just regular friends.

518
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
The night before last at eleven

519
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
to yesterday at three in the morning, where were you?

520
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,200
I was in Japan.

521
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,039
I've been in Japan all this month.

522
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,359
I only came back this morning.

523
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,559
Look,

524
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,000
I landed at nine this morning.

525
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,279
I got your call right after I got off the plane.

526
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,640
Then do you know

527
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,640
if he had any conflicts with anyone?

528
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,279
I just had meals and went shopping with him.

529
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,880
I don't even know where he lives.

530
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,519
I really don't know.

531
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,839
Sir, the person has been caught by the police station.

532
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,079
The money has also been recovered, so don't worry.

533
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,680
My condition is still the same.

534
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,559
As long as you agree,

535
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,160
we can get divorced at any time.

536
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,319
Have you thought about how you would take care of the child?

537
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,079
Do you have time to look after the child?

538
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,240
Do you know about our Diandian

539
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,559
and how many extracurricular classes they have each week?

540
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Do you know the names of their teachers?

541
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,119
What time do they go to school and what time do they finish?

542
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you know all of this?

543
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,759
Every week, Diandian

544
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,480
attends three extracurricular classes.

545
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,240
Saturday at 9 a.m.,

546
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,640
English class for an hour and a half.

547
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,920
The teacher's surname is Li, 32 years old.

548
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,680
At 2 p.m., basketball.

549
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,559
One hour.

550
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,160
The teacher's name is Kevin.

551
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,839
Sunday at 3:30 p.m., art class.

552
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,039
Two hours.

553
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,279
There are two teachers.

554
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,920
One is called Liu Xu.

555
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,359
The other is called Li Mei.

556
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,839
There was also a drum class.

557
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,160
He didn't like that one.

558
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,519
I canceled it for him.

559
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,400
Dad, today my sister taught me a poem.

560
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,440
Then recite it for Dad.

561
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:57,759
Willows are green, the river is calm.

562
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,480
I hear my beloved singing on the river.

563
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,279
The sun rises in the east, it rains in the west.

564
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,799
They say there's no sunshine, but there is.

565
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,719
Thank you for your hard work, Dad.

566
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,480
Do you think I'm being especially heartless?

567
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,199
Leaving without hesitation.

568
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,039
Actually,

569
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,679
I've been hard on myself ten thousand times

570
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,119
before I could bring myself to be hard on you once.

571
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,320
It's all in the past now.

572
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,280
I sold that house.

573
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,840
I can't go back.

574
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,079
If I go back,

575
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,440
I'll just think about the good times we had.

576
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,639
The money from selling the house,

577
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,320
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

578
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,639
No need.

579
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm not good with money.

580
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,039
Let it stay with you for now.

581
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,280
Just consider it savings for Diandian.

582
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,880
Alright.

583
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,679
I'm going abroad this time to accompany my dad for his treatment.

584
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,880
I don't know when I'll be back.

585
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,800
Whenever you figure things out,

586
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,320
we can put a period to our story.

587
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,920
We can't put a period to our story.

588
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,599
There's still Diandian.

589
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:49,840
Dian Dian

590
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,119
These days, play with Dad and Auntie.

591
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Mom is going to take care of Grandpa and won't be coming back.

592
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,280
Is that okay?

593
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,000
Why is she taking care of Grandpa?

594
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,239
Because Grandpa is sick.

595
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,000
He needs Mom to take care of him, okay?

596
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,079
Why is Grandpa sick?

597
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,000
In a few days, let your dad

598
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,639
take you to Grandma's place, okay?

599
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,760
Which one?

600
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,480
Take you to Grandma's place.

601
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,119
Mom will be waiting for you there.

602
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,079
What's wrong?

603
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,760
Dad

604
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Dad

605
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
Eat that banana.

606
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,840
You peel it for me.

607
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,360
I'll take this part off.

608
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,199
Do you want to share some with Mom?

609
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Give it to Dad.

610
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,559
I'm leaving now.

611
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,599
Dian Dian, Mom is leaving.

612
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,159
Then say goodbye to Mom.

613
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,119
Goodbye, Mom.

614
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,079
Such a good kid.

615
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,159
The willows are green, the river is calm.

616
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,480
I hear my love singing on the river.

617
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,480
The sun rises in the east, it rains in the west.

618
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,360
They say there's no sunshine, but there is.

619
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,199
Bye-bye.

620
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,400
Is there anyone among these people who likes to play with knives?

621
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,480
You mean a knife enthusiast?

622
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,639
We did have a security guard here before.

623
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,239
His name was Wu Fan.

624
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,360
He was a knife enthusiast.

625
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,079
He liked to fiddle with knives in his spare time.

626
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,280
Wu Fan?

627
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,159
Is it this person?

628
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,360
Yes, that's him.

629
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,559
Where is he now?

630
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,199
He quit a few months ago.

631
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,440
He quit?

632
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,280
Our property management hires an external security company.

633
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,199
All the security guards

634
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,559
are assigned by them.

635
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,119
There's a high turnover rate.

636
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,159
Basically, they change staff every few months.

637
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,320
That's quite normal.

638
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,800
Did he ever have any conflict with the resident Zhao Tiancheng?

639
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:53,960
I don't think so.

640
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,760
Can you find a way to contact him now?

641
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,360
From the night of February 4th to the early morning of February 5th,

642
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,559
where were you?

643
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,360
February 4th?

644
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,039
Yes.

645
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,639
What day of the week was that?

646
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,639
Thursday.

647
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,280
I was on the night shift that Thursday.

648
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,960
I started my shift at 11 p.m.

649
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,960
and worked until 11 a.m. the next day.

650
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,079
Is this knife yours?

651
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,639
Yes, it's mine.

652
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,039
But this knife was stolen.

653
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,360
Where did you find it?

654
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,320
How do you know it was stolen?

655
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,760
A couple of days ago, I wanted to take it out and oil it.

656
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
That's when I realized the knife was gone.

657
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,880
Really?

658
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,679
Then who do you think stole it?

659
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,320
I'm not sure about that.

660
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,719
Wu Fan, let me be clear with you.

661
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Privately keeping a controlled knife is already illegal.

662
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,440
And this knife has caused trouble.

663
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,440
Serious trouble.

664
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,920
So think carefully before you answer.

665
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
What kind of trouble?

666
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,280
You really don't know what happened?

667
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,400
Did someone get stabbed?

668
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,880
Who told you someone was stabbed?

669
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,400
Officer, I don't know.

670
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
I really don't know.

671
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,599
I've never taken this knife out.

672
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,719
I just like to look at it at home.

673
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,719
Then who do you think stole it?

674
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,679
Who stole it?

675
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,320
Sometimes some coworkers come over to my place to play cards.

676
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,599
Could it have been them?

677
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,599
Think carefully—before February 4th,

678
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,800
who had been to your house?

679
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,960
February 4th... the 4th...

680
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,079
He Shun.

681
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,159
He Shun had been to my house.

682
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,159
Who is He Shun?

683
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,000
He used to work as a security guard with me at Luli.

684
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,960
We left one after the other.

685
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,000
That was last week, Wednesday.

686
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,639
Yes, I was off that day.

687
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:58,159
He came to my place and said he wanted to have a drink with me.

688
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,599
He even bought quite a lot of food.

689
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,039
But I can't hold my liquor.

690
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,599
I passed out after just two drinks.

691
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,199
When I woke up, he was already gone.

692
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,800
Where is He Shun now?

693
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,719
Are you still in contact?

694
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,760
He did send me a text later.

695
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,239
He said he went back to his hometown.

696
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,880
But when I tried calling him again, I couldn't get through.

697
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,199
Hello.

698
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,320
The number you dialed is not in service.

699
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,239
Please check the number and dial again.

700
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,960
This is the number.

701
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,480
Write down the number.

702
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,119
Sir, I found it.

703
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,199
The whole night of February 4th,

704
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,280
he stayed in the hotel parking lot and never left.

705
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,679
Yes.

706
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,480
Thank you for your cooperation.

707
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,760
But we still have to act according to the law and regulations

708
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,960
and issue you a penalty.

709
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,360
Xia Yu.

710
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,519
Take him to sign.

711
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,760
We'll contact you if anything comes up.

712
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,280
Don't forget about the phone.

713
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,559
Okay, let's go. This way.

714
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:52,559
This way.

715
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,360
Check on this He Shun.

716
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,039
Okay.

717
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,559
Master

718
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,239
He Shun, thirty years old

719
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,400
From Chong County

720
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,360
He used to work as a security guard in the victim's neighborhood

721
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,000
He suddenly resigned six months ago

722
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,239
There’s been no news of him since

723
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,360
Let’s go

724
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,719
Master, maybe you shouldn’t go, let’s not go

725
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,880
Diandian is home alone

726
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,239
Hurry up, stop talking nonsense

727
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:38,320
It’s this house

728
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,800
He Shun

729
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:41,719
He Shun

730
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,599
Who is it?

731
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,679
Come out and play cards, we need one more

732
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,559
What’s up, Monkey?

733
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Playing cards, we need one more

734
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,920
Don’t move, don’t move, don’t move

735
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,719
Who?

736
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,199
Get up

737
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,599
Don’t move

738
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,159
We’re from the Haiming City Public Security Bureau

739
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,960
Are you He Shun?

740
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,360
Yes

741
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,039
