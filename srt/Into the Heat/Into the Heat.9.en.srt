1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,439
Do you recognize this?

2
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
Still being stubborn?

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
It's not you.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,439
You have no more chances.

5
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,200
Let me tell you one thing.

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,200
If the child lives, you live.

7
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,079
If the child dies,

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,799
you'll get the death penalty.

9
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,439
The child's life is your life.

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,239
Do you understand?

11
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,439
Speak.

12
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,360
Is the child alive or not?

13
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,599
I'm asking you.

14
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,000
should

15
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,879
It should be here, right?

16
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,680
Where is it?

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

18
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,360
Hold him down.

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,599
Quickly, quickly!

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,639
Hurry, hurry! Where is the person?

21
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,599
The pillar up ahead.

22
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,199
Is it there? Is it that pillar?

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,599
Hold him.

24
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,000
Go check quickly, see if the child is there.

25
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,639
The child is here, here, here!

26
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,199
How is it, Wang Xiaoyong?

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,199
Give a hand! Doctor, doctor, hurry!

29
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,599
Careful with the head, the child's head!

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,840
Call the doctor, call the doctor!

31
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,120
Slow down, slow down! Be careful!

32
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,000
Take him to the hospital, hold him steady.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Take him to the hospital, support him, quick!

34
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Liu Yang, you and Yalin hurry to the hospital.

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,719
Report any updates immediately.

36
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:10,960
Okay.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,639
Hurry, get in the car!

38
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,120
Coming!

39
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,280
Take the person back first.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,719
Understood.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,039
Get in the car, quickly!

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,919
The child will definitely be fine.

43
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,280
How is Ziming?

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,759
They're being treated in the hospital.

45
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,600
We

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,759
Our home is quite small

47
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,759
Nothing can be kept secret

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,759
Everyone knows I was inside.

49
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,600
It’s definitely hard to find a job after getting out.

50
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,519
So I stayed in the city and did odd jobs.

51
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,600
But things never really worked out.

52
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,680
So I ended up changing jobs several times.

53
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,959
So how many jobs have you worked at the Wang family?

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,959
This is my third.

55
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,439
How many have you tied up?

56
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,680
Just one.

57
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,879
How did you kidnap him?

58
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,319
The child knows me.

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,000
So I was

60
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,279
waiting for him in my car on his way to school.

61
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,160
When I saw him, I asked him,

62
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,160
"Where are you going?"

63
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
I'll give you a ride for a bit.

64
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,759
He just got in the car with me and left.

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
Why did you choose him?

66
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,560
This summer, a box went missing from the warehouse.

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,120
Wang Dongfeng didn't care about right or wrong.

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,759
He just asked me, "Where's the goods? Where did they go?"

69
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,639
How would I know?

70
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,480
I didn't take the goods.

71
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,560
He was just targeting me.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,839
Have I ever been inside?

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,639
Didn't you say you were, too?

74
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,360
You've been away from the Wang family for so long.

75
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,040
Why would you suddenly think of kidnapping someone's son?

76
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,160
Yes, I left.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
But the more I thought about it, the angrier I got.

78
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,639
Why should I be wronged?

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
I didn't take the goods.

80
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,240
So I kidnapped his son.

81
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,279
I wanted to get back at him.

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,160
Hello

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,639
How is the child?

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,079
That child

85
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,759
That child

86
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,959
That child

87
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,920
That child will be fine, right?

88
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,920
Did you ever even

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,839
I never intended for that child to come home alive.

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,879
No.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I didn't.

92
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,959
I know the child is innocent.

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,560
Once Wang Dongfeng gives me the money,

94
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,240
I will definitely let the child go.

95
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,720
No.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,959
I just want to take revenge on Wang Dongfeng.

97
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,399
I never intended to kill the child.

98
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,720
On such a cold day

99
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,040
How long

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,319
Are you even human

101
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,800
I didn't.

102
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't mean to kill the child.

103
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,680
You didn't mean to kill the child.

104
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,600
Then why didn't you move the child?

105
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
I just...

106
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,800
I just wanted to get back at Wang Dongfeng.

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,199
Let alone a child,

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
even an adult wouldn't survive out there.

109
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,519
Tell me

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
On November 25th

111
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,360
where were you from 4 p.m. to midnight?

112
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,439
I—I was at the warehouse that day

113
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,120
playing cards with my coworkers

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,680
No

115
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
What does this have to do with the child?

116
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,079
Doctor

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
How is the child?

118
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
We've managed to save them.

119
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,040
Thank you, doctor.

120
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,839
Thank you, doctor.

121
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,560
It's all right now.

122
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,360
So the box of goods wasn't lost?

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,279
It was the delivery order that was wrong.

124
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
Then why did you only ask him?

125
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
I asked everyone.

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,519
I asked them all.

127
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,799
Just because of this matter

128
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,399
they kidnapped my child.

129
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
They're here.

130
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,559
Captain Huang.

131
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,480
It's been clarified.

132
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,320
Cheng Yunhao's case has nothing to do with Zhao Hui.

133
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,120
Are you sure?

134
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,000
On November 25th

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Zhao Hui was indeed playing cards with some friends.

136
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,279
From 2 p.m. until noon the next day.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,519
Many people can testify.

138
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,639
Thank you for your hard work.

139
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,039
Find somewhere to rest for a bit.

140
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,559
What are you doing? What do you mean by that?

141
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,759
What are you doing?

142
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,519
What about me?

143
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,559
I just wanted to ask.

144
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,440
Then why is it that other people's cases

145
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,519
get solved so quickly?

146
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,039
Why is no one handling our case?

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's not make a scene. Calm down first.

148
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
Why shouldn't I make a scene?

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,679
What's wrong with you?

150
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,440
You...

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Calm down.

152
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,279
Why should I calm down?

153
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,080
Go get that kidnapper out here for me.

154
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,159
I want to see him.

155
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
I want to ask him.

156
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,399
Does he know anything about my son?

157
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,559
Why won't you let me in?

158
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,840
Is it abnormal for me to ask these questions?

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,559
Can't I ask?

160
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,159
Why can't our case be solved?

161
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,559
Can you save my child or not?

162
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,639
I'm begging you, can you please solve the case?

163
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,440
Enough.

164
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,960
Please look for him, I'm begging you.

165
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,960
Call him out and ask him.

166
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,279
Um...

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,279
Take her home to rest first.

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,399
That's enough, Li Jia.

169
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,200
Let's go home, let's go.

170
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,919
Go back first.

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Yellow Team

172
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
You're absolutely right.

173
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,320
But as for the 11·25 case,

174
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,720
It's already been ten days since the incident.

175
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,759
Even if we find them now,

176
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,519
the child is probably already...

177
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,519
The child isn't dead.

178
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
How do you know?

179
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,000
He must have hidden the child somewhere.

180
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Think about it, what can he do with just eight thousand yuan?

181
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,320
He'll definitely ask for more money.

182
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,200
I think that

183
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,440
Ziming makes a good point.

184
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,519
As long as the child hasn't been found for a day,

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,440
it means there's at least a chance of survival.

186
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,919
Even if there's just a sliver of hope, we can't give up.

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,279
As for the family,

188
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,960
no matter how they might misunderstand,

189
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,200
we should be more understanding and tolerant.

190
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,159
Bear with it.

191
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,440
Put all your effort into finding the child.

192
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
Once that's done, all problems will be solved.

193
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
From now on,

194
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,879
at Cheng Yunhao's house,

195
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,200
I want people stationed there 24 hours a day.

196
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,759
The purpose is simple: to let the family know.

197
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,000
It also reminds ourselves

198
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,840
to have hope and never give up.

199
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,559
A child

200
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,080
can't just disappear without explanation.

201
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,000
How many times have I said this?

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,120
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,320
You just don't believe me.

204
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,679
If it wasn't me, then what?

205
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,279
If someone has a record, are they not human anymore?

206
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,600
Do they lose all their rights?

207
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,320
Calm down.

208
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,679
You're not the only one we're investigating.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,039
Just tell us the truth, and we'll all save time.

210
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,440
I'll ask you again.

211
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
On the afternoon and evening of November 25th,

212
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,240
where were you?

213
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,360
The 25th...

214
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,480
That was so long ago.

215
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,879
How am I supposed to remember?

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Think carefully.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,399
Check your messages, look at your contacts.

218
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,200
Right, I remember now.

219
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,559
I was at the hospital that day.

220
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,399
Which hospital? Who can confirm that?

221
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,679
Central Hospital.

222
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,480
Early that morning, I had acute appendicitis.

223
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,919
All the doctors at the hospital can vouch for me.

224
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:03,919
Look at this.

225
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,320
My wound is still red.

226
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,879
Thank you for cooperating with our work.

227
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Next, we will verify the information.

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
Come, sign here and leave your fingerprint.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,679
Here.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,600
Right here.

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,879
So, can I leave now?

232
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,320
Yes, you can.

233
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,919
What a mess this is.

234
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,759
Who should we ask next?

235
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,279
What's wrong?

236
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,639
Don't be afraid. Are you hurt?

237
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,159
What's wrong, kid?

238
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Are you hurt? Don't be afraid.

239
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,399
What's wrong, kid?

240
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,519
Don't be afraid.

241
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,519
What's wrong?

242
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,360
Kid, what's wrong?

243
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,080
Stay away from me.

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,840
Back off! Help!

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,720
Okay, we won't touch you.

247
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,240
We're the police.

248
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,039
It's okay, don't be scared.

249
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,240
We won't hurt you.

250
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,799
Step back, step back.

251
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
It's okay, it's okay.

252
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,879
Don't be afraid.

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,399
Comrade, come here.

254
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:11,919
What's wrong?

255
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,879
The kid seems to be frightened.

256
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,879
He won't let us get close.

257
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,679
Go and try to calm him down.

258
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,600
Don't be afraid, little one.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,639
This is the police station.

260
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,639
We are all police officers.

261
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,960
Can you trust us?

262
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
Let's sit on the chair and talk slowly.

263
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,159
Don't worry.

264
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,559
Take it slow.

265
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,679
Little one.

266
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,240
Tell me, what's wrong?

267
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,799
I was kidnapped by bad people.

268
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't worry, what's your name?

269
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,240
My name is... my name is He Hongyu.

270
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,320
Check the household registration records.

271
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,440
Notify the family, quickly.

272
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,279
Okay. Do you know your parents' names?

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,039
Are you still cold, little one?

274
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,679
Xiaoyu.

275
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,559
Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!

276
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,159
Mom! Son!

277
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,519
Mom was so scared.

278
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,519
Why didn't you call the police?

279
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,679
We were too afraid.

280
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,480
He said if we called the police,

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,320
we would never see our child again.

282
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,440
How much did he want?

283
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,440
Ten thousand.

284
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,320
Does the voice on the phone sound familiar?

285
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,360
Not really.

286
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,120
When he called,

287
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,519
this was right next to me.

288
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,720
So I recorded it.

289
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,399
Prepare ten thousand yuan.

290
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,519
Wait for my call at eleven tonight.

291
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,200
Prepare ten thousand yuan.

292
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
Wait for my call at eleven tonight.

293
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,679
Prepare ten thousand yuan.

294
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,879
Wait for my call at eleven tonight.

295
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
Prepare ten thousand yuan.

296
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,240
Wait for my call at eleven tonight.

297
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,720
Prepare ten thousand yuan.

298
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,919
Wait for my call at eleven tonight.

299
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,279
We'll hold onto this for now.

300
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,759
Don't be nervous. If anything happens, tell me.

301
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,279
Do you still remember that person?

302
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,840
He...

303
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,960
is an uncle.

304
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
What does he look like?

305
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,240
He was wearing a security guard's uniform.

306
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,919
Can you tell me

307
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,080
how old he is?

308
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,840
Is he older or younger than your dad?

309
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Younger.

310
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,360
Where did you meet him?

311
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,639
At that time, I was playing in the arcade.

312
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,399
He told me that kids aren't allowed in the arcade.

313
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,559
He asked me to go with him.

314
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,200
I got nervous and just went with him.

315
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,320
This lady is an artist.

316
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,879
Tell this lady what the bad man's face looked like.

317
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,839
Tell this lady.

318
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,480
Let her help draw it, okay?

319
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,680
Was his face round or pointed?

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,079
Pointed. Pointed.

321
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,160
A pointed face? Or round?

322
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,039
Round.

323
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
I think it was round.

324
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,319
Then, about him—

325
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,400
Do you remember his facial features?

326
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,519
Did he have any distinctive features?

327
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,880
Were his eyebrows thick or thin?

328
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,039
Thick

329
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,799
Thick eyebrows, yeah

330
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,440
Did he have anything on his face

331
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,680
like a mole

332
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,319
or any obvious scars or something like that

333
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,599
I... I can't say

334
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,680
He beat me, beat me nearly to death

335
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,599
Uncle, please don't beat me to death.

336
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,799
I begged him.

337
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,039
Then he tied me up.

338
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,759
And threw me into the well.

339
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,680
No, no!

340
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Help!

341
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,119
Help!

342
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,480
What happened next?

343
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,680
After that,

344
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I used my mouth to bite the rope.

345
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
I bit the rope until it loosened.

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,039
Then I climbed out.

347
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,640
Was there anyone else in the well?

348
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,279
Do you still remember where the well was?

349
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,279
The two crime scenes are very close to each other.

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,200
The amount demanded was about the same.

351
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,759
So we can't rule out that it was done by the same person.

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,480
Think about it.

353
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,160
If I randomly ask any of you right now,

354
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,160
in our district,

355
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,440
where is there a manhole cover that can hide a person?

356
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,160
Could you answer that?

357
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,400
Normally, no one could.

358
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
If I asked about a manhole cover that can hide a person in another district,

359
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,079
it would be even harder to answer.

360
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Because a normal person

361
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
wouldn't even notice this place.

362
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,920
So why did this person choose to hide the child

363
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,759
in the well?

364
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,000
It can only mean one thing.

365
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,039
This area is his comfort zone.

366
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,759
It shows he often operates around here.

367
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,319
That's why he thought of hiding someone here.

368
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,079
Here's what we'll do.

369
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,799
You and Dali, form two teams.

370
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Immediately check all the arcades in the area.

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,279
Go through them thoroughly.

372
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,200
Whether it's the owners, the workers,

373
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,440
or the regular visitors,

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and anyone else,

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
using Cheng Yunhao's

376
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,359
last known location as the center,

377
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,200
search within a five-kilometer radius.

378
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,920
Check every underground space where someone could hide.

379
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:48,960
Search them all thoroughly.

380
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,480
Boss

381
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:42,799
We're from the city criminal police unit.

382
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,039
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

383
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:44,480
Go ahead.

384
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Has this person ever been to your shop?

385
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
I can't remember.

386
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,200
Has anyone in a security guard uniform been here?

387
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,599
There are people coming and going here every day.

388
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,640
So many people.

389
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,319
I can't keep track.

390
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,200
Did your child ever go to the arcade?

391
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
He did.

392
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,519
But that was in the past.

393
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,000
Later, his grades started to drop.

394
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,279
So we stopped letting him go.

395
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,799
A month before the incident, he promised us

396
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,160
he would never go to that kind of place again.

397
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,160
I think I saw someone like that in the past couple of days.

398
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,960
Wearing a blue uniform.

399
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
Like a security guard's uniform.

400
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't you have surveillance cameras here?

401
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,359
No.

402
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,079
Ziming

403
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,279
Give him your contact information.

404
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
If he comes again,

405
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
contact us right away.

406
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,519
Keep this sketch.

407
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,160
What do we do now?

408
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,759
Wait.

409
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
He Hongyu got away.

410
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,559
We didn't catch him this time.

411
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,400
He'll definitely strike again.

412
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,920
This place is probably his new target.

413
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,119
Wait. Just keep waiting.

414
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:29,920
Captain Huang

415
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Captain Huang

416
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,000
What brings you here?

417
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,400
I came to check on you all.

418
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:33,880
Come on.

419
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,599
Thank you, Captain Huang.

420
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,880
Which one is this?

421
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,400
Fifty-two.

422
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,880
Why did I count fifty-one?

423
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,559
Hello?

424
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,480
What's wrong?

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't know.

426
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,160
Sorry, guys.

427
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,799
Something happened at home.

428
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,359
I have to head back first.

429
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,319
Go ahead, we've got this.

430
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,000
It's fine.

431
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,559
Hurry up.

432
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,359
Take it easy.

433
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,319
Chengcheng

434
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,880
Take care of yourself, and my condolences.

435
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,240
Alright, alright, alright.

436
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,119
Let's just look ahead.

437
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah.

438
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,400
Chengcheng.

439
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,920
Chengcheng,

440
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,480
Brother Lei

441
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,079
Why are you here?

442
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,240
Staying at home is just staying at home.

443
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,039
My own son is gone.

444
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,319
I might as well help others look for their sons.

445
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,839
What are you two doing standing here in the middle of the night?

446
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,160
Come on, let's go somewhere else.

447
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,319
Hurry up.

448
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,880
Come eat with me.

449
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,319
Master

450
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,119
Have a seat, sit down.

451
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,240
Here.

452
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
Security uniform

453
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
Statue

454
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,160
The person in the photo is him.

455
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,799
Want to take it? Don't rush.

456
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,880
Take another look.

457
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,319
Sir, how much are the sweet potatoes?

458
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,200
Ten yuan per jin.

459
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:33,759
Okay, I'll take one.

460
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,279
Okay, I'll take one.

461
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:34,960
I've left the money here.

462
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,839
Alright.

463
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,039
How much does a haircut cost here?

464
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:42,599
Thank you.

465
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,559
Fifteen per person.

466
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,240
Sir, would you like a haircut?

467
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,240
Do you work here?

468
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
We're here to learn.

469
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,000
Don't move.

470
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,160
Get down.

471
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,799
Hands.

472
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,759
Don't move your hands.

473
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,960
What's your name?

474
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,640
Speak.

475
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,680
What is this for?

476
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
Get up, get up.

477
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,240
Where is the child?

478
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:10,759
Go.

479
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,720
Get in, get in.

480
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,039
Don't move, behave yourself.

481
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:32,680
Captain Huang

482
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,680
At a sewage well in Mapo

483
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,279
Cheng Yunhao's backpack was found

484
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,599
Bring the suspect to the scene immediately

485
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,359
This is a sewage well.

486
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
If a child is thrown in, they'll die.

487
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,039
Do you understand?

488
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,279
Haohau

489
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,319
Have you found Haohau?

490
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
Where is Haohau?

491
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,519
Haohau

492
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,799
Where is Haohau?

493
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,319
Haohau

494
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:08,680
A backpack has been found.

495
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
Haohau

496
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,839
Where's the child? Haohao's backpack.

497
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,480
Where's the child?

498
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,640
Where exactly is the child?

499
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,720
The child hasn't been found yet.

500
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,240
Speak up. We will keep searching.

501
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,039
That person, that person.

502
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,799
We only found the backpack.

503
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,160
We will keep looking.

504
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,880
Haohao.

505
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,359
Haohao.

506
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,000
Haohao.

507
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,720
There's still hope, there's still hope.

508
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,279
Haohao.

509
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,279
Haohao.

510
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,720
Where exactly is the child?

511
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:38,880
Where is the person?

512
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,319
I'm asking you.

513
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,160
What time was he put in?

514
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,119
Did you go back to check later?

515
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,279
I'm talking to you.

516
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,599
Where is the person?

517
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,319
Where is the child?

518
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
Let me tell you something.

519
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,480
Don't think staying silent will get you off the hook.

520
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,759
Stop dreaming.

521
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,039
Yu Peng.

522
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,319
Twenty-three years old.

523
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
From Ancheng.

524
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,400
He was abandoned after birth.

525
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,319
He grew up in this welfare home.

526
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,200
At fourteen, he ran away from the welfare home.

527
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,720
At the train station,

528
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,839
he hung out with a group of boys about his age.

529
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,119
They got involved in street life together.

530
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Doing petty theft and similar things.

531
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,240
He arrived in our city, Haiming, four years ago.

532
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,640
At first,

533
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,920
he washed dishes at a restaurant.

534
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,720
Worked as a waiter in a bar and such.

535
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,119
He was doing honest work then.

536
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,119
Later, he met some shady people.

537
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,160
He got addicted to gambling.

538
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,799
His wages were low and not enough.

539
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,279
So he started thinking about doing bad things.

540
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
According to his own confession,

541
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,200
he committed two kidnappings in total.

542
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,400
The first time was with Cheng Yunhao.

543
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,920
He took eight thousand yuan and went back to his hometown.

544
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,720
He spent it all in just a few days.

545
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Then he came back to Haiming and committed a second crime.

546
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,039
The second target was He Hongyu.

547
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,759
That's the general situation.

548
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,640
According to our analysis,

549
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,400
Cheng Yunhao's condition

550
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,359
is not looking good.

551
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,119
Pull yourself together.

552
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,400
Keep searching.

553
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,480
We need to find them, dead or alive.

554
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,319
Yes.

555
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,720
You're back.

556
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,519
No, no, no.

557
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,480
You're too dirty.

558
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,279
Go back to sleep.

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
I'll take a shower and be right back.

560
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,159
The child

561
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,320
We’ll definitely find them, right?

562
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:18,679
Ziming

563
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,239
Excuse me, excuse me, make way, Lei.

564
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,599
How are things over in Yunnan?

565
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,679
We checked, it's not Cheng Yunhao.

566
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,599
It was Yu Peng's uncle who had a child with someone else.

567
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,519
He didn't dare tell his family, so he claimed the child was found.

568
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
Have you interrogated Yu Peng these past couple of days?

569
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,719
Yes, but it didn't go well.

570
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,199
Get in the car.

571
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,320
Done.

572
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,159
Why do these pants feel a bit tight?

573
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,079
It's fine, I can get into them.

574
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,199
Lei, where are the shoes? The dress shoes?

575
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:49,840
Shoes.

576
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,679
Did I leave them at the police station?

577
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:53,840
It's okay.

578
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,400
Let's just go with this.

579
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,639
Let me take you for a quick shower.

580
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:58,800
No, no, there's no time.

581
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,239
My mother-in-law said,

582
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,920
not even a minute late is acceptable.

583
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,760
No matter how busy, the wedding must be made up today.

584
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,760
Then hold on tight.

585
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,559
I'm stepping on the gas.

586
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:06,440
Faster, faster!

587
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,480
Lei, speed up!

588
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,079
Inside, inside.

589
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,719
Thank you, thank you.

590
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,679
Coming, coming.

591
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,840
Wu Hai.

592
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,360
Give me a hand.

593
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,880
It's too heavy.

594
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,840
Thank you for your hard work.

595
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,800
What happened here?

596
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Congratulations, Uncle.

597
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,679
Congratulations.

598
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,199
Congratulations!

599
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
What happened to your leg?

600
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,119
Tingting, don't worry about him.

601
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,159
He can jump from the second floor catching someone and be fine.

602
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,239
But at home, just cleaning a window,

603
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,559
he broke his leg.

604
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,920
Talk about bad luck.

605
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,400
Congratulations!

606
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,039
Thank you, thank you.

607
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,639
Hurry, go inside.

608
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,119
Where's Ziming?

609
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,239
He hasn't arrived yet.

610
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:38,599
Not here yet.

611
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,880
You all go in first.

612
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,039
Please, come in, come in, come in.

613
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,920
We're here, we're here! Hurry, hurry!

614
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,559
You just got here?

615
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:47,880
What's going on?

616
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,519
Slow down, slow down.

617
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,880
Tingting, sorry, sorry.

618
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,599
Hurry, hurry!

619
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,440
People might think I'm the groom.

620
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,840
I'm going to the restroom first.

621
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,719
I've been holding it in the whole way.

622
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,079
Um, uncle, I...

623
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:56,599
Alright.

624
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,400
Hello, hello.

625
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,400
Dad.

626
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Not out yet.

627
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,280
Not out yet.

628
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,679
Put the shoes on him.

629
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,280
Okay.

630
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,599
Liu Ziming

631
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,519
Ziming

632
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,079
is getting married

633
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:51,119
Distinguished leaders and guests,

634
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,320
ladies and gentlemen,

635
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,280
hello everyone.

636
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,599
Thank you all for coming on time to attend the wedding of the groom, Liu Ziming,

637
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,079
and the bride, Fang Tingting.

638
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:02,280
At this moment, please allow me to speak on behalf of the bride and groom,

639
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,079
as well as both of their families,

640
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,320
to express our heartfelt gratitude

641
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,199
for your presence here today,

642
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,159
and to extend our warmest welcome.

643
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,480
Welcome, everyone.

644
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:13,840
Thank you.

645
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,639
In the boundless wilderness of thousands of years,

646
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,559
among thousands of people,

647
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,360
you meet the one you are meant to meet.

648
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,880
You will find it, not a moment too soon,

649
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,400
and not a moment too late.

650
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,000
You will definitely find it.

651
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,440
This is the best encounter that love can offer.

652
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,960
Today, the groom is filled with immense excitement

653
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,239
and joy.

654
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,920
He is ready to give his speech.

655
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,760
I announce

656
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,440
that you may now kiss the bride.

657
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,079
See if there's anything else nearby.

658
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,960
Like any tools or objects.

659
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,840
Blunt or sharp instruments, for example.

660
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,599
The main injury is a blunt force trauma to the head.

661
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,960
Make way, make way.

662
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,079
Put him on the stretcher.

663
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,639
Move aside, give us a hand.

664
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,199
Hurry.

665
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:40,880
Come on, hurry up.

666
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,280
Cao.

667
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,280
I'm here.

668
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,280
Has the victim's identity been confirmed?

669
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,800
His surname is Yang, from Sichuan.

670
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,719
He worked at a nearby internet café.

671
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,360
Who found him?

672
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,559
An old scavenger.

673
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,639
In the morning, his dog

674
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,840
kept barking here.

675
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,119
No matter how he called, it wouldn't come.

676
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,239
When he came to check, he found the body.

677
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,840
He's still at the station giving a statement.

678
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:05,800
Zhang.

679
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,719
Come here.

680
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,599
Wait a moment, take a look.

681
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,079
The main injuries are from blunt force.

682
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,159
They're on the head and body.

683
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,840
Also, there are strangulation marks on the neck.

684
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:17,960
No.

685
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,760
Officer Liu, do you want to take another look?

686
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,400
Zhang, I'll treat you to lamb skewers when we're done.

687
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,239
You're using your mentor's trick again, aren't you?

688
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,320
How about a whole roasted lamb instead?

689
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
You're more generous than your mentor in this regard.

690
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,280
Alright, let's talk about it later.

691
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,840
Please hurry up.

692
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,159
Okay.

693
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,920
Do you know where the deceased lived?

694
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,360
I know. I'll take you there.

695
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,719
How long have you been renting this place to him?

696
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,559
A year and a half.

697
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,400
How much is the rent?

698
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,599
One hundred fifty.

699
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:56,920
How do you pay the rent?

700
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,599
Once a month.

701
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,119
It's okay.

702
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,039
Don't be nervous, don't shake.

703
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,360
Do people usually come and go here?

704
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,679
I don't know about that.

705
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,239
I don't have any contact with the tenant.

706
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,239
When was the last time you saw him?

707
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,559
At the end of last month.

708
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,960
I came to collect the rent and haven't seen him since.

709
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,199
Alright.

710
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:20,159
Then take him back to the station to make a statement.

711
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:20,800
Okay.

712
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,480
I'll go take a look over there.

713
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,079
Let's go.

714
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,000
No way, this is so unlucky.

715
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,440
I didn't do anything.

716
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,280
I—

717
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,280
Wait, what's going on? I—

718
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,480
Did anyone come by last night?

719
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,400
Did you see anything?

720
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,800
I went to bed early last night, so I didn't notice.

721
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,320
Forensics said

722
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,440
from the network cable

723
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,320
and the fingerprints taken from the dumbbells at home

724
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,000
there are four clear prints that don't belong to the victim.

725
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,000
They're still being compared.

726
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,880
What did the medical examiner say?

727
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,320
The head injury wasn't fatal.

728
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,320
The cause of death was mechanical asphyxiation.

729
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,559
The victim had a sexually transmitted disease.

730
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,480
Genital warts.

731
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,039
Eggs were found in the stomach contents.

732
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,679
They were probably eaten two to three hours before death.

733
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,320
Social connections.

734
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,639
You, focus on his social connections.

735
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,599
Look into them carefully.

736
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,360
Liu Yang isn't here.

737
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,239
You two need to get this case sorted out for me.

738
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,559
Report directly to me if anything comes up.

739
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,320
Don't worry.

740
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,159
It's you two I'm worried about.

741
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:50,880
I'm telling you,

742
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,440
call me anytime if something happens.

743
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,559
Take care.

744
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,079
Alright, alright.

745
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,599
Where's Captain Huang going? Out of town?

746
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,960
His father-in-law passed away.

747
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,719
