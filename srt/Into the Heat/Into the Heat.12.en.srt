1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,159
Brother Liu

2
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,040
I don't touch this.

3
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,159
Sugar.

4
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,359
With this, drinking is even more fun.

5
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,680
Sixth Brother

6
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,640
You guys play.

7
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,280
Can I just drink and keep you company?

8
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Weizi

9
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,240
You can't even touch this?

10
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,240
Can the two of us still hang out together?

11
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,159
Hello, Yu Hai.

12
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,680
Sister-in-law.

13
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,639
It's nothing, I just wanted to ask—

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
Has Brother Li contacted you these past couple of days?

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
No, I haven't seen him.

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
It's fine, it's fine.

17
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm just asking out of curiosity, what's going on?

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,840
Alright, I'll hang up now.

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Brother-in-law is missing.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,159
What do you mean, missing?

21
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,159
His phone is off.

22
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
He doesn't respond to messages either.

23
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,439
People at his company say they haven't seen him.

24
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,759
When was the last time you were in touch?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The night before last.

26
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,400
What about his friends? Have you contacted them?

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,039
I've asked all of them.

28
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,199
They all said they haven't seen him.

29
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,639
What about the places he used to go?

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,879
He's always out somewhere.

31
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,000
How would I know where he wanders around all day?

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,319
Has this ever happened before?

33
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,639
Like not hearing anything for twenty-four hours?

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,479
No.

35
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,639
In the past, whether he was on a business trip or out drinking,

36
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,639
even if he didn't answer at the time,

37
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,319
he would always get back to me eventually.

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
Sis, you told me before

39
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,639
that there was a woman who kept texting your husband.

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,719
Why don't you ask about it?

41
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm just afraid something happened to him.

42
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,479
You need to think positively.

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
What if he was kidnapped?

44
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,560
Uncle, my dad couldn't really have been kidnapped, right?

45
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,919
Don't listen to his nonsense.

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,599
No, no way.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,159
Your uncle is just joking with you.

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,919
If he really was kidnapped,

49
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,280
then we'd have to ask Mom for money.

50
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,120
It's fine, don't worry.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Alright, stop worrying, Aunt.

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,159
I'll go look for him for you.

53
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,919
I'm leaving.

54
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,560
Let's go.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,759
Are there any other places besides these?

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,759
These are the places your brother-in-law often goes to.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't know about anything else.

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Then where could he have gone?

59
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,759
Yeah, isn't that strange?

60
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,680
Where could he have gone?

61
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,839
He went to see a prostitute.

62
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,120
He couldn't have been gone that long for that.

63
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,319
Brother Yang

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,279
Ziming

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,120
What's wrong? You look terrible.

66
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,720
Does anyone in our line of work ever look good?

67
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,040
True.

68
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,360
About that thing I asked you to do—

69
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,560
Found him. He's in the detention center.

70
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,879
Detention center? What for?

71
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,759
Drug use.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,079
What's wrong with you?

73
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,920
I've been taking care of the kid lately.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,519
Every day it's all about—

75
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,000
Sleeping, feeding, bathing.

76
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,120
It's all a mess.

77
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,360
Why didn't they notify the family after the detention?

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
I asked the police station.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
They said they were going to notify.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,199
But your brother-in-law absolutely refused.

81
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,399
He even smashed the phone.

82
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,079
What was he using?

83
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,759
Meth.

84
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,279
Where was he caught?

85
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,319
Someone reported him.

86
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,480
At a nightclub called Nana.

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,279
Na or Nana?

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Nana, two characters.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Alright, thanks.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,600
I'll go check it out.

91
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,000
You're here.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,079
Driving again, huh?

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,519
Get in the car.

94
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,319
Sit in the back.

95
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,959
Still looking down on me.

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,399
Alright.

97
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,160
Officer, you can head back.

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Thanks for your hard work.

99
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,360
Get in the car.

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,519
Sit further in.

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
What are you doing?

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,519
It's on my way.

103
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,319
Catching a ride.

104
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,959
Ziming.

105
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,360
You didn't tell anyone what I did, right?

106
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,480
Soon they'll say I got into a fight.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
There's nothing to it.

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,319
It's over now.

109
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,199
This is my first time, you know?

110
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,839
Who in business doesn't have a few shady friends?

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,759
It's not like I wanted to do that.

112
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,240
He insisted on dropping that pill in my drink.

113
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,360
So at that moment, tell me—

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Should I have poured it out or thrown up?

115
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,279
Isn't it wrong to embarrass someone?

116
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,519
You—

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,079
Yeah.

118
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,959
Why didn't you turn just now?

119
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,920
Where are you going?

120
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,319
Say something.

121
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,680
To the company.

122
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,199
So meticulous.

123
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,360
Cops really are different.

124
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,319
Turn right here.

125
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,160
What are you doing?

126
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,360
Where are we going?

127
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,439
Officer.

128
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,000
He's trying to kidnap me, see?

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,959
He's not following the route, he's trying to kidnap me.

130
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,319
What should I do about this?

131
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,720
No one's kidnapping you.

132
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,759
What? Then where are we going?

133
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,160
You're just driving straight ahead.

134
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,959
We're going to the rehab center.

135
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm not going there.

136
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,519
Let me out. Sit properly.

137
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:12,959
Sit properly.

138
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,439
What are you doing?

139
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,240
Sit properly.

140
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,040
Do you want to stay there a few more days?

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Sit properly.

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,959
He really came.

143
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,199
Ziming, I swear I’ll never use again.

144
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,959
Please, don’t turn me in, okay?

145
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,839
You can’t do this to me.

146
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,079
You can’t do this to me.

147
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,639
I’ve treated you well, Ziming.

148
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,839
I’ll even get on my knees if you want.

149
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,079
Ziming, you… you can’t—

150
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,240
I can’t go in there.

151
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,360
Ziming.

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,199
That’ll be the end of me.

153
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,040
Behave yourself.

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
Sis, we found him.

155
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,879
He’s fine, don’t worry.

156
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,920
Yeah, he’s at the local station.

157
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,800
He’s cooperating with the investigation.

158
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Yeah, just a minor issue, nothing serious.

159
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,959
Don’t worry, nothing big will happen.

160
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,959
I’m still busy here, so I’ll talk to you later.

161
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,079
Okay.

162
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,120
Brother Ming

163
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,160
Brother Ming

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,199
Brother Ming

165
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Brother Ming

166
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,800
Master

167
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,799
I checked that license plate from An Pinghai.

168
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,639
It's a fake plate.

169
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,080
Then I checked his car.

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,639
All the owners of this type of car in the city

171
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,679
are listed here.

172
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
There are 2,041 cars in total.

173
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,320
But I'm not sure

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,879
if his car is among them.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
It might not be registered in our city.

176
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,799
Anyway, it's not easy to check.

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,679
How's it going on Li Yugang's side?

178
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,600
No luck.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,399
The car disappeared at a

180
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,840
junction with no surveillance.

181
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,519
He's keeping watch there.

182
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,720
I told him

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,919
it would take until New Year's to check all the footage.

184
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
Why don't we have him come back?

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,360
No need. Why should he come back?

186
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,480
He usually can't sit still, right?

187
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,919
Let him sit there a bit longer.

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,480
That's true.

189
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Come with me.

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Brother Liu

191
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,519
Here are your meat skewers and grilled tendons.

192
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,240
They're all ready.

193
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
Brother Lei isn't here.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,519
Our boss really isn't here today.

195
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
If you need anything, just tell me.

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,759
Okay.

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,919
Brother Liu

198
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,159
Sit

199
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,360
Hello

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,919
This

201
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Thank you.

202
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,679
It's nothing.

203
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,279
Is there something you need from me, Liu?

204
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,679
I missed you.

205
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
I wanted to talk to you.

206
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,080
Brother Liu, look at me, I'm not even a whole person anymore.

207
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
And you're still making fun of me.

208
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,960
Come.

209
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,840
Come.

210
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,919
I want to ask you about someone.

211
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,080
You know An Pinghai, right?

212
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,440
Of course I've heard of An Pinghai.

213
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,440
He's such a big shot.

214
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,360
But I've only heard about him.

215
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,039
I can't get close to him.

216
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
It's just what I've heard.

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,320
But you must at least know some of his people, right?

218
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,639
Brother Liu, stop joking with me.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,879
How could I possibly know them?

220
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,919
Playing dumb with me, huh?

221
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,120
An Pinghai has a lackey

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
named Ge Xiaohui.

223
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,919
He usually helps him distribute goods.

224
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,080
Last time An Pinghai stayed at a hotel,

225
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,320
he used Ge Xiaohui's name.

226
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,360
You don't know him?

227
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,639
Ge Xiaohui.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,559
The name Ge Xiaohui

229
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,279
does sound familiar.

230
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,919
But I can't recall right now.

231
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,679
I just can't remember at the moment.

232
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,960
My memory, you know...

233
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
I don't sleep well these days.

234
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,320
You're having trouble again, aren't you?

235
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,840
Having trouble delivering fruit platters?

236
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,440
No, no.

237
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,120
Thanks to Captain Liu,

238
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,320
the boss treats me pretty well.

239
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
He never even haggled over the price with me.

240
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,720
I've turned over a new leaf now.

241
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm not doing bad things anymore.

242
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,720
But...

243
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,759
there's just a tiny little problem.

244
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,759
Go on.

245
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,440
My health,

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
it's getting worse day by day.

247
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,960
The hospital doesn't really want to see me anymore.

248
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,360
No problem, I'll ask around for you.

249
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
It has to be Captain Liu.

250
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,919
It has to be Brother Liu, come on.

251
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,679
Thank you, Brother Liu.

252
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,440
I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that.

253
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,440
Go ahead, tell me.

254
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,639
You mean those big bosses?

255
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,559
I really don't know any of them.

256
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,200
But I heard there's someone like that.

257
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,120
His name is Zhang Bao.

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Zhang Bao is always at Nana Bar.

259
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,240
It's for delivering goods to Ge Xiaohui.

260
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,360
Is there anything I should pay special attention to?

261
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,360
The DJ in that bar,

262
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
is really good.

263
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,679
You should pay more attention to him.

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Sounds great.

265
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
The skewers are delicious too.

266
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,080
Thank you, Captain Liu.

267
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,320
Well then,

268
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,720
I'll head out now.

269
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,159
Car keys.

270
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,639
Car keys.

271
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
I have another set.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Two sets of keys.

273
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
Have some skewers.

274
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,879
Master, you go ahead and eat. I'm done.

275
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,679
Master

276
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,320
Who told you to come back?

277
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,679
Hey, you two are eating skewers without me?

278
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
We saved some for you.

279
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,320
We haven't touched a single bite.

280
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Who ate this? Is it still edible?

281
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,039
It's edible.

282
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,639
It's tasty.

283
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,919
Delicious, grilled to perfection.

284
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,879
Master, the one who was talking just now—

285
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,879
Who is that person?

286
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,080
His nickname is Black Wuchang.

287
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,759
He was sent to juvenile detention at fourteen.

288
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,759
Since then, going to prison has become routine for him.

289
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,559
I've arrested him three times myself.

290
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
I feel sorry for him.

291
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
I help him out sometimes.

292
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Sometimes I ask him for information too.

293
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,720
If you wipe that table again, the color will change.

294
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
You really need to fix your obsession with cleanliness.

295
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,320
Otherwise, how will you handle fieldwork in the future?

296
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,080
Got it, Master.

297
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:07,240
I'll work on it.

298
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,039
Let's go.

299
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,159
You two go back and change your clothes.

300
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,720
I'll take you out for some fun tonight.

301
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,159
Understood.

302
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,159
No, Master, I just sat down, I just started eating.

303
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,240
Where are we going tonight?

304
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Put it on my tab.

305
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Go.

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,240
Bar.

307
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,159
We're going to a bar.

308
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,440
Don't waste it, take it.

309
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
You eat it yourself.

310
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:30,679
Master.

311
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,360
Why do you think Li Yugang still isn't here?

312
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,639
He's so slow.

313
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,480
Here they come.

314
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,120
We're going to a bar, you two are dressed way too plain.

315
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,360
You need to unzip your jacket.

316
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,039
Don't move.

317
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,679
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

318
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,440
Let me see.

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,919
Where's your Rolex?

320
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,279
Can you even see wearing sunglasses in the middle of the night?

321
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,960
They're branded, cost fifty bucks.

322
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,919
Let me tell you.

323
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,240
We're just going to a bar,

324
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,360
and you dress like this.

325
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,039
If one day we have to bust a prostitution case,

326
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
how would you even dress?

327
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,320
Alright, enough talking, let's go.

328
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,080
He’s out.

329
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,399
Call the team and ask for backup.

330
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,000
If you lose him again this time,

331
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,799
you’ll be reassigned to a desk job.

332
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,759
Master, should we go over and take a look?

333
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,519
Car key.

334
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
I have another one.

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,319
Two keys.

336
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,440
Xia Yu

337
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,759
You go. Don't startle him.

338
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,000
The suspect has gone in.

339
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,799
Attention to those inside.

340
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,920
Cooperate with Xia Yu to carry out the arrest.

341
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,440
Attention

342
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,359
New fish have arrived

343
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,519
Master, are you coming?

344
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,680
Got him. (arrest)

345
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,880
Don't move.

346
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,640
Don't move. Who are you?

347
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,839
Police! Police!

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,559
Cuff him.

349
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,279
Car keys.

350
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,720
Cuff him. Take off the bag and search him.

351
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,559
Check the bag.

352
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,759
What is this?

353
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,160
Speak. What is this?

354
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,440
Ice.

355
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,599
What kind of ice?

356
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,160
Meth.

357
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,119
Is there any more in the car?

358
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,359
No, that's all.

359
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,480
Is there any more in the car?

360
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,920
No, that's all.

361
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,119
Take him away.

362
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,240
Move. Keep your head down.

363
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,160
Xia Yu, they've caught the person.

364
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,400
You can take it off on your end.

365
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,400
How many grams is this? Read it out.

366
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,599
Twenty-four point two

367
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
This is from several places

368
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,319
Four, maybe five

369
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
Plus what we found at your house

370
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,599
A total of sixty grams

371
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,319
Do you know how many years you'll get?

372
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,559
Tell him

373
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,960
According to Article 348 of the Criminal Law

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
Illegally possessing more than fifty grams of meth

375
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,119
Or a large amount of other drugs

376
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,839
Is punishable by at least seven years in prison

377
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,160
Or life imprisonment

378
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,359
And a fine

379
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,160
You've got enough for that

380
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,400
Starting at seven years

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,079
Think carefully

382
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,079
No, sir

383
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm just a distributor

384
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,559
We already knew you were a distributor

385
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,119
Let me tell you

386
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,079
The exact sentence

387
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,160
Depends not only on the severity of the case

388
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,680
But also on your attitude

389
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,400
Since you're just a distributor,

390
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,880
you should come clean.

391
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,759
It's time to talk.

392
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,599
They're the ones taking the biggest cut.

393
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,279
Don't trap yourself.

394
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,160
Why do this to yourself?

395
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,119
If I talk,

396
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,279
what's in it for me?

397
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,359
Now you want to make amends?

398
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,160
Just tell us properly.

399
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,799
Who gave you the goods?

400
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,920
Where is he?

401
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,759
Ge Xiaohui.

402
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,960
I met him once at the Yanghe Hotel.

403
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:39,759
We already know that.

404
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,759
Anything else?

405
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,160
Lu Fu Palace.

406
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,359
He keeps a room there year-round.

407
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,480
That's the place he visits most often.

408
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,079
No.

409
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
Why did you stop typing?

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,720
Everything I said is true.

411
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,319
We already know this.

412
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,680
There's nothing new.

413
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
You want to take credit for just this?

414
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,720
He also has a girlfriend.

415
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
Her name is Fan Jingjing.

416
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,799
She often helps him distribute goods.

417
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,400
Ge Xiaohui really likes her.

418
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,640
Last month, because of her,

419
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,880
he got into a fight with someone.

420
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,359
What's her name?

421
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,359
Her surname is Fan.

422
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,680
Her name is Fan Jingjing.

423
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,839
There's no problem moving against Zhang Bao.

424
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,480
But targeting Ge Xiaohui...

425
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,200
With the clues and resources you have now,

426
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,400
what if he gets away?

427
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,559
If An Pinghai gets spooked, everything will be ruined.

428
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,039
How confident are you?

429
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,519
Fifty-fifty.

430
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,039
And you still dare to make a move?

431
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,680
It's not about whether I dare or not.

432
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,960
It's that we have to act now.

433
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,319
If we want to catch An Pinghai,

434
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,119
we have to catch Ge Xiaohui first.

435
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,119
First, Ge Xiaohui handles shipments for An Pinghai.

436
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,640
Once the goods are shipped and the money is collected,

437
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,720
An Pinghai will need him to recover the funds.

438
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,519
Second,

439
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,519
Ge Xiaohui is An Pinghai's

440
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,759
most trusted and important subordinate.

441
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,880
If we catch Ge Xiaohui,

442
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,000
we can use him to lure out An Pinghai.

443
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,279
Third, and most crucially,

444
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,920
most of their goods have already been shipped.

445
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,119
If we don't act now,

446
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm worried they'll move an even bigger batch.

447
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,720
Go ahead and arrest them, Captain Huang.

448
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,079
If anything goes wrong, I'll take responsibility.

449
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,480
You'll take responsibility?

450
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,279
How are you going to take responsibility, man?

451
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,359
So what do you suggest?

452
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll report to the bureau first.

453
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,359
Then while you're at it,

454
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,640
ask if we can get a new car.

455
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
What do you mean?

456
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,640
Our old junk car—

457
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,119
if we park it at such a fancy hotel,

458
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,240
it'll really stand out.

459
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,920
It's like we're begging people to know we're cops.

460
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
Ming, someone is looking for you in the yard.

461
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,079
Is that okay, Captain Huang?

462
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,119
Fine, fine, fine.

463
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,200
Get a better car.

464
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,279
How about I get you a plane?

465
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,359
A plane would be great.

466
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,200
No, Chief—

467
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,839
No, no, I'm not asking you for a plane.

468
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,119
Don't lie to me.

469
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,079
I don't believe he got into a fight.

470
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,519
He's not that kind of person.

471
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,480
Was it drugs or soliciting?

472
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,200
Drugs.

473
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,880
Did you know about it beforehand?

474
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,279
I didn't know.

475
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,960
Do you know where the drugs came from?

476
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,559
I told you, I don't know.

477
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Do you use drugs?

478
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,119
I don't.

479
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,319
I'm asking if you use drugs.

480
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,559
I said I don't.

481
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,319
Sis.

482
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,599
I...

483
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,079
I'm just worried about you.

484
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,119
Where is he?

485
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,319
At the rehab center.

486
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,440
If he behaves well,

487
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,319
and cooperates,

488
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,079
he'll be out soon.

489
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,480
Don't worry.

490
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm not worried.

491
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm leaving.

492
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,039
Go inside, take a break, have some water.

493
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,359
Ni Zi is home alone.

494
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,519
Can't sleep.

495
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
Get me a bottle of water.

496
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,599
Is that Ge Xiaohui?

497
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,200
That's Ge Xiaohui.

498
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,440
Master.

499
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,319
The peanuts have gone up.

500
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,519
He's carrying a bag.

501
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,119
Okay.

502
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,759
What do we do?

503
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,720
Let's go.

504
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,920
Are you sure they're carrying the goods?

505
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,319
We'll only know once we catch them.

506
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,640
Take it, but don't blow your cover.

507
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll be there soon.

508
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,640
Understood.

509
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,000
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

510
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,160
Who is it? Don't move!

511
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,720
What are you doing?

512
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,519
Cuff him! Cuff him!

513
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,279
Let me go!

514
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,720
Hands behind your back! Don't move!

515
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,160
Get up!

516
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,319
Get up! Get up!

517
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,039
Squat there.

518
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,039
Squat down.

519
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,880
Squat down.

520
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,400
Give

521
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,400
We are from the Haiming City Public Security Bureau.

522
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,160
Is your name Ge Xiaohui?

523
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,240
Answer me, is your name Ge Xiaohui or not?

524
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,920
Yes.

525
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,039
What is this?

526
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,559
Tea leaves.

527
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,240
Tea leaves.

528
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
This is tea.

529
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,119
Your tea is a mixed blend.

530
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,319
What is this?

531
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,319
I'm asking you a question. Answer me.

532
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,839
I don't know. Someone gave it to me. I don't know.

533
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
Who gave it to you?

534
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:50,720
A lot of people have given me things.

535
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,799
I know who gave it to you.

536
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,920
You're not being honest, are you?

537
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,960
Search the room again.

538
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,920
Don't move.

539
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:07,680
Ziming

540
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
Brother Ming

541
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,160
How is it? How is it going?

542
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,200
We're making a breakthrough.

543
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,519
Let me tell you,

544
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,039
An Pinghai could call him at any moment.

545
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,319
To ask about the delivery situation.

546
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,279
If contact is lost, he might run.

547
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,440
Then it will be too late to catch him.

548
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,119
I understand.

549
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,680
You...

550
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
Every second counts.

551
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,039
You must get him to cooperate with your actions.

552
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,000
Otherwise, there's nothing we can do.

553
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,000
But you need to stay calm even if you're in a hurry.

554
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,480
Because these people are risking their lives.

555
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,960
If there's any sign of trouble,

556
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,519
we could alert them at any moment.

557
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,759
Over two years of our work would be wasted.

558
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,759
You need to be steady.

559
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,200
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

560
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,319
Contact me anytime if anything happens.

561
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,039
Understood.

562
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:50,799
Master

563
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,799
How much can this bag hold?

564
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,759
Fifty grams

565
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,759
You still have this kind of thing in your room?

566
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
Let's see if it's accurate.

567
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,039
Bro, this is a hotel.

568
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,839
How would I know whose it is?

569
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,480
Here, see for yourself.

570
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,000
How much is this?

571
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
Don't frame me, okay?

572
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,640
This isn't mine, I don't know.

573
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,799
It's okay.

574
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,519
Let's take a break.

575
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,240
Let's talk slowly, there's no rush.

576
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,240
Don't move.

577
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,519
They really know how to hide things.

578
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,319
That's a huge amount.

579
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,440
Come, let's weigh it.

580
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't move.

581
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,119
Turn your head. How much is this?

582
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,039
Anyway, the stuff is here. I admit it.

583
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,359
Go ahead and sentence me.

584
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
I don't know anything else.

585
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,200
Don't play games with us either.

586
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,880
I'll tell you the truth.

587
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
Right now, you have two options.

588
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,920
First,

589
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,039
Selling and possessing a huge amount of drugs.

590
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
One kilogram, plus what we just found.

591
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
You know what the outcome will be.

592
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,920
Two.

593
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
Losing so much product,

594
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,519
do you think your supplier will let you off?

595
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,640
Whether you live or die

596
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,920
depends on you.

597
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,240
At worst, I'll just die.

598
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,119
If you die,

599
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,480
what will happen to Fan Jingjing?

600
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,400
She often comes to you for goods, right?

601
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,759
Where does she live again?

602
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,720
Baoxing Garden

603
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,640
She... she doesn't know anything.

604
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,240
She's just a kid.

605
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,599
This has nothing to do with her.

606
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,359
At most, she just took a couple of puffs.

607
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:43,920
Really?

608
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,960
It's her, right?

609
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,599
See for yourself.

610
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,559
I told you, it has nothing to do with her.

611
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,559
It's not her business, do you understand?

612
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,400
It's not her business.

613
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,759
Whether she has anything to do with it or not

614
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,000
is not up to you.

615
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,400
I know you care about her.

616
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,160
If you really want what's best for her, I suggest you cooperate.

617
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:06,720
Try to make a contribution.

618
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,640
If I cooperate, can you...

619
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,119
Can you get her a lighter sentence?

620
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,920
Whether we can or not isn't up to us.

621
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,519
If you cooperate,

622
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,920
we'll submit a request.

623
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,519
We'll try to get you leniency.

624
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
Maybe you'll even get a chance to see her alive.

625
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,559
Can I trust you?

626
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,920
Her issue isn't serious.

627
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,599
I have no reason to lie to you.

628
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,160
An Pinghai gets the goods from Yangcheng.

629
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,559
At first,

630
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,680
he sold the goods for exactly what he paid for them.

631
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
He didn't make a single cent of profit.

632
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,319
That way, the goods moved quickly.

633
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,160
And the payments came in fast.

634
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,480
Everyone was willing to supply him.

635
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,920
Gradually,

636
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,119
he built up the market.

637
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,599
Later, he took on a big deal.

638
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,519
A really big one.

639
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,920
His supplier trusted him.

640
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,960
They even agreed to give him the goods before getting paid.

641
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
But after that deal,

642
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,359
he never paid again.

643
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,240
He started double-crossing people.

644
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,680
By doing this,

645
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,720
who would still supply him?

646
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,639
If he offended one supplier, he'd just switch to another.

647
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
An Pinghai,

648
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
he's pretty ruthless.

649
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,360
And very cruel.

650
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,639
That's how he monopolized the market.

651
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,239
Yes, I sell goods for An Pinghai.

652
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,239
But this matter

653
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,280
has nothing to do with Jingjing.

654
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,480
She doesn't know An Pinghai.

655
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,639
How do you usually contact An Pinghai?

656
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,639
He always calls me.

657
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,119
Sometimes it's from a public phone.

658
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,119
Sometimes from a cell phone.

659
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,880
He throws away the SIM card after one use.

660
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,679
I can't reach him either.

661
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,920
Xiaohui, you're doing the right thing.

662
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,679
Otherwise, if you wait for An Pinghai to call you,

663
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,840
and only confess then,

664
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
you'll be at a disadvantage.

665
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
If you slip up,

666
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,320
and he runs, you'll take all the blame.

667
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,880
Right?

668
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,960
After An Pinghai left the Yanghe Hotel,

669
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
where did he go?

670
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,440
He went to Bingcheng.

671
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,039
Someone there wanted goods.

672
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,880
Before he left,

673
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,440
he took a little from me for emergencies.

674
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,559
So he's going to Yangcheng to get more goods?

675
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,039
Yes, that's what he told me.

676
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,320
He said after delivering the goods, he'd head straight to Yangcheng.

677
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,039
How much is he getting this time?

678
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,719
I'm not sure about the exact amount.

679
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,239
But he said it's quite a lot.

680
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,480
Who are you delivering the tea to this time?

681
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,320
Huang Xin

682
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,639
Which Huang, which Xin?

683
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,920
Huang as in "yellow," Xin as in "new."

684
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,519
Tell me about Huang Xin.

685
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,360
I only know his name is Huang Xin.

686
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,719
An Pinghai arranged for me to deliver goods to him.

687
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,800
I met him once before.

688
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,559
Just once.

689
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,039
Was it for a delivery, or just to meet?

690
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:57,760
For a delivery.

691
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,039
Where does Huang Xin live?

692
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,159
I don't know.

693
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,440
I really don't know.

694
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
He doesn't ask me about things like that.

695
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,519
And I don't ask him either.

696
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,159
It's better if we don't know about each other.

697
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,360
Where should this batch be delivered?

698
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,280
Baishuanyu.

699
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,360
What time was the meeting set for?

700
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,119
Six o'clock.

701
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,000
Do you have a photo of An Pinghai?

702
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,280
No.

703
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,239
He... he doesn't take photos.

704
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,039
What about Huang Xin?

705
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,639
No photo of him either.

706
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,719
Then how will you recognize him when you arrive?

707
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,960
I've met him once before, haven't I?

708
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,360
Here.

709
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,039
An Pinghai could contact you at any time.

710
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
All you need to do is

711
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,039
do exactly as he says.

712
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,119
Make sure he doesn't get suspicious, understand?

713
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,880
Understood.

714
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
How much money do you still owe him for the goods?

715
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,000
Not much.

716
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,280
He took everything he could before he left.

717
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,199
All the goods are here now, right?

718
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,280
Yes, everything is here.

719
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,920
It should be.

720
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,599
Do you know how to say it?

721
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,360
Hello

722
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,400
Have you met with Huang Xin?

723
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,360
Did you give him the goods?

724
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,599
I haven't arrived yet, there's a traffic jam.

725
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,400
Hurry up.

726
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,760
Does he usually use a landline?

727
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,800
He sometimes uses a mobile phone too.

728
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,519
It's a public phone.

729
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,760
The number is from Yangcheng.

730
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,760
Xiao Wang, send a request for assistance to the local police.

731
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,599
Ask them to help with the investigation.

732
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,280
Maybe they can find some clues.

733
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,639
Yes.

734
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:50,679
Captain Huang.

735
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,039
Now we have to let Ge Xiaohui

736
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,559
deliver the goods to Huang Xin as An Pinghai instructed.

737
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,679
Otherwise, An Pinghai will realize

738
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,199
that we've arrested Ge Xiaohui.

739
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,800
How do we deliver it?

740
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:04,800
You go with him.

741
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,840
You’re not thinking of taking a drug dealer

742
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,280
across half the city to make the deal, are you?

743
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,559
That's too dangerous.

744
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,840
Right now, it's our only option.

745
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,719
Use Ge Xiaohui to lure Huang Xin out.

746
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,880
Then we take him down.

747
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
Make him cooperate with our investigation.

748
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,559
Otherwise, if An Pinghai calls Huang Xin,

749
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:20,519
everything will be exposed.

750
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,840
You're right.

751
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Let's do as you suggested.

752
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,079
But make sure to stay safe.

753
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,960
Here's what you'll do.

754
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,639
You lead a team and go ahead.

755
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,920
Xiao Feng, you take a team and a vehicle.

756
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,760
Xiao Xie, you take a team and a vehicle.

757
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,119
Follow behind and handle protection.

758
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,679
Be sure to stay safe.

759
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,159
Move out.

760
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,679
Yes.

761
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:44,360
Okay.

762
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,679
Don't forget to buy some MSG and replace this.

763
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,400
Yes.

764
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,480
Is there any?

765
00:38:59,199 --> 00:38:59,679
No, there isn't.

766
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,239
Is it there?

767
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,159
No.

768
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,199
Are you sure it's at the entrance?

769
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm sure.

770
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
Could it be because you were late?

771
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,559
He went in first.

772
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,519
No, we agreed on the place, so that's where it is.

773
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,360
How about I go down and take a look?

774
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,039
It should be.

775
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,199
You know how to say it, right?

776
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,079
I know.

777
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,400
Hello?

778
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,679
Where are you?

779
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,400
Hai, I’ve arrived.

780
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,519
Huang Xin didn’t come.

781
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,679
I just sent him to do something else.

782
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,599
Wait for my call.

783
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,400
Just wait.

784
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,199
Hello

785
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,079
Huang Xin is on Dalin Road

786
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,679
In front of Dafa Supermarket

787
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,440
Should I go over now?

788
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:31,079
Go now

789
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,159
Okay

790
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's go

791
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,639
Hello

792
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,719
Brother Hai, I've arrived.

793
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,920
We're not meeting at Dalin Road anymore.

794
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,679
Go to Zhanlan Road, hurry up.

795
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,760
After it's done, go back quickly to repackage.

796
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,519
Zhang Shengli is asking me for goods.

797
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,320
I'll tell you the address later.

798
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,159
Did he notice something unusual?

799
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,400
I don't think so.

800
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
He's just really suspicious by nature.

801
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,679
I didn't deliver to Huang Xin on time, remember?

802
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,039
He might be testing me because of that.

803
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,079
It makes him feel more secure.

804
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,119
He's like this with everyone.

805
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,079
Really.

806
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Write down the number.

807
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,239
It's no use remembering it.

808
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,880
I told you, he throws away the card after one use.

809
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,119
Captain Huang

810
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,679
What's the situation with this Zhang Shengli?

811
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,559
Regular customer, often gets goods from An Pinghai.

812
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,679
We have to catch both of them at the same time.

813
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
If we're even a minute late,

814
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,079
who knows what An Pinghai

815
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,480
might pull.

816
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,039
A van has already been sent to Zhanlan Road.

817
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,519
The license plate ends with 467.

818
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,280
Understood.

819
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:18,960
Let's go.

820
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,360
Huang Xin

821
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,679
Which one?

822
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,880
The one in the brown leather jacket.

823
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,360
Did you see clearly? Are you sure it's him?

824
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:49,320
I'm sure.

825
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,239
Gangzi just entered the bus station.

826
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,440
Wearing a brown leather jacket.

827
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,280
Took it off.
