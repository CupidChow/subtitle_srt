1
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,439
Tingting

2
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,879
Why are you waiting outside?

3
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,719
It's so cold.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,040
So you do know I'm cold.

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
Why did you miss dinner again?

6
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,359
I tried my best to make it.

7
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,480
Look, I'm sweating all over.

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,159
The food is all gone.

9
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,359
There's only some noodles left.

10
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,120
There's no sauce either.

11
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
No way, Mom wouldn't treat me like this.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,519
She knows I use up a lot of energy working on cases.

13
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,040
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

14
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,159
The case, the case—Is the case more important or am I?

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,439
Of course the case is more important.

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,560
Let's go.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,199
You—you're important.

18
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,240
You're the hardest case to handle. Hurry up!

19
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,840
Auntie

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,479
Mom

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,840
Come, come

22
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:22,719
Come

23
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,360
Dad, Liu Ziming, Liu Ziming

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,199
Hello, Uncle

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
You must be Xiao Liu, right? Come in, come in

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,879
Come on in

27
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,560
Change your shoes

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,680
Um

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Sorry about last time

30
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,879
I had something I couldn't get away from, so I was late

31
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,879
It's good to be busy when you're young

32
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,919
Being busy leads to success

33
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,159
Perfect timing, the food is ready

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,120
Sit down and eat together

35
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,199
Come, come, come

36
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,360
Pass me the noodles

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
Give it to me, give it to me, pass me the noodles

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,520
Go pour some water

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Why do you want to run away every time you see your mom?

40
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,199
Where are you running off to?

41
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,759
Come over here

42
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,639
Come, come, Ziming, have a seat

43
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,840
Sit here, you sit here

44
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,439
Slow down

45
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,360
Have some water, have some water

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,120
It's delicious

47
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,400
Have another bowl

48
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,199
Old Fang

49
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,360
Here, let me get you another bowl

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,639
You've already had two bowls

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
We have to make sure Xiao Liu eats enough

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,840
Can you still eat more?

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,879
It's really not easy doing your job.

55
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,800
From now on, no matter how late it is, come eat if you're hungry.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,599
Alright.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,439
Here, Xiao Liu.

58
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,520
Thank you, Uncle.

59
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,800
Thank you, Auntie.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,319
Why are you still calling us Uncle and Auntie?

61
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,840
Shouldn't you change what you call us now?

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,319
So soon?

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Xiao Liu,

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,400
I heard from Tingting,

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,439
that you two want to get married.

66
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,080
Yes.

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
What does your family think?

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,800
Have you discussed it?

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,439
We have.

70
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,400
They have no objections.

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
It's all settled.

72
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
Tingting gets along really well with my sister.

73
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,800
His sister is a really good person.

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,879
She's also very nice to me.

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,199
I heard from Tingting that your mother passed away early.

76
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,360
So after you get married in the future,

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,960
how will you two live?

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,120
Will you live with your dad?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,199
My mom passed away early.

80
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,400
And my dad doesn't really take care of me.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,840
So I plan to move out and live with Tingting.

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
Actually, I think

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,720
look,

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,519
you and Tingting are both still young.

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,680
Shouldn't you communicate more?

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
And get to know each other better?

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
You’re young people, after all.

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
Career should come first, after all.

89
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,839
You think you’re capable,

90
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,319
so you want to show off, right?

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,319
Being a police officer is actually pretty good.

92
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,560
A government employee.

93
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,240
A stable job with official status.

94
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,399
But for you two,

95
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,600
it would be great if you could get an apartment assigned.

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,360
Uncle, Auntie,

97
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,240
Our group missed out on the housing allocation.

98
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,720
Right now, I can't afford to buy a house either.

99
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,519
So I can only rent for now.

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,519
If you mind,

101
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,560
we can wait a bit longer.

102
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,439
No need to wait.

103
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,399
Don't we have an apartment in Xinyuan?

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,759
We can just live there.

105
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,079
Come on, Xiao Liu.

106
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,040
Here, add some more sauce.

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,519
Eat this bowl of noodles while it's hot.

108
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,160
Alright, alright.

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,399
Otherwise, it'll get cold soon.

110
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,120
Okay.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,959
Eat up.

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,639
Thank you, Auntie.

113
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,519
Thank you, Uncle.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll head out now.

115
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll walk you out.

116
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,319
Come visit when you have time.

117
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,160
Goodbye, Uncle and Auntie.

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,680
Why are you glaring at me?

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
What do you mean by that?

120
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,199
What do you mean, "what do I mean"?

121
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,160
I didn't say anything.

122
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Do you really need to worry about this?

123
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,639
Is it even your place to disagree?

124
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,120
This is the first time meeting.

125
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,439
Do you even know him?

126
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,000
And you agreed so easily.

127
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,839
He's a detective.

128
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,120
In a couple of years, he could be promoted to chief.

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,879
Then your daughter would be the chief's wife. What do you know?

130
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
There are plenty of people working as police officers.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,199
How many actually become chief?

132
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,519
The job is definitely busy.

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,959
In the future, he won't have time for the family.

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,800
Our daughter will be the one to suffer.

135
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,000
Is your dad upset with me?

136
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,519
No.

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
He's just worried about me.

138
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,879
That's why he said those things.

139
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,319
Your dad's concerns aren't wrong.

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,120
It's mainly my fault for being so useless.

141
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
That's not true at all.

142
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,959
I'm leaving then.

143
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,519
I'm really leaving.

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,560
Hurry up and go.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
Bye.

146
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,519
Good night.

147
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,959
Good night.

148
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,519
Hurry upstairs.

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,560
You haven't even started working at the city bureau yet,

150
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
and you're already talking like an official.

151
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:02,759
Already putting on airs.

152
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,120
Don't try that with me.

153
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
Now you're even speaking Mandarin to me.

154
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,399
That's no fun, Captain Huang.

155
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,360
Who's no fun? You're the one who's no fun.

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,439
Let me tell you,

157
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,360
if you don't give me a name,

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,959
I'll stay here with you all day if I have to.

159
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,279
The two of us can chat here for two hours.

160
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,920
How should I put it, Captain Huang...

161
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,319
Like you always say,

162
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,240
they were all trained by you.

163
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,160
Who doesn't know that?

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
That's just how things are.

165
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,160
Ziming, that kid,

166
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,480
he's definitely capable.

167
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,040
Very strong, and has a lot of potential.

168
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,279
But right now,

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,439
he's just inexperienced.

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
Still a greenhorn, a bit too raw.

171
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,439
As for Cao Lei, he's good in every aspect.

172
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,959
That's the honest truth.

173
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,000
Of course, he does his own work very well.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,759
But Chengcheng has Down syndrome,

175
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,079
and could have a medical episode at any time.

176
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,800
We can't ignore that.

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,160
Right?

178
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,279
That's pretty much what I was thinking too.

179
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
So there's no one else.

180
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,399
We'll have to let Liu Yang fill in for now.

181
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,639
They're all your people, you decide, boss.

182
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,160
It looks like the three of you

183
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
have all mastered the Wubi input method.

184
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,519
Come on, let me give you a spot check.

185
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,639
Come in, come in, quickly.

186
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,879
Come here and listen confidently.

187
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,600
Master.

188
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,600
Master, these are the latest cases.

189
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Please take a look first.

190
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,240
Ziming,

191
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,960
Of all of you, I have the highest hopes for you.

192
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,279
But I'm also most worried about you.

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,519
Liu Yang overthinks things.

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
Cao Lei doesn't think enough.

195
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,279
And you, kid, are always so stubborn.

196
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,279
Remember this.

197
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,559
As criminal police,

198
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
cases are our life.

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,799
But in life,

200
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
there can't be only cases.

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,919
Understand?

202
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
I understand.

203
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,480
You don't really understand yet.

204
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,919
It's okay, you'll get it with time.

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,879
Master,

206
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,360
Tingting and I are about to get our marriage certificate.

207
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,279
Yes, I know.

208
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,080
When we have a child,

209
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,279
can we still call you Master?

210
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,480
Don't say that.

211
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,759
Stop always dragging me into your messes.

212
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,120
Alright, go on home.

213
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,399
Let me walk you inside.

214
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,879
No need, I'm fine.

215
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Hurry and go home.

216
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Take it slow, Master.

217
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,840
So what did Wei say?

218
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,159
I don't believe it.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,759
He definitely said you’re not good enough for me.

220
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,600
Tingting.

221
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,159
My dad's here.

222
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,039
Let's talk later.

223
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,639
What's up, Dad? Is something wrong?

224
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,360
It's nothing.

225
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,279
Tingting

226
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,600
This

227
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,120
What is it?

228
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,360
Open it and see

229
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,679
The apartment we have in Xinyuan

230
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,120
I went over and tidied it up

231
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a bit small

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
But it's nice and clean

233
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,960
You two can make do, it's enough

234
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,120
The furniture, bed, and appliances

235
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,159
are basically all there

236
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Just need to buy a new fridge later

237
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
If you two want to

238
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,799
renovate it in the future

239
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,440
then you can discuss it together

240
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,240
Dad

241
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
Weren't you not in a hurry for me to get married?

242
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,639
Does it matter if I'm in a hurry?

243
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,639
Nothing is more important than my daughter's happiness

244
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,919
Your mom agrees too

245
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,320
This apartment

246
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,919
will be your dowry

247
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,039
Dad

248
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,519
Dad, why are you so good to me?

249
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,919
You're such a big girl now

250
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,600
But the name on the property deed can't be changed

251
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
It won't change, it won't change

252
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,039
It'll still be in your name

253
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,480
It won't change, it won't change

254
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,120
Thank you, Dad

255
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,720
Marriage is even harder than a case.

256
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,120
Hang in there.

257
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,200
Mom

258
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,399
I've brought her here for you.

259
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
Her name is Fang Tingting.

260
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,080
If there's anything you're not satisfied with,

261
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
just tell her directly.

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Speak nicely.

263
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
Isn't she speaking just fine?

264
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,480
Mom, everything's fine.

265
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
Don't worry.

266
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,519
The two of them will get their marriage certificate in a couple of days.

267
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,559
Take this.

268
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,559
Sis, what is this?

269
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,559
I can't accept this.

270
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,320
Why can't you accept it?

271
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,720
This is for you to renovate your house.

272
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,159
But renovating a house costs so much, and he's so poor.

273
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
Really, I don't want it.

274
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,759
I really don't want it.

275
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,360
What do you mean you don't want it? Say something.

276
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,559
Just take it. My sister has money, it's fine.

277
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,159
Exactly.

278
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,559
Let me tell you, all the dirty and tiring renovation work—

279
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,559
Let him do all the running around, got it?

280
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you, sis.

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Make sure you don't get too tired.

282
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,039
Let's go.

283
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,039
Come on, let's go.

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
You take it.

285
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,960
It's for you.

286
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Take it, I don't need the money anyway.

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,840
It's for you.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,840
Still eating?

289
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,360
Qiangzi, sis.

290
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,159
Let's go.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,879
The two of us still have things to do.

292
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,759
You go ahead.

293
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,960
You two are going to eat again?

294
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,559
Take me with you.

295
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm going shopping with sis.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,759
When you have time, buy the paint.

297
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,559
Okay.

298
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:06,759
Let's go, sis.

299
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,840
We're leaving, Qiangzi.

300
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Come on, give it a try.

301
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
This doesn't fit anymore either.

302
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,679
Look at how broad her shoulders are.

303
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,720
It's our daughter's graduation ceremony.

304
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,840
Can't you make her look a bit better for her?

305
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,879
Just take it to the clothing store downstairs to have it altered.

306
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,840
Our daughter earned her reputation on her own.

307
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,960
What I wear doesn't affect her reputation.

308
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
Look at these sleeves.

309
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:08,919
Alright.

310
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,919
Then I'll go and alter the shoulders and sleeves a bit more.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,440
Okay.

312
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Where are you going?

313
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,039
Isn't today your day off?

314
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,840
Don't you love to eat

315
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,879
those fennel buns from Dongyuan's place?

316
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll go buy some for you.

317
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,360
Which brand has the best value for money?

318
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
This one.

319
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,919
This one?

320
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,600
Yes.

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,639
Hello?

322
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,639
Something happened to Lao Ma at the Dongli morning market.

323
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,399
Hurry over here.

324
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,519
I'm coming right away.

325
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,200
This one, this one.

326
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Deliver it to mine.

327
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,240
The address I just gave you.

328
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,120
Okay, boss.

329
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,799
Sir, could you please drive a bit faster?

330
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,799
That person ran away right after committing the murder.

331
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,120
Brother Lei

332
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:19,879
Excuse me

333
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't move

334
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,120
Where's Old Ma?

335
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,519
Where is he?

336
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,440
He was taken away.

337
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,080
To the hospital.

338
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,360
All departments will cooperate with your operation.

339
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,759
Don't miss a single blind spot.

340
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,799
Your station needs to comfort the family members.

341
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
Let me know if you have any difficulties.

342
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,399
He's really gone.

343
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,399
Three stab wounds.

344
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
He didn't make it at the scene.

345
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,799
The family has arrived.

346
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,880
This is Mr. Ma's wife, Teacher Zhang.

347
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,480
This is—

348
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,880
Teacher Zhang.

349
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,519
How is he now?

350
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
Tell me the truth.

351
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,519
My condolences.

352
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,559
It happened quite suddenly.

353
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,680
The doctor said—

354
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,279
He didn't suffer much.

355
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,720
Can I see him?

356
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,279
Teacher Zhang

357
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Comrade Ma Guoqiang has been, since the founding of our bureau,

358
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,279
in order to maintain social order and stability,

359
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,200
the thirteenth comrade to sacrifice his life.

360
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,680
Thank you for your hard work.

361
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,440
I'll go back and make arrangements for his funeral.

362
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,359
Make the most of our time and solve the case as soon as possible.

363
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,839
We owe the family an explanation.

364
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,240
Yes.

365
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,799
According to eyewitnesses at the scene,

366
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,079
the suspect was hit on the head while fleeing.

367
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,759
Blood samples have been collected at the scene.

368
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,960
Compare them with the database.

369
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,279
See if there's any criminal record.

370
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,319
Send a notice to the hospitals as well.

371
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,279
Check if anyone has sought medical treatment.

372
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,720
His head was split open.

373
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,079
Normally, he wouldn't be able to handle it himself.

374
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,200
Get the sketch artist here as soon as possible.

375
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,799
See if, based on everyone's descriptions,

376
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,240
he can draw a rough sketch.

377
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,720
Yes.

378
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,440
Also,

379
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,480
stay in close contact with headquarters.

380
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,319
Maintain close communication.

381
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,720
If there's any new information,

382
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,319
report it immediately.

383
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,039
Understood.

384
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,039
Captain Huang,

385
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,519
any leads?

386
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,039
We've checked all the vehicles from that time period.

387
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,200
No one with a head injury was seen on the bus.

388
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
There were many bicycles parked near the bus stop.

389
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
We thought maybe he escaped by bike.

390
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,519
There's a surveillance camera nearby.

391
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,359
We're about to check with the traffic police.

392
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,319
Just checking with the traffic police isn't enough.

393
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,240
We need to check both the traffic police and the bus stop.

394
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,440
I'll go to the traffic police.

395
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,440
The two of us will go to the bus stop.

396
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,559
Guess how much money was in that wallet.

397
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,799
How much?

398
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,839
Forty-seven yuan and sixty cents.

399
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
All for forty-seven yuan and sixty cents.

400
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
They stabbed Old Ma to death.

401
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
Old Ma died unjustly.

402
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
Follow the direction of the blood trail.

403
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,720
At the bus stop two kilometers from the crime scene

404
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,720
it stopped.

405
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm not going to the morning market area.

406
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,359
If you don't go, who will?

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,400
A while ago, a few thieves showed up around here.

408
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,880
Do you know who did it?

409
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
Who?

410
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,559
Just these few people.

411
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
Probably a lot of people have seen him.

412
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,400
That's him.

413
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,880
May I ask you something?

414
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,039
Have you seen this person?

415
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,039
Really haven't seen him.

416
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,759
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

417
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,519
No, no.

418
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,839
Hello, could you please take a look and see if you've seen this person?

419
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:54,640
Hello.

420
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,599
Please show your ID and driver's license.

421
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,960
I don't think I've seen him.

422
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,799
Tall and thin.

423
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,920
Looks quite energetic.

424
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,279
Haven't seen him.

425
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,000
Thank you.

426
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,480
Haven't seen him.

427
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,200
I've seen him.

428
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,559
He came alone.

429
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,640
When did he come?

430
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,119
He got into a fight and hurt his head.

431
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,440
I gave him emergency treatment and bandaged it up.

432
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,559
You bandaged him?

433
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,720
This is a barbershop—do you even know how to bandage wounds?

434
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,720
I was worried he might get tetanus.

435
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,119
I just wanted to do a good deed, so I bandaged him.

436
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,440
Why did he come here?

437
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,559
Do you know each other?

438
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,319
No, I don't.

439
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,759
You don't know him, so why did you help him?

440
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,440
He paid me a lot.

441
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
So you helped him just because he paid you more?

442
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,640
Be careful next time, be careful.

443
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,640
Did the bandaging leave anything behind?

444
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,160
Here, look, it's all contaminated.

445
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,160
How did he leave?

446
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,960
He left alone, riding a bicycle.

447
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,000
Where does he live?

448
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,559
I really don't know about that.

449
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,440
Where did he go?

450
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know that either.

451
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,000
He dared to bandage himself here.

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,559
That means this area is his safe zone.

453
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,720
He must live nearby.

454
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,720
Sooner or later, he'll have to go out.

455
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I'll go call for backup.

456
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,279
Use this shop as the center.

457
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,799
Mark out the area and visit each house.

458
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,799
Sir, do you recognize this person?

459
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,480
Haven't seen him.

460
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,240
No, I haven't.

461
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Thank you.

462
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,960
Thank you, thank you.

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,279
It's nothing, thank you.

464
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,079
Sir, do you know this person?

465
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,000
Hello, have you seen this person?

466
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,079
No, I haven't.

467
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,720
Please take another look, he looks quite sharp.

468
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,480
Hello, have you seen this person?

469
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,960
Hello, have you seen this person?

470
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,720
Please take a good look.

471
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,880
Ziming.

472
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,799
What's wrong? It's nothing.

473
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,680
Brother Lei.

474
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,079
Master.

475
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,359
Doctor, how is he?

476
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,519
Acute gastric ulcer.

477
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,519
If you had come any later, it might have perforated.

478
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
His eating habits must be really irregular.

479
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,640
Is it serious?

480
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,079
He must be hospitalized for IV treatment and cooperate with us.

481
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,640
He needs to rest for a while.

482
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,279
Otherwise, his health will really collapse.

483
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,319
Go handle the admission procedures.

484
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,319
Thank you, doctor.

485
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you, you've worked hard.

486
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
Hello, hello.

487
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,759
Please take a look. Have you seen this person before?

488
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,440
I don't know.

489
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,240
Hello.

490
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,079
Please take a look. Have you seen this person before?

491
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,160
I haven't seen him.

492
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:09,880
I have.

493
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,680
He came here this morning to eat steamed buns.

494
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,480
Did he have gauze wrapped around his head?

495
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,240
Yes.

496
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
He also had white gauze wrapped around, and there was blood.

497
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,799
This morning?

498
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,880
Around five or six o'clock.

499
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,960
When he was eating here,

500
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
did he say anything?

501
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,640
He didn't say much.

502
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,920
What could he say while just eating?

503
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,160
Think carefully.

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,039
Did he make a phone call?

505
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,359
He did.

506
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,119
He seemed to say he was going back to his hometown.

507
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,839
Do you know where he lives?

508
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
I think I saw him coming out from the entrance of this alley.

509
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,759
He walked out from there.

510
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,079
Alright, thank you.

511
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,359
What did he eat at that time?

512
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,759
When he came,

513
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,039
we only had pork and cabbage ones.

514
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,559
He ordered a basket of pork and cabbage buns.

515
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,480
Okay, thank you.

516
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,599
Why are you asking about the bun filling?

517
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
My mentor once said,

518
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,920
if the suspect commits suicide

519
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,960
or has an accident,

520
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,839
the contents of the stomach can serve as evidence.

521
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,279
What should we do?

522
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
We wait and watch.

523
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,920
The two of us don't have enough manpower.

524
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll notify Captain Huang.

525
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,640
Da Liu, Chaozi

526
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,640
Keep a close watch for me.

527
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,799
Don't doze off.

528
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,200
Got it.

529
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,160
Where are you going?

530
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,519
I'm going to check it out.

531
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,319
Wait for him to come out.

532
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,000
Wait until when?

533
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,240
Wait until he comes out.

534
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,079
If you mess around,

535
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,640
I'll fire you right now.

536
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
These are all shared apartments here.

537
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,359
If you startle him, he might hurt someone else.

538
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,480
Target spotted. Target spotted.

539
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
It's ready, get prepared.

540
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,839
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

541
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,160
What are you doing?

542
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,799
What's your name? Don't move!

543
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,680
What are you doing?

544
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,640
Speak! What's your name?

545
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:50,559
A knife!

546
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,400
Pull him up!

547
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,720
Get up! Get up! Get up!

548
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,920
Are you Zhou Xiaocheng?

549
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,400
You've got the wrong person.

550
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,000
Team, fall back.

551
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,759
Take him away. Move.

552
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
What's your name?

553
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,599
Zhou Xiaocheng.

554
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:11,920
Age?

555
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,079
Nineteen.

556
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:13,839
Place of origin?

557
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,400
Mengcheng.

558
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,759
Why did you steal?

559
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,039
I've been here for over half a year.

560
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,079
It was hard to find a job.

561
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,079
I worked as an apprentice in the kitchen.

562
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,200
But the boss ran away unexpectedly.

563
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,960
The restaurant was shut down.

564
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,640
I... I really ran out of money.

565
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,640
If you had no money, why were you carrying a knife?

566
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,000
Were you ready to stab someone at any time?

567
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,160
I didn't mean to stab him.

568
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,039
I just wanted to run.

569
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,359
Boss, how much is this?

570
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,079
Four yuan.

571
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,880
Boss, how much is this cabbage?

572
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,440
What are you doing?

573
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,279
What?

574
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,119
Whose stuff is this?

575
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,160
It's mine.

576
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:48,839
Don't move.

577
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,559
I didn't steal it.

578
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,200
That's my wallet.

579
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,599
Come with me to the police station to make a statement.

580
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,240
I thought I saw a police badge on him.

581
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,960
I got scared.

582
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,039
Let's go, to the police station.

583
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,279
Catch the thief

584
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,240
I stabbed him

585
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:11,839
Hello

586
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,640
Understood.

587
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,119
Everyone, take a look.

588
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,799
This is from 1983,

589
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,519
a tragic case that happened in Mengcheng.

590
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,039
The couple ran a leather goods business.

591
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,000
They were found hacked to death in their home.

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,759
What's more important is,

593
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,200
their eight-year-old only son was also severely injured.

594
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,440
The key issue was that, due to limited technology at the time,

595
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,759
the suspect's identity could never be determined.

596
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,039
So the investigation couldn't move forward.

597
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,000
As you all know,

598
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
every team has a case that haunts them.

599
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,039
This case is the one that haunts their team.

600
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Whenever a new member joins, the first file they review

601
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,920
is the one you have in your hands.

602
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,920
This time, with Zhou Xiaocheng,

603
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,799
the DNA

604
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,759
test report just came out,

605
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,640
and there has been a major breakthrough in the case.

606
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,319
After a careful comparison by our forensics team,

607
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,359
in Zhou Xiaocheng's

608
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,880
DNA chromosomes,

609
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,119
they found a match with the DNA

610
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,599
extracted from the evidence of this murder case.

611
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,319
There is a familial relationship.

612
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,319
So Liu Yang, you and Ziming,

613
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,240
hurry to Mengcheng.

614
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,960
Take Zhou Xiaocheng's

615
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
DNA sample and deliver it to them.

616
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,519
Assist them with the investigation.

617
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,119
Got it.

618
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,839
I had just joined the police force back then.

619
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,200
I remember it very clearly.

620
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,400
It was September 30th that day.

621
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,079
The weather was especially stuffy.

622
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,680
It was so stifling, I could hardly breathe.

623
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,839
In the evening,

624
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
after days of holding back, the heavy rain

625
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,319
finally poured down.

626
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,240
Help!

627
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,200
Usually, the child

628
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,680
would have dinner at a classmate's house.

629
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,519
Help!

630
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,480
It was pouring that day.

631
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,640
The parents came home early.

632
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,279
So they picked up the child on the way.

633
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,839
Help!

634
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,839
The child was walking behind them with an umbrella.

635
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,839
As soon as they entered the yard, the child found the parents had been slashed.

636
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,200
Terrified, the child turned and ran away, shouting.

637
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,839
But was caught at the gate.

638
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,799
And was stabbed several times.

639
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,359
The two attackers ran away.

640
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,119
Luckily, a neighbor rushed the child to the hospital in time.

641
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,039
There's been a murder!

642
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,319
That's how the child barely survived. There's been a murder!

643
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,279
There's been a murder.

644
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,200
There's been a murder.

645
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,359
Was it revenge or for money?

646
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't know.

647
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
The child is too young.

648
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Can't explain clearly.

649
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,359
Based on the child's and neighbors' descriptions,

650
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,400
and the footprints in the room,

651
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,440
there were probably two perpetrators.

652
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,000
But where did they come from?

653
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,319
Where did they go?

654
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,559
And why did they do it?

655
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,960
We have no clues at all.

656
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,440
Back then, we only had fingerprint collection technology.

657
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,160
But that required manual comparison, one by one.

658
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,920
The efficiency was...

659
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,079
Was that blood sample from the scene?

660
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,759
Yes.

661
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,039
Just one drop.

662
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,640
A drip stain.

663
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,640
At the doorway.

664
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
It just happened to avoid the rain.

665
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,839
Just this one drop of blood.

666
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,599
Its blood type was different from all the victims.

667
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,720
But at that time, there was no

668
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,839
DNA technology.

669
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,079
So what's the situation now?

670
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
We've already taken

671
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,839
blood samples from three of Zhou Xiaocheng's male immediate relatives

672
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,759
for testing.

673
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,319
The comparison is underway.

674
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,200
We could have the results as early as tomorrow morning.

675
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,920
Come have some water. Thank you.

676
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,400
I just made it.

677
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,039
Thank you.

678
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,759
Hello

679
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Master, I've found out the truth.

680
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,920
It's Zhou Xiaocheng's father, Zhou Bingsheng.

681
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,599
Let's go.

682
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,599
Master

683
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,240
Your back hasn't fully recovered yet, you shouldn't go.

684
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,759
Are you kidding? Let's go.

685
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,079
Where are you going?

686
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,640
Stop! Don't move.

687
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,440
Don't move.

688
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,640
Hands.

689
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:33,920
That's him.

690
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,599
What's your name?

691
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,880
Zhou Bingsheng.

692
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,240
Do you know why we're looking for you?

693
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,599
I know.

694
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,880
For murder.

695
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,079
When did you kill?

696
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,160
In 1983.

697
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,079
Let's go.

698
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,720
Speak.

699
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,400
Why did you kill?

700
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,880
For money.

701
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,240
If it was for money, why didn't you just rob someone?

702
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,599
Back then, I was supposed to take over my father's job.

703
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,599
I was supposed to work at the factory.

704
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,160
But someone else took my spot.

705
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,279
I felt wronged and frustrated.

706
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,559
So I started gambling.

707
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,960
I had bad luck and lost all my money.

708
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,559
I had no other options.

709
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,640
What was your relationship with the two victims?

710
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,400
No relationship.

711
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,839
They just used my car twice.

712
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,279
For prostitution.

713
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
Why did you target them?

714
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:44,720
Because they had money.

715
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,720
Go on.

716
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,160
There was another person involved. Who was it?

717
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,559
My fellow townsman, Fei Yong.

718
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,359
How did you meet?

719
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
We met playing cards.

720
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,880
Where is he?

721
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,599
He died of cancer two years ago.

722
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,319
Have you been in contact with your son Zhou Xiaocheng recently?

723
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
No contact.

724
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,960
He's studying out of town.

725
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,280
Don't tell him about this.

726
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,800
Don't let it interfere with his studies.

727
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,960
The other suspect, Fei Yong, has already been identified.

728
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,679
He did pass away from lung cancer the year before last.

729
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,159
But this time, it's all thanks to you.

730
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,800
If we hadn't caught Zhou Xiaocheng,

731
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,920
who knows when this case would have been solved.

732
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,119
Don't mention it.

733
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,519
We didn't really do much to help.

734
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,280
The blood samples you kept from the suspects

735
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,360
were the key to solving the case.

736
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,679
Now that this case is closed,

737
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,960
my mentor can finally let go of this burden.

738
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Uncle Tao,

739
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,360
you're getting on in years too.

740
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,960
I guess you're the victim's child. Take care of yourself.

741
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,639
Me too, I'm especially grateful to you.

742
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,000
We finally caught them.

743
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,119
But honestly, I wish even more

744
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,719
they had never come to my home,

745
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,320
and never killed my parents.

746
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,159
Moment of silence

747
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
Moment of silence is over.

748
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,880
First bow

749
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Second bow

750
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,559
Three bows

751
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,079
Salute

752
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,519
You're back.

753
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,079
Didn't I say I wanted beige walls?

754
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,920
What color is this?

755
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,119
This is way too different.

756
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,079
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,559
I bought the wrong one.

758
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
What's wrong?

759
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,519
It's nothing, it's nothing. This color looks nice too.

760
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:40,800
Tingting

761
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,639
Let's break up.

762
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,360
No, we won't.

763
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,800
I know what you're afraid of.

764
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,760
Then I won't break up with you either.

765
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,599
Liu Ziming, remember this.

766
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,159
You will belong to me, Fang Tingting, for your whole life.

767
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,760
Even if you die,

768
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,960
you'll still be mine, Fang Tingting's.

769
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Wait a moment.

770
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,920
I heard you're getting your marriage certificate.

771
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,719
You probably won't come back after that, right?

772
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,679
Yes.

773
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,760
Come.

774
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,840
Take a look at how it's written.

775
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,159
Do you know them?

776
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Your calligraphy is really good.

777
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,320
I'll have it framed later.

778
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,079
I'll give it to you as a wedding gift.

779
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,519
I appreciate your kindness.

780
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,920
You should keep it for yourself.

781
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,719
Frame it and hang it by your bedside.

782
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,800
Here's your key back.

783
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,920
This is way too far.

784
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,960
Mom, you just don't get it.

785
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,960
The ones nearby can't be real hot springs.

786
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,360
They're all just filled with hot water.

787
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,559
So can you guarantee

788
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,199
that the place you're taking us to is a real hot spring?

789
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,480
It's definitely real.

790
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,840
I went there last time for a case.

791
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,039
There are dozens of pools.

792
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,519
All kinds, big and small.

793
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,679
They even have fish therapy.

794
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:11,920
Fish therapy?

795
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,679
It's a kind of small fish.

796
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,280
They live specifically in hot springs.

797
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,320
They swim around and nibble on your feet.

798
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,719
They say they eat the dead skin on your feet.

799
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,280
That sounds gross.

800
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,679
It's not gross, it's actually really fun.

801
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,039
You'll know once you try it.

802
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,239
I can give it a try.

803
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,280
Just don't leave me halfway through soaking and trying it.

804
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,920
And then you leave.

805
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,280
Yeah, you leave halfway.

806
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,960
What if the little fish don't get enough to eat?

807
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,559
That's impossible.

808
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,519
I took three days off from the team.

809
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,320
We'll soak for three days.

810
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,039
Try out every single pool.

811
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,239
Won't our skin be all peeled off by then?

812
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,480
Three days?

813
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,559
Won't all that dead skin make the fish burst?

814
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Don't answer it.

815
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,320
Let me see what it's about.

816
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,000
Hello?

817
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,599
We're going to the hot springs, on the way now.

818
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,320
What's up?

819
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,519
Driver, stop the car. Stop.

820
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,519
I need to go back to the team.

821
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,519
I knew it.

822
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,239
Then get out of the car.

823
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,280
I know it takes you over half an hour to get there.

824
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,159
And that's with you being the closest one.

825
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,559
They can't even get a cab over there.

826
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,960
I'll treat you to a meal later, okay?

827
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,239
Alright, two meals.

828
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,679
You pick the place.

829
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,960
Alright, alright.

830
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,519
Hurry up and get going.

831
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll cover the gas.

832
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,760
But whatever you do, don't run any red lights.

833
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,679
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

834
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,280
Bro, just get over there quickly.

835
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,760
The weather forecast says it's going to rain soon.

836
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,920
And they're not dressed warmly.

837
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,920
Alright, alright, I'm on it, okay?

838
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
Driver, could you please go a bit faster?

839
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,000
Okay.

840
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,800
Yang, what's the situation exactly?

841
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,519
A nine-year-old child has been kidnapped.

842
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,159
The family got a call from the kidnapper at five o'clock.

843
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,159
But they didn't call the police until nine thirty.

844
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,760
Why did they wait so long?

845
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,639
Who knows? The victim's name is Li Jia.

846
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:36,559
She's a businesswoman.

847
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,880
She's the boss of Datong Building.

848
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,800
They said they were afraid to call the police or something.

849
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,039
Her husband couldn't make up his mind.

850
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,440
Then I don't know if they argued or what.

851
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,199
But they ended up calling the police.

852
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:43,960
What time is the exchange?

853
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,960
Eleven o'clock. That's fifty-two minutes from now.

854
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,280
How much are they asking for?

855
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,880
Eight thousand.

856
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,480
Sounds like a wealthy family.

857
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,679
Why are they only asking for eight thousand?

858
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,400
Some people treat 110 like a counseling hotline.

859
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,599
It's not like we haven't seen this before.

860
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,760
Let's go check it out first.
