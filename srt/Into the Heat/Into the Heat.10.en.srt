1
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,519
He was supposed to be on duty yesterday.

2
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,439
Shift change was at six.

3
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,719
It was almost time.

4
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,400
He called and said he had something to do.

5
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,159
I found someone to cover for him at the last minute.

6
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,319
Did he say what it was about?

7
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,319
No, he didn't.

8
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,920
Do you have a copy of his ID?

9
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,439
You hired him without even having his ID?

10
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,359
No, that's not it, man.

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,039
You can't blame me for this.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,840
He said he lost his ID and is getting a new one.

13
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,080
I got so busy that I forgot about it.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,879
I already asked.

15
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,520
His name is Yang Jian, "Jian" as in "inspect."

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,080
Right, I also have his...

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
...handwritten home address.

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,879
I'll find it for you.

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,759
Hurry, find it.

20
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,639
Here it is, bro.

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,520
How much do you pay him per month?

22
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,919
I pay him eighteen hundred.

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,639
But I also heard

24
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,000
they secretly sell some stuff here.

25
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,639
Cigarettes, drinks, instant noodles.

26
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,639
Just to make some pocket money.

27
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,639
I know all about that.

28
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,759
I can't be bothered to deal with him.

29
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,639
As long as he keeps the accounts straight for me,

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm fine with whatever.

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,120
Who is he usually close with?

32
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,680
That I don't know.

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,639
Is there anyone who comes to see him often?

34
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,639
He has a little girlfriend.

35
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,120
I heard she's still in school.

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,639
Sometimes she comes here to use the internet.

37
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,800
The two of them play games together.

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,639
What's her name?

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,639
I saw her just a couple of days ago.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,919
Her name is Tang... Tang something.

41
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,960
Let me check for you, bro.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,520
I'll look for you.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,039
I'll look for you.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Tang, Tang Jian Yong.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,759
Do you know Yang Jian?

46
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah, I know him.

47
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,639
Was he killed by someone?

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,159
How do you know he was killed?

49
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,719
Everyone in our guild knows.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,639
They even sent out a notice.

51
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,639
What guild?

52
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,840
The gaming guild.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,400
We all publicly mourned him.

54
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,240
But that woman didn't even say a word.

55
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,639
Wait, which woman?

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Tang Jianyong.

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,120
Her online name is Princess Xiangxiang.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,039
Her.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
And Yang Jian was so good to her.

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,000
He helped her level up and clear maps every day.

61
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,840
He was really blind.

62
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,319
Are you friends with Yang Jian?

63
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,919
Not exactly.

64
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,240
Anyway, he was really impressive in the group.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,319
We all admired him.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
I even reached out to him before.

67
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,919
Asked him to help me out.

68
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,000
But he ignored me because of that woman.

69
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,639
Do you know this Princess Xiangxiang?

70
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,520
Yeah, I know her.

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,719
Everyone in the group knows her.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
She has two boyfriends.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
One is Yang Jian.

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
The other one spends money on her.

75
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,919
I guess,

76
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,360
it was that man who killed him.

77
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,759
Then who is this man?

78
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,680
Do you know him?

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
His name is Luo Bo.

80
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,719
He owns a building materials store.

81
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,919
Which "Luo"? Which "Bo"?

82
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,159
The "Luo" from the surname Luo.

83
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,400
The "Bo" from "waves."

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,199
What are you here for?

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you here for?

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,720
Hello.

87
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,959
Um, is this place closed down?

88
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,639
Has it been transferred?

89
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,639
No, it's not closed, just taking a break for a couple of days.

90
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,879
So it's just closed for these two days, right? Yes, that's right.

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,839
We also want to rent a place nearby.

92
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,639
So we wanted to take a look.

93
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,040
If they're transferring, we want to rent it.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,439
Are your two units the same layout?

95
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,360
They're about the same size.

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,439
Can we take a look?

97
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,240
Sure, come on.

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,720
Thank you.

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,480
No problem.

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,319
No one lives here, right?

101
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,000
No one lives in mine, but someone lives in theirs.

102
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,680
They've always lived there.

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
Yeah, I saw that someone lives there.

104
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
Right, they've always been living inside.

105
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,639
They've always lived here?

106
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,480
Yes, yes, yes.

107
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,639
This way, you can save some money.

108
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
When was the last time you saw him come back?

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,399
I haven't seen him these past couple of days anyway.

110
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
He hasn't opened the door these past two days either.

111
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,639
Are you two close?

112
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,079
We're just neighbors who do business.

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,040
Did you know Yang Jian was killed?

114
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,759
Yeah, I know.

115
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,519
Aren't you scared?

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
Scared of what?

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
It's not like I killed him.

118
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,199
He had it coming.

119
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,199
Why did he have it coming?

120
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,160
No, that's not it—

121
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:35,959
Ziming.

122
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,560
Ask a bit slower.

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,759
I can't keep up.

124
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,560
Let me do it.

125
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,879
Alright.

126
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,839
How did you meet Yang Jian?

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,120
We met last year while playing games.

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,920
He was really good in the game.

129
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
If he didn't like someone, he'd just attack them.

130
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,040
He also had a nice voice.

131
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,680
He sounded pretty cool.

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
But when I saw him, I didn't feel anything.

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,040
Later on,

134
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,040
he kept calling me.

135
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,959
He even helped me level up in the game.

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,839
I thought he was pretty good to me.

137
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,439
So we got together.

138
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,279
So how did you meet Luo Bo?

139
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,120
Tell us.

140
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,319
What's going on?

141
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,439
How do you guys know everything?

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,480
Just answer what we ask.

143
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
How did you meet?

144
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,639
We met at a mixer.

145
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,920
He pursued me.

146
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,879
He was pretty good to me too.

147
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,319
It's a genuine kind of kindness.

148
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
What do you mean by "genuine" kindness?

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Give me money to spend.

150
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,680
Someone saw you go to Yang Jian's house last week.

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,279
You even went to the internet cafe to look for him.

152
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,040
Is that true?

153
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,079
Yes.

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
Why did you go to see him?

155
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,199
Luo Bo is nice to me, that's true.

156
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,920
But we just can't have a good conversation.

157
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,720
Yang Jian doesn't even log into his own account every day.

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
He just helps me keep my account online.

159
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,360
So I was a little touched.

160
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,720
You were really touched?

161
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
If you were really touched, why did you say he deserved to die?

162
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,759
You even went to Yang Jian's house the day before the incident.

163
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,839
Can you really say his death has nothing to do with you?

164
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,279
It really has nothing to do with me.

165
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,279
If that's true, then why did you go to his house?

166
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,720
I went to ask him for money.

167
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,959
What money?

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,279
I'm asking you, what money do you want?

169
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,480
Why do you want money?

170
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Money for medical treatment.

171
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,000
Are you satisfied now?

172
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,279
What illness are you talking about?

173
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,800
You tell me, what illness?

174
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,480
Why are you asking him for money for your treatment?

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,639
He infected me.

176
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,079
If I don't ask him, who else should I ask?

177
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,600
Has Luo Bo contacted you recently?

178
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
No.

179
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,480
I've called him several times.

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,759
He didn't answer.

181
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,199
You don't really think it was Luo Bo who did it, do you?

182
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,279
Call him right now.

183
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,680
No way.

184
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,279
The two of them got along pretty well.

185
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,600
Like brothers.

186
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,439
Then who do you think is most likely?

187
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,560
Who knows what kind of shady people he got involved with.

188
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
I can't get through.

189
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,879
Maybe I should just leave the phone with you.

190
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,199
Luo Bo is now a key suspect.

191
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,360
No matter how he contacts you,

192
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,279
you must inform the police immediately.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,839
Come, handle the necessary procedures with me.

195
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,879
Don't break my phone.

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,360
Remember to return it to me when you're done.

197
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,879
Sorry

198
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,840
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,399
Please try again later

200
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,919
What do you think of Luo Bo?

201
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
He's a pretty good guy.

202
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,399
He can endure hardship and is loyal.

203
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
But about his girlfriend...

204
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,320
We don't think she's that great.

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,399
What's his girlfriend's name?

206
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,159
Her name is Tang Jianyong.

207
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,720
She's quite tall.

208
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,039
We often see her playing games.

209
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,519
She doesn't really help him with anything.

210
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,639
He said all the money he's earned these past years has been spent on her.

211
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,159
If Luo Bo contacts you,

212
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,879
please remember to let us know.

213
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,320
Okay.

214
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Can I have your phone number?

215
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,399
Stop messing with it. It's been broken for a long time.

216
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,320
Why can't this one be fixed?

217
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Hey, are you asleep?

218
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,080
Hello?

219
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,320
Where is Tang Jian Yong?

220
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,039
Who are you? She's taking a shower.

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
I'm answering for her.

222
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,759
Who are you?

223
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,960
Who are you?

224
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,919
I'm her boyfriend.

225
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,159
I'm her boyfriend.

226
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,879
Let her answer the phone.

227
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,480
She's taking a shower. Are you deaf?

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,320
I already told you.

229
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,519
Who are you?

230
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Why is she showering?

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Who are you, really?

232
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,559
Where are you two?

233
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,399
I'm at her place. What's up?

234
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,519
Fine, fine.

235
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,080
Just you wait.

236
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,799
I'll wait for you. I'm not scared.

237
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,679
Backup will arrive in twenty minutes.

238
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,960
Let's head out first.

239
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,159
Slow down, slow down.

240
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,559
I told you to drink less.

241
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

242
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,919
Are you okay?

243
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm fine.

244
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,440
What are you doing?

245
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,440
Police, what's going on?

246
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,919
Don't move.

247
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,440
Who are you people?

248
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,879
What's your name? What's your name?

249
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,639
Who are you?

250
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,679
Police, what's your name?

251
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
Speak. Don't move.

252
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,360
Luo, Luo Bo.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,639
That noon, I had a bit to drink.

254
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,720
The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,320
I support her, and he just plays around.

256
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,720
Normally, we even call each other brothers.

257
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,320
Then in the afternoon,

258
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
I bought some alcohol and food.

259
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
And took it to their place.

260
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,480
I wanted to have a talk with him.

261
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,559
Brother, I came here today

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
to talk to you.

263
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Whatever happened before,

264
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,879
I'll just let it go.

265
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,320
But from now on,

266
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,000
stay away from our Tang Jian Yong.

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,639
Then he said something that really pissed me off.

268
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,799
What did he say?

269
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,639
You think she really likes you?

270
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,279
She likes your money.

271
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,320
Look at you, how old are you already?

272
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,080
What do you have to compare with me?

273
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
And you still want to negotiate with me?

274
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Are you even qualified?

275
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,120
I hit him a few times and then he stopped moving.

276
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,480
Besides hitting him with a dumbbell,

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,679
what else did you do?

278
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,960
Right, there was also a network cable.

279
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,159
I used that cable to strangle him.

280
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,399
You've already smashed it.

281
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,480
Why bother strangling him?

282
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,480
To vent my anger.

283
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,360
That day, I just

284
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,960
dragged him over from there and threw him over there.

285
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,399
Let's go.

286
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,799
Where exactly is it?

287
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,600
I can't really remember, it was pretty dark that day.

288
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
I was pretty confused, I just can't recall.

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,879
It's somewhere around here.

290
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,799
Take him away.

291
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,559
Let's go.

292
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,639
Brother Lei

293
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,559
Morning

294
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,360
Take it easy

295
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I missed a lot of calls

296
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,720
Alright

297
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,360
If there's nothing else, you can go

298
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,559
How are you handling Yang Jian's stuff?

299
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,960
We'll follow legal procedures

300
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,159
As for his things

301
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm actually not interested

302
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,240
It's just that

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,279
Can I have his game account?

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Never mind if not

305
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
Tell me,

306
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,600
why hasn't he been promoted yet?

307
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,720
Doesn't he get promoted every two years?

308
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,159
Who told you that nonsense?

309
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,840
What do you mean, every two years?

310
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:50,919
You have to take an exam for that.

311
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,919
Then let him take the exam.

312
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Don't move around.

313
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,919
You're getting it on your neck.

314
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,159
Have you decided where to go for your honeymoon?

315
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,360
Yes, we have.

316
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,759
The Three Nans.

317
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,559
What does that mean?

318
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,639
Yunnan, Hunan, Hainan.

319
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,200
No way.

320
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,759
Why is nothing ever okay with you?

321
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
Hurry up and change it for me.

322
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,799
It can't be changed.

323
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,480
So many problems right after getting married.

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,559
It's bad luck.

325
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,840
Whose terrible idea was this?

326
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
It was my terrible idea.

327
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,919
Everything's already set. I want to go.

328
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
What are you doing? You can't just change it like that.

329
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,720
I didn't object when you were dating, right?

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,720
I didn't object when you wanted a simple wedding, right?

331
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,840
No, you didn't.

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
Then listen to me carefully.

333
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,000
Find somewhere nearby.

334
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,639
Just go somewhere close for a couple of days.

335
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,360
Did you hear me?

336
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,600
Mom, I—

337
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,399
I heard you, I heard you. Okay, okay.

338
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:44,919
Do it.

339
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,759
Brother Lei

340
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,679
It's done, take a look.

341
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,559
I always feel like this case was solved too easily.

342
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
Something doesn't feel right.

343
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Fingerprints, shoe prints,

344
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,279
the bloody clothes, the statements—all match up.

345
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
What else could be wrong?

346
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,559
Aren't there still two fingerprints?

347
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,480
On the network cable and the dumbbell.

348
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,759
They don't belong to Luo Bo or Prosecutor Yang, right?

349
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,879
Maybe someone else touched them before.

350
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,399
The dumbbell—

351
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,279
Maybe a neighbor played with it when they visited before.

352
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,840
Someone must have touched the network cable when installing the broadband.

353
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,159
I don't think there's any problem.

354
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,279
Anyway, just hand it over to Captain Huang for me.

355
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,559
If he has any objections, we can talk about it then.

356
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm going on vacation tomorrow.

357
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,879
Going on my honeymoon.

358
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,879
Tingting got mad at me the last two times.

359
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
I have to go this time.

360
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm off, then.

361
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,359
My brother-in-law's taste could really use some improvement.

362
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,759
Let's just make do and listen to it.

363
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
How about the two of us

364
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,319
have a child?

365
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,559
Why? Do you want to be a dad now?

366
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,359
Giving birth is really painful.

367
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,680
But you wouldn't be the one giving birth.

368
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,640
With a child, we'd have a complete family.

369
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,319
He would cry, laugh, and call us mom and dad.

370
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,240
He could keep you company when I'm not home.

371
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,559
What's the point of just having a child for company?

372
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,799
You knew before we got married

373
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,079
that my job

374
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,720
means I wouldn't have much time to be with you.

375
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,119
I know.

376
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
I just didn't think it would be this little.

377
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,359
Tingting.

378
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,519
I promise I'll spend more time with you from now on.

379
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,160
Okay.

380
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
We'll see how you do.

381
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,240
This is so nice.

382
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,440
I wish it could always be like this.

383
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:56,839
Ziming

384
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,599
Brother Lei

385
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,039
Prosecutor Yang's case

386
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,839
Captain Huang sent it back

387
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,519
Why?

388
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,240
It's about the other two fingerprints

389
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,279
Captain Huang doesn't accept it

390
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,200
Testimony and identification

391
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,240
On-site evidence chain

392
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,279
I've said everything I should

393
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,519
So what did he say?

394
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,920
He said no

395
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,519
Further investigation is needed

396
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,400
How about you...

397
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,240
Come back in the next couple of days

398
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,039
Alright, I'll go back tomorrow

399
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,519
Okay, got it

400
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:21,920
Got it

401
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,839
It's fine, I'm not leaving today

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
I'll go back tomorrow

403
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
Either the two of us now

404
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,839
The footprints and fingerprints at the scene match Luo Bo.

405
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
The bloodstained clothes found at his residence

406
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,960
The test results are consistent with Prosecutor Yang's findings.

407
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,519
And Luo Bo's confession

408
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,359
matches the situation at the scene exactly.

409
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,799
I don't see any problem.

410
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,519
This is a crime of passion caused by a relationship dispute

411
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,160
that led to a murder in the heat of the moment.

412
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,359
What about the fingerprints?

413
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,119
On this dumbbell, we found

414
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,119
another person's fingerprints. Whose are they?

415
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,000
No.

416
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,519
Whoever it is, it doesn't affect the outcome of the case.

417
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,640
One doesn't affect it.

418
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
But what if there are two?

419
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,359
The examination report states it so clearly.

420
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,200
Did you read it?

421
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,440
The Chinese characters aren't clear.

422
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,759
Is that important?

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,119
Isn't it important?

424
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,839
Keep investigating.

425
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,960
Also,

426
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,960
the victim's date of birth

427
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,960
doesn't match the records in the household registration office.

428
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,839
Tomorrow, go to his hometown

429
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,160
and get this matter clarified for me.

430
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,440
Also, review the victim's social connections.

431
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,359
Hurry up and go.

432
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,640
Let's go.

433
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,960
This is Prosecutor Yang's uncle, Yang Liansheng.

434
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,319
Uncle, are you feeding the chickens?

435
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,519
They're from the Haiming City Public Security Bureau.

436
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,119
They've come to ask you some questions.

437
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,039
Police.

438
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,960
I was wrong. I confess.

439
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,720
I killed my nephew.

440
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,599
I didn't mean to do it.

441
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,160
Yang Jian is my only nephew.

442
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,039
A few years ago, he came to Haiming City.

443
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,119
He had no one to rely on.

444
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,039
So he came to stay with me.

445
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,920
He didn't have much money when he arrived.

446
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,440
Whenever he ran out of money, he would borrow from me.

447
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,440
He's my nephew, after all.

448
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,960
So I lent it to him.

449
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,160
Eventually, he found a job.

450
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,839
Then he moved out.

451
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,920
He earns more than I do now.

452
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,319
I went to ask him to pay me back.

453
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,000
But he never paid me back.

454
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,480
He even thinks I'm just an old nuisance.

455
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,799
He says I'm always asking him for money.

456
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,480
The truth is, he does have money.

457
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,319
He just won't pay me back.

458
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,200
He's just being unreasonable.

459
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,599
Got into a fight with someone.

460
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,839
Why are you here?

461
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,599
How did you end up like this?

462
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,039
Do you want money again?

463
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,519
Yes.

464
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,680
Your sister got into college.

465
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,480
She needs tuition money. I don't have any.

466
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
I told you, I don't have any money.

467
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,400
Get lost, now.

468
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,880
I'm really annoyed.

469
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,079
Hurry, go, go, go.

470
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,759
Your sister got into college.

471
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
We're short on tuition.

472
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,119
I've given you so much money, give me some back.

473
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
Do you want money?

474
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,599
Is it money you want?

475
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,880
You beat me up like this.

476
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
And you still want money?

477
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,000
You should be giving me money instead.

478
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,200
I hit you.

479
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,000
I just came in, and I hit you?

480
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:41,880
What nonsense.

481
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,400
If you didn't hit me, then who did?

482
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,599
Hurry up and cover my medical expenses.

483
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,119
Now I have to pay your medical expenses?

484
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,880
Hurry up.

485
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,920
How can you be so ungrateful?

486
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,799
I gave you so much money before.

487
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,759
Now I ask you for a little money,

488
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:54,480
Tell me, right now,

489
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,079
if I call the police,

490
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,359
do you think they'll believe you or me?

491
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Hurry up and pay my medical expenses.

492
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,519
It doesn't matter who they believe.

493
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,160
Someone, come here!

494
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,160
What did I do? Don't accuse me falsely.

495
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,720
You're so ungrateful.

496
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,000
You're so ungrateful.

497
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
You're ungrateful.

498
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,400
So, combining the autopsy report

499
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,359
with the suspect's statement, we can confirm

500
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,319
that two people attacked Yang Jian that night.

501
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
Luo Bo thought he had killed Yang Jian

502
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,079
and dumped the body in the wasteland behind the house.

503
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,359
What he didn't expect was

504
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,720
that Yang Jian was actually still alive.

505
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,359
He later regained consciousness.

506
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,559
The methods and tools used by both

507
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,440
were basically the same.

508
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,279
The times of the crimes were also very close.

509
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,680
Next, regarding the fingerprint issue,

510
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,599
let Xiao Qin from the technical department explain it to everyone.

511
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,559
From the dumbbell and net at the scene,

512
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,000
some fingerprints were collected.

513
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,799
After repeated comparisons by the technical department,

514
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
they were found to belong to Yang Jian's uncle, Yang Liansheng.

515
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,079
Combined with the forensic identification results,

516
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,759
this fully confirms the process.

517
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,160
The one who ultimately caused Yang Jian's death

518
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,400
was Yang Liansheng.

519
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,279
Come in.

520
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,960
Captain Huang.

521
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,759
I see.

522
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,880
You two, from this

523
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,440
investigation method

524
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,279
to professional ability,

525
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,279
and most importantly, your work attitude,

526
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
need to seriously reflect on yourselves.

527
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,920
Write a thorough self-criticism.

528
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,400
Why?

529
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,839
What's wrong with my work attitude?

530
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,359
You don't know, do you?

531
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:52,720
Then let me tell you.

532
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,480
Is assault the same as murder?

533
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,119
It clearly wasn't a homicide.

534
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,599
Yet you insist it was a homicide.

535
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,319
Do you know what that's called?

536
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
That's called serious dereliction of duty.

537
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,839
Dereliction of duty?

538
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,839
Captain Huang.

539
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,559
Luo Bo had a motive.

540
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,039
He had the intent to kill.

541
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,119
He also took action.

542
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
He admitted it too.

543
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,319
Who knows what happened after that?

544
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,680
You can blame me for this too?

545
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,079
Then who do you think should be blamed?

546
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,079
Blame me, blame him.

547
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,960
We can't blame the victim, can we?

548
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,359
If it's your case, who else should be blamed but you?

549
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,839
If we had closed the case earlier like you said,

550
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,839
and sent it to the prosecutor's office,

551
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,960
this would be a classic case of wrongful conviction.

552
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,359
You'd be facing a sentence yourself.

553
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,799
Ziming, stop arguing.

554
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,599
There were indeed flaws in our handling of the case.

555
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
You're leaving anyway, so you don't care.

556
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,480
What's your attitude?

557
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,279
Captain Huang.

558
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,680
If you say I'm not competent at work, I accept that.

559
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,200
If you say I'm not thorough in handling cases, I accept that too.

560
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,799
You can say whatever you want.

561
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
I work hard every day.

562
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,720
But in the end, you say I'm negligent.

563
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,839
If you put it that way, are you happy with it?

564
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,799
What is it?

565
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,960
You think you're the only one working hard, huh?

566
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,079
Look around.

567
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,720
Everyone out there is working hard.

568
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm not going to waste words with you.

569
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,000
Let me just ask you one thing.

570
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,359
Are you going to write this self-criticism or not?

571
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,079
No, I won't.

572
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,079
You say I have a problem with my work attitude.

573
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:31,880
I don't accept that.

574
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,480
Fine.

575
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,559
You don't have to accept it.

576
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
Alright, I accept it, okay?

577
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
The way you look right now

578
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,880
is no longer suitable for continuing to work.

579
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,119
Starting today

580
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,799
go home on leave and wait for further notice.

581
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,480
Captain Huang

582
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,400
Leave.

583
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,319
When did you find out I was leaving?

584
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,000
No.

585
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,079
What do you mean, a farewell party?

586
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
It's not that serious.

587
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,440
It's a farewell for the two of us.

588
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:29,759
The three of us.

589
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm switching to a desk job.

590
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,640
Come on.

591
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,279
Lei.

592
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,400
I just don't get it.

593
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,759
Why are you doing this?

594
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,079
One day, I had a dream.

595
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,559
I dreamed I was in the sky.

596
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,839
I saw my son.

597
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,000
From the day my son was born,

598
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,079
I knew this day would come.

599
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,400
I knew it, yes,

600
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,720
but I still couldn't accept it.

601
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
The day my son passed away,

602
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,200
at the hospital,

603
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,440
my daughter-in-law was in the hallway,

604
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,160
crying.

605
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Then family and friends gathered around her, comforting her.

606
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:30,880
I

607
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,519
just stood by and watched.

608
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
I didn't dare take a single step forward.

609
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,839
I felt like I wasn't part of this family.

610
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,599
I owe both of them, mother and daughter.

611
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,480
Then you should have at least told us in advance.

612
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,480
I didn't dare to say anything.

613
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,480
If I had told you, you definitely would have tried to talk me out of it.

614
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,480
And if you tried to persuade me—

615
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,839
I can't bear to leave.

616
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:25,920
Alright.

617
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Don't talk about these sad things.

618
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:29,920
From now on,

619
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,440
if you want to eat or drink anything,

620
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,640
just come here.

621
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,359
I've taken over this place.

622
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:45,759
We'll tidy up and open for business next month.

623
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,440
Come on.

624
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,559
Sister

625
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,559
Sister

626
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,799
What's wrong?

627
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,319
The doctor said it's a cerebral infarction.

628
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,599
They're trying to save him inside.

629
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,039
How could he suddenly have a stroke?

630
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,920
He said he felt chest tightness when he woke up this morning.

631
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,640
He was feeling a bit unwell.

632
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
By noon, he was feeling cold all over.

633
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,640
Then he suddenly fainted.

634
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,839
Isn't it your fault?

635
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,319
Blame me? What did I do?

636
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,720
As soon as he heard you were forced to take leave by your boss,

637
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,160
he hasn't slept well for a week.

638
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,799
He must be happy about that, right?

639
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,480
Look at the situation we're in.

640
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,680
And you're still joking around.

641
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,559
Are you even human?

642
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,920
Why is he even worrying about this?

643
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,200
My taking leave doesn't affect his sleep.

644
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,720
Were you actually fired or not?

645
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,279
Can you even keep this job anymore?

646
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
How would I know right now?

647
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,279
Doctor, how is it?

648
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,519
The surgery went very well.

649
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,319
We'll transfer to the intensive care unit first.

650
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,079
We'll observe for a few days.

651
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,039
Once the condition stabilizes, we'll move to a regular ward.

652
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:21,720
Okay, okay, take it slow.

653
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,480
Thank you, thank you.

654
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,200
Be careful.

655
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,640
Let me do it.

656
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,759
What do you mean, you'll do it?

657
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,319
Can you afford it?

658
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,200
It's tens of thousands.

659
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,319
It's that expensive?

660
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,759
Then you do it.

661
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,519
Stop making me worry so much.

662
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,319
Go focus on your work.

663
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,119
Go to work if you should be working.

664
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:39,880
Did you hear me?

665
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,319
It's not up to me, either.

666
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,480
We have to listen to the boss.

667
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,960
So what are you planning to do?

668
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,480
Just sleep at home all day?

669
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,559
How about this: when Dad gets a bit better,

670
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,160
I'll ask my brother-in-law to lend me a car.

671
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,480
I'll drive an unlicensed cab.

672
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,119
Are you kidding me?

673
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,319
I'm not kidding.

674
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:00,039
I think you're really bored out of your mind right now.

675
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:18,559
How are you doing?

676
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,519
You're recovering well.

677
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,440
You've been moved to a regular ward.

678
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,519
Okay, let them take you.

679
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,599
Alright, thank you, thank you.

680
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Why are you here?

681
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
I'm here to take care of you.

682
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
You don't need to take care of me so much.

683
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,119
I can still live for another two years.

684
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,039
Stop talking so much.

685
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,440
You have to at least tell me why you called me here.

686
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,319
It's a good thing.

687
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,079
What good thing could it be?

688
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,319
You'll know when you get there.

689
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,119
Come on, come on.

690
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,240
Um...

691
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,079
This is the person I told you about.

692
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,000
My brother-in-law. Hello.

693
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,799
Liu Ziming.

694
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,359
Help him with the onboarding procedures.

695
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,559
He used to be a detective.

696
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
The contract is all ready.

697
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,720
Please take a look.

698
00:33:59,839 --> 00:33:59,880
Wait, what contract am I signing?

699
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,319
Wait, what contract am I signing?

700
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,559
From now on,

701
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,359
you're my personal assistant.

702
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,000
In this company, you're second only to me.

703
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,920
What does a personal assistant even do?

704
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,719
You...

705
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,239
With our resources, we can do anything.

706
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,159
Don't you think so?

707
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,519
If you're willing,

708
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,760
help me drive for now.

709
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,880
At least eight thousand a month.

710
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,239
And don't think that's too little.

711
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,559
There are also bonuses.

712
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,719
I'm fine with driving.

713
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Then just sign it.

714
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
It has to go through the accounts.

715
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,360
No, no, the contract isn't urgent.

716
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,239
You can try it out for a while first.

717
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,000
That works too.

718
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,880
What are you doing?

719
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,760
The keys.

720
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,920
Where are you going?

721
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm going to get familiar with the car first.

722
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,800
So I don't end up crashing it later.

723
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,599
You...

724
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,920
Alright, alright, let's go.

725
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,880
Okay, Mr. Li.

726
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Call Xiao Yueyue over for me.

727
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,599
Okay, Mr. Li.

728
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,519
Close the door.

729
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,519
Sir,

730
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:56,679
I want to take my dog to the crematorium for cremation.

731
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,840
Could you please give me a ride, sir?

732
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,199
A dead dog? No, no, no.

733
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,920
I won't dirty your car.

734
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:01,639
No, no.

735
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm begging you, sir, I'm begging you.

736
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,000
Please give me a ride, I'm begging you, sir.

737
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:19,199
Miss, do you have an urgent matter?

738
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,360
Driver,

739
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,360
I want to take my dog to the crematorium for cremation.

740
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,480
Is it okay if I hold it while getting in your car?

741
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,159
It's fine, it's fine.

742
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,239
Get in, I'll take you there.

743
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,159
Thank you, driver.

744
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,719
Sorry for the trouble, thank you, driver.

745
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,760
Xiao Yueyue

746
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,239
Xiao Yueyue

747
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:51,440
Hey, hurry up and help me call a car.

748
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:52,760
Boss

749
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,840
Didn't you ask Brother Ming to be your driver?

750
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,920
He's not my driver.

751
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,079
That's my dad.

752
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,719
Hello, hello, hello

753
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,880
Brother Liu, Brother Liu, I—

754
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,079
I'm almost there, just two more traffic lights.

755
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,679
Alright, see you in a bit.

756
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,599
Right away, right away.

757
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,079
Thank you.

758
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,280
Was it sick?

759
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:20,760
No.

760
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,440
It was just too old.

761
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,320
It couldn't eat and couldn't stand anymore.

762
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,519
It even developed bedsores.

763
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,599
The doctor said

764
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,480
if it kept going, it would just suffer more.

765
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,039
So I had it put to sleep.

766
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:37,400
How old was it?

767
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,039
Fourteen years old.

768
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,480
That's over a hundred in human years.

769
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,039
It's considered a happy passing.

770
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,440
Miss

771
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,519
If you're feeling upset, just let yourself cry.

772
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,880
Don't hold it in.

773
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
Here, have some water.

774
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,840
Thank you.

775
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,199
From now on,

776
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,119
don't just drink water without checking.

777
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,239
And don't get in as soon as the door opens.

778
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
If you take a ride with a stranger,

779
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,679
you should write down the license plate number.

780
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,639
Send it to your friends or family as a precaution.

781
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,440
Otherwise,

782
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,000
you could easily run into danger.

783
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,119
Why do you sound so much like a police officer?

784
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,280
I think so too.

785
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,239
Sir,

786
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,079
do you think there's reincarnation in this world?

787
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,280
I hope it can be my dog again in the next life.

788
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,440
It's hard to say.

789
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,039
I hope so too.

790
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,639
If it really exists,

791
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,440
All these bad people

792
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,239
should be treated like animals.

793
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
Only good people deserve to be called human.

794
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,639
If that's the case,

795
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,000
there would be no more crime in the future.

796
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,400
And there would be no need for police.

797
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,400
Are bad deeds really only done by bad people?

798
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,400
Is it here?

799
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,400
Yes, yes.

800
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,400
Excuse me, sir.

801
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,960
How much is it? I'll pay you.

802
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,760
No need, no need.

803
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,840
You really thought I was an unlicensed driver.

804
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,360
I was just out for a drive because I had nothing to do.

805
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,880
I should thank you for keeping me company.

806
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,679
Thank you, sir.

807
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,039
Sorry to trouble you.

808
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,159
I've been searching for a long time.

809
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,239
Thank you.

810
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,760
Don't act silly all day, understand?

811
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,440
You're already an adult.

812
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,559
No problem, big bro.

813
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,280
I'll leave everything about those two to you from now on.

814
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,679
Okay.

815
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,639
Don't worry, big brother.

816
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,159
Leave it to me.

817
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,239
Big Brother Dali

818
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,079
What do you mean? Weren't you suspended?

819
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,639
Did you get the photo?

820
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,239
I got it.

821
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,079
Check it quickly.

822
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,440
Is that person Sun Haixing?

823
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:57,800
Yes. Where are you?

824
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,960
Are you sure?

825
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm sure.

826
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm at Qian Ferry in Ancheng.

827
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,360
Notify the local police right away.
