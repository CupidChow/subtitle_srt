1
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,599
Hey, bring the goods over here.

2
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,519
The boss is here.

3
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,159
Coming.

4
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,959
Coming.

5
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,280
How many years have you been doing this?

6
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,159
Not many years.

7
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,840
Coming, coming.

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,120
Boss, this is the boss.

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,799
Hello, hello, hello.

10
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,560
Just put it here for now.

11
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,719
Put it here, right?

12
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,920
This place is pretty big.

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
Go, go get it.

14
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,319
What are you doing?

15
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,040
Don't move.

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,959
I've called the police.

17
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,680
Don't move! What are you doing?

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,359
We are just... we are just...

19
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,840
We're from the Haiming City Criminal Police.

20
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,120
Where did you get all this stuff?

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,000
You know exactly where it came from, don't you?

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,560
If you cooperate with us,

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,159
this won't be a big deal.

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
You'll have a chance to make up for your mistakes.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,960
But if you don't cooperate,

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,199
this will become a serious matter.

27
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,199
Do you understand?

28
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,000
I understand.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Will you cooperate?

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,439
I will cooperate.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,439
Alright.

32
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,199
We need to stay here for a couple of days.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,599
Please bear with us.

34
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,360
Take him inside.

35
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,400
Let's go, we'll talk inside.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,840
We'll talk inside.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Hey, take it easy, man.

38
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm not cooperating.

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
Why would I run? This is my home.

40
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,879
That's unnecessary, unnecessary, unnecessary.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,759
Where's your room?

42
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,479
It's... this way.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,439
Tingting.

44
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,879
Can you come back now?

45
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,039
I'm in the middle of an arrest.

46
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,199
I'm just asking if you can come back now.

47
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,400
Alright, alright, I'll come back, I'll come back.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,759
Don't be mad.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,960
I'll be back right away.

50
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,719
Don't scare me.

51
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,000
It doesn't say that here.

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,680
Are you sure it's cancer?

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
What did the doctor say?

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Could it be a misdiagnosis?

55
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,159
The doctor said

56
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:17,840
The doctor said

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,319
They'll only know if it's malignant after surgery.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,919
If it's malignant, then it's definitely cancer.

59
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,879
My grandma died of lung cancer.

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,360
My chances are high.

61
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,960
No, no, don't be afraid. Don't be scared.

62
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,560
They haven't confirmed it yet.

63
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
We'll treat it.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,199
We'll do whatever it takes to get you treated.

65
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,199
If we have to, we'll sell the house, okay?

66
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,680
Okay? How is that okay?

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,879
That's cancer.

68
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,080
No matter how much money you spend, you can't cure it, do you understand?

69
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,000
But they haven't confirmed it yet.

70
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,719
Don't scare yourself.

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't worry, even if I have to give you my lung,

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,319
I'll make sure you live.

73
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,280
Our son can live without a dad,

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
but not without a mom. Don't cry.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,879
Don't say that. We can't lose anyone.

76
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:08,919
Don't cry.

77
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,919
Stop crying now.

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,840
It's okay.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,080
Ziming, I'm scared.

80
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,879
I'm scared.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,680
I can't get off the operating table.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
I'll definitely stay with you during the surgery.

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
I won't do anything else.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll definitely stay with you.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,959
Don't be afraid.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,800
Everything will be fine.

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's have the patient do a preoperative checkup in the next couple of days.

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,600
If the checkup results are good,

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
I'll arrange the surgery as soon as possible.

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,720
What if the results aren't good?

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,399
We'll give you IV fluids for a few days in the hospital to help you recover.

92
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,800
Then I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

93
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
Are you really not going to tell your parents?

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,959
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

95
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,160
It's not a big deal.

96
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,160
Eat when you should, sleep when you should.

97
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,199
Don't worry.

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,759
I'm full.

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Eat a little more.

100
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,639
Have a bite.

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,279
If you don't want to eat, get some sleep.

102
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,959
Cover yourself with the blanket, or you'll catch a cold.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,639
Go ahead.

104
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,600
Don't move yet.

105
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait for me to come over.

106
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,519
Go ahead and do your work, I'm fine.

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,199
I'm not going anywhere today.

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm just staying with you.

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
Let me tell you a story.

110
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,439
Okay.

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Or maybe I should tell you about a case instead.

112
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,920
Then I won't listen.

113
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,800
Let me read you a piece from the newspaper.

114
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,319
To help you sleep.

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,959
Let's go with this section.

116
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,519
Life will be better tomorrow.

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
Social development.

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,680
Go ahead and take care of your things.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,639
I'm fine.

120
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Are you really okay?

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,959
Then I'll head over for a bit.

122
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,399
I'll be back as soon as I can.

123
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,199
Call me if anything comes up.

124
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,040
Okay.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Go to sleep.

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Alright, 160 jin.

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,879
180.

128
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,160
Watch closely.

129
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,360
180, 180 jin.

130
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,560
Do you have change?

131
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,720
I only have sixty.

132
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,639
Let's just leave it at that.

133
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,600
It's such a big deal, why worry about a few bucks?

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
May wealth flow in from all directions.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,199
Alright, alright.

136
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,000
That's enough.

137
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
Goodbye, okay, okay.

138
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,839
It's not easy being different.

139
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,639
What are you doing?

140
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,879
Lost money, definitely lost money.

141
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,160
Is this scale accurate or not?

142
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,040
It's accurate.

143
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,160
Absolutely.

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,480
Look.

145
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,160
That can't be right, I weigh 120.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,879
You've lost weight.

147
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,839
Have I lost weight?

148
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,639
Lost twenty jin, was it you who lost weight?

149
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,240
No.

150
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,159
It wasn't you who lost weight, right?

151
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,320
Um...

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,679
Is there something wrong with your scale?

153
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
Don't tell anyone about this.

154
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,159
When you sell something,

155
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,799
even if it's just scrap,

156
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,440
do you shortchange people too?

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,720
Don't you have any morals?

158
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
Keep this a secret for me.

159
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,960
What secret do you want me to keep?

160
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,480
I'm telling you about this.

161
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,240
We'll talk about it later.

162
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,759
I'll remember this.

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
You'd better behave yourself.

164
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,559
Two meat dishes and one vegetable, not bad food.

165
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,039
No way, I'm going to work for you from now on.

166
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,080
What?

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,639
What do you mean, "no way, work for me"?

168
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,519
You think it's that easy?

169
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,799
In our line of work,

170
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,320
on a large scale, it's called global recycling of renewable resources.

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,519
On a small scale, it's just riding a tricycle.

172
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,000
Our job of collecting scrap

173
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,240
is much better than those regular jobs

174
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
way better, in fact.

175
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,879
If I had to choose my favorite thing to do,

176
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,440
it would be collecting scrap.

177
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,000
What's wrong with people these days?

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Still not good enough.

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
And you want to work for me?

180
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,200
You think it's that simple?

181
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,200
Go on.

182
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,399
Keep going.

183
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm done talking.

184
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,240
Did you forget who you are?

185
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,039
Eat some more.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Eat.

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,519
Master.

188
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,559
Call him Brother Liu.

189
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,480
Brother Liu.

190
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,399
Brother Liu.

191
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,639
Three nines, right?

192
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,639
Three nines with a five.

193
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,519
Three nines, three nines, three tens.

194
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Three circles with three sixes.

195
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,600
Right?

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
No, they have to be consecutive.

197
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Three hooks, three circles, or three sixes, three sevens.

198
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
So is mine okay?

199
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,639
Boss, I...

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,679
The goods have arrived.

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,840
They're here, that's them.

202
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,639
You two, come help out.

203
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,440
Unload the goods.

204
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,720
Coming! Let's put them here first, we'll help.

205
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,279
And these too, right?

206
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Don't move, squat down.

207
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

208
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,080
What does this mean?

209
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm a good citizen, what does this mean, boss?

210
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,960
Get up.

211
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,519
Why do you look so familiar?

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,240
I don't know you, I don't know you.

213
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,080
Fatty.

214
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,080
Squat here.

215
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
These things belong to your family, right?

216
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,240
I stole all of this.

217
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,159
It has nothing to do with my mom.

218
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:22,639
Stand still.

219
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,399
You already took away the eldest and the second.

220
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,960
Now you want to take our third child.

221
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,600
Does our family have a grudge against you?

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,759
Look at you kids,

223
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,679
Why do you have to do this?

224
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,759
You could survive by farming.

225
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,080
Please don't take my brother away.

226
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,639
Don't arrest my brother.

227
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,879
Stand there and don't move.

228
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,559
Don't move.

229
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Do you have any money on you?

230
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
Study hard.

231
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,360
Even if you really can't keep studying,

232
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,279
you still can't go stealing, understand?

233
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:02,759
I understand.

234
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,840
If you all get locked up, no one will be left to take care of the family.

235
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,519
Isn't that right?

236
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,159
That's right.

237
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,279
Take this and use it for now.

238
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,600
Big brother.

239
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,919
I promise I'll never be a thief again, no matter what I do.

240
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,960
What did you promise my master back then?

241
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,879
Do you still remember?

242
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,480
I remember.

243
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,519
Then why did you still do it?

244
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,279
It's not that.

245
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,360
My mom is sick.

246
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,440
She has cataracts.

247
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,240
She needs money for treatment.

248
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,799
I have to earn money.

249
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,679
Why not earn money doing something else?

250
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,000
Isn't there any other way to make money?

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
Had to do this.

252
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,000
I really couldn't think of any other way.

253
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,720
The manhole covers on Hongtai Road and along the east river,

254
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
were all stolen by you?

255
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,679
Yes.

256
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,480
Besides manhole covers, what else did you steal?

257
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,879
Steel and cables.

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
I went with someone else.

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
With whom? Where?

260
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,879
With a guy I met while working odd jobs.

261
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,679
At a construction site near the port in Yaohai.

262
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
How old are you this year?

263
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,039
Are you eighteen yet?

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,639
Almost.

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
So you're basically an adult.

266
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,840
Adults have to take legal responsibility.

267
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,679
You know that, right?

268
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,000
I know.

269
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,919
I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself.

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,639
Do you want it?

271
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Yes.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,799
Bro, whatever you say, I'll do it.

273
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll tell you everything I know.

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,799
It's right here.

275
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,279
We pried the lock open.

276
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,279
Went in and stole things.

277
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,000
Alright, you can go back now.

278
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,039
You're letting me go, bro?

279
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,919
I'm letting you go for now.

280
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,080
Take this.

281
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,639
Just do what you need to do when you get back.

282
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,320
Don't tell anyone about this.

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,480
Call me next time there's a job.

284
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,279
Did you hear me?

285
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,480
I heard you.

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,279
Go on.

287
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,679
Alright, I'm leaving then, bro.

288
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
You let him go?

289
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,559
It's because of this—following the trail of stolen manhole covers.

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,279
We discovered a case.

291
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,360
A lead on a series of construction site thefts.

292
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,480
And it's very likely a gang operation.

293
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,639
When I thought about it,

294
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,720
this counts as a loss of state assets.

295
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,919
We have to investigate.

296
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,080
Yes, we must.

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,480
So how many people are in the gang?

298
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,399
We don't know the exact number yet.

299
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,159
Is there any surveillance at the construction site?

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,919
Over here, Captain Huang.

301
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,399
Take a look.

302
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,000
This person was probably scouting the place.

303
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,639
He's very familiar with the surveillance.

304
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,679
He walked through the blind spots.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,679
He turned the camera, so nothing could be seen.

306
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Now look at this.

307
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,120
The car went in empty.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,919
It came out full. They succeeded.

309
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,000
This kind of thing

310
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
is hard to pin down as evidence.

311
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
You handle it.

312
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,639
But make sure you do it thoroughly.

313
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,440
Okay.

314
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,600
Any difficulties?

315
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,080
No.

316
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,320
Tofu.

317
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,000
Dr. Zhou.

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Dr. Zhou.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,759
Are you eating?

320
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,320
The test results are in.

321
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,440
Everything looks fine.

322
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,960
But the hospital is a bit busy.

323
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,320
You’re scheduled for 3 p.m. tomorrow.

324
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Three in the afternoon.

325
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,639
A family member needs to accompany you and sign at that time.

326
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,639
Understood.

327
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,519
Don’t eat anything random now.

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,039
Just have some liquid food.

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,240
Got it.

330
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,960
Alright, alright.

331
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,480
Thank you.

332
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,559
Thank you, Dr. Zhou. Sorry for the trouble.

333
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,840
You’re having it done tomorrow too?

334
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Surgery is tomorrow.

335
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
I’m having it tomorrow too.

336
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,840
Are you by yourself?

337
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
No one with you?

338
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,240
No, my son will be with me.

339
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,399
Then you can’t eat either.

340
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,399
I’ll get you some liquid food in a bit.

341
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,639
Do you want to tell your parents?

342
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,120
I don’t want them to worry.

343
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,559
It’s enough if you’re with me for the surgery.

344
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,440
You’re not going to leave me alone for the surgery, are you?

345
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,559
No, I won’t.

346
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,839
If you’re having surgery, I’ll definitely be there.

347
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,720
Hello

348
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,519
Hello, brother

349
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,759
There's a job tonight at midnight

350
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:26,920
Where is it?

351
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,400
I don't know yet

352
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,920
We'll find out after we meet up

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,119
Okay, got it

354
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,599
Another job, huh?

355
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,759
Go ahead

356
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,200
It's fine, no rush, it's still early

357
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,759
Go early and come back early, okay?

358
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,440
Don't forget what you promised me

359
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,279
Just be with me for my surgery tomorrow

360
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,799
Don't worry

361
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,079
I'll definitely be back before 3 p.m. tomorrow

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,839
I'm heading out

363
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
If you're tired, get some rest

364
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,279
I'm leaving, Auntie

365
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,799
Take care

366
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,880
Who is this?

367
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,359
He canceled the rental for that house

368
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,400
Canceled? Where is he?

369
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,000
How would I know?

370
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,599
How can you handle things like this?

371
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,400
I only rented it to you because you said it would be for six months

372
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,279
It's only been a few days

373
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,359
And now he absolutely refuses to rent

374
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,880
Did he say why?

375
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,319
He didn't say

376
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:55,400
I counted the days too

377
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,480
I refunded him the rent

378
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,599
But I can't refund the deposit

379
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm just letting you know

380
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
You're here, Ziming.

381
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,799
You checked out.

382
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,799
You want cash, right?

383
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,160
No, no, no.

384
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
That place is too noisy and expensive.

385
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,000
What happened to the money?

386
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
Well...

387
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,039
I bought a computer for Nizi.

388
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,759
It's second-hand, though.

389
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,200
But can you give it to her for me?

390
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,160
I won't tell her.

391
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,640
Can I say it's from you?

392
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,519
Okay.

393
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Anything else?

394
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,359
I want to borrow ten thousand yuan from you.

395
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,559
But I promise it's definitely not for buying drugs.

396
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
It's for that business I told you about last time.

397
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,079
I'll pay you back.

398
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,799
I don't have that much on me.

399
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Where are you staying?

400
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,559
At Shui Mu Qingyuan Bathhouse.

401
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,599
Then I'll wait for you.

402
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,119
I'll bring it to you tomorrow afternoon.

403
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,200
Six o'clock?

404
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,799
Okay.

405
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,799
At the entrance of the bathhouse.

406
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,480
Alright.

407
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,799
I'll get going then.

408
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,000
Thanks, Ziming.

409
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
How is it? Does it work?

410
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,680
These shoes won't do.

411
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,160
Look at what we're wearing.

412
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,440
All like this.

413
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,640
Yours are way too clean.

414
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,960
There's a pair over there.

415
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,799
Here, change into this pair.

416
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,319
Whose are these?

417
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,480
Why do you care whose they are?

418
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Here, just wear them, it's fine.

419
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,359
These pants definitely won't work.

420
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,759
That hoodie won't do either.

421
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,880
Go find another one for him.

422
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,440
This one.

423
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,119
This fits.

424
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,240
This one works, this one.

425
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
This is good, just put this on.

426
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,079
It's slim, but you can fit.

427
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,960
Right, take off your hoodie in a bit.

428
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,400
Brother.

429
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:04,480
Sister.

430
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,359
Dong, where are we going today?

431
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,599
Donghu Bay.

432
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,200
What's so good about that dump?

433
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,759
We've been there so many times.

434
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,880
Is there anything good left there?

435
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,400
If you don't want to go, then don't. If not, get lost.

436
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,799
Let's go.

437
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,960
Let's get to work.

438
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Fell asleep.

439
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,599
What are you doing? Want to make a call?

440
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,279
Pretty responsible, huh.

441
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How much do you make a month?

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
Seven or eight hundred yuan, big brother.

443
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,519
You make that much? Where does it all go?

444
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,480
Don't make things hard for me.

445
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
Press it for me.

446
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,599
If you don't behave, I'll throw you into the sea.

447
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,319
Hurry up, hurry up.

448
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on, come on, over here, hurry!

449
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,039
Faster, faster!

450
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,880
Hurry up, put some effort into it!

451
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
Move inside, move inside.

452
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,279
Lao Jiu.

453
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm here, boss.

454
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:54,799
Where are the people?

455
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,039
They're unloading.

456
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,079
I'm here, boss.

457
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,640
Tomorrow night, we'll do something big again.

458
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,599
Bring everyone along.

459
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,240
Okay.

460
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
Mingfeng, three hundred and one, give three hundred.

461
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,119
Here you go, thank you, boss, thank you.

462
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,880
Little Fatty, Little Fatty, five hundred and fifty.

463
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
Give five hundred, we'll talk next time.

464
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,440
Stop for a moment.

465
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,599
Wait for them.

466
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,319
Why are they riding so slowly?

467
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,039
Just now, Liu Dong said to call everyone.

468
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,119
Everyone? How many people is that?

469
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,440
I don't know.

470
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
What's the most people you've seen with him at once?

471
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,240
Probably over a hundred.

472
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,240
What time does Liu Dong usually go to scout the place?

473
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,319
How would I know?

474
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,319
But today, it should be in the afternoon.

475
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,279
Because he has to go back and sleep soon.

476
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
Can you follow him tomorrow?

477
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,200
No, bro.

478
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
You can ask me anything.

479
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,480
But you want me to follow him?

480
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,799
I wouldn't dare.

481
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,240
Besides,

482
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,119
he wouldn't tell me where he's going to scout.

483
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,319
Usually, I just get notified.

484
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,599
They tell me where to go, and I go.

485
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,599
Alright, you can head back now.

486
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,880
Okay, I'll go then.

487
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,640
Are you guys still going today?

488
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,839
Depends. Let's go back.

489
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
Alright, I'm leaving.

490
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
If you go, let me know.

491
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,200
If the construction site can't be completed on time,

492
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,839
it will affect our city's image.

493
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,960
Even the country's image.

494
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,440
This is a big deal.

495
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,839
How about this:

496
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,000
Tonight, we'll conduct a coordinated sweep of the residences.

497
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,559
Understood.

498
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,279
Yes, Chief.

499
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,039
I'll do my best.

500
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,359
Um...

501
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,799
How many people did you say there were?

502
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,680
Over a hundred.

503
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,720
That's a conservative estimate.

504
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,680
Do you have any suggestions?

505
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,039
My suggestion is,

506
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,359
first, figure out their patterns.

507
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,920
Then, at all the construction sites in the area,

508
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
install hidden high-definition cameras.

509
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,279
They should have night vision.

510
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,240
Then, at the crime scenes,

511
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,680
collect evidence one by one.

512
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,039
After that, carry out a coordinated arrest.

513
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,359
You're not wrong.

514
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,880
The problem is, by the time you've gathered all the evidence,

515
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,279
they'll have stolen everything in the city.

516
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,160
Have you figured out where they live?

517
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
Is it possible today

518
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,559
to conduct a coordinated raid on their residences?

519
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,720
The group isn't fixed.

520
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,000
They live scattered around.

521
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,279
And they form teams randomly.

522
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,920
Their theft targets are decided on the spot each day.

523
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,599
They can change at any time.

524
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,319
And if you want to arrest them at their homes,

525
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
how many people would that take?

526
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,599
Even if you catch them,

527
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,559
without evidence, they won't confess.

528
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,119
It's just not possible.

529
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
Even if it's impossible, we have to do it today.

530
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,640
If we miss this chance,

531
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,759
you might never get another one.

532
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,640
Besides,

533
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,160
do you even know what these places are for?

534
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,200
Aren't you aware?

535
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,960
Who will be responsible if the construction gets delayed?

536
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,079
Just tell me

537
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,680
the location and number of people involved in their operation.

538
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,240
This information—location and number of people—

539
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,400
only Liu Dong knows.

540
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,119
Then you need to get in there right now

541
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,359
and find a way to get this information.

542
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,759
Captain Huang, I think this is too risky.

543
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,319
Making such a big move,

544
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,079
if we can't secure the evidence in the end, isn't this—

545
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey, come here for a second.

546
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,839
What is it?

547
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,160
Come on, come on, it's a good thing.

548
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
Come here.

549
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,960
Come on, this spot is yours.

550
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,839
No, no, no, don't.

551
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,799
I'll let you be the captain.

552
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,440
Or should I call the chief?

553
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
You be the captain, no, no, no.

554
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,440
Captain Liu, Captain Liu.

555
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:37,880
Captain Huang, Captain Huang, stop messing around.

556
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,359
We'll do whatever you say.

557
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:40,559
That's how it should be.

558
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,920
Before four o'clock this afternoon,

559
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,960
the operation's location and number of people—

560
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,920
find out for me.

561
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,160
Why didn't you answer the phone?

562
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,160
I was sleeping.

563
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,960
Where does Liu Dong live?

564
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,920
He rented a place by himself.

565
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,920
In Faxin Village.

566
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,480
But he also has a girlfriend.

567
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,599
His girlfriend lives in another village.

568
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,519
Sometimes he stays with his girlfriend.

569
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,559
Where does his girlfriend live?

570
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:17,759
It's called

571
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Mapo.

572
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,880
Right, it's called Mapo.

573
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:22,680
Okay.

574
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,279
I'll have Xia Yu come find you in a bit.

575
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,960
Gangzi, you go keep watch at Faxin Village.

576
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,039
As soon as Liu Dong shows up,

577
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,759
follow him.

578
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
Change your clothes and go find Xiaopang.

579
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,480
Figure out the headcount before 4 p.m.

580
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,119
I'll go to Mapo.

581
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,759
Yes.

582
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,759
Sir.

583
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,359
Can you fix this battery cable?

584
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:37,920
Yes, I can.

585
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,400
Let me take a look.

586
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,920
What model is it?

587
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,119
Here, okay, okay.

588
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,119
I'll find it for you.

589
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:44,839
Alright, thanks.

590
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,519
Okay.

591
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,160
Tingting.

592
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,160
Wait for me.

593
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,799
Captain Huang.

594
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,759
How's it going?

595
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,640
Still searching.

596
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,519
Hurry up.

597
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,400
I've already contacted the SWAT team.

598
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,240
Understood.

599
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,599
Hello

600
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,160
Mom

601
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,680
Can you come to the hospital?

602
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,480
No need to say more

603
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,279
Mr. Liu already called me

604
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm already downstairs at the hospital

605
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Okay

606
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,200
Captain Huang

607
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,039
It's already past four

608
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:18,920
How's it going?

609
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,720
Right now, we only know it's at midnight

610
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
They'll gather around the Qingheyan area

611
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,000
I know that too

612
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Have you figured out how many people there are?

613
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,519
It's still uncertain for now

614
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,079
Alright

615
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,920
Excuse me, sir, hello

616
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,920
I'm waiting for someone

617
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,319
Alright

618
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,279
Okay, okay, okay

619
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,400
Shoot

620
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Missed, missed

621
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,039
Fifty thousand, Qiangzi

622
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,400
Hand it over

623
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Yours

624
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
That was close

625
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll owe you for now

626
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
There's interest

627
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,440
He's out

628
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,079
When did he get out?

629
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,440
A couple of days ago

630
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,559
Didn't even say anything

631
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,759
Three, four

632
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,680
Come on, wait a second

633
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,079
Can't handle the game, huh?

634
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:40,920
I owe you ten thousand

635
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,599
Are you crazy?

636
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,640
There's interest, you know

637
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,440
Let's go, my treat.

638
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,800
Consider it a welcome for you.

639
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,800
I've quit.

640
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,440
Quit? I quit too.

641
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,719
It's been over a dozen hours since I quit.

642
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,400
I really quit.

643
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,079
If you quit, why are you hanging around here?

644
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,239
I'm waiting for someone.

645
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,599
To borrow some money.

646
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,639
You can still borrow money?

647
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
Who? Who is it?

648
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,280
Family.

649
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,320
See?

650
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,000
That's what real family is.

651
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,559
I've seen right through them long ago.

652
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Do you know Dayong's car wash?

653
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,480
I have two friends there.

654
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm going over to hang out for a bit.

655
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,440
If you need me, come find me there.

656
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:35,719
Sis

657
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,719
Have you seen Li Wei, Wei?

658
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,599
Who are you looking for?

659
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,920
Is Old Kong here?

660
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,079
He's inside.

661
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,079
Um, I gave that money to Li Wei.

662
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Qiu, what's the bet today?

663
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Get to work, get to work.

664
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,840
Everyone, move faster.

665
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,239
Dr. Zhou

666
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,960
Family of Fang Tingting

667
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,719
Went to get food.

668
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,039
It's okay, don't cry.

669
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,519
Your pathology results are out.

670
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,000
It's benign.

671
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,000
And the surgery was very successful.

672
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,519
Just rest well.

673
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,320
Don't cry anymore.

674
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,199
Thank you.

675
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,039
Okay, okay.

676
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,559
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

677
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,280
You're welcome.

678
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Run, run!

679
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,800
Run!

680
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,400
You two, go keep an eye on Liu Dong.

681
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,119
Okay.

682
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:45,639
Don't move.

683
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,880
Don't move, police!

684
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,360
Don't move, hands on your head!

685
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,079
Stop!

686
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,239
Stop running!

687
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,519
Stop.

688
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,800
Don't move.

689
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,719
Freeze.

690
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,360
Don't move.

691
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,360
Freeze.

692
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,400
Freeze.

693
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,679
Freeze.

694
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,719
Don't move. Freeze.

695
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,800
What do you mean, bro?

696
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
Weren't you not going to arrest me?

697
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,920
I don't want to arrest you either.

698
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,440
But I have no choice.

699
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,039
Since this is your first offense,

700
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,079
and you helped us out,

701
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,199
you won't be locked up for long.

702
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,679
I have a friend who runs a driving school.

703
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,599
When you get out, go there and learn to drive.

704
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,079
That way, you'll have a skill.

705
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,840
Don't do shady things anymore.

706
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,639
Do you hear me?

707
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,760
Take him away.

708
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,480
Freeze.

709
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,480
Don't run! Don't run! Don't run!

710
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,719
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

711
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,440
What did I do?

712
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,960
Don't move.

713
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm not moving.

714
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,559
Get up.

715
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:52,880
What did I do? Why are you arresting me?

716
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,719
Why are you running?

717
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,960
If you chase me, of course I'll run.

718
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,039
So you run just because I chase you?

719
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,079
That's scary, you know.

720
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,119
I thought you were checking IDs.

721
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:58,639
Checking IDs?

722
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,079
Why are you scared of an ID check?

723
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,280
What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?

724
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,480
I'm collecting trash, so what?

725
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,760
Looks like you're collecting trash as a group.

726
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,639
What did you steal?

727
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,480
I don't know, I didn't steal anything.

728
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,519
Go ahead and search, I have nothing.

729
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,840
Is your name Liu Dong?

730
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,239
Is it a crime to be called Liu Dong?

731
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,639
It's not a crime for others.

732
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,320
But for you, maybe.

733
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,639
Take him away.

734
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:20,480
Go. Wait, no—

735
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,280
Tell me what I did! Get in the car.

736
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,840
Just tell me what I did wrong.

737
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,880
Why are you arresting me?

738
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,679
You're something else, kid.

739
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,320
I just heard about Tingting.

740
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,360
You should go quickly.

741
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,519
Let me tell you,

742
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,119
A woman needs a man by her side most at times like this.

743
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,519
Don't take it lightly.

744
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,960
Hurry back and apologize properly.

745
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,719
What are you doing?

746
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,480
Hello, I'm looking for someone.

747
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,280
Fang Tingting.

748
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,440
She just had surgery.

749
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,840
Visiting hours are over.

750
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,000
You can't disturb the patient's rest.

751
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,280
Come back tomorrow morning.

752
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,079
How did the surgery go?

753
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,559
Are the test results out?

754
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,639
You need to ask the doctor.

755
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Okay, thank you.

756
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:04,800
Brother

757
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:05,440
I

758
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,159
Alright, go ahead.

759
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,320
Go find Coach Yang.

760
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,599
Just say Officer Liu sent you to find him.

761
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,639
Go on.

762
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,679
How have you two been lately?

763
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
We're doing well.

764
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,880
She went to work today.

765
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,000
If you can, spend more time with her.

766
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,800
I know.

767
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,360
I'll pick her up after work.

768
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,280
Don't worry, sis.

769
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,119
Okay.

770
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,519
What's all this mess?

771
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,920
It's Xia Yu's birthday.

772
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,199
These are all from colleagues.

773
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,559
It's his birthday?

774
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,920
Did you forget, Master?

775
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:49,800
I didn't forget.

776
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:54,400
He brought back all these gifts.

777
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,519
Grilled cold noodles?

778
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,599
What grilled cold noodles?

779
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,800
Longevity noodles.

780
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,639
Where is he?

781
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,199
He went to the bureau to report in.

782
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,000
He'll be back soon.

783
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,199
Hello?

784
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,760
Got it, let's go.

785
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,239
Where are we going, Master?

786
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,599
A decomposed body was found at Huacui.

787
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,199
Hurry.

788
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,360
When did you first notice the bad smell?

789
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,599
It started to smell back in the summer.

790
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,960
When the weather got cooler, it wasn't as noticeable.

791
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,559
But in the past two months, the smell has gotten much worse.

792
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,800
I thought something in their house had gone bad.

793
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,519
When exactly was this?

794
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Was it around the time the heating started?

795
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,519
Yes, that's right.

796
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,480
So the heating made the smell even stronger.

797
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,920
Who lives in this apartment?

798
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,840
We checked, the owner is Yang Kaixin.

799
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,320
He's a professor at the music academy.

800
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:00,559
Is he the deceased?

801
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,920
We can't be sure. The body has decomposed.

802
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,119
Decomposed? What do you mean?
