00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,310
Hey, Ji An.

7
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,450
Stop talking like you're from Seoul.

8
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,510
I can't stand it. That's not going
to make you an actor.

9
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,790
I sound so natural.

10
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,180
Why do you have to criticize?

11
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,930
Is today a special day?

12
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,220
No, not at all.

13
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,970
The mackerel at the fish shop looked good.

14
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,830
You like mackerel.

15
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,840
That's why I bought some.

16
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,610
Just be home more often.

17
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,440
I hear other moms yell at their kids to come

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,970
home early and not sleep outside.

19
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,350
Unlike other moms,

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm pretty.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,230
Do you know what they call this these days?

22
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,170
- Princess syndrome.
- Aigoo...

23
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,030
Here.

24
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,280
Eat quickly, and we'll go for a walk.

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,130
Why bother walking by rice paddies?

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,210
Listen to you.

27
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,320
Why do you have to call them rice paddies?

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,000
It sounds nicer if you call it a walk.

29
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,320
Here you go.

30
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,090
Eat a lot.

31
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,500
Your dad and I used to come here often.

32
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,710
We used to drink soju here

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,710
and talked about silly things.

34
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,890
He wanted to have a farm,

35
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,300
but you said you didn't want to.

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,080
Farming or selling stuff isn't for me.

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,180
That's why you left our shop a mess like that.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,400
So, since we're on the topic, Ji An...

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,290
I met a nice man.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,200
But he wants us to run a business in Vietnam.

41
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,880
We'd have no hope living like this.

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,700
We need to do something big to make money.

43
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,800
You could study in Seoul, too.

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,630
I'll settle down in Vietnam first

45
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,640
and come to pick you up.

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,220
You're a high school student. You can live alone.

47
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,490
Let's rent out the shop.
That will get you living expenses.

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,210
I'll send you money every month, too.

49
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,600

51

Okay.

52
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes. Because you're smart and strong-

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,110
Shut up!

54
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,370
Don't say what you don't mean.

55
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,900
I don't need a mom.

56
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,950
Geez. That girl. Where did she
get her temper from?

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,300
You scared me.

61
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,440
Why does she suddenly act like a girl?

62
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,040
Aren't you going to work?

63
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,210
I'm on vacation.

64

65
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,210
Aren't you hungry?

66
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,790
I'm not hungry. I won't eat. I'll sleep.

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,450
Okay. I'll make omurice.

Hello? H-Hyo Ri?

78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,100
I should've called you.

79
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,350
<i>I know.</i>

80
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,510
You know Mom's here, right?

81
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,840
Come and get her.

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,980
<i>Looks like she took time off work.</i>

83
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,020
<i>It's not good to be away from work.</i>

84
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,820
She didn't feel good leaving you alone-

85
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,930
<i>You know.</i>

86
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,060
<i>We'd only harm our relationship
by being together.</i>

87
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,840
I think we need to stay apart

88
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,660
and spend time sorting things out.

89
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,230

91
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,700
Okay. I'll be there.

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,330
I miss you a lot, too.

93
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay.

94
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,390
Here. It's 16,000 won.

95
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,120
16,000 won?

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,500

This is 3,000 won?

99
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,150
I grew it organically myself.

100
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,960
That's why it's a bit expensive.

101
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,970
Organic is this big?

102
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,240
You're impressive.

103
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,160
I gave it fertilizer. A little bit.

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
Gosh. That's not organic. It's pesticide-free.

105
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,370
Organic products are grown naturally

106
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,890
without even fertilizer.

107
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,060
"I gave it fertilizer, but no pesticide.
It's pesticide-free."

108
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,800
You should sell it like that.

109
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,420
If you get caught selling stuff like this in Seoul,

110
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,810
you'll see a policeman, ma'am.

111
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,420
<i>Listen to her.</i>

112
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,080
You're so knowledgeable.

113
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
It's just common knowledge.

114
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,220
Did you live in this village for a long time?

115
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,320
Well, a little.

116
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,060
For about 65 years.

117
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,110
Do you know Yijeong-ri, too?

118
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,300
Yijeong-ri?

119
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,290
Oh, past that mountain?

120
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,750
Yes. You know.

121
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,420
There's a house there, you know.

122
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,480
Yes. A mansion.

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,600
- A mansion?
- A mansion at the foot of the mountain.

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,350
A mansion?

125
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,140
It's not a mansion.

126
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,530
Anyway, that house.

127
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,390
What about that house?

128
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm wondering if that's a good place to live.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,070
When they built that house,

130
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,950
they hired a water flow expert, an astrologist,

131
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,620
a bazi expert, and a fortuneteller.

132
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,290
They built it by making a great deal of fuss.

133
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,170
But no one ever used the house.

134
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,770
That's why it looks abandoned.

135
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,230
Oh, really?

136
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,240
It didn't look that way.

137
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,680
You know about organic produce,

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,370
but you know nothing about houses.

139
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Why are you interested, by the way?

140
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,800
The house has an owner.

141
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm telling you this just in case.

142
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
Our village doesn't just let in new people-

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,490
Okay. Take care.

144
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,670
H-Hold...

145
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,920
Organic. Organic.

146
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,610
Geez.

147
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,320
She's right.

148
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,600
Oppa, you haven't had breakfast, right?

149
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,300
No.

150
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,900
- It's not much of a spread, but-
- It really isn't much.

151
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,670
You should've cooked for the two
of you. You shouldn't have.

152
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,300
It's no trouble at all.

153
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,880
Have breakfast with us for a while.

154
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,610
- Why?
- Why?

155
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,020
Don't feel burdened.

156
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,690
I'm just putting another set
of utensils on the table.

157
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,420
I don't feel burdened. I was saying no indirectly.

158
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
Is there some for me, too?

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,470
Bo Hyeon. There is. Join us.

160
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,870
I was starving.

161
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,480
Thank you.

162
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
- Let me get it for you.
- I'll do it.

163
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,670
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

164
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,360
By the way, looking at you side by side,

165
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,080
you look close like siblings.

166
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,160
- Be good friends.
- Okay.

167
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Don't embarrass us over a meal.

168
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,470
Pretend you didn't hear that.

169
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,600
This is delicious.

170
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
Is it? Eat more.

171
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,200
- So, when are you going back to Seoul-
- Dad.

172
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,500
Will you be at your office today?

173
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes. I'll be working at the office.

174
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,100
Really? What time do you leave for work?

175
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,700
I need to talk to you urgently, too.

176
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,000
Wow. An architecture studio sure is different.

177
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,680
Nice vibe, too.

178
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,510
Wow, so cool.

179
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,690
I'm starting to get a sense.

180
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,360
Huh? What do you mean?

181
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,850
The house we saw last night.

182
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,700
By chance, are you-

183
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
Let's do it, Oppa.

184
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,100
Let's fix it up together.

185
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,640
Hold on.

186
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,510
Gosh, gosh...

187
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,220
You're so mean. Seriously.

188
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,240
Can't you help me, considering our old friendship?

189
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,920
I won't do it.

190
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,540
Let's do it, Oppa. Please, let's.

191
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,770
I won't. Didn't you see it last night?

192
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,700
I can't do it. I can't do it, I said!

193
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,000
- I won't do it!
- I want to do it.

194
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,650
Hello.

195
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,400
Stop saying hello. Please.

196
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,960
Mr. Ryu. Mr. Ryu.

197
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,370
Ryu, Ryu, Ryu...

198
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,210
I know you're listening.

199
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,200
Don't be discouraged just because
you failed to do it one night.

200
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,070
If you couldn't do it last night,

201
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,400
you can do it tonight.

202
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,570
- Don't you agree?
- You're right.

203
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,300
Well, that's just how it is.

204
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,840
It comes and goes.

205
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,900
It goes and comes. Back and forth.

206
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,800
Gosh. You're at that age now.

207
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,480
That kind of stuff happens all the time.

208
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,530
Of course, I've never experienced that myself.

209
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,020
We can't wait to see you...

210
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,460
trying your best, Mr. Ryu.

211
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,190
Fighting.

212
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,630
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

213
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,330
What are they saying?

214
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,250
Why are the villagers here always so random?

215
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,560
This is the country of manners.

216
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,700
You can't do that in the car.

217
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,340
Doing what you aren't supposed to do

218
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,930
always gets you going.

219
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,790
I knew this wouldn't work.

220
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,370
It's perfect.

221
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,920
You said you're a field manager.

222
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,890
Look at the material and environmental conditions.

223
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,860
The crossbeam and the rafters...

224
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,460
They're fine.

225
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,820
The walls are falling off, too.

226
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,240
There isn't much you can keep.

227
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,090
The belly button is bigger than the belly.

228
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,300
The rotten framing can be replaced.

229
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,200
The crumbling walls can be removed and replaced.

230
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,780
It'd be a lot easier that way.

231
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,970
There's nothing around. It's too secluded.

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,500
It's dangerous and lonely for you two to live in.

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,760
I've only lived in multi-unit buildings
for the past 20 years.

234
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,510
I want to be away from neighbors now.

235
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,710
<i>Cut her off.</i>

236
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,860
Oh, right.

237
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,370
We had a brief connection back
in high school as sunbae and hoobae.

238
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,050
But I went too far.

239
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,610
I support your decision, Ji An.

240
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,720
I hope you build the house you want.

241
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,460
You'll be building it.

242
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,100
<i>Ryu Jeong Seok, get it together.</i>

243
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,510
You're still just as mischievous.

244
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,700
I'll see you before you leave for Seoul.

245
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,640
Oppa, you'll end up doing it.

246
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,600
Don't fight for no reason.

247
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,350
Hello?

248
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,270
Hey, Hyo Ri. I'm in front of the camper.

249
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,010
I'm coming out now.

250
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,380
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah.

251
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,710
Mr. Ryu.

252
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,540
Here's the document.

253
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,190
Geez.

254
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,100
This part is still weak.

255
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,900
- Yes.
- When is the presentation?

256
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,900
I bought us some time.

257
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,100
Since the county executive suddenly changed,

258
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,640
they're reestablishing the
internal reporting system.

259
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,900
But do you know why the
county executive was changed?

260
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,400
He left his phone at a bar,

261
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,870
- but his phone-
- Spare me.

262
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,060
Spare? I'm sure they have spares.

263
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,160
I don't want to hear silly gossip.

264
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,480
Okay.

265
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,610
Here.

266
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,160
Suggest having a competition
for the fun kids' library

267
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,790
ideas near the borough office.

268
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Since we have time, we should
get people's attention.

269
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,150
It'd be nice to get new ideas, too.

270
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,250
Okay. I'll contact them.

271
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
- Also...
- Yes?

272
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,570
You know, the abandoned house...

273
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,990
Abandoned house?

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,300
- Abandoned house...
- Abandoned house.

275
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,620
You're sick.

276
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,180
Try standing up.

277
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,680
Come on. Stand up.

278
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,510
Breathe out as much as you can.

279
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,220
- Come on and do it.
- No, no.

280
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,270
It's not that.

281
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,070
Gosh, whatever. Go back to work.

282
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,410
Okay.

283
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,820
Don't get sucked in.

284
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,400
Don't get sucked in.

285
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,630
Hello. Hello.

286
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,060
Hey, Bo Hyeon.

287
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,960
What brings you here, son?

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, I wanted to talk to you.

289
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,990
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

290
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,690
Egg...

291
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,030
What? Did you come worried about me?

292
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,620
Yes.

293
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,200
I suppose. Yes.

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,230
She called you to pick me up, huh?

295
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,450
Geez. Seriously. That's not true.

296
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,160
You have no sense of imagination.

297
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,810
She called you to pick me up
first thing in the morning.

298
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,700
So, you came in a hurry. I can tell.

299
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,930
Hey. I swear that's not true.

300
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,300
It's not true.

301
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
It is.

302
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,750
What?

303
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,310
Crazy. You're so funny.

304
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,780
Gosh. I said it's not true!

305
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,450
Anyway, this is good. You're coming with me.

306
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,140
What? Where are we going? Where are we going?

307
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,600
Hey...

308
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,180
Did you lose your head from the shock?

309
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,930
You'll fix this house up?

310
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,770
It's still considered a mansion
in this village, okay?

311
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,930
Wow, I hate it even more.

312
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,560
Look. We'll change the entire interior.

313
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,650
If we used the basic structure-

314
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,130
Yes, Ji An.

315
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,750
Right now, you're confused

316
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,710
and having a hard time. I know.

317
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,580
But still.

318
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,570
We need to be rational right now-

319
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,760
Hey!

320
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
Be careful. You're damaging our house.

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,230
Geez. You ruined our door.

322
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
Hey, you can't talk like that.

323
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,990
- Hey, Lee Ji An.
- Gosh, whatever.

324
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,420
Where are you going? Where are you going?

325
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,130
Lee Ji An. Lee Ji An! Come to your senses.

326
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,470
Should I remove all this and expand the garden?

327
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,580
Forget it! Why would you fix this house up?

328
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,900
Geez.

329
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,640
It'd be a waste just to use it as a garden.

330
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,370
Is that so? Should we utilize the space?

331
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,660
Wake up!

332
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,500
This would be an endless amount of work.

333
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,870
It's hopeless.

334
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,090
You could use it as a shop if you fixed it up.

335
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,590
We could open a cafe.

336
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
Hey. Who would come this far for coffee?

337
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,390
The village grandmas?

338
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,700
A restaurant would be better.

339
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,450
A restaurant. Yes, it's a restaurant.

340
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,020
Right? It's perfect.

341
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,970
If we start a business under your name...

342
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,580
You wanted to quit working at the diner, right?

343
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,380
Hey. How dare you try to trick me?

344
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
You think you could trick me like that?

345
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,530
Forget it, then.

346
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,530
I'll find a renter while we're fixing it.

347
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,120
I'll fix it the way they want.
And I'll have a restaurant here.

348
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,640
Hey, when did I say I don't want to?

349
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,540
Are you in? Deal?

350
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,430
When did I say I'd do it?

351
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,660
Geez. Forget it. I'll put it on the market.

352
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,340
Done. You lost your chance.

353
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,110
- Deal, deal. I'm in.
- The ship has sailed.

354
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,500
- The ship has sailed.
- Hey, girl.

355
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,340
You're firm about stupid things.

356
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,700
Hey, I didn't even get to think
for a minute. Come here.

357
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,510
<i>That doesn't make you feel less victimized.</i>

358
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,760
<i>You don't lose love for her, either.</i>

359
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
<i>So, why do you keep behaving rudely to her?</i>

360
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,210
He acts high and mighty.

361
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,040
You can tell he's always like that.

362
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,510
He's a total jerk-

363
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,790
Jerk?

364
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,370
Who's a total jerk?

365
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,470
You... What are you doing here?

366
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,030
It's a street.

367
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,960
Right.

368
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,000
I was looking for you desperately.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,200
I need your service right now.

370
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,520
Done.

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,010
Here.

372
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,330
[Good work!]

373
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,190
Did I just get an approval?

374
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,490
I suppose.

375
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,940
You're better than Tae Oh.

376
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't like who you're comparing me to,

377
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,700
but I appreciate the stamp. I'll return this.

378
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,080
Labor is sacred.

379
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,150
It needs to be respected.

380
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,360
And I give it to everyone who works here.

381
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,150
Don't overreact...

382
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,200
Okay.

383
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,160
- Got it.
- Okay.

384
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I'm good at making things pretty.

385
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,980
I know. You pick flowers nicely
and wrap them nicely, too.

386
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,670
You look pretty when you work,
and you have a pretty face, too.

387
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,630
<i>Shit.</i>

388
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,910
<i>What's this?</i>

389
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,180
The sky is pretty, too.

390
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Everything is pretty.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,240
- Bo Hyeon, Bo Hyeon, what are you up to?
- You came.

392
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,140
- Did you send out flowers?
- Yes.

393
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,910
- Hi.
- Hello.

394
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,170
- What? Are you going surfing again?
- You little.

395
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,980
God of the ocean gave us these waves.

396
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,120
But no one is riding them.

397
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,090
That's a sin. It'd make the god of the ocean sad.

398
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,150
Let's go, brother.

399
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,650
Right.

400
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,720
Want to come, pretty sister?

401
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,840
<i>Do you know what the diagnosis means?</i>

402
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,900
<i>It means I need to change the way I live.</i>

403
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,660
She can't swim.

404
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,510
- Let's go.
- Hey.

405
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,000
I can learn.

406
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,040
What?

407
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
You'll teach me, right?

408
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,920
You little.

409
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,160
Don't you know the aloha spirit?

410
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,490
Trust and bond with others.

411
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,000
Kindness and love.

412
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,570
That's the surfer spirit.

413
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,050
Let's go. I'll...

414
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,570
teach you the right way.

415
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,670
Go, go, go.

416
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,030
Let's get moving.

417
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,960
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

418
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,260
- Party time, brother.
- Okay.

419
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,480
Go, go, go.

420
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,940
Let's go...

421
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,930
Hang tight.

422
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,870
We're visiting the god of the ocean.

423
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,710
Oppa!

424
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,150
Hey, So Yeon!

425
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,720
Bo Hyeon, I'm here!

426
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,400
I missed you a lot!

427
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,670
Who's she?

428
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,580
Let's talk when we get there.

429
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,100
Okay. See you.

430
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,230
Hello.

431
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,450
She's not here.

432
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,330
- She's not?
- I'm thirsty.

433
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,410
Let's wait.

434
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,300
The owner didn't look friendly
enough to visit friends.

435
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,390
- She'll be back soon.
- What are you saying?

436
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,520
You don't have to know.

437
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,840
Isn't this place kind of nice?

438
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,120
It's so peaceful.

439
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,540
The fact that we find that nice means we're old.

440
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,220
Yes. Only you're old.

441
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,880
I'm just sensitive.

442
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,100
Geez. Keep trying.

443
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,620
The wrinkles on your face show time

444
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,900
and marked their territories.

445
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,820
- Seon Yeong.
- Yes?

446
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,150
I won't cry anymore.

447
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't be shocked at how dogged I am.

448
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,370
I'll do something instead of crying.

449
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,660
Yes.

450
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't waste your energy on crying.

451
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,640
I'll build a nice house
and live happily with Hyo Ri.

452
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,050
Wrong.

453
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,860
You'll live happily with Hyo Ri and Seon Yeong.

454
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,680
Should I ask Chief An if he knows an architect?

455
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,390
I already chose one.

456
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,960
Seeing how he built his house, he's the real deal.

457
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,810
You went to his house? When? Who's he?

458
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,690
Here he comes. He's our architect.

459
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,060
Oppa.

460
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,480
You're already calling him Oppa?

461
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,240
He's Oppa until he signs the contract.

462
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,650
I think your oppa is...

463
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,390
running away from us. Am I the
only one who thinks that?

464
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,770
Get me ice cream when the
lady returns. Get Hyo Ri's, too.

465
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,670
I'm getting to work.

466
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,400
He's running away, though.

467
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,840
The architect is running away.

468
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,640
I'm jogging.

469
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,020
Looks like we share the same course.

470
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,100
So, have you thought about it?

471
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,620
Didn't you keep thinking about our house today?

472
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
No way.

473
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,750
Oppa, you know my friend who was with me?

474
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,490
She was called the "Wallpaper Queen"
back in the day.

475
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,750
As long as you decide,

476
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,860
I can get you the Avengers of contractors.

477
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,500
Oppa, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

478
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,140
Why are you trying to fix that house?

479
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,760
To live in it.

480
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,800
I want to live a fun life with Hyo Ri.

481
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,880
Huh? Gosh.

482
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,270
Forget it. I can't believe this.

483
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,090
He could just say no.

484
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,250
He can just explain why he can't.

485
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,890
How could he have no manners?

486
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,670
Seriously. He thinks so little of me?

487
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,050
Wow.

488
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,870
Yes.

489
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,920
I can't just insist that you take the job.

490
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,870
But still. If I'm trying this hard,

491
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,120
you should give me an answer, at least.

492
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,310
Anyway, fine.

493
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,320
It's obvious that you don't want the job.

494
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,300
I won't bring it up anymore.

495
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,440
Let's do it.

496
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,000
Right.

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,200
Also, we only knew each other in high school.

498
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,130
We were just reunited after 20 years.

499
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,480
Calling you Oppa sounds too casual.

500
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,470
Let's be formal from now on, Mr. Ryu Jeong Seok.

501
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,680
Let's do it, Lee Ji An.

502
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,800
Lee Ji An! Let's do it!

503
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,760
You'll do it? You said you'll do it?

504
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,460
You'll really do it?

505
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,110
Oppa.

506
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,330
Really?

507
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,400
I knew it, Oppa. I had faith in you.

508
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,370
We'll make this work.

509
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,510
We will. We'll have fantastic chemistry.

510
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,060
Fantastic chemistry! Fantastic chemistry!

511
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,130
Gosh, those are the days.

512
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,120
Fighting! Fighting!

513
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,820
Wow! Thank you so much.

514
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,940
Nine feet. Long boards.

515
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,270
Since it's wide and thick, it floats well.

516
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,360
What do you do, then?

517
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,400
It's much easier to balance and stand up.

518
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,560
But since you're a beginner,

519
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,700
- you'll use a long board.
- Okay

520
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,380
- Okay?
- Okay.

521
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,300
- Say hello. This is-
- Hi.

522
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,370
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hyo Ri.

523
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,730
She's pretty. Nice to meet you.

524
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,070
I'm Yu Dong Seok.

525
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,750
There's a restaurant called "Dongseok
Butcher House" at the village entrance.

526
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,950
- I'm their youngest son.
- Nice to meet you.

527
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,050
If you mention his name there,

528
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,180
his mom will slap your back. Don't bother.

529
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,100
I run a 2-hectare or 6,000 pyeong
organic onion farm.

530
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,930
I'm a farm owner. Farm owner, Lee Jae Dong.

531
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,950
Nice to meet you.

532
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,460
She's Kim So Yeon. She's transparent.

533
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,520
She speaks whatever's on her mind.

534
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,910
She leads a tiring life.

535
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,990
Please be generous and empathetic toward her.

536
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,070
Okay, let's stretch.

537
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,440
Gather around.

538
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,400
Yes. Okay.

539
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Stretch the spine first. One, two, three, four.

540
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,110
Slowly. That's right.

541
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,510
Stretch every joint.

542
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,650
That's right, Hyo Ri.

543
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,740
She's stiff.

544
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,180
- I don't want to do this.
- Hey, hey.

545
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,480
Good.

546
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,330
Okay. Move on to the hips.

547
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,110
To the right. Stretch.

548
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,660
Yes.

549
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,400
That's right.

550
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,160
<i>♫ If how I feel stays true ♫</i>

551
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,290
<i>♫ That your heart is feeling it, too ♫</i>

552
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,240
Paddle with your hands.

553
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,750
Paddle forward.

554
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,020
One, two. The wave is here.

555
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,920
Get ready to push. Push.

556
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,900
Okay.

557
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,080
Nice. Good work.

558
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,580
What are you looking at?
Look forward. That's right.

559
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,630
Go forward.

560
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,830
<i>♫ My love comes to you ♫</i>

561
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,670
Become one with the ocean.

562
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,490
Drink the ocean water. Okay.

563
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,050
Have faith and lie face down.

564
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,650
Okay. Paddle.

565
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,320
Push!

566
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,430
So close.

567
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,700
But you did a great job.

568
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,240
Nice, nice. That's how the first try goes.

569
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,700
Paddle. Push!

570
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,000
Up!

571
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,270
Nice, nice, nice.

572
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,750
It's okay.

573
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,920
It's okay.

574
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,120
Push!

575
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,390
Up!

576
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,350
Nice. Push.

577
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,940
Up, up!

578
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,740
Okay.

579
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,260
Nice.

580
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,580
Hold on. Hold on.

581
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,040
Should we...

582
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,890
rent a big duck tube and use that?

583
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,640
Tubes aren't bad.

584
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,030
It's so fun.

585
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,230
You'd be surprised.

586
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,470
Quack.

587
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,930
Quack, quack.

588
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,390
<i>♫ My love comes to you ♫</i>

589
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:39,030

00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,300

591
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,030
There.

592
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,080
Good job!

593
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,270
You can do it!

594
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,370
You can do it!

595
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,900

00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,390
<i>♫ My love comes to you ♫</i>

601
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,180
I saw hope.

602
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,760
Good work.

603
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,460
You've got the surfer's spirit.

604
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,870
You won't give up on me like this, right?

605
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,760
What? Give up?

606
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,100
I'm just providing a realistic suggestion.

607
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Such as a duck tube.

608
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,330
You're good at everything, So Yeon.

609
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,560
Not everything. She was terrible at studying.

610
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,940
Geez.

611
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,300
I admit it.

612
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,980
What? What? Miss.

613
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,420
Miss!

614
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,260
Miss!

615
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,170
Let's go. Miss, please...

616
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,860
Push! Up!

617
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,510
Nice!

618
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,220
Great student with a great teacher!

619
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,510
Aren't you tired? You were pushing it.

620
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm not tired at all.

621
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,950
I didn't know something so frustrating

622
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,600
could be so much fun.

623
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,200
What are you doing? Close it.

624
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,710
Oh, okay.

625
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,080
So?

626
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,950
How did it feel to stand
on the wave for the first time?

627
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,520
It was totally exhilarating.

628
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,200
Totally?

629
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,400
I overcame my limit, not the waves today.

630
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,560
I think I have a talent.

631
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,400
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

632
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,170
I have to collect forms to submit
and bring them to Oppa.

633
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,720
Hey.

634
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,760
Ask your architect to join us for dinner.

635
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,200
You need to feel comfortable
together before you start working.

636
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,330
So, you can communicate easily.

637
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,650
Should I?

638
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,600
I could tell he's not so easygoing.

639
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,100
You know I'm great at face reading.

640
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,040
I didn't like his face reading,

641
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,750
but he's your hometown friend. So, I'll trust him.

642
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,460
How's his face reading?

643
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,360
"Hey, I'm inflexible."

644
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,840
His face says that. It says, "I'm inflexible."

645
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,220
When will you let go of that habit?

646
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,970
You know nothing about face reading.

647
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,280
Whenever you meet someone,
you bring up their face reading.

648
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,640
You judge people all the time. Seriously.

649
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,720
What? When you first came to the worksite,

650
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,660
people said, "She looks pretty rude."

651
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,690
And I said, "No, she doesn't look pretty rude.

652
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,990
She looks ridiculously rude."

653
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,020
I'm the only one who saw it.

654
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Everyone praised me for having a rudeness detector.

655
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,410
Shut up.

656
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,980
Jeong Seok isn't inflexible.

657
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,060
He's a heartbreaker.

658
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,000
Heartbreaker?

659
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,120
A handsome, heartthrob,

660
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,630
and childhood crush type?

661
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,830
Did you join a religion behind my back?

662
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,430
Since when were you so generous?

663
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,070
Someone had a crush on him in high school.

664
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,010
I'm telling you.

665
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,570
By chance,

666
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,470
is that someone...

667
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,970
in front of me right now?

668
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,300
When you got a test sheet in school,

669
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,960
did you roll a pencil without reading the questions

670
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,420
and guessed the answers, right?

671
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,590
That's why you still say random things.

672
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,240
- Right?
- Hey!

673
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm older than you.

674
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,290
That was actually pretty perceptive.

675
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,960
You're clever sometimes.

676
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,640
- Whatever. I'll call Oppa, then.
- Yes, call him.

677
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,160
Call him.

678
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,900
- Your fingers look so happy.
- No.

679
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,470
- You like him a lot.
- Geez, no.

680
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,260
Are you nervous? You're calling.

681
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,460
Gosh, why cover your mouth?

682
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,140
Why are you wet again?

683
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,080
- Did you drown again?
- No, no.

684
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,770
What do you mean, no? Be careful. It's dangerous.

685
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,300
We're coming back from surfing.

686
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,260
- Surfing?
- Yes.

687
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,180
Thank you for today.

688
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,260
I don't know who she takes after.

689
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,000
We're having dinner together later. See you then.

690
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,700
- Okay.
- Really? Should I join you later?

691
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,540
You're back again.

692
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,670
I was told the dinner would take a long time.

693
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,990
It's okay. I need to fix Bo Hyeon's board.

694
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,920
I'll stay a long time, too.

695
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,430
Okay. See you later.

696
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,550
Okay, got it.

697
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,390
Hyung, it must be heavy. Let me help you.

698
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,490
It's okay. Come on, Bo Hyeon.

699
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,030
Choo-choo. Choo-choo.

700
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,020
See you later. Choo-choo.

701
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,260
He's borderline witty and clueless.

702
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,740
What a questionable character.

703
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,980
I should watch out for now.

704
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,600
- Here.
- Wow!

705
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,000
No joke, huh?

706
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,710
I just love it.

707
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,710
It's not over-the-top, clean, and unique.

708
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,000
You have good taste.

709
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,700
Oppa, you have an eyelash.

710
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,140
I got it.

711
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,170
No!

712
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,590
It's not like that. How many times...

713
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,240
It's not like that.

714
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,220
There's nothing going on.
We aren't doing anything.

715
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,860
It's not like that.

716
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,000
Bo Hyeon,

717
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,400
doesn't a strong no mean yes?

718
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,770
Hyung.

719
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,800
You're a divorcé.

720
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,980
It won't be weird if you were dating.

721
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,570
Are you a divorcé?

722
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,330
Tae Oh,

723
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,170
how about you take food to go?

724
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,100
Hyung,

725
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,940
are you looking out for me?

726
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,800
Okay. If so,

727
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,990
I'll take the leftovers after the meal.

728
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,810
Does that work?

729
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm hungry.

730
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,730
Auntie, serve rice.

731
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,700
Okay, okay. Here comes the pollock stew.

732
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:56,570
- Come.
- Yo, yo, yo.

733
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,490
There won't be any leftovers.

734
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,160
Okay. Have a seat.

735
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,230
So noisy.

736
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,580
Have a seat. Have a seat.

737
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,330
Impressive, right?

738
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,340
- It's impressive.
- I made it.

739
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,390
Here, here.

740
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,920
Good job.

741
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,240
Well,

742
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,680
I...

743
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,230
heard.

744
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,870
<i>She's here because she's sick.</i>

745
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,230
Looks like they just found out.

746
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,660
So...

747
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,430
So, I want her to have a comfortable stay with us.

748
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,110
I see.

749
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,500
If you decided to take on the job

750
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,800
- after hearing that-
- It's not like that.

751
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,090
A project happened to be delayed.

752
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,300
I have some time.

753
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,800
I like money. I need to make money.

754
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,070
Okay. Anyway, thank you.

755
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,580
Let's do this together.

756
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,650
Let me visit your Seoul home when you're free.

757
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,370
When I see people's old homes,

758
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,490
I get ideas for their new homes.

759
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,450
Okay. Let's do that.

760
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,970
I'll let you rest.

761
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,950
Is this all you see?

762
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,890
When does your vacation end?

763
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,680
I'm not going to Seoul.

764
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,740
What?

765
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,660
I quit my job.

766
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,780
What did you just say?

767
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,200
- You quit your job?
- Yes, I did.

768
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,100
I'll stay here instead of going back.

769
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,100
- So, just know that.
- Why did you quit your job?

770
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,880
Because I might die?

771
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,700
What?

772
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,030
Why would you talk like that?

773
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,860
She's making me feel that way right now.

774
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,900
She's acting like I'll die any day now.

775
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,610
Aren't you the one who's preparing
to die and staying here alone?

776
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,400
What are you doing?

777
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,360
How would I feel living in Seoul alone?

778
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,970
I said I can't worry about your life, too.

779
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,310
I said I can barely take care of myself.

780
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,100
Hey, that's enough. Okay?

781
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,900
If you were me... If I were sick,

782
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,170
could you leave me alone?

783
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,100
I would.

784
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
If that's what you want.

785
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,620
Do you hate being with me that much?

786
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,560
Yes.

787
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
So, take back the resignation letter-

788
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,600
She got fired.

789
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,100
Some of the company's supplies were stolen.

790
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,720
It was a bad situation.

791
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,730
She was treated unjustly.

792
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,430
It's true.

793
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,510
So, stop.

794
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,000
Did you even argue?

795
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,500
Did you foolishly say,
"Got it. I'll quit." Didn't you?

796
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,870
What's wrong?

797
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,700
Are you in pain? What's wrong?

798
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,100
Are you in pain?

799
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,110
Let go!

800
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,050
I can always find another job.

801
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,100
- Hyo Ri, let's cheer up together.
- You cheer up.

802
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,920
Cheer up all you want.

803
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,440
A family can't be apart.

804
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,160
Rather than fight every day together,

805
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,830
I'd rather see you occasionally and feel better.

806
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,960
Why can't we do that?

807
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,250
Hyo Ri, I prepared food. Eat it later.

808
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,730
Mom and I will step out.

809
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,800
Leave her alone.

810
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey, how long will you do this for?

811
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,020
Hyo Ri?

812
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,650
Hyo Ri.

813
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,580
- Hyo Ri.
- She must be sick.

814
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,700
- What do we do?
- Hyo Ri.

815
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,230
Hyo Ri!

816
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,750
- My gosh.
- Hyo Ri.

817
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,310
Hyo Ri.

818
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,730
Hyo Ri.

819
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,470
- Are you Ms. Lee Hyo Ri's guardian?
- Yes, yes.

820
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,360
Ms. Lee's guardian?

821
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,170
It's acute tonsillitis.

822
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,400
She has a very high fever.

823
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,870
- Until she stabilizes-
- Doctor,

824
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,970
she has a brain tumor.

825
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,180
She's seeing a doctor in Seoul.

826
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,540
Can tonsillitis affect the brain tumor somehow?

827
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,410
She should be hospitalized

828
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,660
so we can check once the fever breaks.

829
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,670
If she needs additional treatment or tests,

830
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,810
then, she should be transferred
to her regular hospital.

831
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

832
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,960
What time is it?

833
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,430
It's 7 a.m.

834
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,630
You'll get breakfast soon.

835
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,500
I don't want to eat anything.

836
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,460
It's acute tonsillitis.

837
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,300
You won't need any treatment
once your fever breaks.

838
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,520
When I was in high school,

839
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,820
after my dad passed away,

840
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,580
my mom dated three men.

841
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,510
One was a karaoke owner.

842
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,770
He turned out to be married.

843
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,710
One was a barbecue restaurant owner.

844
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,910
She had a meltdown because he was two-timing.

845
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,030
The third one was a jean factory owner.

846
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,140
She ended up going to Vietnam with him.

847
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,630
When I was in the 11th grade.

848
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,790
She left me all alone.

849
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,210
<i>Even when I close my eyes,</i>

850
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,420
<i>I can remember that night clearly.</i>

851
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,090
<i>Mom walking away for the last time.</i>

852
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,690
<i>The image of me left alone in that room</i>

853
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,480
<i>is vivid like a picture.</i>

854
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,610
Should I have stopped her

855
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,200
and asked her to stay with me?

856
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,330
Or should I have begged her

857
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,870
to take me with her?

858
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,980
<i>Whenever I'm alone in the empty house,</i>

859
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,730
I picture that night dozens of times

860
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,460
over and over again.

861
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,820
I blame her and myself.

862
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,710
I suffered for a very long time like that.

863
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,950
I suffered for a very long time like that.

864
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,420
You said Grandma was nice.

865
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,390
She was the prettiest in the village.
She made tasty soybean stew.

866
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,820
She took you to the cinema
because she wanted to be an actor.

867
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,620
I only wanted to tell you good things.

868
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,970
Because nothing is ordinary in our lives,

869
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,230
I wanted your memory to be ordinary.

870
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,180
Do you know why I don't like you, Mom?

871
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,300
You think it's okay to pretend to
be fine as if nothing's going on.

872
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,070
I hate that.

873
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,660
Because you pretend to be okay and fine,

874
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,270
I have to pretend to be okay and strong.

875
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,310
That was too burdensome and difficult.

876
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,090
Hyo Ri...

877
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,540
I'm scared.

878
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,590
I...

879
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:54,050
don't know what a good mom is like.

880
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,840
I didn't give birth to you...

881
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:04,310
and my mom left me when I was young.

882
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm so scared...

883
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,560
that you're sick.

884
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,960
But I don't know what to do.

885
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,620
When my mom left me,

886
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,830
I couldn't ask her...

887
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,500
to be by my side.

888
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,540
If she left even after I asked,

889
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,760
it meant that I was really abandoned.

890
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,700
I think I was afraid to confirm that.

891
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,270
But...

892
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,690
I regretted it for a long time.

893
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,000
"I should've stopped her.

894
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,820
I should've asked her to stay with me."

895
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,300
So...

896
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,500
I don't want to have regrets with you.

897
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,600
Hyo Ri, for my sake...

898
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,060
you can stay with me, right?

899
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,710
I'm very afraid right now.

900
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,400
Now that you told me,

901
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,720
I can tell you, too.

902
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,800
- I'm sorry for making you feel scared.
- No...

903
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,220
But to be honest,

904
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,370
I'm scared, too.

905
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,060
Mom, I'm so scared.
