00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,720
Is that so?

186
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,090
Dr. Jung.

187
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,840
Hyo Ri, are you going to Seoul today?

188
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,860
Yes. With our Bo Hyeon.

189
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,030
You're talking as if you gave birth to him.

190
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,050
Is it "our Bo Hyeon"?

191
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,340
It's my Bo Hyeon.

192
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,950
Yes, your Bo Hyeon.

193
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,550
Doctor!

194
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,930
Dr. Jung.

195
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,480
Drink healthy juice.

196
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,220
I feel kind of tired today.

197
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,930
No.

198
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,930
Okay, let's start.

199
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,520
Raise them up.

200
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,290
Relax your shoulders. Stretch your back.

201
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,510
- Stretch your tailbone.
- It feels good.

202
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,690
To the left.

203
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,610
Ji An, don't put your head on your arm.

204
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,210
Cross the right leg.

205
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,580
Sit straight, Ji An.

206
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,170
How about my leg?

207
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,970
Okay. Twist.

208
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,530
Hyungnim!

209
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,200
Hey. So hot.

210
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,340
I harvested this corn this morning.

211
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,430
Eat a few and...

212
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,110
sell the rest for us.

213
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,180
10,000 won for a dozen.

214
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,190
I won't make any profit.

215
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,570
Make it 10. Make it 10.

216
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,550
- Is that so?
- Let me look.

217
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,290
- 10,000 won for 10?
- Yes, 10.

218
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,580
Mr. Ryu is here.

219
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,930
What? Do you have eyes in the back of your head?

220
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,040
How did you know?

221
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,550
She wasn't just born in the year of the dog.

222
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,850
She was born in the year of the German Shepherd.

223
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,300
You're here to get milk, right?
Take the stuff in the fridge.

224
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,790
Didn't you get these today?

225
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,540
Aigoo, he's so quick. Seriously.

226
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,230
They're the same thing.
There isn't a big difference.

227
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,360
But still, the ones you got today must be fresher.

228
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,200
They say the regular who left is
scarier than the new customer.

229
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm envious of your knowledge, Mr. Ryu.

230
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,060
You'll deliver them to Hyo Ri's again today, right?

231
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,630
Wow, this is why they say midlife romance is scary.

232
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,550
It's not midlife romance. She's my first love.

233
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,050
I reunited with my first love after 30 years.

234
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,570
First love? Right?

235
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,470
I knew it was something unusual.

236
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,800
First what? First what?

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,260
First love. You know first love? First love.

238
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,160
Of course, I know what it is.

239
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,210
You might not know.

240
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,940
You probably had your first love
during the Korean War.

241
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,130
I...

242
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,500
I was born in '58, the year of the dog. Come on.

243
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,520
You tease me a lot for being nice.

244
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,210
You were obviously born in '46,
the year of the dog.

245
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,180
He's so funny.

246
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,820
Hey, my niece was born in '70.
People think we're the same age.

247
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,940
Geez. Really. I'm serious.

248
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,020
He's so good at teasing.

249
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,090
He's the best.

250
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,800
You can't do this to me, Ahjussi.

251
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,930
I've always kept my promise.

252
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,950
What?

253
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,550
The Rising Sun Attack? How dirty.

254
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,870
It's not dirty. It's strategic.

255
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,670
Hey, hey, hey.

256
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,570
Geez.

257
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,490
What a shame.

258
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,210
Oh, yes.

259
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,440
Are you okay?

260
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,430
Gosh, my knee is acting up these days.

261
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,660
Geez. I'm okay. I'm okay.

262
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,280
Take this.

263
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,240
Why are you whispering?

264
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,910
It's Auntie Seon Yeong's.

265
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,750
She takes it for her joints these days.

266
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Two tablets?

267
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,850
You need to care for your joints in advance

268
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,490
to game with me for a long time.

269
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,950
Gosh. You're the only one
who cares about me, Hyo Ri.

270
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,000
It'd be too noticeable if I left this here.

271
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,980
I'll take it with me.

272
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,750
What's with you two?

273
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,420
The milk was just an excuse, huh?

274
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,460
You come to game with Hyo Ri, don't you?

275
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,680
That's not true.

276
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,580
He goes through the trouble of picking up
milk for us. Come on, Mom.

277
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,850
Milk helps kids grow taller, you know.

278
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,200
He's right. I need to grow taller.

279
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,660
We'll turn this off. Let's turn it off.

280
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,440
We'll stop now.

281
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,480
Okay.

282
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,680
Talk quietly. Quietly.

283
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,840
All right.

284
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,210
Bo Hyeon.

285
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,290
Oh, hello.

286
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,510
I made this.

287
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,670
It's not Seon Yeong's.

288
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,700
I knew it.

289
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,520
Is it good?

290
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,180
The bibimguksu tastes like bibimguksu.

291
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,290
I feel like you're mocking me.

292
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,810
It's just my insecurity, huh?

293
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,190
Saying bibimguksu tastes like
bibimguksu is the highest praise.

294
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,330
Oh, okay.

295
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,550
Hey, your dad is gaming with Hyo Ri again.

296
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,160
Isn't he addicted at this rate?

297
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,290
His eyes change when he plays games.

298
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,020
This is no good.

299
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,030
We'll put a screen time limit on his phone.

300
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,170
We'll put the computer in the living room.

301
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,650
Let's go shopping next week.

302
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,260
Don't tell Dad. Just the two of us.

303
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,060
Shopping with him makes you lose your temper.

304
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,020
He tries on all the clothes at the shop.

305
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,330
I know. It's not like he buys it afterward.

306
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,300
It's so annoying when he just leaves.

307
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,620
That's what I'm saying.

308
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,900
That's why we should go without him.

309
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,610
Okay.

310
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,390
And when you drive to Seoul later,

311
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,590
take breaks if you feel tired.

312
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,090
Don't drive sleepy to look cool.

313
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,050
Okay.

314
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,980
Wow, this is...

315
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,780
You eat so well. Must be tasty.

316
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,530
Wow. Can't believe this taste.

317
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,430
- Eat it all.
- Okay.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,300
- I'll make it for you again.
- Again?

319
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,020
Are you waiting for Bo Hyeon?

320
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,460
Yes.

321
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,260
You must be going somewhere nice.

322
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,120
I wanted to visit my old school.

323
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,050
Hyo Ri,

324
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,160
do you know why I become a doctor?

325
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,680
I got spectacular grades.

326
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,720
Medicine was my profession.

327
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,290
I tried living as best as I could.

328
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,050
But when I was about to retire,

329
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,170
I realized I wasn't so good with the patients.

330
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,290
I couldn't figure out the reason why.

331
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,110
But I understand now that I'm a patient.

332
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,350
The things I neglected as a doctor.

333
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,150
The patients' lethargy.

334
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,100
I thought that providing the answer based on

335
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,770
my knowledge was the best approach.

336
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,610
But I was wrong.

337
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,480
I should've understood their hopeless and

338
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,430
<i>powerless feelings first.</i>

339
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,200
<i>Understanding the indefinable fear.</i>

340
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,540
<i>That should've been my first step
in approaching patients.</i>

341
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,290
That's why...

342
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,590
I think you'd be different from me.

343
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,450
I'll stop now.

344
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,040
Because I'm an advanced boomer
who knows when to stop.

345
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,600
It went well, didn't it?

346
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,840
How did you know?

347
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
You know how much I'm into you.

348
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,630
I can just tell from your face.

349
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,510
- The dean asked...
- Yes.

350
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,580
if I want to resume, even
after knowing how tough it is.

351
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,360
- He asked if I'd regret.
- Yeah.

352
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,190
So, I told him that...

353
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,300
I desperately need this extremely
challenging and tiring life back.

354
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,860
That I think I can get back to it.

355
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,600
Good job.

356
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,850
It's okay if your current decision is wrong.

357
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,340
You can figure things out again.

358
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,530
Right?

359
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,540
That's different than regretting.

360
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,740
I even know the secret of life that
most people don't know.

361
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,800
Hardship isn't something you
overcome, fight, and defeat.

362
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,670
You just need to accept that it's a part of life

363
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,440
and decide on your attitude toward it.

364
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,510
You can't do this.

365
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,840
You can't make my heart flutter
like this. It's hard.

366
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,940
So, when will you tell Ahjumma?

367
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,880
I should tell her now.

368
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,210
I didn't want Mom to wait anxiously.

369
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,600
She's been anxious a lot because of me, anyway.

370
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,820
She'd be happy.

371
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
- You think so?
- Yeah.

372
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,640
I want to tell you something, too.

373
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,410
I want to try studying.

374
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,570
There's a landscape design program
in Berlin that I wanted to join.

375
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,550
I've been looking into it for two years.

376
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,420
I sent my portfolio, and they reached
out and told me to apply.

377
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll have to go sooner to study the language.

378
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,200
I want to apply for the next semester.

379
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
Since you're making this cool decision,
I feel confident, too.

380
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,990
Bo Hyeon...

381
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,360
you're the coolest...

382
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,190
when you talk about flowers, trees,

383
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,230
gardens, dirt, and stuff like that.

384
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,560
I'm sure you'll have so much fun studying.

385
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,230
This is great.

386
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,130
Are you sad about us being apart?

387
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,690
No.

388
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,730
To be honest, very much so.

389
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,340
Me, too.

390
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,970
But this is the right way.

391
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,480
Shall we?

392
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,920
Yes.

393
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,280
Wow. They're growing so well.

394
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,920
Right? All on their own.

395
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
Aren't you so proud of them?

396
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,390
How are they so smart?

397
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,080
Someone said this is how nature works.

398
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,990
Gosh, you're so unsentimental.

399
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,620
How will you survive
the 21st century, the era of EQ?

400
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,230
I know, huh?

401
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,600
- Are you done?
- I'm done. Let's go.

402
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,370
Mom,

403
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,710
I think I'll go back to school.

404
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,970
What?

405
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,480
To learn more about readmission,

406
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,470
I went to school and met with the dean today.

407
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,870
No. It'd be too hard on you. You can't.

408
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,530
Mom.

409
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,570
I'm trying to live.

410
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm trying to live well, even.

411
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,310
You know how difficult it is.

412
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,030
Mom, I really want to do it.

413
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,890
Rather than worrying about whether
I could do well or if it'd be too tough,

414
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,140
I really want to do it.

415
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,830
Sharing the knowledge I learned by working hard.

416
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,790
That's what I want to do.

417
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,930
I won't abuse my body.

418
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,050
I have you by my side.

419
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,870
For Bo Hyeon, Auntie, Dr. Jung, Ahjussi,

420
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,290
I won't waste my body away for the sake
of people I love.

421
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,880
I'll cherish it.

422
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,400
You won't change your mind,
no matter what I say, right?

423
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
No.

424
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,450
Geez, you're just like me.

425
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,660
I trust you, Hyo Ri.

426
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,130
I knew you'd support me, Mom.

427
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,540
So, Mom,

428
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,280
would you like to go somewhere with me on Sunday?

429
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,430
Right. Sook is coming tomorrow.

430
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,350
Why? Does she miss my scolding?

431
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,110
Let's eat fruit. Let's eat fruit.

432
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,200
Where's Dr. Jung? Dr. Jung, let's eat fruit!

433
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,170
- Dr. Jung!
- It's apples.

434
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,890
Come eat. It's so tasty.

435
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,930
Have some apples, Dr. Jung.

436
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,220
It's delicious.

437
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,680
Well, I have something to say.

438
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,810
I'm thinking of going back to Seoul now.

439
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,910
I've inconvenienced you a lot.

440
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,040
I should go back to where I belong.

441
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,780
I put the villa on the market.

442
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,300
I'm looking for a place where
I could receive care in Seoul.

443
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,990
Why? Why?

444
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,850
Why are you suddenly going to Seoul? Why?

445
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,410
Hyo Ri is doing well.

446
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,600
And if I stayed here, I might end up
being a burden to you.

447
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,430
- Dr. Jung, this is where you belong.
- Yes.

448
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,400
Our relationship is special.

449
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,310
We save, lean on, and support each other.

450
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,760
Unlike a family that was just given to you,

451
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,880
relationships like ours, that were formed

452
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,640
through complicated connections are...

453
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,800
What do you call that? What do you call that?

454
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,360
Bbaebak*. You call it bbaebak.
(Means "getting stuck")

455
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,500
A relationship like this can't be sustained
if we didn't like each other a lot.

456
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,740
It's bbaebak because we like each other, right?

457
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,610
Yes.

458
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,080
If I stayed here-

459
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,670
It's because we like you.

460
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,430
Not because we're grateful or feel guilty.

461
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,160
It's not out of moral obligations, either.

462
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,310
- It's because we like you a lot.
- Right.

463
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,500
- So, live with us.
- Yes.

464
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,800
Dr. Jung, we all know well.

465
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,400
Delaying or holding back feelings
when you like someone is foolish.

466
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,210
It's foolish.

467
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,690
Because we like each other.

468
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,730
Let's have fun and live together
since we like each other.

469
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,960
If you feel uncomfortable around us,

470
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,310
I have nothing to say, but...

471
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,820
Is that how it is, by chance?

472
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,590
Is that so?

473
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,490
No. Gosh, come on.

Didn't your heart skip a beat?

480
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,540
There's no turning back once a heart skips a beat.

481
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,610
No turning back.

482
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,370

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,580
Hey.

541
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,010
How did you get so strong?

542
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,810
- I'm strong, right?
- Yes.

543
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,200
Hey.

544
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,230
- Hi.
- Hey, come on.

545
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,270
Did you come to greet me? Did you miss me?

546
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,580
Did you wait for me?

547
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,490
What took you so long?

548
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,910
Yo.

549
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,360
Wow, Dong Seok. What's the deal?

550
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,570
I've zoned out watching water and fire,

551
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,790
but I've never been hypnotized by someone grilling.

552
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,560
Wow. You're good.

553
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,540
Don't be fooled.

554
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,820
She's tricking you.

555
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,410
She wants to eat a lot of meat.

556
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,900
So, she's trying to exploit you.

557
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,840
- Hey.
- What?

558
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,000
She's way too good at reading the air.

559
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,360
I'll get us ice cream. Ice cream.

560
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,420
I-I want to pick one myself.

561
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,560
Where are you going?

562
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,810
We're getting ice cream.

563
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,560
See you.

564
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,010
When are you leaving again, Bo Hyeon?

565
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,960
I miss him already.

566
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,700
Shouldn't you guys go on a farewell trip?

567
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,620
He gets indigestion while traveling. We can't.

568
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,570
That happened for the first time in my life.

569
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,970
First time in my life, I said.

570
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,530
Yes.

571
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,200
It wasn't because you were nervous and afraid.

572
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,750
Right?

573
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,080
It's okay.

574
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,710
You've already kissed.

575
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,930
When the time comes, it'd naturally-

576
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

577
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,570
Look at you two.

578
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,220
Wow. Look at them acting innocent.

579
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,620
Is kissing bad? Huh?

580
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,940
Kissing isn't a sin.

581
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,320
- They're here.
- Hey, Jae Dong.

582
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,690
When was the last time you kissed, Jae Dong?

583
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,570
K-Kiss?

584
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,120
Hey.

585
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,180
Really?

586
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,160
Look at him blushing.

587
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,530
Why are you touching your lips?

588
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,300
Hold on. They look puffy.

589
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,540
- It was just now!
- Hey, keep grilling.

590
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,460
- Hey, Lee Sook.
- Seriously.

591
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,000
- Lee Sook. Lee Sook.
- Enough is enough.

592
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,140
I won't take any questions.

593
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,130
Hey, keep grilling.

594
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,930
Am I not allowed to date?

595
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,460
<i>♫ I'm the hottest one ♫</i>

596
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,560
<i>♫ I'm the hottest one ♫</i>

597
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,710
[Ryu Jeong Seok]

598
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,320
Oppa, I'm at a karaoke.

599
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
The CEO can't leave early.

600
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,790
That goes against work ethics.

601
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,550
Yes, I'm totally fine.

602
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,760
Alcohol?

603
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,100
Maybe a glass? Or two?

604
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,550
I don't remember.

605
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,320
<i>Why do you look like a ripe tomato, then?</i>

606
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,640
No, you're mistaken.

607
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,930
It's because of hot flashes, not alcohol.

608
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,780
Come out.

609
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,360
Hyo Ri is going back to school,
and Bo Hyeon is studying abroad.

610
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,240
I think I'll feel lonely.

611
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,970
Hyo Ri and Bo Hyeon will support
each other and do well.

612
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,430
It's their lives.

613
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,930
We just need to support them quietly from afar.

614
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,440
Oppa,

615
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:14,800
the fact that my life wasn't normal was a burden.

616
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,660
But I don't think normal is such a set notion.

617
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,070
My life revolves around me.

618
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,070
I get to decide what normal means in my universe.

619
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:32,290
I don't know why I tried to meet
other people's criteria.

620
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,910
I'm inside that universe, right?

621
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,790
My universe is shining thanks to you.

622
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Look at you flirting while pretending to be drunk.

623
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,920
By the way, the route
for our walk is a bit secluded.

624
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,180
No, it's not. We walk here all the time.

625
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,520
It's brightly lit, too.

626
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,080
Is it secluded?

627
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,520
Feels dark and remote?

628
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,540
There's no one around.

629
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,520
And mosquitoes are buzzing.

630
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,530
You cheeky little...

631
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,600
I feel dizzy.

632
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,250
I can't disappoint you.

633
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,770
Careful. Let's sit here for a second.

634
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,420
- What's with you?
- Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

635
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,140
<i>♫ I'm the hottest one ♫</i>

636
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,690
<i>♫ I'm the hottest one ♫</i>

637
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,110
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

638
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,060
- What are you trying to do?
- Gosh.

639
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,660
Geez.

640
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,120
Hey, I'm drunk. I'm leaving.

641
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,210
Drink more without me.

642
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,620
You're drunk. You're drunk.

643
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,830
What are you saying?

644
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,570
That wasn't enough alcohol to reach your stomach.

645
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,180
Where's your stomach?

646
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,770
I said your body is a murder weapon.

647
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,550
Let's go. I'm the hottest one.

648
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,790
Let's go.

649
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,310
Let's go, Wu Seok. Let's go.

650
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,370
Get home safely.

651
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,500
How about we go to the tented
snack bar over there... No.

652
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:41,800
There's a really nice cafe nearby...

653
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,540
How cute.

654
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,060
Hey, I have ears.

655
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,670
I have both of them.

656
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,920
- I have nostrils and teeth.
- Yes.

657
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,090
- I have eyes.
- Oh, no. Yes, yes, Gosh.

658
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,020
What do you mean...

659
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,350
Of course, I have ears.

660
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,140
- That makes no sense.
- Sorry, Chef Kim. You have two ears.

661
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,670
- It's okay.
- Okay, okay.

662
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,670
- Let's go home.
- Okay. Let's your go home.

663
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,830
Okay.

664
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,580
- Here.
- Thank you.

665
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,650
Bottoms up.

666
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,460
Thank you.

667
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,220
Give me that.

668
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,750
Do you talk to your mom often these days?

669
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,770
Be good to her.

670
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,130
See her often when you can.

671
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,820
You have to.

672
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,440
If you come to our place sometime,

673
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,470
I'll make you something delicious-

674
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,900
Tae Oh.

675
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,410
Yes?

676
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,280
Don't you think that...

677
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,810
felt a bit awkward?

678
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,870
Depending on your perspective,

679
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,390
it can be, and maybe not.

680
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,680
Depending on perspectives.

681
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,480
You tease me a lot these days.

682
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,250
I'm not. I like you.

683
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,840
What?

684
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,350
I like you.

685
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,600
Wait for me. Wait for me. Wait for me.

686
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,910
<i>Bye!</i>

687
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,660
<i>See you at the restaurant!</i>

688
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,370
Hey, I'm not joking!

689
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,730
I really like you!

690
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,960
Bye.

691
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,520
<i>Bye!</i>

692
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,660
What is he? Does he think he's Seon Jae*?
(Referring to a drama)

693
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,990
I ate too much meat. I feel...

694
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,150
Are you not digesting?
Do you want a digestive pill?

695
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,790
No, I'm stuffed. I'll sleep well.

696
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,950
I'll transfer to the nursing department.

697
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,060
Hey, do you mean that?

698
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:11,090
I've been considering it since
you started medical school.

699
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,220
But I didn't have the courage.

700
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,300
But I think I can do it now.

701
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,930
It's a good thing.

702
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,580
Let's become a doctor and a nurse

703
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,360
and do a lot of good things.

704
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,640
You jerks.

705
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,960
What about me, then? What would I do?

706
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,430
You...

707
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,800
Consultation manager.

708
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,900
Wow.

709
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,920
I like that.

710
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,710
- Do you?
- Yeah.

711
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,020
When you become one, can you get
me a quote for a nose job?

712
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,590
- I'm serious.
- How about urology? Urology.

713
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,140
Hey.

714
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,500
If you like that...

715
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,460
Hey, you have chili pepper on your braces.

716
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,280
Really? Geez.

717
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,600
- You didn't brush your teeth, did you?
- No.

718
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,950
Are you busy?

719
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,160
No, no. I sent out all the flowers. Why?

720
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,700
Well, I was just passing by.

721
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,750
Aren't you busy?

722
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:31,880
I'm always busy, you know.

723
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,100
What?

724
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,590
Are you sad that I'm leaving?

725
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,350
Hey. What's there to be sad about?

726
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,490
You'll be coming home here and there.

727
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,340
You won't be there that long. Why would I be sad?

728
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,040
I know. Don't worry, Dad.

729
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,500
Geez. I'm not worried.

730
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,410
You'll do just fine.

731

You have Mom nearby, too.

732
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:04,590
I'm telling you not to worry
because I'll think about you a lot.

733
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,110
I won't let you miss me alone.

734
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,370
Dad,

735
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,170
if you knew how much I care about you,

736
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,160
you'd cry.

737
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,320
Father,

738
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,540
If you knew how big a mountain you were to me,

739
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,530
you'd cry, I said.

740
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
You, too, man.

[Han Cho Rong]

742
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,700
I thought you'd be very worried.

743
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,620
I'm okay.

744
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,110
I came to tell you that I'm totally okay.

745
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,520
I'm going back to school, too.

746
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,670
Aren't you proud of her?

747
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,260
She must've been so stressed.

748
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,390
But she didn't show it...

749
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,510
not to stress me out...

750
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,190
Well, that's not entirely true.

751
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,630
She acted so mean...

752
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,310
and she's been torturing me. But we've been well.

753
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,260
Mom is...

754
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,320
a good mom.

755
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,580
She's a good mom, a good adult,

756
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:13,050
and a good person.

757
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,660
She must've been upset often because of me.

758
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,300
But she never gave up on me, even for a moment.

759
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,790
She didn't make me feel lonely
when I was struggling.

760
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,000
She held me tight.

761
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,910
<i>You must've been exactly my age.</i>

762
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,350
<i>I couldn't have made the same decision.</i>

763

Thank you for protecting me.

764
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,440
I've always wanted to tell you that.

765
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,360

Gosh. Seriously.

So annoying. What's with me? Why-

772
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,590
Why should I run away?

773
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,190
Did I do something wrong?

774
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,180
Gosh, seriously.

Hey, Kim Seon Yeong, are you lonely?

He just has a nice body, he's cute, and sweet.

There are tons of men like that.

Let's not get too excited here.

780
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,690
Let's not.

781
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,200
Hi.

You must be going somewhere.

Yes, yes. I need to go somewhere.

785
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,040
See you tomorrow.

786
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,880
Okay. Bye.

Why are you not flirting?

790
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,020
- Pardon?
- If you flirted once,

791
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,260
you should try more.

792
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,950
I didn't think you would,
but you give up so easily.

793

Should I flirt?

794
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,010
Don't if you don't want to.

795
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,360

Hey, you!

Hello, Doctor.

812
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,610
There are always two or three a year.

813
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,160
The ones who pass out in the OR.

814
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,770
I always say this,

815

but if you can't even take that much,
give up on being a doctor. Okay?

Scalpel.

Yes.

823
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,970
Any other symptoms? Headache, spasms,

824
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,600
fatigue, or memory decline?

825
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Not really.

826
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,920
Some parts are a bit swollen,

827
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,180
but that's common after radiology treatments.

828
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,540
I don't detect any relapse anywhere else.

829
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,900

You'll learn once you study.

834
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,300
Treatments aren't entirely up to doctors.

835
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,670
Patients do half and doctors do the other half.

What did the doctor say?

845
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,900
He said the numbers improved.

846

He wants to adjust the prescription.

847
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,620
He was optimistic. How about you?

848
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,040

Well, it's tiring...

854
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,150
but I'm not tired.

856
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,090
Don't worry.

857
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,010
You'll be okay after the surgery.

858
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,260
He's a really famous doctor and-

859
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,410
How do you know that?

860
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,300
I'll be okay after the surgery?
How will I be okay?

861
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,610
Who guarantees that the surgery will save me?

862
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:50,060
Su Ah.

863
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,960
I won't get the surgery.

864
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,240
I'll just live however I want and die.

865
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,040
<i>I don't want to live tenaciously anymore.</i>

866

<i>What difference does it make?</i>

867
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,350
<i>I'll just live a boring life and die.</i>

868
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,670
Are you scared?

869
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,670
I'm not, okay?

870
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,930
I was really scared, too.

871
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,070
So much so that I wanted to run away.

872
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,770
I was just like you a year ago.

873
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,940
<i>I wondered why this was only happening to me.</i>

874
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,640
<i>It wasn't fair.</i>

875
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,550
My world felt so dark.

876
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,400
So, it's okay to cry.

877
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,720
You can cry if you want to.

878
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,270
But don't tire yourself out.

879
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,310
I promise you.

880
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:14,910
In hardships,

881
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,330
the new world comes.

882
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:22,210
You'll be a lot stronger and
cooler than you are now.

883
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:30,620
The illness is bad luck. It's not our fault.

884
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:36,320
But good luck and bad luck come as a set.

885
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,930
You can cry all you want.

886
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,790
But don't miss out on fortune.

887
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,310
We'll meet again.

888
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,670
See you again.

889
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,800
Guys, it's been 30 minutes.

890
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,680
Just leave them. They must be so sad.

891
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,070
But still. Thirty minutes is too much.

892
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,920
It's not right.

893
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,880
Beware of Jenny.

894
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,610
Who's Jenny?

895
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,340
It has a symbolic meaning.

896
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,350
I'm telling you to beware of women. Women, women.

897
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,550
Stop being cute, I said. Stop.

898
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53,880
You're making me miss you already.

01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,070
Gosh. Seriously.

- What do you mean, top scholar?

905
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,220
It holds a symbolic meaning, okay?

906

Hey. You're running late. Get going.

Don't worry about anything.

Beware of Charles.

That was a symbolic expression, right?

920

Don't let anyone find out you're cute.

921
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,150
That would be kind of hard.

922

But I'll try.

923
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,060
Okay.

Why is it so heavy?

932
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,610
It has dried sweet potatoes,
dried fish, and crispy rice in it.
