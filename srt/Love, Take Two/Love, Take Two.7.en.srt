Yes, the owner needs to sing for the opening.

182
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,971
My gosh.

183
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,721
I won't get up until I hear her sing.

184
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,921
- Sing.
- I can't sing.

185
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,181
- Come on.
- You sing the Deux song well.

186
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,981
You can dance, too.

187
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,671
Were you a Deux fan? Me, too.

188
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,101
Sing, sing.

189
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,241
Applause, applause!

190
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:38,251
<i>♫ We'll get started right here, right now ♫</i>

191
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,821
<i>♫ D.E.U.X. Deux ♫</i>

192
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,371
Okay, everyone.

193
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:54,721
I was wondering what was missing.

194
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,161
We forgot to give toasts.

195
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:02,411
Gosh, let's hear her sing first.

196
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:04,321
It's an opening party, after all.

197
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:08,321
Just singing and having a talent
show won't be meaningful.

198
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,311
- I agree.
- Yes.

199
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:15,161
Everyone should say a blessing
to show support and make it meaningful.

200
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,721
Blessing? Yes, sounds great.

201
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:24,921
I can tell she's been to many parties abroad.

202
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:28,211
- Yes, yes.
- How about you...

203
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,021
say a blessing first, Bo Hyeon's mom?

204
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,431
Should I?

205
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:33,921
Should I?

206
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:37,731
Okay, then. Fill up your glasses.

207
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,591
- Okay.
- Let's fill them.

208
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:44,881
Here I go.

209
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,041
If you run a business with this skill level,

210
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:56,941
you'll be opening the second
and third branches soon.

211
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,051
This place will satisfy our hunger and lonely souls

212
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,621
with the cook's skills and generosity.

213
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,031
For Nature is a Masterpiece's success.

214
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>For success!</i>

215
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,841
I hope it's a success.

216
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,021
<i>Don't drink more. Slow down.</i>

217
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,071
What are you doing, Hyung?

218
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:31,621
Did I tell you to call me Hyung or not?

219
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:34,501
Gosh. Just call him Hyungssi.

220
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,821
Mr. Ryu sounds good. How's Mr. Ryu?

221
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,601
Mr. Ryu. Mr. Ryu hyung.

222
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,291
That sounds good. Hand that to me.

223
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,841
Are you upset?

224
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:50,301
She always needed to be
at the center, even in college.

225
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,221
She always sticks out like that.

226
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:57,891
We used to call that annoying
and obnoxious back in our day.

227
00:13:57,891 --> 00:14:00,521
The mood has been lifted, thanks to her.

228
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:03,821
I'm grateful. Don't worry.

229
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,151
Honey,

230
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,371
I think I'm a bit drunk.

231
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,581
I want to go home.

232
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,121
My purse.

233
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,961
It must be outside.

234
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,741
Bring it to me.

235
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:29,421
Ji An, you know...

236
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:34,921
I'm not used to Jeong Seok
being nice to other women.

237
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:41,501
To be honest, I hate it so much.

238
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,971
I almost got jealous of you.

239
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,651
Oppa isn't nice to me. He yells at me often.

240
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:49,521
That "Oppa."

241
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,021
That sounds a bit off, doesn't it?

242
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,791
It makes you look too close.

243
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,731
Hey. Ji An, Ji An,

244
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,801
everyone's leaving. They're leaving.

245
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,341
Are you making Toast Part 2 here?

246
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,521
Let's see them off. Let's.

247
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,701
- Let's see them off.
- Let's go.

248
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,061
Thank you.

249
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,861
- Gosh.
- Gosh, gosh.

250
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:17,121
She was standing just fine.

251
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,901
Let's go.

252
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:23,431
- Gosh.
- Don't, don't.

253
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,741
I said I can do it myself.

254
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,801
I don't think you'd be done since you're so slow.

255
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,271
Did you have dinner?

256
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,731
I didn't feel hungry because I was too busy.

257
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,161
Go. Go and eat something.

258
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,881
It's okay. I'm really not hungry.

259
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,721
You have soap on your face.

260
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,721
- Where?
- Let me see. Here.

261
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:04,091
There. That looks better now.

262
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,521
What was that?

263
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,161
You should rest, too. I'll finish this up.

264
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,361
I'd get yelled at for exploiting a customer.

265
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:19,481
Hey, why are you exploiting a customer?

266
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:27,651
Bo Hyeon is my dragon hunter
heir I'm raising, okay?

267
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,711
You're raising me? I didn't know.

268
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,621
It's okay since you know now.

269
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:36,721
Let's go unless you're going to
do the dishes. I'm busy tomorrow.

270
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:40,021
- How dare you look at me like that?
- Be quiet.

271
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:43,511
- Thank you.
- Gosh, what's with you two?

272
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,221
Should I tease them?

273
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:48,761
Why interrupt them and make things awkward?

274
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:52,181
We'll walk away as if we saw nothing.

275
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,571
Go ahead and continue.

276
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:55,751
Yes.

277
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:59,121
- See you.
- Bye.

278
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,481
- Did you guys do something?
<i>- No.</i>

279
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,861
We did nothing. We were only doing the dishes.

280
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,521
- Just dishes.
- Yes.

281
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,891
Bo Hyeon, son...

282
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,341
let's go home.

283
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,411
I should get going.

284
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,671
Make sure to eat something.

285
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:25,041
In the near future,

286
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,521
their family tree might get complicated.

287
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:31,721
I sense an interesting situation.

288
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:36,081
There will be wild love affairs
in different generations.

289
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,321
Oh, my.

290
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,921
- Chef.
- Yes.

291
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:46,421
People praised your cooking skills so much.

292
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:50,361
I knew her multi-sensory and
soulful recipes would work.

293
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,521
Multi-sensory what?

294
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:56,331
You definitely ate her food with your mouth,

295
00:17:56,331 --> 00:18:00,691
but it feels like a hug in your heart.

296
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,061
I always felt energized eating her food.

297
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:08,921
You're being silly because you don't want to work.

298
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,391
Finish this up. Gosh...

299
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:14,281
I should stretch my back.

300
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,671
Gosh.

301
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,121
Congrats.

302
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:36,971
Ji An, I should feel tired,

303
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:38,881
but I don't at all.

304
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,671
I know.

305
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:43,441
This has always been your dream.

306
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:48,421
It's an honor to work with Chef Kim Seon Yeong.

307
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,871
Hey, it's an honor for me, too.

308
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,521
Hey.

309
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:56,821
Don't get scared and trust me. I'll trust you.

310
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,771
Let's not try to be good. Let's just be ourselves.

311
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,141
Got it?

312
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,501
I'm not scared. Why would I be?

313
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,971
You're by my side.

314
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,791
I have Hyo Ri, too.

315
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,091
We can do anything.

316
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:17,391
In that light, use that starting
tomorrow. That thing.

317
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,521
Hey, people live to a hundred these days.

318
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,781
If we have good health and romance,

319
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:26,621
we'll be young for 60 more years.

320
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,061
- Okay?
- Okay.

321
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,681
Okay.

322
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,331
Nice.

323
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,181
Give me a hug.

324
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,781
Ji An...

325
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,631
It hurts. Geez.

326
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,601
Seriously.

327
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,221
Do you want to fight?

328
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,201
Come here. Come here.

329
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,801
Come here. I'll catch you!

330
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,911
Come here...

331
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,201
Come!

332
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:08,081
No, no.

333
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,021
Gosh...

334
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,811
I definitely knew how to bike.

335
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:18,331
Calm down first. Hold on.

336
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:20,541
Sit up and...

337
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,211
put my feet up like this...

338
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:24,961
and kick!

339
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:27,201
Here I go. Here I go. Here I go.

340
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,221
Here I go.

341
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:42,551
Look forward! Look forward!

342
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,451
Are you okay?

343
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,361
Gosh, Oppa.

344
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,871
Hold tightly. Hold tightly.

345
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,661
There's only so much I can do.

346
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:56,021
How could you not know how to ride a bike?

347
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,021
I do, but I forgot momentarily.

348
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:01,991
Because I have good motor skills,

349
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,661
my body will remember quickly.

350
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:07,791
It's been two hours. How could you say that?

351
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,431
Gosh, hold on.

352
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,811
I mean...

353
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:16,071
you have to hold tightly and help me balance

354
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:17,901
so I could pedal.

355
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,121
Why are you so weak?

356
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:24,421
Since we're on the topic, whenever
I saw your feminine arms,

357
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:29,021
I thought, "You need muscles. How's he
planning to age with arms like that?"

358
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,061
- Feminine?
- Yes.

359
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,171
You little.

360
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,271
If you don't have muscles when you're old,

361
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,981
you become E.T.

362
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:38,681
You'll have thin limbs and a pot belly.

363
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,821
E.T. is cute, at least. You aren't even cute.

364
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:44,301
Gosh, look.

365
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:48,681
Your legs are so skinny that your pants
flap around like a flag.

366
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:52,051
I'm going. Oppa, you see?

367
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,881
I'm moving on my own.

368
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,611
I said I have good motor skills.

369
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:58,491
Look!

370
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:08,821
There was a nurse on duty, thankfully.

371
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:12,031
- Let's put ointment on.
- I'm okay.

372
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,611
I'm not okay with it.

373
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:17,131
Don't ignore the pain.

374
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:20,751
It'd hurt less if you take care of it.

375
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,591
I'll help you ride next time, too.

376
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,611
Don't ride alone and get injured.

377
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,901
Bo Hyeon's mom is pretty.

378
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:45,881
Should we agree not to bring up our exes?

379
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,801
I'd be happy to.

380
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,441
All right.

381
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:06,721
Take a break if you're in that much pain.

382
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:10,771
My corn is very strong.

383
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,641
Cornea, do you mean?

384
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,771
Cornea.

385
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:17,491
Yes, cornea. Cornea.

386
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:19,751
Mine is strong.

387
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,331
Our kitchen's future is bleak.

388
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,181
- Pardon?
- Whatever.

389
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:29,611
Here. Taste this. Say, ah.

390
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:34,421
Hey, I told you not to be too chummy.

391
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,071
Whatever. Is your bike okay?

392
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:39,221
It's in shock right now.

393
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:41,991
I rode it at full speed.

394
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:44,501
- I'll take a shower.
- Okay.

395
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,211
It's in shock, she said.

396
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:48,491
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Come again.

397
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,921
- Okay.
- Take care.

398
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:54,521
[Nature is a Masterpiece]
That was tasty. Let's come back.

399
00:23:56,221 --> 00:24:00,381
I hoped we'd get as many customers as yesterday,

400
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,431
but we didn't.

401
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:06,421
Welcome.

402
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:08,721
Huh? Hello.

403
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,021
Gosh.

404
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,631
What's this?

405
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,201
Thank you.

406
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:29,801
Why didn't you come yesterday?

407
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,291
Thankfully, we had some pyeonyuk left.

408
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,071
You came.

409
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:39,221
Are you okay? Do you have any discomfort?

410
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,911
I'm totally fine.

411
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:42,771
Have a seat here.

412
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:49,821
You've been taking the meds on time, right?

413
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,311
Do you feel dizzy or have a headache?

414
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:56,121
I haven't had a headache since we switched meds.

415
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,061
But my heart palpitates a bit.

416
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:03,011
Do you notice it as soon as you take the meds?

417
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:05,981
Not exactly.

418
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:09,711
I should check if it has caffeine in it.

419
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,091
Just have bread for breakfast.

420
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,011
You spend too much time cooking.

421
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,981
Bo Hyeon always eats rice for breakfast.

422
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,481
Really?

423
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:32,101
I didn't know.

424
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,111
That's why your cooking skills improved.

425
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,081
Right.

426
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,151
I have to inspect the job site.

427
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:44,361
Could you come along as an advisor?

428
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:46,771
There should be a list in the inspection manual.

429
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:48,121
Look at that and figure it out.

430
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:52,131
I have the first list, but I want to improve it.

431
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:53,521
Please?

432
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:59,721
Never mind.

433
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:02,281
I should ask someone else.

434
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:09,651
I said I can go alone. You shouldn't have come.

435
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,521
Is this how Mom feels?

436
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:15,521
This bag is heavy because
she packed so many side dishes.

437
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,921
- By the way...
- Yes?

438
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,271
Could you have a look at this?

439
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:38,601
Are you receiving a package from abroad?

440
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,101
It's my daughter's belongings.

441
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:46,871
I'll call and ask them to change
the address to here.

442
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:09,931
- I'm back.
- Hey.

443
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,581
It tastes just like my mom's.

444
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:37,721
I suddenly teared up.

445
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,421
- That means it's tasty, right?
- Pardon?

446
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:44,421
Not all mothers are good cooks.

447
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:51,381
You're so off the wall, Ji An.

448
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:58,621
By the way, I have a favor to ask.

449
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,821
Plot inspection advisor?

450
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:07,421
You're the expert. Why do you need my help?

451
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:10,721
You have way more experience in Korea than I do.

452
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:14,251
- More job site experience, too.
- I'm not that experienced.

453
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:16,531
I was just a construction site manager.

454
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:19,851
Gosh, why is she suddenly so modest?

455
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,201
She told me not to get intimidated.

456
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,281
And I have a lot to do since our shop just opened.

457
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,221
We don't get that many customers yet, right?

458
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:31,961
How would we have time to eat corn otherwise?

459
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,921
It's okay if you can't.

460
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,321
- It's not polite to insist-
- I'll do it.

461
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,011
That's surprising.

462
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:46,431
I just need to give you my opinion
based on what I know.

463
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:48,681
I don't see why not.

464
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:51,571
I do have many years of experience.

465
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,791
When and where should I meet you?

466
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,021
It's so good.

467
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,261
Here. Cheers.

468
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:12,751
Thank you.

469
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,121
Have some manners.

470
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:20,161
How refreshing.

471
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:22,701
Fine.

472
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:27,401
By the way, for today's inspection,

473
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:30,221
Ji An agreed to be my advisor.

474
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:33,971
- What?
- It's better to ask someone trustworthy.

475
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:35,961
I'll go now.

476
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,551
Where's the job site again?

477
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,141
The safety plan follows the legal codes, right?

478
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:55,421
Of course. We followed the codes.

479
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,221
Here are the construction law requirements.

480
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:03,421
But there aren't enough safety
managers for the size of the site.

481
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:07,441
We assigned more people than are required.

482
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,961
That's just the minimum requirement.

483
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:13,801
Considering the shape of the site
and the structure to be built,

484
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,021
there aren't nearly enough as is.

485
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:19,601
You need a sufficient number
of managers with different roles

486
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,671
to effectively prevent accidents.

487
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,721
We would've if the budget allowed it.

488
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:27,121
- Based on the budget-
- Let's do that.

489
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:30,381
As Ms. Lee said, considering the site condition,

490
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:33,121
- we should have about three more.
- Okay.

491
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,851
- Please update the safety plan.
- Got it.

492
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:38,641
The budget is just a budget.

493
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:41,021
I have the authority to change it.

494
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:43,821
- I'll update it immediately.
- Okay.

495
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:04,791
How about the safety plan
for the riverside construction?

496
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,511
Here it is.

497
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:14,021
Nice.

498
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:17,221
Hire local professors as the board of advisors.

499
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:21,221
As for the riverside construction,

500
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:25,581
include people from the local
environmental group on the board-

501
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:28,511
Meeting their demands would be

502
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,131
practically impossible.

503
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,841
We might be adding unnecessary noise.

504
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,291
It's not unnecessary noise. You can say

505
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,321
it's a way to get the most realistic advice.

506
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:41,081
Considering the future of the building for the

507
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,651
next decades and hundreds of years,

508
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,261
it'd be good to listen to the ones
who worked hard on the site-

509
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,041
Whose advisor is she?

510
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,711
Team Leader,

511
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:55,371
she was hired as an advisor for us.

512
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:01,121
Ji An, we're not in a position where

513
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:06,221
we can't simply focus on the site like you do.

514
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:11,541
Considering balance in the site,
policies, business, and public interest,

515
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,281
we need to make a decision
with a big picture in mind.

516
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:17,401
It means we're on a different level.

517
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,301
Do you understand?

518
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:20,841
You do, right?

519
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,431
Yes, of course.

520
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:23,921
I just...

521
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:26,451
- didn't want any issues during-
- I understand.

522
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:29,841
We'll make the decision.

523
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,521
Okay.

524
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:34,771
- Please form a team of professors as I mentioned.
- Okay.

525
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:38,001
- Please arrange a meeting with them.
- Got it.

526
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,431
Is there more paperwork we need to work on?

527
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,121
Hurry.

528
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,761
- Come now.
- Is everything okay? What? What is it?

529
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:00,461
Hold on.

530
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:05,321
Look at this. Isn't it amazing?

531
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:11,301
This... This is how nature works, isn't it?

532
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,821
Don't take it for granted.

533
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:17,291
Isn't it so cute? Aren't you so proud of it?

534
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,321
Geez.

535
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,191
Excuse me.

536
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:29,321
Let me ask you something.

537
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:48,621
Gosh.

538
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,591
You worked hard. You should
have something to drink.

539
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:54,051
It's okay.

540
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:56,621
We'll go back before it gets darker.

541
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:58,561
- Let's go.
- Okay.

542
00:33:58,561 --> 00:34:00,391
We'll get going.

543
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,911
<i>She must've had a hard time.</i>

544
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:31,771
Yeah.

545
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,681
I didn't know she was a doctor, either.

546
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,851
She was famous, apparently.

547
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:40,261
She helped us a lot when I was hospitalized.

548
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,521
Seeing her at the hospital,

549
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:48,961
I wondered what would've happened
if I had stayed in school for the first time.

550
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,381
If I want to do something later,

551
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,651
I'm afraid it'd be too late then.

552
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:56,531
When is later?

553
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,331
When is later, I asked.

554
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:31,051
We're almost there.

555
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,721
Where are we going? I'm scared.

556
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:44,241
Have a seat.

557
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:50,321
You know a lot of secluded spots.

558
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:55,621
It must've been good for dating
with so many secluded spots, huh?

559
00:35:55,621 --> 00:36:00,621
So, I'm thinking of doing something
you can do only in secluded spots.

560
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:03,741
Like what?

561
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:14,911
They're late-summer fireflies.

562
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,661
They show up in late summer

563
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:20,521
after regular fireflies are gone.

564
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:25,421
They're bigger since they show up
late and brighter, too.

565
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:32,121
They're so beautiful, I could cry.

566
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:33,621
Seeing them,

567
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:36,521
it's not a bad thing to be late.

568
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:41,161
They brighten the darkness more
since they took more time.

569
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:44,641
Don't be anxious that you're behind.

570
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:47,941
Thinking about how you will shine

571
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,951
carefully is more important.

572
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,861
I see.

573
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,351
There's no need to be impatient.

574
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:13,791
But I...

575
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:20,011
I need to tell you something.

576
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,961
I have a tumor in my brain.

577
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,361
I learned recently.

578
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:38,131
There's no way to know how it'd develop.

579
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:40,591
I need to get surgery first.

580
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:43,481
I need additional treatment based on the result.

581
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:49,361
I wanted to tell you that it's far
more serious than you think-

582
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,841
I'm so sorry, but...

583
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:55,721
No, don't be sorry.

584
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,021
- I was selfish-
- I...

585
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:03,021
can't like you more or less because you're sick.

586
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:07,021
I told you that you come first
in everything these days.

587
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,891
I understand what kind of person you are,

588
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,781
what situation you're going through,

589
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:16,991
and I like you that way.

590
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:19,031
I just like you so much.

591
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,501
"Feeling excited and fluttering

592
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,651
are the perfect feelings for me now.

593
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:32,541
So, I'll be responsible for my feelings."

594
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,781
That's what I decided to do.

595
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,151
So, I'm saying...

596
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:44,141
I'm okay.

597
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:46,821
If I become a burden to you-

598
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:14,331
Don't say stuff like that.

599
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:19,321
Hearing you say that breaks
my heart for some reason.

600
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,811
There are too many steps.

601
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:04,291
The work process is still stuck in formalities.

602
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:13,401
Being back at a job site must take you back, Ji An.

603
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,121
It does.

604
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:17,001
Reminds me of working on-site

605
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:21,221
while being criticized and walking on eggshells.

606
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:26,021
Ji An, I noticed you seemed
to have conviction in your work.

607
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:29,921
I guess I couldn't be successful
because I'm so stubborn.

608
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:43,121
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

609
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:47,121
Manager Lee, are you back
to being a restaurant owner?

610
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:50,751
Ms. Kim, how much did we make today?

611
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:53,021
We seem to have overcome the hurdle.

612
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,421
- We made enough.
- That's a relief.

613
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,521
Since we're pretty much done,

614
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:05,821
why don't we sit down together
and count cash and receipts?

615
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:10,221
Let's do that. I'll get changed and come back.

616
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:57,541
Is that why you came back upset?

617
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,151
It was embarrassing.

618
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:03,681
I should've stayed in my lane
since I've only worked on job sites.

619
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,091
The same things I fought so
hard for, but couldn't get

620
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:08,641
only required one comment from her.

621
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:11,321
I felt so small.

622
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:15,621
She lectured me like I was a child, too.

623
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:19,491
How dare you say you're small?

624
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:23,931
Chief Oh, we can finish today, right?

625
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:27,071
We don't even get to take a leak, Manager Lee.

626
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,411
You're so annoying.

627
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:33,651
If you're in such a hurry, help them
instead of just talking.

628
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:35,321
Hey, Seon Yeong.

629
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,511
It's too annoying. You think
we don't know the schedule?

630
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:40,711
If she's demanding a realistic timeline,

631
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:42,901
I'd at least pretend to understand.

632
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:46,431
But she's insisting we meet a ridiculous deadline.

633
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,461
I'm losing my will to work.

634
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:50,861
Okay. Let's do it together, then.

635
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:28,781
Shit.

636
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:04,821
Gosh, seriously...

637
00:45:04,821 --> 00:45:07,991
<i>You might've thought she was cool for</i>

638
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:10,721
<i>calling the shots with just one comment,</i>

639
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:15,421
<i>but to me, you were way cooler as a colleague</i>

640
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,021
for holding my hand when I was struggling

641
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:23,811
and took me for a spin, and pushed me around

642
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:27,821
when I was being a jerk.

643
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:31,791
You calling yourself small

644
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,921
is like calling all of your colleagues

645
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:40,021
who worked hard with you, small.

646
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:47,421
Manager Lee, I'll understand since

647
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:52,001
you've been in difficult situations lately.

648
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:54,991
But I'll get really angry next time.

649
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:57,071
I'll swear like a sailor.

650
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:01,671
You're so cool.

651
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:04,691
I know, you bitch.

652
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:09,121
- Let's start over.
- So cool.

653
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:12,021
- You are, too.
- I know.

654
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,511
Gosh, I'm tired.

655
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,711
Korea got so much hotter.

656
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:20,771
Lee Yeo Jeong,

657
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:24,431
you had to be at least polite to Ji An.

658
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,081
What?

659
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:33,621
Yes. I appreciate that she made time to come.

660
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:37,621
- But-
- I'm not asking you to thank her for making time.

661
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:42,681
She was advising you based
on her experience at job sites.

662
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:45,261
You should've shown respect for that.

663
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:49,341
I do respect her opinions,

664
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:52,021
but I couldn't accept them blindly.

665
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:54,831
- But I get to make the final call.
- Lee Yeo Jeong,

666
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:57,451
sometimes, attitude is more
important than your intention.

667
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,721
That's more true if you work together.

668
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:04,011
Of course, you make the final decision.

669
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,191
But you were being very

670
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:09,581
rude and unpleasant.

671
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:14,571
Ji An doesn't deserve to be treated that way.

672
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:20,611
Really?

673
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:25,541
Yes, you're right.

674
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:28,511
Would you be happy...

675
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,621
if I apologized to her formally?

676
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:35,521
Don't ask me. Think and act on your own.

677
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:38,471
And one more thing.

678
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:42,451
Don't address me "Honey."

679
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:45,121
Our relationship isn't like that anymore.

680
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,181
You're drawing the line too much.

681
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:12,951
Were you out to exercise?

682
00:48:12,951 --> 00:48:14,201
Yes.

683
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,431
Since the neighborhood is so pretty,

684
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:18,351
I can run all day.

685
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:19,421
Where are you going?

686
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:21,631
I have a training in Seoul.

687
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:27,381
You're going to work early today.

688
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:29,151
Let's go, Bo Hyeon.

689
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:35,121
We're driving together because
he has a meeting in Seoul, too.

690
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:38,661
He's angry with me.

691
00:48:38,661 --> 00:48:41,121
But I'm sure he'll feel better soon.

692
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,931
See you.

693
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:44,991
I need to take a shower.

694
00:48:57,721 --> 00:49:00,921
<i>- I'll start the navigation.</i>
- There's no traffic.

695
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:04,281
Well,

696
00:49:05,321 --> 00:49:07,921
I told Mom that-

697
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:12,631
Father, please do whatever you want to do.

698
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:14,521
Don't put me in the middle of you two.

699
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:18,521
Express your feelings however you want.

700
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,621
You'd be respecting me and
trusting me by doing that.

701
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:40,631
Is it because it's hot?

702
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,331
There are no customers.

703
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:46,721
Tae Oh, eat a lot. Eat more.

704
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:50,421
- You're the only one who cares for him.
- Of course.

705
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:53,001
- No dating is allowed at work.
- What?

706
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:55,591
Hey, you never know.

707
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:57,211
Right?

708
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:08,471
Flirting with anyone is her chronic illness.

709
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:11,421
It's not because she has ill intentions or is sly.

710
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:14,301
It's just a habit. It's a hobby.

711
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:20,131
Hey, these greens are so tasty.

712
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:22,821
Set some aside for Dr. Jung.

713
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,121
You actually care for her a lot.

714

Why didn't you tell me?

754
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:50,141
No.

755
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:55,031
I should've known before you told me.

756
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:58,581

788
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,461
Okay.

789
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:39,241
You should go ahead and rest.

790
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,161
You look terrible right now.

791
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:51,881
Yes.

792
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,071

- Okay.

01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:02,941
Okay.

797
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:11,221

It doesn't sound like she's injured.

800

Are Ahjumma and Hyo Ri okay?

801
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:24,131
I couldn't ask the details
since Hyo Ri seemed shocked.

802
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:30,071

803
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:31,671

811
01:01:01,621 --> 01:01:03,921
I'll die, too!

812
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:06,261
How could he die alone?

813
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:11,471
What will we do?

814
01:01:16,241 --> 01:01:19,901
How could he die and leave me?

818

What if she's crying alone again?

819
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:40,471
What are you doing here?

820
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,741
I heard about Dr. Jung.

821
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:47,421
- Did you cry?
- Why would I cry?

822
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:51,191
- I was just a bit shocked.
- I know.

823
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:54,051
All sorts of things happen in life.

824
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:56,401
Why all the fuss?

825
01:04:58,391 --> 01:04:59,871
Right.

826
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:03,081
All sorts of things happen in life.

827
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:06,721
Yes.

828
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:09,271
Pretending to be suffering alone

829
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,311
doesn't look so nice.

830
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:15,081
Pretending?

831
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,341
Did I do that?

832
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:19,911
Think about it.

833
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:23,221
You aren't the only one who suffers in this world.

834
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:27,031
Why would you be so cold?

835
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:29,021
Okay. Leave now.

836
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:31,521
Everyone suffers as much as you.

837
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,851
As much as I?

838
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,271
They suffer as much as I?

839
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,141
My daughter, who just turned 20, is sick.

840
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:49,801
I have no money since I got fired from my job.

841
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:52,971
I have no knowledge about anything.

842
01:05:52,971 --> 01:05:56,971
I'm a mom, but I can't do anything for her.

843
01:05:57,921 --> 01:06:00,541
Dr. Jung suddenly appeared

844
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:05,321
and upsets me, saying she's my mom or whatnot.

845
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,921
She tried to jump into the ocean in front of me.

846
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:11,061
- Lee Ji An.
- You're bad, too.

847
01:06:11,061 --> 01:06:13,221
Why did you show up

848
01:06:13,221 --> 01:06:15,321
and keep making me weak

849
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:19,731
and make me want to lean on you?

850
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:22,861
Why is the world always picking on me?

851
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,391
Yes, I'm not the only one who suffers.

852
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:28,261
I'm not,

853
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:31,651
but I'm really suffering.

854
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:37,231
I try to hang in there, but why
does this keep happening to me?

855
01:07:36,211 --> 01:07:38,631
Cry, you fool.

856
01:07:38,631 --> 01:07:41,261
You should've cried freely like this.
Why did you hold it in?

857
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:44,801
Why do you pretend to be okay? Why fight it?

858
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:46,821
I...

859
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:50,711
- I have to fight it, so-
You don't have to.

860
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:52,741
