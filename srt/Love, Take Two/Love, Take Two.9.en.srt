1
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,570
You were my first love.

2
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,250
I said you were my first love.

3
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,430
First love?

4
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,910
Are you... Really... What...

5
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,520
Are you acting shy? You, Lee Ji An?

6
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,430
N-No, right?

7
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,470
What are you saying?

8
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,300
A lot of people have told me I'm their first love.

9
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,610
So, I don't feel shy at all.

10
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,510
I'm very used to situations like this.

11
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,490
Gosh, first love isn't such a big deal.

12
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,720
Right?

13
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,030
Yup.

14
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,270
My gosh.

15
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,800
There are fireworks. Bang, bang.

16
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,120
Should we go this way?

17
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,460
- So, by the way, Oppa,
- Yeah.

18
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,250
you had very high standards
despite your looks, right?

19
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,500
My nickname was Minor League.

20
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,640
Because I had an unusual taste.

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,060
It's because they didn't have a good look at me.

22
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,130
The person who said that had 20/20 vision.

23
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,860
He saw you dancing in the schoolyard.

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,830
Beauty usually feels unfamiliar at first.

25
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,170
You always have the last word.

26
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,380
I never let things go.

27
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,420
Hi, Tae Oh.

28
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,840
Hello.

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,660
What? Did you fall on the way?

30
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,000
Why are your eyelids red?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,010
Are they?

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,120
I put a little bit of eyeshadow on.

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Fu Bao better watch out.

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,260
There's a funnier human here.

35
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,970
What do you know about makeup?

36
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,520
Are you wearing a hairpin?

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,910
Is something up with you?

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,900
There must be a reason you're acting differently.

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,120
Either confessed your love or
someone confessed to you.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,730
What are you, a profiler?

41
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,010
Hey, this is a warning.

42
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,620
Don't analyze my behavioral pattern and stuff.

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,670
Are you flustered much?

44
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,940
- Hello, Ahjussi.
- Hi.

45
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm going to the farm to work.

46
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,530
What's with your eyes? What are you, a panda?

47
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,940
I'm off.

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,490
You beat Fu Bao.

49
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,100
You're impressive.

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,130
- That's enough. Seriously.
- Okay.

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,140
I'll do my homework for the art studio.

52
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,340
I'll be back quickly.

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,350
Don't come quickly. Take your time.

54
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,450
Tae Oh and I will enjoy each other's company.

55
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,280
I feel sorry for Tae Oh.

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,620
What?

57
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,800
Let's enjoy each other's company.

58
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,770
Shall we?

59
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,510
- Shall we enjoy?
- Yes.

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,900
Let's polish spoons and chopsticks together.

61
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,500
Gosh.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,840
The weather is nice, too.

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,380
- Hello.
- Hey.

64
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,570
You know the wall in the front?

65
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,860
It needs to be repaired.

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,060
It could hurt someone if you leave it like that.

67
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,450
You'll have to fix it yourself.

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,670
She sees things sometimes.

69
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't tell anyone about it.

70
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,390
She's building good karma.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,380
She says it'll bring you good luck.

72
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,230
You're so knowledgeable, Village Leader Go.

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,610
Not just anyone can be a village leader.

74
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,080
Right, I'm fine anytime you decide.

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,790
Come and build good karma when you can.

76
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,000
I bet you two never get bored.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,360
- I'll go.
- Right?

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
- Bye.
- See you.

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,090
Bye.

80
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,660
- Where are you going?
- Huh?

81
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,420
Are you going to draw?

82
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,450
I wanted to unleash my artistic passion
before we open.

83
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,930
Get in. I'll take you somewhere really nice.

84
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,520
Wow. It's so pretty.

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,460
If you just follow me,

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,310
you'd only be walking on flowery paths.

87
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,440
I don't want to admit it, but I guess it's true.

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,230
Be careful.

89
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,550
Should we sit over there?

90
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,550
Should we sit here?

91
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,290
Gosh, are you doing that again?

92
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,960
That's a chronic condition, Oppa.

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,190
You get a better sense of the view this way.

94
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,740
Yes, this is good.

95
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,340
Although I'm not sure you could capture this.

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,020
- I'm here, Oppa.
- Huh?

97
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,620
I blend in with the flowers too well.

98
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,620
In case you can't find me.

99
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,220
So, I'm kindly telling you where I am.

100
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,210
You're so you.

101
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,500
Only you stick out here.

102
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,130
You say what you want to say
and don't listen to others.

103
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,920
It's very bad.

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,870
- Oppa.
- Yeah?

105
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,330
I always thought these flowers were purple.

106
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,500
But there's a bit of white in there.

107
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,170
- You didn't know, either. Right?
- Huh?

108
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,880
Wow. You guys had colors like these.

109
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,240
Yes. I'll capture everything.

110
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,240
There's no perfect purple for it.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,320
I'll use this.

112
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,150
What's with your eyes?

113
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,320
Do they look weird?

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,530
[Episode 9. If I fell in love for the first time]

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,420
<i>We'll never get back together.</i>

116
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,210
<i>Watch your mouth in front of people.</i>

117
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,690
<i>I won't tolerate it next time.</i>

118
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,010
Huh?

119
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,820
You're back early.

120
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,680
Yes.

121
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,650
Well, I have a day off tomorrow.

122
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,740
Should we eat out?

123
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,430
There's a restaurant I want to check out.

124
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,150
That's a good idea.

125
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,670
Really?

126
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,300
What time are you free tomorrow?

127
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,100
I'll meet you at your office.

128
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,300
Why do you ask that? You're eating out alone.

129
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,940
You'll end up coming with me.

130
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,210
Don't fight it.

131
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,660
- Hold these.
- Huh?

132
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,100
Hold these.

133
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,630
- Why?
- Okay...

134
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,740
Smile.

135
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,120
- Cheese.
- Seriously.

136
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,660
Wow. Which one's the flower?

137
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,530
I've always noticed this,
but your taste in men is...

138
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,620
exceptional. It's on another level.

139
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,790
Maybe the flowers are prettier.

140
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,960
Are these going to Seoul today, by the way?

141
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,990
No. They're going to Japan.

142
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,100
Japan? Wow.

143
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,660
You guys are better off than I am.

144
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,040
I haven't been to Japan.

145
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,710
To be honest, my trip to Cheonghae
was my first trip ever.

146
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,100
I've never been on a trip before.

147
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,920
Mom was busy, and I was busy studying, too.

148
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,620
I was planning to take a trip far away
once I finished medical school.

149
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,050
Go with me.

150
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,030
Go on a trip with me.

151
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,350
Well, I'll think about it.

152
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,380
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

153
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,690
<i>I'm on my way to catch the flower boy now.</i>

154
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,030
Hey,

155
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,550
Sook got angry because of the photo.

156
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,560
She's coming to Cheonghae to catch you.

157
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,020
What?

158
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,470
That means Sook is coming to Cheonghae.

159
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,090
Sook is coming! Sook is coming!

160
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,390
Sook! Sook!

161
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,670
What should we eat?

162
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,800
- What should we eat?
- What should we eat?

163
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,200
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

164
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm building good karma.

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,710
Are you happy about something these days?

166
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,610
You're busy getting dolled up
and building good karma.

167
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,330
Yes. You don't have to know.

168
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,840
When is Sook coming?

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,140
Around five.

170
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,930
Bo Hyeon and I will finish work and pick her up.

171
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,330
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

172
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,220
Bye.

173
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's go.

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,560
I'll meet you at the office at six.

175
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,380
How will you do this on your own?

176
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,450
Village Leader Go and her husband
went downtown today.

177
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,200
I can handle this on my own.

178
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,610
But still. You're making me feel bad
if you work alone like this.

179
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,120
Huh? That's Bo Hyeon's mom, right?

180
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,020
Why?

181
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,160
What?

182
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,160
You're doing this alone?

183
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,780
Do you even know how to?

184
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,970
It'd take a whole day.

185
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,500
I'll manage it myself. Be on your way.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,630
Should I?

187
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,200
Jeong Seok and I are going out to dinner tonight.

188
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,220
I need to get back and get ready.

189
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,610
I'm sorry I can't help you.

190
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,950
Carry on, then.

191
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,250
Okay. Be on your way.

192
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,750
Let's see.

193
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,980
What was Mr. Ryu's number?

194
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,280
I can just call Mr. Ryu.

195
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
Excuse me.

196
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,790
What?

197
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,430
You know you have to apply it thoroughly, right?

198
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,350
I've done part-time jobs while studying abroad.

199
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,370
You can't design if you don't know how to build.

200
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,130
Geez. I've never traveled abroad.

201
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,130
What's it like to live abroad?

202
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,430
Living abroad is...

203
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,160
filled with newness,

204
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,250
loneliness,

205
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,970
and sadness.

206
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,630
Stuff like that.

207
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:51,705
It was so hard at first,
but I thought I could do anything.

208
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,855
I suppose I was young then.

209
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,330
To change one's fate,
if you live ambitiously for the future,

210
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,900
you get used to the environment.

211
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,400
Once you get used to it,
you feel, "I'm an outsider after all."

212
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,230
You feel the limitation of your identity.

213
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,560
That makes you feel lonely.

214
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,960
Once you realize you're lonely, you feel sad.

215
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,500
That's how it was for me.

216
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,860
It's not because you lived abroad.

217
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,000
Life is supposed to be lonely and sad.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,450
I guess you were lonely and sad.

219
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,860
I was.

220
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,380
But not really.

221
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,440
Are you playing hot and cold with me?

222
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,640
Life told me, "Aren't you worn out to death?

223
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,280
Let's see how long you can last."

224
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,370
So, I endured it out of spite.

225
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,000
And then I stopped feeling that way.

226
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,130
She got to me while I let my guard down.

227
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,190
You almost made my heart flutter.

228
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,760
Hello.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,040
Huh?

230
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,160
Are you on a break?

231
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Yes.

232
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,950
Byeong Jae, have you not had lunch yet?

233
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,530
Well, I've had indigestion since yesterday.

234
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,240
I feel drained because I haven't eaten anything.

235
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,520
You're sick.

236
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,000
Let me see.

237
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,620
Here.

238
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,220
Does it hurt here?

239
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,770
Does it hurt?

240
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,880
They say that boys and girls should
be segregated after the age of 7.

241
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,680
I believe men and women
above 60 should accelerate.

242
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,390
Above 60...

243
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,230
Oh, I knew what that meant. I couldn't
think of it immediately.

244
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,230
This part needs to hurt.

245
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,460
I don't think you have indigestion
if it doesn't hurt here.

246
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,780
Is it because I overworked
at the job site the last few days?

247
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,550
You've been stressed.

248
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,750
Hold on. For Byeong Jae, I'll...

249
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,780
get you buckwheat tea.

250
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,660
Drink this and take it easy here for now.

251
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,170
Thank you.

252
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,460
I have some abalone prepped.

253
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,930
I'll make you porridge.

254
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,290
I'll make a lot. Eat the rest for dinner later.

255
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,790
Okay. Thank you.

256
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,620
I like abalone porridge, too.

257
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,830
Huh? Really?

258
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,360
Okay. I'll pack you some, too.

259
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,790
Let's see.

260
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,810
- Byeong Jae.
- Yes.

261
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,900
I saw you working when this house was being built.

262
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,610
I'm not just saying this. You worked really hard.

263
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,690
I could tell how thoughtful
and attentive you were.

264
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,420
I guess I felt a bit worried, too, should I say?

265
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Okay, listen. Well...

266
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:24,800
working hard enough
so you don't hurt your relationship

267
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,895
with coworkers and not strain your body
would make you a real pro.

268
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,545
- I'm just saying, don't get sick.
- Okay.

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,920
The abalone is so meaty.

270
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
- You want water?
- No.

271
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,440
Go ahead.

272
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,780
It'll dry in 30 minutes.

273
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,360
You must be tired. You're more tenacious
than I thought.

274
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,560
This neighborhood is so strange.

275
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,030
I'm a very selfish person.

276
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,640
But it makes me want to pretend to be nice.

277
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,560
Did someone say you're nice?

278
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,960
- Well?
- You don't seem nice,

279
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,020
but you don't seem selfish, either.

280
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,170
You don't know how to assess people.

281
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm a very selfish person.

282
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,720
I need to get what I want, no matter what.

283
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,700
I have a twin brother.

284
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,140
My parents always put him first.

285
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,100
We weren't well off.

286
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,740
My parents let my brother
go to the school he chose,

287
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,250
but they made me go to one
that offered a scholarship.

288
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,820
Since I was a kid, I made sure I had my share.

289
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,710
I always achieved what I wanted to.

290
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,670
I just became more spiteful.

291
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,400
I've been hated a lot for that reason, too.

292
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,490
Why is it bad to acquire and achieve

293
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,160
the things you want?

294
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,890
I envy people like that.

295
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,717
I'm always defeated.

296
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:08,925
I get defeated by the world and people.

297
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,625
I really don't want to be,

298
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,795
but no matter how hard I try, I still lose.

299
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,530
I don't want to. But it's hard not to.

300
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,670
That's why I envy people like you.

301
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,230
That was why.

302
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,520
I wondered why you were so tough.

303
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,510
I guess knowing how to lose makes you that way.

304
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,920
You don't break because you're soft.

305
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,030
If so, Ji An,

306
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,060
can I ask you a favor?

307
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

308
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,920
Sir, where are the colored pencils?

309
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,655
They're here.

310
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,585
Oh, here they are.

311
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,770
Okay. Purple... let's see...

312
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,465
- Is this purple, too?
- Yes. Light purple.

313
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,495
Light purple.

314
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,100
My gosh.

315
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,790
Wow. You're almost done.

316
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,540
Gosh, you've done so much.

317
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,790
Be careful. Be careful.

318
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,150
Don't worry.

319
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't touch this for about two days.

320
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,390
There must've been a flowering tree here.

321
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,510
After my husband built this wall,

322
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,120
he planted flowers in front of it for me.

323
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,400
But after he died,

324
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,090
I hated to see the petals falling.
So, I removed all of them.

325
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,530
But look how resilient they are.

326
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,470
My heart broke when he left.

327
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,350
The wall also broke.

328
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,180
And the petals fell, too.

329
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,650
I'm done.

330
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,510
Yeo Jeong!

331
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,600
Are you okay?

332
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,160
[Examination Room]

333
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,390
Ms. Jeong Ju Hyeon.

334
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,900
Yes.

335
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,940
Do they say you're okay?

336
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,790
I think I'm already healed.

337
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,340
They say it's nothing serious. Don't worry.

338
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,780
It just can't get inflamed.

339
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,990
Gosh, it's my fault.

340
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,820
You're pretending to be nice again.

341
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,530
You caught me.

342
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,560
It looks bad, doesn't it?

343
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,080
There was a fire in my apartment
two years ago, and I got burned.

344
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,290
I'm still not used to it, either.

345
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,140
Oh, don't tell Jeong Seok.

346
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,830
He doesn't know I got injured.

347
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,460
I didn't tell him.

348
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,560
Looks like you were badly hurt.

349
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,980
Treating burns wasn't easy.

350
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,460
Is it because I was struggling?

351
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,980
I got burnt out from work then, too.

352
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,880
I underwent psychiatric treatment, too.

353
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,230
I had a pretty hard time.

354
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,890
So, I couldn't come to Korea
to see Bo Hyeon for two years.

355
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,250
Do both Jeong Seok and Bo Hyeon not know, then?

356
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,210
I thought of my family the most
when I got injured.

357
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,760
I regretted a lot.

358
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,820
That's also why I didn't tell them.

359
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,470
I wanted to be back once I had recovered.

360
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,390
I...

361
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,340
was trying in my own way.

362
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,030
[Bus Terminal]

363
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,970
Lee Sook.

364
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,310
She's pretending to be blindsided.

365
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,030
I was going to tell you, Sook.

366
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,840
Long time no see.

367
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,440
She's happy to see me, right?

368
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
She's not usually like this.

369
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,640
It's okay. So Yeon does this to me a lot.

370
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,270
I'm used to it.

371
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,760
Sook, Sook.

372
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,840
Hold on. I'm sorry. I mean it.

373
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,140
- Honey.
- What's going on?

374
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,100
I was working on Mimi Corner Store's fence.

375
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,930
While she was helping with that...

376
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,390
Are you the village's problem solver?

377
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,000
Why do you keep causing trouble here and there?

378
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,690
It was a simple job.

379
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,110
What do you mean, simple?

380
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,250
She got injured.

381
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,200
No. I'm not badly injured.

382
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,260
I'm just wearing a brace.

383
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,870
Get in.

384
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,630
Like this. Go.

385
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,260
Oh, hello.

386
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

387
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,490
Hello.

388
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,330
I'm back.

389
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,300
Gosh. You fixed Mimi's wall all day, huh?

390
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,900
That's why you're so tired.

391
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,290
No, I'm not tired.

392
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,930
I'll help here. Go and rest.

393
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,260
You don't look well.

394
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,970
Yes. We're pretty much done cooking.

395
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,730
Dr. Jung and I can finish it up. Go rest.

396
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,730
Hey!

397
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,920
Huh?

398
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,710
Go inside and rest. Go on.

399
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,780
Okay. Thank you.

400
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,090
I'll turn in early today.

401
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,260
What's Sook doing?

402
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,400
Dr. Jung, come this way.

403
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,170
When did you guys get together?

404
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,380
The day you kissed is the first day, right?

405
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,490
Shut up, please.

406
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,000
Kiss? Kiss?

407
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,820
Hey, did you kiss him, too?

408
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,650
I didn't not kiss.

409
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,090
Hey, why did you seduce the innocent Hyo Ri?

410
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,300
She has never dated before. She's pure.

411
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,850
Sook. Shut up.

412
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,310
It's true.

413
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,730
No. That wasn't my first kiss.

414
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,270
Hey!

415
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,690
Bo Hyeon is like that, too.

416
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,110
Move.

417
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,050
Soju.

418
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Bo Hyeon is...

419
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,730
as pure as a priest.

420
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,260
Hey, be honest.

421
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,470
You've never dated once. Right?

422
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,550
What are you saying? No, no.

423
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,290
- It's true.
- No, no.

424
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,430
It's true.

425
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,260
She's the only free-range chicken among us.

426
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,860
We shuffled from home, school, and the field.

427
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,550
We were basically like monks.

428
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,580
Shut up.

429
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,020
Did you just call me a chicken?

430
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,940
Look down.

431
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,565
Ji An,

432
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:55,615
can I ask you a favor?

433
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,648
I...

434
00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:03,698
came to Korea to get back together
with Jeong Seok.

435
00:29:04,835 --> 00:29:07,980
Bo Hyeon, Jeong Seok, the three of us.

436
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,490
I want us to have a fresh start.

437
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:17,030
But I think Jeong Seok is distracted by you.

438
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,830
Could you not distract him?

439
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,810
I really...

440
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,270
want a fresh start with him.

441
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,420
You know Hyo Ri used to attend
medical school, right?

442
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,960
Her college entrance exam score
was in the top 0.05%.

443
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,790
Bo Hyeon is the farm's successor.

444
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,300
- A landscape design certificate...
- He has a landscape design certificate, too.

445
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,710
- Hey.
- Huh?

446
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you think I'm bragging about you?

447
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,600
I'm trying to say that she's nothing.

448
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,160
I hate you and her. I just hate everyone.

449
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,300
I like you, though.

450
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,810
Hey, why do you hate Hyo Ri?

451
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,890
She's actually a good person.

452
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,440
I hated her from the beginning,

453
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,200
but I hate her even more because of you.

454
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,160
Okay, guys,

455
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,110
I've been listening to you for a while.

456
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,580
I think you argued enough.

457
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,310
You're drunk enough, too.

458
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,690
How about you settle with a physical fight?

459
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,750
Pardon?

460
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,100
How refreshing. I love it.

461
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,330
Should we fight at Yijeong Elementary School?
There's no one around there.

462
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,010
It's close to a hospital, too.

463
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,850
He's just like Tae Oh.

464
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,880
Anyway, we'll go home.

465
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,740
Please clean up the rest.

466
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

467
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,050
Report the result of the fight.

468
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,400
- Okay.
- Got it.

469
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,590
<i>- Take care.
- Good night.</i>

470
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,930
Hey, come out.

471
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,700
Let's go. Let's go now.

472
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,950
- To where?
- We're going?

473
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,830
- I can use a weapon, right?
- No, no. You can't.

474
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,120
Hey, I can fight underwater, too.

475
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,180
Underwater? She said underwater. Hey.

476
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,840
What do I do with her?

477
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,200
- Are we really going?
- Call my parents in advance.

478
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,440
- Hey.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

479
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,200
Don't do it. You'll get hurt.

480
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,680
She's no joke.

481
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,900
Hey, I'm Lee Sook.

482
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Yes, just call it even. Our bones
don't heal well anymore.

483
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,630
What are you saying?

484
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,500
My motto is, "Losing is better than not trying."

485
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,480
Okay, then...

486
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,250
the one who finishes six laps first wins.

487
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,820
Okay. Ready...

488
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,280
Start!

489
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,460
Run! Run!

490
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,060
- Look at them go!
- Go!

491
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,760
- Lee Sook!
- They're good. They're good.

492
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,810
- Fighting!
- They're so fast.

493
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,070
Lee Sook started the third lap!

494
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,110
Kim So Yeon's on the third lap!
It's neck and neck!

495
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,550
She's catching up!

496
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,560
Why don't you give up?

497
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,850
You give up.

498
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,820
What's giving up?

499
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,060
I don't know...

500
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,160
I don't know what that means.

501
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,490
Hey!

502
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,940
What?

503
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,870
I'll give up.

504
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,510
- What? Why did they stop?
- What?

505
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,590
Are they actually fighting?

506
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,220
- Are they having a fist fight?
- No, right?

507
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,310
I said I'll lose.

508
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,920
You can win everything.

509
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,100
I'll let you be the best.

510
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,680
And you...

511
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,280
should understand Hyo Ri.

512
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,700
I get it.

513
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,900
She could come across as rude.

514
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,110
I admit it. I totally do.

515
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,240
But...

516
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,040
she's trying not to get hurt
because she's soft-hearted.

517
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,390
So, please understand her.

518
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,830
She has a situation.

519
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,260
I want to be by her side,

520
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,580
but I know that'd make it harder for her.

521
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,810
That's why I'm asking you a favor.

522
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,360
Hey, she's giving up!

523
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,960
I won!

524
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,500
- What?
- What?

525
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,060
Did she win or lose?

526
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,010
Hey, don't worry.

527
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,205
Even if you didn't ask me,

528
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:27,105
we wouldn't have let her feel lonely.

529
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,220
I won!

530
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,590
Kim So Yeon's the best!

531
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,450
- Good job.
- I knew you'd win.

532
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,970
Lee Hyo Ri.

533
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,010
You cheered for me, too. Didn't you?

534
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,310
I didn't cheer for you.

535
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,630
You did.

536
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,580
Did you see me?

537
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,200
Sook, I cheered for you.

538
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,430
- Good job. Really...
- No way.

539
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,070
Where are you going? Where are you going?

540
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,430
Why? Why?

541
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,110
Don't come!

542
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,870
Hey, manage your boyfriend better.

543
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,640
What did I do?

544
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,350
<i>When I said hello to Ahjumma,</i>

545
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,410
I felt her kindness very briefly.

546
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,630
Really? You're terrified of my mom.

547
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,380
I know.

548
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,540
There's something in this village's water.

549
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,530
Ahjumma changed.

550
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,708
By the way,

551
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:40,010
what do you like about Bo Hyeon?

552
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,310
Because he's handsome?

553
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:45,725
Hey, there are tons of guys
who are as good-looking.

554
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:48,195
Do you really think so?

555
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,060
Bo Hyeon...

556
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,100
makes you think about that very
moment when you're with him.

557
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,310
He lets you look at the world simply,

558
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,020
and he makes me honest.

559
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,510
I love that.

560
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,130
He removes complicated thoughts.
My head doesn't hurt when I'm with him.

561
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,300
Does your head...

562
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,830
hurt a lot?

563
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,890
Don't you feel scared?

564
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,140
That's a relief.

565
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,820
Goodnight.

566
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,700
You're mine, Sook.

567
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,030
Hey, that...

568
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,890
Jae Dong, you know.

569
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,175
Does he have a girlfriend?

570
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:12,255
H-He's my type.

571
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:15,560
Hey, do you like that type?

572
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,630
I mean, he has such a cute smile.

573
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,940
He's better than Bo Hyeon.

574
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,420
Are your eyes already aging?

575
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,070
- No.
- Seriously.

576
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,100
His land is 6,000 pyeong.

577
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,850
He has a halo around him. So cute.

578
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,890
Bo Hyeon has thousands of flowers.

579
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,790
What will you do with flowers?

580
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,220
Jae Dong raises onions. Onions.

581
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,790
- Can we make it work?
- H-How could you...

582
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,370
compare him to Bo Hyeon...

583
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,460
Would you like me to...

584
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,020
help you out somehow?

585
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,590
I mean, if there's a way...

586
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,560
I'd like you to, but...

587
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,490
Well, Jae Dong...

588
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,720
Just ask me. I'll help you.

589
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,890
Give me his number.

590
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,920
[Seoul bound]
Hey, can't you stay?

591
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,630
I'll be back soon.

592
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,330
Hey.

593
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,480
The bus is here. Aren't you getting in?

594
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,650
Oh, really?

595
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,510
The bus is here, Hyo Ri. I have to go.

596
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,340
I'll be back soon.

597
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,350
What?

598
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,670
Hi.

599
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,010
Hi.

600
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,790
Here. It's for you.

601
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,250
These are the Shine Muscats from So Yeon's farm.

602
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:38,780
Thank you. T-They look tasty.

603
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,480
Be sure to come back.

604
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,760
Huh?

605
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,660
I don't have a girlfriend.

606
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,840
What are you doing?

607
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,960
- Good luck.
- I can't keep hanging out with him.

608
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,080
What are you talking about?

609
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,680
Hey, see you later.

610
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,560
Yes, come back soon.

611
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,100
- Bye.
- You need to come back.

612
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,260
Let's go.

613
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,670
Hey.

614
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,040
Why are you crying?

615
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,820
Don't cry. She'll be back.

616
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,090
- Hello.
- Hey, Byeong Jae.

617
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,580
We're closed for lunch. Are you here to eat?

618
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,670
No. I wanted to bring this back.

619
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,990
Gosh. You could've returned it later.

620
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,290
And...

621
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,820
This, too.

622
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,640
W-What's this?

623
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,400
It's a poetry book. I thought you'd like it.

624
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,490
Poetry book.

625
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,000
"Can you eat it?"

626
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,210
You like poetry, right?

627
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,800
Poetry?

628
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,660
Yes, I love it.

629
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,860
She likes poultry, not poetry.

630
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,640
If you haven't eaten...

631
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,750
No, no. I need to get going.

632
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,550
But I don't know about Mr. Ryu.

633
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,530
I told him I was going to Masterpiece.

634
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,390
And he said...

635
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,470
he needed to bring this to Ms. Lee.

636
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,340
Come look. Over here.

637
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,290
Where?

638
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,840
He followed me, but he won't come in.

639
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,880
W-Why won't he come in?

640
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,710
Does his back hurt?

641
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,300
You should've come in.
Why are you protesting out here?

642
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,650
Well...

643
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,120
I came to apologize for yesterday.

644
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,250
But pushing that door open was so hard.

645
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,380
You must've been flustered, too.

646
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,800
I would've felt better if I had gotten injured.

647
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,610
Lee Ji An.

648
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,390
I thought Yeo Jeong was just annoying,

649
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,100
but she's nice.

650
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,660
She's honest, thoughtful, and sincere.

651
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,310
You can judge a person by working with them.

652
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,970
She's honest.

653
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,870
She doesn't look like it,
but she can be thoughtful.

654
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,600
You feel sorry for her once you know her.

655
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,810
Oppa,

656
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,310
you're a time machine to me. Did you know?

657
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,040
When I'm with you,

658
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,120
I feel like an 18-year-old all over again.

659
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,890
When I found out Hyo Ri was sick,

660
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,980
I felt so scared and struggled a lot,

661
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,760
and you showed up right then.

662
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,780
Because you let me feel like an 18-year-old again,

663
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,100
I was able to pull myself together
as confidently and bravely as I was back then

664
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,515
without feeling crushed with anxiety.

665
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:21,125
So, I feel grateful for you.

666
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,650
And...

667
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,370
I care about you.

668
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,250
Relationships keep changing.

669
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:40,000
If it'd be good for you,

670
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,265
it'd be nice if you, Yeo Jeong, and Bo Hyeon

671
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:46,355
could restore your relationships.

672
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,550
Am I overstepping too much?

673
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,660
Anyway,

674
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,230
I understand how you feel.

675
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,880
Don't worry about me and go.

676
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,040
Yeo Jeong is injured. Don't leave her alone.

677
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,530
I need to get back to work, too.

678
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,950
Because you could've gotten injured, too.

679
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,930
I got angry because I was upset about that.

680
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,920
Aigoo, how dare that crow fly so low?

681
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Dalgu, that bastard.

682
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,140
He should crow after the sunset,
at least, if not at dawn.

683
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,140
Gosh, look at this bastard.

684
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,120
If I'm sitting here like this, he should say,

685
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,620
"Aigoo, Hyungnim, are you drinking makgeolli?

686
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,220
Should I pour you a glass?"

687
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,110
That's being polite.

688
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,790
He has no basic...

689
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,920
What? Did he hear me?

690
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,650
I don't think I was that loud.

691
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,420
We got the onions delivered.

692
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,470
Tae Oh.

693
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,870
Yes?

694
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,680
Hey, that's enough.

695
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,510
What's with you today? You're scaring me.

696
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,290
- Hyung.
- What?

697
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,650
What did you say just now?

698
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,420
I think I'm broken.

699
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,670
It's okay. It's okay.

700
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,140
I was broken a long time ago, too.

701
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,840
My battery died a long time ago.

702
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,640
By the way, what did you call me?

703
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,370
- Hyung!
- Yes.

704
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,700
Yes, yes, yes. Jeong Seok.

705
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,820
Are you worried about something?

706
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,340
Go ahead and tell me everything.

707
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,850
I might not look like it,

708
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,910
but I was called Sergeant Byeon, the therapist.

709
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,980
I was basically like Oh Eun Young.

710
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,740
I'm serious.

711
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,940
I'm scared of people.

712
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,500
I'm scared of someone.

713
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,060
Someone...

714
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,160
is sick.

715
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,350
By someone, do you mean love?

716
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,100
I suppose that's the same thing.

717
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,380
The unfamiliar feeling I haven't felt for so long

718
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,100
is making my heart creaky.

719
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,190
I'm not sure what's wrong with it.

720
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,710
I think I'm broken.

721
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,180
Did something fly into here?

722
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,740
Does it flutter, creak,

723
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,340
make you run out of breath,

724
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,420
suddenly flip out like you're crazy,

725
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,650
and makes you think, "Is this how I die?"

726
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,060
How did you know?

727
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,900
It's an epidemic
from the time of Australopithecus.

728
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,890
It's love.

729
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,450
Love.

730
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,690
I met my wife when we worked at a shoe factory.

731
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,200
I had a crush on her the entire time.

732
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,260
But she suddenly stopped coming to the factory.

733
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,680
I was wondering where she went.

734
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,150
She apparently got married.

735
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,690
Because I was so distressed back then,
I got shorter.

736
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,940
Are you doubting me right now?

737
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,080
I was almost 180 cm tall.

738
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,500
I got shorter because of the shock.

739
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,260
I'm metaphorically saying
that's how heartbroken I was.

740
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,170
Anyway,

741
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,650
while I was trying to heal after that,

742
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,290
she suddenly came back to the factory.

743
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,550
After her husband passed away.

744
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,110
She showed up looking so skinny.

745
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,880
It drove me insane.

746
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,370
My heart shattered.

747
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,840
That's why I made up my mind.

748
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,340
I decided not to be a fool twice.

749
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,070
So, did you sweep her off her feet like this?

750
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,400
Gosh, you seem to get it.

751
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,550
Jeong Seok,

752
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,810
you can't be a fool twice.

753
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,390
You must have a reason.

754
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,850
But while acting timidly like this,

755
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,150
will you end up with another heartache?

756
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,980
I don't know how I feel, either.

757
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,700
Is this right? Is this the right person?

758
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,560
So...

759
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,200
"My gosh.

760
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,420
This must be love." Something like this?

761
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,480
There's no such thing.

762
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,960
It's just confusing.

763
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,300
It drives you crazy and confuses you.

764
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,700
You don't know what's going on.

765
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,280
You go, "Geez, I'm going crazy."

766
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,870
But that's when you need to decide
and get a hold of your heart

767
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,170
to turn that crazy feeling into love.

768
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,000
Can I love again?

769
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,400
Of course.

770
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,610
Who says love is predetermined?

771
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,670
Love is courage and choice.

772
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,660
That's why you can start over again.

773
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,410
Start over again.

774
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,040
Thank you.

775
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,680
<i>Stop! Get up!</i>

776
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,140
<i>I don't want to go to work.</i>

777
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,670
<i>Should we go to the beach?</i>

778
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,000
<i>It tickles. Stop.</i>

779
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,750
<i>Let's stay this way for five minutes.</i>

780
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,140
<i>It tickles. It tickles.</i>

781
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,840
<i>Gosh, stop!</i>

782
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:47,370
I can start over?

783
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,720
Excuse me.

784
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,740
Hand me that.

785
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,050
Huh?

786
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:30,290
Bo Hyeon, you got an email
from the school in Berlin.

787
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,240
- Huh?
- Oh, my.

788
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,670
Goodness.

789
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,430
They're telling you to apply this semester.

790
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,100
This is great.

791
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,650
If you get in, we can fly together when I go back.

792
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,860
It'd be great if your dad could come briefly, too.

793
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,220
He can see you settle down

794
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,540
and we can go on trips together, too.

795
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,040
Yes. But this is too sudden.

796
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,360
Why? It's great.

797
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,570
It feels like this was meant to be.

798
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,830
Let's tell your dad when he gets back.

799
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,090
No. He must be at the office, right?

800
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,540
I'll go see him right now.

801
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,970
Honey, where are you?

802
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,780
Are you going for a walk?

803
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,890
How's your leg?

804
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,050
I'm okay.

805
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,060
By the way, this...

806
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,820
See you later. I need to go somewhere now.

807
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,730
- Yes, Yeo Jeong. Are you okay?
- Yes.

808
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,930
That's great. Thank you for the wall.

809
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,690
Gosh, no...

810
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,310
There's a flower garden now.

811
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,160
I thought of the mural at Tae Oh's surfing club.

812
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,800
It doesn't even compare to the
flowers your husband planted.

813
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,100
I just tried to express how he wanted
you to live, looking at flowers.

814
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,110
How do you always move me like this?

815
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,220
Your heart...

816
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,740
must be torn into thousands of pieces, too.

817
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,500
What energy do you have to care for

818
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,260
other people like this?

819
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,530
Thanks to you,

820
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:25,610
flowers are blossoming in my heart, too.

821
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,530
Just like that day.

822
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,270
Thank you.

823
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,560
Thank you.

824
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,820
You, too, Yeo Jeong.

825
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,050
Thank you.

826
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,090
Their curriculum is pretty great.

827
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,990
The landscape design faculty is young.

828
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,880
They're hip and they're still in the industry.

829
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:27,860
What did Bo Hyeon say?

830
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,560
The last time I talked to him,

831
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,790
he asked about it. So, I looked into it.

832
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:34,750
I just wanted to check if it was possible,

833
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,870
but they say he can apply now.

834
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,880
He's lucky.

835
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,000
He asked you to look into it?

836
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,070
If he decides to do it,

837
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,170
why don't you come to Germany

838
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,775
and stay with him for a few months
until he settles down?

839
00:56:57,775 --> 00:57:00,795
Wouldn't you be on sabbatical soon?

840
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,350
Yeo Jeong.

841
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,040
Yes?

842
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,800
You used to...

843
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,330
want to live somewhere with an ocean view.

844
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:19,610
Do you still like the ocean?

845
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,960
It always feels special.

846
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,440
But I don't want to live near the ocean anymore.

847
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,980
Those places are usually far from hospitals.

848
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,130
We're old now.

849
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,570
Aren't we?

850
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,370
When Bo Hyeon was in second grade,

851
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,300
I went to Germany for your birthday.

852
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,590
To celebrate your birthday.

853
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,290
Yeo Jeong,

854
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,730
you can stop now.

855
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,010
Don't do this.

856
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,050
Honey,

857
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,540
I understand.

858
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,290
But no.

859
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,270
Don't let me go like this.

860
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,680
Yeo Jeong,

861
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,670
I have...

862
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,410
struggled for too long.

863
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,570
At first, I couldn't forgive you for betraying me.

864
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,870
Later, I couldn't forgive myself for running away.

865
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:23,320
I struggled a lot more

866
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,660
than you can imagine.

867
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,230
You were young, too.

868
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,720
I know you were lonely.

869
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:43,590
I should've cared for you better.

870
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,820
You're such a fool.

871
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,020
You really were a fool, Honey.

872
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,000
What's with Lee Ji An?

873
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,510
How does she know everything about you?

874
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:09,600
I thought I'd regret it if I didn't tell you now.

875
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:15,540
I like Jeong Seok.

876
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,340
So?

877
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,940
So, I wanted to ask you a favor.

878
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,400
- Are you asking me to give up-
- Please apologize.

879
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,920
The day I went to the conference,

880
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,800
I heard people talking about why you two broke up.

881
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,950
He's probably blaming himself for that, too.

882
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,540
Like a fool,

883
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,820
he must be thinking, "She must've had a reason.

884
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,930
What did I do wrong?" while blaming himself.

885
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,750
Because he's a fool,

886
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,700
he must've struggled alone for a long time.

887
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,940
Oppa doesn't know that I know.

888
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:04,020
He doesn't need to be comforted right now.

889
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,467
He needs an apology.
And only you can do that to him.

890
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:09,508
So, please do that for me.

891
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,340
You're overstepping your bounds now.

892
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,040
I'm not overstepping.

893
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,270
Because I like him and care about him,

894
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,800
I'm giving up.

895
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,090
So, he's not confused,

896
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,390
I'm stepping aside.

897
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:34,730
I'm sorry.

898
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,440
I'm sorry.

899
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,583
I know what you did for me
and for Bo Hyeon. I know better than anyone.

900
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,983
I shouldn't have done that.

901
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,320
I'm sorry.

902
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,930
It's entirely my fault that we broke up.

903
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,420
You shouldn't carry this burden.

904

Unload everything on me

905
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,990
and be at peace now.

906
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,260
To be honest,

907
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,600
I knew the moment I first saw Ji An.

908
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,320
I knew it was too late, but I wanted to try.

909
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,890
I wouldn't have given up if it weren't for Ji An.

910
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:41,960
But it's...

911
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,680
impossible for me to beat her.

912
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,920
Oh, my God!

913
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,580
What? What? What?

914
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,740
Is something going on?

915
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,670
No.

916
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,830
What do you mean, no?

917
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,580
You look as if the world has ended.

918
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,770
I know why.

919
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:32,310
Is it because of the store's profit?

920
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,950
To settle down at first-

921
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:36,010
No, Dr. Jung.

922
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:39,230
She's in love with someone right now.

923
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:42,300
But she met a powerful enemy, who is his ex-wife.

924
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,200
While naively playing nice,

925
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,480
she's about to lose him now.

926
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,280
Is that true?

927
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,800
Hey, seriously.

928
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,160
Hey. Aigoo...

929
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,460
You'd better get away from those two.

930
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,310
Birds of a feather flock together.

931
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,190
Because they're just like each other,
they got married, divorced,

932
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,550
- and get back together.
- Come on.

933
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,940
That's what they're doing.

934
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,760
He's not like that.

935
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,700
Ryu Jeong Seok is the worst, okay?

936
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:10,840
Whether it's romance or lust,
they should keep it to themselves.

937
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,570
Why would he shake you up like this?

938
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:17,270
It's not his fault that I like him.

939
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,800
You're the bad guy, then?

940
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,450
They're just living their lives,
but you turned them into bad people.

941
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:28,540
Hey, are you trying to win
the Nobel Peace Prize or something?

942
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,130
Whatever. How frustrating. Forget it.

943
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,965
Lee Ji An, can you handle it?

944
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,110
If you can love until the end, get up now.

945
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,550
Go and tell him.

946
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,120
Tell him to be yours.

947
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,680
That's what I'm saying!

948
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,290
Hey, you bitch. That's what I'm saying right now.

949
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:57,850
Stop this pity party and go now.

950
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,465
Go and say, "Oppa, sleep with me."

951
01:05:00,465 --> 01:05:03,935
No, hold on. "Live with me!"

952
01:05:09,695 --> 01:05:14,960
It's not like that. You don't have to worry.

953
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,160
What's wrong with you? Seriously.

954
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,970
You aren't inferior to Bo Hyeon's mom.

955
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,470
They broke up, anyway.

956
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:26,510
You're more shameless, dogged,

957
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,600
and you and Jeong Seok
are each other's first love.

958
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,550
I told you not to be fearful of fate.
