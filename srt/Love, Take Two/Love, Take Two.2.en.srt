Yes.

15
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,370
The CT and MRI scans detected a brain tumor.

16
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,870
Tumor?

17
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,490
It's not metastatic. It appears protopathic.

18
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,700
We'll know the details after a biopsy.

19
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,400

It's Patient Kim Min Ji, 27 years old.

24
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,990
She was hospitalized due to a sudden tetraplegia.

25
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,900
The test revealed a tumor in the brainstem region.

28

She doesn't eat because she's worried.

Okay.

66

Awake surgery is appropriate

68
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,150
that's melded into the brain.

69
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,800
Her tumor is small in size,

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,230
but it's located near a highly
functional part of the brain.

71
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,420
So, through the awake surgery,

72
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,030
we'll maintain the important part

73
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,720

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,500
<i>I couldn't call Hyo Ri.</i>

183
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,740
<i>I just couldn't for some reason.</i>

184
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,890
<i>Bring her back quickly because I miss her.</i>

185
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,610
Okay. Hang up, bitch.

186
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,280
Dad, hand me the wrench.

187
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,620
Okay.

188
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
- Here.
- Thank you.

189
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,660
You're making me uncomfortable by being here.

190
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,450
Why don't you check out the neighborhood?

191
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,930
Okay.

192
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Dad,

193
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,060
go to downtown. I bought the wrong wire.

194
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,900
It's the wrong size.

195
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,120
Should you be telling me that so secretly?

196
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
Because I would've looked lame.

197
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,170
Right. Men can't look lame.

198
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,200
I'll go without anyone noticing.

199
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,110
What's the deal?

200
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,000
It only took 30 minutes to circle around.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,580
So hot.

202
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,690
<i>The empty fields get filled
with stray dogs at night.</i>

203
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,410
<i>Sometimes, they get into fights with boars.</i>

204
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,490
Boar. Boar.

205
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,440
Hey.

206
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,010
She looks very skillful.

207
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,840
These are basic skills you learn in school.

208
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,120
Are you okay?

209
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,120
Why am I here?

210
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,010
You overdressed to work in the field in this heat.

211
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,300
Of course, you have heat exhaustion.

212
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,710
To get tanned the right amount for my physique,

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,600
I can't be exposed to the sun.

214
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,500
But I can't give up on our garlic, either.

215
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
So, I had no choice...

216
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,440
but to work overdressed like this.

217
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,060
Gosh, my image was ruined.

218
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,500
You have no image to protect around here.

219
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,920
Don't try to save your face and...

220
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,390
just try not to inconvenience others, okay?

221
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,260
If it weren't for her,

222
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,250
you would've gotten eaten by stray dogs.

223
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,000
Do you feel dizzy or nauseous?

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
Drink water little by little often slowly, and

225
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,090
rest enough before you move.

226
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,100
Okay.

227
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,040
But you know...

228
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,320
are you a doctor or a nurse?

229
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,680
I was in medical school, but I quit.

230
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm nothing anymore.

231
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,080
Go to the hospital if you feel sick
after 30 minutes.

232
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,060
Okay.

233
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,640
Thank you.

234
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,870
Bye-bye.

235
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,990
Good work.

236
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,770
She's pretty and smart, too?

237
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,640
Your eyesight is good at times like this.

238
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,550
It's no good.

239
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
Hello. How much are the apples?

240
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
They're 10,000 won for four.

241
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,600
Help yourself. They're tasty.

242
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,230
Hello, sir.

243
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,950
I'm checking out electrical wires.

244
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,350
Will the 5-meter one work?

245
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,620
Aigoo...

246
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,870
Gosh, it hurts...

247
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,100
Gosh, you're so out of touch.

248
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,110
Look. Anchorwoman Baek Ji Yeon
was on the news with this hair.

249
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,290
Gosh, when? When?

250
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,250
Your faces are different.

251
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,830
You easily look pathetic if you try to copy.

252
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,940
What are you saying?

253
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,760
Hey, look.

254
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,870
As the recession continues,

255
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,500
the market prices have been going up.

256
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,170
Hey, that's your problem.

257
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,490
You don't understand the basics.

258
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,970
A newscaster needs a mic.

259
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,200
You need to do it properly.

260
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,700
Fine. If I held this...

261
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,320
As the recession continues...

262
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,120
Are you okay?

263
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,400
<i>He doesn't have any sort of accent.</i>

264
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,800
<i>He said, "Are you okay?"</i>

265
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,640
<i>Go in there!</i>

266
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,690
Jeong Seok!

267
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,190
Jeong Seok! Jeong Seok!

268
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,740
Hey!

269
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,320
I thought the transfer student was a bookworm.

270
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,960
When did you steal a girl's heart, anyway?

271
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,480
Wow.

272
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,380
Look.

273
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,810
- Hey, hold on-
- Hey!

274
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,030
Jeong Seok's girlfriend is here! Oh, my gosh!

275
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,840
What's she doing there?

276
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,100
["In Summer." I mean, "In Jeong Seok."]

277
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,740
Geez, stop.

278
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,540
<i>♫ The sky is open toward us ♫</i>

279
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,080
<i>♫ And you're by my side ♫</i>

280
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,740
<i>♫ You're standing smiling brightly ♫</i>

281
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,420
<i>♫ Yes, you're the blue ocean ♫</i>

282
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,160
<i>♫ You're the blue ocean ♫</i>

283
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,550
<i>♫ I love you ♫</i>

284
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,780
<i>♫ I love you ♫</i>

285
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,740
<i>♫ I love you ♫</i>

286
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,360
<i>♫ I love you ♫</i>

287
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,730
Ryu Jeong Seok?

288
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,400
Lee Ji An?

289
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,150
What a small world.

290
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,600
We ended up meeting again like this.

291
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,370
I know.

292
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,200
You haven't...

293
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,920
changed much, Ms. Lee.

294
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,800
Ms. Lee?

295
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,900
Talk to me casually, Oppa.

296
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,900
I don't talk to any random person casually.

297
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,020
Random person?

298
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,960
Anyway, you became a lot more handsome.

299
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,760
Well, I aged a lot-

300
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,570
You used to wear huge glasses

301
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,800
and those drab clothes... what was it?

302
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,430
You only wore depressing colors.

303
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,330
Your nickname was Pity Party, you know.

304
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,710
I was going for minimalism.

305
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,920
- Minimal-
- But I still liked you.

306
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,170
My friends said I had poor taste,
but I didn't care.

307
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,780
Hey, Lee Ji An.

308
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,860
You're talking casually.

309
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,530
Looks like you can do it with any random person.

310
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,200
I'm joking because I'm happy to see you.

311
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,680
It's so crazy that we met like this.

312
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,760
By the way, what brings you here?

313
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,580
Are you here to get someone, too?

314
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,570
- What?
- I'm here to get my daughter.

315
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,300
She's pretending to be on a trip,
but she ran away.

316
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Did your daughter drive a camper, by chance?

317
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,920
Did you become a psychic?

318
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,760
Let's go.

319
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,800
Isn't it heavy?

320
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,040
Wow, this was your house?

321
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,660
We must have a special connection.

322
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,240
Please don't read into it too much.

323
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,490
Let's call it a coincidence, not fate.

324
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,390
Lee Hyo Ri.

325
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,390
Hey, Lee Hyo Ri.

326
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,140
Hyo Ri.

327
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,140
Lee Hyo Ri!

328
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,080
Hyo Ri.

329
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,610
Didn't you understand what I said?

330
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,970
I told you to leave me alone, even for a moment.

331
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,090
I went to the hospital today.

332
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,940
I got a treatment plan. The treatment fee...

333
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,740
Anyway, let's go to Seoul. Let's properly-

334
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,230
Why do you get to decide
everything? I asked you...

335
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,680
to wait just a few days.

336
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,280
I'm worried your condition would worsen-

337
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,380
I'm trying to live right now.

338
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Do you know what the diagnosis means?

339
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,380
It means I need to change the way I live.

340
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,860
I don't know how much time I have.

341
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,820
So, what I should live for and how...

342
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,520
I need time to figure that out.

343
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,030
How about me?

344
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,770
Am I not...

345
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,730
one of your reasons to live?

346
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm sorry,

347
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,550
but I have no energy to care for you now.

348
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm overwhelmed just thinking for myself.

349
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,840
So, you care for yourself.

350
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,070
Why weren't you there...

351
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,040
when I needed you?

352
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,440
Why me?

353
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,650
Why me?

354
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,080
What did I do wrong?

355
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,830
Why just me?

356
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,570
What did I do wrong, exactly?

357
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,640
Hey!

358
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,110
<i>Hey!</i>

359
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,500
Hey!

360
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,940
Hey!

361
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,690
Hey!

362
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,270
It stopped raining.

363
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,080
Thank you so much.

364
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,660
I'll leave with my daughter tomorrow.

365
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,040
You know the rule of brattiness, right?

366
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,840
Some behave until high school

367
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,490
and get late puberty in their 20s.

368
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm a known brat myself, too.

369
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,910
Menopause beats puberty.

370
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,420
Fighting.

371
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,120
What's wrong?

372
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,180
Don't be fussy. I fell into the ocean.

373
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,870
What? H-How did that happen?

374
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,050
It's okay. I'll do it.

375
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,560
Why did you do that?

376
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,290
It was an accident, right? A mistake, right?

377
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,040
I was standing on the beach,

378
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,150
but the wave suddenly got intense.

379
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,780
Why would you go to the beach?

380
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,490
The wave was too strong,

381
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,650
but I had no energy to withstand it.

382
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,610
It's okay. Let's go to Seoul tomorrow.

383
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,010
The waves were much stronger than I was.

384
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,800
Of course, they are. The ocean is dangerous.

385
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Should I no longer go to the beach
because I might drown again?

386
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,200
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

387
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,590
No.

388
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,080
I won't do that.

389
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,720
I'm not going to Seoul.

390
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,530
Not seeing the ocean even though I want to

391
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,030
because of the fear of drowning.

392
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,700
Waiting until things get safe.

393
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,740
I won't do that anymore.

394
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,890
Hey.

395
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,770
Come to our house.

396
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,650
She must be in shock.

397
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,130
Let's feed her a warm meal.

398
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,810
Okay!

399
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,580
I haven't eaten, either, Hyung.

400
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,720
Hyung, I was so shocked, too.

401
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,000
Earlier at the beach,

402
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,900
I was so shocked. My heart is racing right now.

403
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
I need a warm meal, too, Hyung.

404
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,800
Hyung, we must have a telepathic connection.

405
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
- Come.
- Okay.

406
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,960
Hello.

407
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,160
Hyung, I'll move this and be right there.

408
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,140
Wait, Hyung!

409
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,060
Gosh, let me finish it.

410
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,060
You're so good at cooking meat.

411
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,860
Invite me sometimes, Hyung.

412
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,000
You have a healthy appetite.

413
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,950
I've been told I'm a good eater since I was a kid.

414
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,190
They must've meant it sarcastically.

415
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,510
Pardon?

416
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,260
Never mind.

417
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,570
Thank you for today. I heard you saved her.

418
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,210
Not at all.

419
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,850
By the way,

420
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,030
it's hard to run into a hometown friend like this.

421
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,740
It's meant to be, right?

422
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,310
Hyung...

423
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,490
was really handsome back in school, right?

424
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,500
Your father...

425
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,780
well...

426
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,410
got very good grades.

427
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,110
He was a good student and...

428
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,400
H-He was a good student.

429
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,830
No.

430
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,640
Not that. Wasn't he totally...

431
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,670
handsome and super popular?

432
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,200
Girls lined up in front of his school
to see him, right?

433
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,740
Excuse me, I keep saying he was
a good student repeatedly.

434
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,570
Don't you think there must be a reason

435
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,060
and you should stop, maybe?

436
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:13,010
I fed meat to these people and this?

437
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,630
You got funnier, Ji An.

438
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,910
Yes. I got really funny.

439
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,530
You have a beautiful home.

440
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,320
I've always wanted to live in a house like this.

441
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,300
- A house like this?
- Yes.

442
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,690
A house with a picturesque view
outside the window.

443
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,300
You see the seasons changing.

444
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,590
It has stairs, a high ceiling, and a garden, too.

445
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,300
It's like a house in dramas.

446
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,130
Hey, I said I'll build a nice house for us.

447
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,500
When I was little,

448
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,300
I found it ironic that we don't have a house

449
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,040
when you build houses, after all.

450
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,080
But not anymore.

451
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,860
I just...

452
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,890
want you to not lend money
to others, save modestly,

453
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,680
and get a small apartment soon.

454
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,890
Mom is a construction site manager.

455
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,760
A site manager?

456
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,200
I know a lot of good lots to build houses.

457
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,880
Discuss with your husband and let me
know if you really want to build.

458
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,150
I'll recommend a few lots
I've been keeping a secret.

459
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,200
I'm a single mom.

460
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,950
- If I tell you about raising Hyo Ri alone-
- Thank you for the meal.

461
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,560
I'm not feeling well. I should rest.

462
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,210
Let's go, Mom.

463
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,010
Why are you suddenly doing this?

464
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,130
Are you in pain, by chance?

465
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,540
- Is that something to brag about?
- What?

466
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,580
Are you proud that you raised me alone?

467
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,200
Should I get you an award or something?

468
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,780
Hey, should I be ashamed, then?

469
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,300
I chose to have you and raised you so well.

470
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,430
I should be proud. Is that a shame?

471
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,270
You could be proud since it was your decision.

472
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,300
What about me?

473
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,800
I was born a daughter of a single mom.
I didn't even get to choose.

474
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,700
- Hey.
- You think you should be proud?

475
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,770
Then, why not say you adopted me, too?

476
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,440
Wouldn't that make you prouder?

477
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,140
Why bring that up now?

478
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,070
What does that have to do with anything?

479
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,230
When you have meals with people,

480
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,150
they always ask where your dad
is and what he does.

481
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,810
I'd rather come right out and tell them-

482
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,690
That's why you blabbered to everyone
throughout my school days

483
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,230
when we made introductions.

484
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,200
Did you find that embarrassing?

485
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,910
Why did you pretend you were okay
when I was telling people?

486
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,330
You should've told me not to say anything.

487
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,210
I wasn't okay with it.

488
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,710
I had to pretend like I didn't care

489
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,640
to feel less embarrassed. So, I acted okay.

490
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,960
Because I didn't want other kids talking about us,

491
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,530
I studied desperately.

492
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,240
Because grades equal power,

493
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,250
I studied desperately so they couldn't say a word.

494
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,310
So, don't say that to people
in front of me anymore.

495
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,920
If you really want to brag about it,

496
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,580
do it when I'm not around to people
who have nothing to do with me.

497
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,280
Is that why you looked down on me,

498
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,950
dropped out without discussing with me,

499
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,100
and refusing to go to a hospital in Seoul?

500
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,420
- I'll manage myself.
- Manage what? You can't manage this alone.

501
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,350
Will you keep treating me like this?

502
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,690
Fine, I get it.

503
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,930
I-I made no accomplishments,

504
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,250
and I didn't do much for you.

505
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,590
Now, I know I blabber my mouth,
not knowing when to shut it.

506
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,490
Fine. We're going to Seoul tomorrow.

507
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,300
Let's stop.

508
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,580
[Dongjong Kindergarten Talent Show]

509
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,860
Who's that?

510
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,520
Is she someone's sister?

511
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,630
Don't you know? She's Hyo Ri's mom.

512
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,410
Gosh, did she have her in high school?

513
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,610
She must've been a partier.

514
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,960
I heard she divorced her husband, too.

515
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,230
If I stayed with my first love,

516
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,990
my son would've joined the military by now.

517
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,520
Not everyone can do that.

518
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,430
You have to have the knack for it.

519
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,200
Must've lived up to her pretty face.

520
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,700
Hey, if it were about looks,

521
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,770
she can't beat me.

522
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,300
You're so silly.

523
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,600
Seriously. You're pretty.

524
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,950
Hello.

525
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,450
I'm Hyo Ri's mom.

526
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,680
We kind of know.

527
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,200
What is it?

528
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,180
I know. I think you kind of know.

529
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,940
I wanted to provide facts.

530
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,310
It's true that I was a partier in high school.

531
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,880
But I had her after graduating.

532
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,100
I'm not a divorcee. I never married.

533
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,010
I'm a single mom.

534
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,460
And you...

535
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,490
are nowhere near my competition.

536
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,100
Why is there nothing easy in this world?

537
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:33,120
I always attacked first because
it was tough to hear murmurs.

538
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,020
But that wasn't the solution.

539
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,100
How could I have known that
it made things harder for you, girl?

540
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,550
Excuse me.

541
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,800
I think there was a transaction between us.

542
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,400
Just like I'm trying my best to fix the camper,

543
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,100
I want you to do your best to work here, too.

544
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,560
I don't ever do anything half-ass.

545
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,090
Whenever I do something,

546
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,000
I always get the perfect score.

547
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
- Perfect score?
- Perfect score.

548
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,310
Okay, then.

549
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,600
I'll be expecting a thorough job.

550
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,530
Give me your hand.

551
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,470
Another fragrant day.

552
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,890
- Nice, nice, nice!
- Nice, nice, nice!

553
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,350
Nice, nice, nice. Okay?

554
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,230
One more time.

555
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,760
- Another fragrant day. Nice, nice, nice!
- Another fragrant day. Nice, nice, nice!

556
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,300
- This is Korea.
- Go.

557
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,770
So, let me repeat myself.

558
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,600
Cut the stem at a 45-degree angle like this.

559
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,320
The cross-section needs to be large
so it absorbs water and grows.

560
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,150
- Here?
- - No, no. A little lower.

561
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,850
- Lower?
- Yeah.

562
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,730
<i>At a 45-degree angle.</i>

563
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,770
You're good.

564
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,540
45-degree angle...

565
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,250
That's right.

566
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,080
You did it right.

567
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,400
Are you tired?

568
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,010
No, not at all.

569
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,390
Really?

570
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,370
Yes, I'm fine.

571
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,030
You must've worked for a long time.

572
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,560
Has it been six years?

573
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,900
I started when I dropped out in 11th grade.

574
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,360
It's been about six years.

575
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,720
I see.

576
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,380
It was nice to see.

577
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,790
Huh?

578
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,210
You seemed happy.

579
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,920
You're right.

580
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,220
I really love this job.

581
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,400
By the way,

582
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,090
why do you act so rude?

583
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,090
Why are you rude to your mom?

584
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,320
I saw you arguing with your mom yesterday.

585
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,580
- You-
- That doesn't make you feel less victimized.

586
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,880
You don't lose love for her, either.

587
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,890
So, why do you keep behaving rudely to her?

588
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,350
It's not something you should care about.

589
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,930
Don't overstep the bounds, please.

590
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,470
You're right.

591
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,800
I overstepped the bounds.

592
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm sorry.

593
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,380
Hyo Ri.

594
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,740
Your mom must've left this yesterday.

595
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,330
It kept ringing.

596
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,550
- Thank you.
- Sure.

597
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,550
Don't look at me like that
first thing in the morning.

598
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,520
Get ready to go to Seoul.

599
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,980
<i>Hey, it's Chief Hwang's mother's
80th birthday today.</i>

600
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,700
<i>His family lives in Cheonghae.</i>

601
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,500
<i>Go see him. You need your 30 million won back.</i>

602
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,800
<i>The address is...</i>

603
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,090
Again? Did you lend money again?

604
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,610
Why...

605
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,280
Are you set to be a pushover for good?

606
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,400
- It's not that. It's not that.
- It's not?

607
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,270
Chief Hwang's mother is sick.

608
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,480
I told you.

609
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,760
Monetary exchange is for those who can afford it.

610
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,970
Or it's for people who don't mind burning bridges.

611
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,960
I said you aren't qualified.

612
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,100
I'll get it back. He promised to pay back.

613
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,970
Follow me.

614
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,970
Hey, where are we going? It hurts.

615
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,560
Auntie Seon Yeong sent you the
address. You have to go there.

616
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,070
Will you lose 30 million won?

617
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,810
It's okay. I'll go. You stay.

618
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,860
You're not well.

619
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,660
Where is it?

620
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,680
You shouldn't have given a loan if you
cared about me so much.

621
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
It's not far from here. Take a taxi.

622
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,200
Hey, I said I'll take care of it.

623
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,680
And it's hard to get a taxi here.

624
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,100
- Hello.
- Hi.

625
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:37,480
What?

626
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,240
It takes about 30 minutes. Should I play music?

627
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,340
Okay. Play NEXT, please.

628
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,700
Let's drive quietly.

629
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,110
You're so inconsiderate.

630
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,700
He's suggested playing music because it's awkward.

631
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,500
- Right?
- Pardon?

632
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,300
- Well...
- He wants to drive quietly,

633
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,400
but he's wondering if he should
play music, after seeing your face,

634
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,460
to be considerate of his elder.

635
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,110
- Right?
- Huh?

636
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,450
- Yes...
- Hey, hey, did you say elder just now?

637
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,570
People still think I'm a college
student if I get dolled up.

638
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,320
I haven't heard such a silly
statement in a long time.

639
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,520
Wow, seriously.

640
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,700
Bo Hyeon, when you first saw me,

641
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,620
you thought I was in my 20s
at a glance from afar, right?

642
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,290
Why do you keep pressuring him? Don't do that.

643
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,980
It'd be pressure if I were unreasonable.

644
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,580
I'm just asking for fact-checking.
That's not putting pressure.

645
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,670
I think this is it.

646
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,120
I won't let him get away with it.
I'll flip everything upside down.

647
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,360
Do it right. Don't argue pointlessly.

648
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,400
Swear, scream, roll eyes, and fight.

649
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,470
- You can't get the money back otherwise.
- You just watch.

650
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,460
I worked at a construction site for years.

651
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,000
We'll take a taxi on the way back. You can go.

652
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,950
Thank you.

653
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,910
Mr. Hwang Yeong Ju!

654
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,070
Mr. Hwang Yeong Ju!

655
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,830
Don't say "Mister."

656
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,140
Gosh, got it. This girl...

657
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,630
Hwang Yeong Ju!

658
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,910
Chief Hwang!

659
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,490
Are you home alone?

660
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,350
No.

661
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,420
Where's dad? Where's he?

662
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,680
Dad is at Grandma's hospital.

663
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,250
It's a nursing hospital.

664
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,050
Who are you?

665
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,200
Huh? Gosh, thank you.

666
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,750
Thank you.

667
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,710
We don't know...

668
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,700
where Dad went.

669
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,280
Oh, I see.

670
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,070
Where's Mom?

671
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,920
Your siblings are so healthy.

672
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,690
- Don't say stuff like that.
- Ouch!

673
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,900
Gosh, are you okay?

674
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,870
Are you okay?

675
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,410
It hurts.

676
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,890
Noona, I'm hungry.

677
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,350
Okay.

678
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,210
I'll make you food and go to work.

679
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,940
Do you work?

680
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,920
I clean griddles at a barbecue restaurant.

681
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,640
There's nothing more fun than watching fights.

682
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,530
I'm not going anywhere.

683
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,430
They should start screaming soon.

684
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,860
Huh?

685
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,360
One, two, three.

686
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,570
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

687
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,580
Two, three.

688
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,910
There.

689
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

690
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,270
There.

691
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,840
Smile.

692
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,380
Smile.

693
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,210
Here.

694
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,840
- A heart.
- So pretty.

695
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,760
- Eat.
- Thank you.

696
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,060
Let me help you.

697
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,280
Put ketchup.

698
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,590
Enjoy.

699
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,940
Say ah.

700
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,540
Enjoy.

701
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,020
Eat this.

702
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,790
Do you want to try this?

703
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,300
Aigoo, you acted all tough and smart.

704
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,350
Since when did you care about humanity?

705
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,290
Geez.

706
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,740
Excuse me!

707
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,780
Huh?

708
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,950
Well...

709
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,300
<i>It's Grandma's 80th birthday.</i>

710
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,800
<i>He's treating Grandma and her friends for a meal.</i>

711
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,930
Wow, he's having a party instead of paying me?

712
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,620
Can you do it properly?

713
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,060
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

714
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:28,960
<i>♫ Deep within the waves of the Samakdo ♫</i>

715
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,970
<i>♫ The young bride standing at the dock ♫</i>

716
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,710
Mom, happy 80th birthday!

717
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,470
Applause.

718
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,690
Be healthy!

719
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,620
Gosh, so frustrating.

720
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,340
Manager Lee.

721
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,420
