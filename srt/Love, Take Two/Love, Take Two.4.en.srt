5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm sorry for making you feel scared.

6
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,390
But to be honest,

7
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm scared, too.

8
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,060
Mom, I'm so scared.

9
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,910
- Mom, I'm scared.
- It's okay.

10
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,310
I wanted to tell you that.

11
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,270

12
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,100

23
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,860
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

24

- I'll pick up the medicine.
- Okay.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
I think she'd take long. Should we wait in the car?

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,500
- Aren't you tired?
- No.

27
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,300
- Auntie.
- Yes.

- Did you two talk yesterday?
- Yes.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,340
Gosh. Good job. Good job.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,380
You could've honestly talked about

33
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,400
how you felt from the beginning.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,890
You heard about building a house, right?

35
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,440
I feel relieved after telling you.

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,190
Being honest is always the best.

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
House? What house?

38
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,800
We're building a house?

39
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,840
- Huh?
- Huh?

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,710
Build what?

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,290
I'll cook instead.

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Because I'm a cook.

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,390
Geez. Oh, no...

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,540
Well,

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,990
the thing is, Hyo Ri...

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,220
Don't get angry and listen.

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,550
All done. Let's go.

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Why is she in a bad mood?
Why are you giving me a stink eye?

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,370
I heard someone is planning
to fix up an abandoned house.

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,070
I spilled everything.

51
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,480
I heard there isn't a single house nearby.

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,350
Without even a door, it's assumed
that it was vacant for decades.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,470
I asked her what's good about it, and
after much thinking, she came up with

54
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,020
how it's like renting the entire mountain.

55
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,910
What a ridiculous answer.

56
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,310
Geez.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,700
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,640
It's... It's a very beautiful traditional house.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,070
People in the village call it a mansion.

60
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,720
- Yes, yes.
- Ask the corner store lady.

61
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,290
Let's go there, then.

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Go where?

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,470
Let's go to the traditional house called a mansion.

64
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,910
Let's go.

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,950
You can go later. Later...

66
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,800
Hyo Ri, let's go later.

67
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,170
Why are you stopping?

68
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,340
We're in the neighborhood,

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
- but let's rest today since you're tired.
- No.

70
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,490
Let's go right now.

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,200
Yes. It's better to get it over with.

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,350
I'm not the only one who's tired of him, right?

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,920
No, definitely not.

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

75
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,460
Are you going home? Give us a ride, too.

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,750
No, we aren't going home.
We need to stop by somewhere.

77
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,180
Where?

78
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Looks like you're going somewhere really nice.

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,980
- Let's follow them.
- No, why...

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,900
Get in. Let's go. Just get in.

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,110
Should we scooch a bit?

82
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,340
Yes, yes.

83
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,460
A little more. A little more. Right.

84
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,530
- Keep going. Nice.
- My goodness. What in the world.

85
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,020
Oh, yeah. Go, go, go.

86
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,300
This isn't reality.

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey, give her time. This house takes

88
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,660
some time to get used to it.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,800
It... It feels so exotic.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
Exotic? You mean, the scenery
is exotic or something?

91
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,100
Yes.

92
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,110
Right here. This part.

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,100
Over here.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,980
It's Serengeti!

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,930
If you put a few lions here like in a jungle,

96
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,860
- it'd be exactly like Serengeti.
- There are no lions.

97
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,700
There are a lot of boars in the mountains.

98
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,800
There are wild dogs, too.
That's why it's Serengeti.

99
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,990
Yes.

100
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,240
- Good.
- Bo Hyeon,

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,090
if boars and wild dogs fought, who'd win?

102
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,250
- That's not important right now.
- No. What's important now?

103
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,950
Checking this place out is. Come here.

104
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,630
Wow, daebak. Look here.

105
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,240
Come over here.

106
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,390
Why is he here?

107
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,800
I came since the borough office
is doing due diligence for repurposing.

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
Did you bring Hyo Ri to show her the house?

109
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,800
Thanks to someone, I'm having an open
house for the whole neighborhood.

110
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey, keep it short. Keep it short.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,150
Wow, daebak.

112
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
- Why are they here?
- Hyung!

113
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,450
This is...

114
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,830
totally daebak. I mean...

115
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,000
the inside and outside are completely...

116
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,700
bizarre.

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,100
I think this is a very attractive house.

118
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,190
Really, it's daebak.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,600
<i>He's the only one on my side,
but I don't feel comforted at all.</i>

120
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I think I saw this house in a drama.

121
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,070
A drama? What drama?

122
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,160
Kingdom.

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,050
I know that one.

124
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,940
Zombies walk on roofs and stuff.

125
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,710
Must be nice. You're so knowledgeable.

126
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,390
The borough office people are here.

127
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,100
- Hello.
- Hi.

128
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,310
That house is really no good.

129
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,260
No way.

130
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,440
You saw the borough office
employees earlier, right?

131
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,410
We already got the paperwork done.

132
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,720
The house has been abandoned,

133
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,330
but it'd be nice if we fixed it up well.

134
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,580
It's so hard to find a house

135
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,130
with a view like that these days.

136
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,740
That house is what people call...

137
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,020
the mountain and water location.

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,800
Is there a river in front of the house?

139
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,300
- Mountain and water?
- Mountain after mountain, more like.

140
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,310
To fix the house,

141
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,600
it'd cost a lot of money. Do you have money?

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,200
I have to go to the hospital now.
We'd have a lot of expenses.

143
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,480
And will you stop working now?

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,020
Whether you get back to work or get
a new job, you have to return to Seoul.

145
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,330
Why would you build a house here?

146
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,170
I have severance pay and a security deposit.

147
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,720
And with that money, we'll upgrade the annex

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,790
with Auntie Seon Yeong and open a restaurant.

149
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,440
Restaurant?

150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,450
Can you cook or have a good personality?

151
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,000
- Restaurant?
- You diss me to my face?

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,350
Just give up. We already got the paperwork done.

153
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,480
I'll call them and cancel it tomorrow.

154
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,100
- It's all over.
- I said you can't-

155
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,200
Huh? Bo Hyeon.

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,690
Don't worry. We're joking around.

157
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,210
You know, on National Geographic,

158
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,180
the mom and baby growl and play around.

159
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,530
That's what we're doing now, right?

160
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,980
No.

161
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,000
Can I get your 'best help' tomorrow?

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
- Sure.
- Let's leave at seven, then.

163
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,070
Okay.

164
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,340
- See you.
- Okay.

165
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,220
Gosh.

166
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,020
What's the 'best help'?

167
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,060
Here comes the next box.

168
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,450
It has a red label on it.

169
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,600
Mixed colored roses. There's another box, right?

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
- Yes, another one.
- Okay.

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,800
Red roses are here...

172
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,940
You're a good worker.

173
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,240
I can tell she went to medical school.

174
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,070
She's good at everything.

175
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,660
Will these really become flowers?

176
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,490
This is called propagation.

177
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,280
If you cultivate a branch from the mother plant,

178
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,780
it becomes a seedling.

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,090
If you plant the seedling in a pot,

180
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,780
it grows flowers.

181
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,050
How fascinating.

182
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,000
Flowers and people need to grow up
away from their mother.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,370
If the mother coddles too much,

184
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,940
you can't develop on your own.

185
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,150
Look at me.

186
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,020
Because my mom raised me free-range,

187
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,000
I turned out so well.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,150
You're right.

189
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,870
You were basically a calf.

190
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,700
She made you leave at sunrise

191
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,030
and not let you come home before sunset.

192
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,800
How could you call a person a calf?

193
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,310
- What?
- How about a bull?

194
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,910
Have a cow, man.

195
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Bo Hyeon, bring more cases from the storage.

196
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,020
Okay.

197
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,030
I think she was raised like
a plant in a greenhouse.

198
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,730
When a plant in a greenhouse becomes a human,

199
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,280
it becomes a bookworm.

200
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,530
A foxtail?

201
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,470
What?

202
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,190
I wasn't a plant in a greenhouse, but a foxtail.

203
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,250
You have to let wild plants grow naturally,

204
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,150
but my mom wanted to raise me well.

205
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,440
But she couldn't afford to put me in a greenhouse.

206
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,100
So, she kept watering the weed on the path.

207
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,050
Not knowing I drowned and ran out of oxygen.

208
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,600
I was like a sick foxtail that barely

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,380
managed to survive.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,370
I was more like that than a plant in a greenhouse.

211
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,490
She's different because she went to medical school.

212
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,800
Look how eloquent she is.

213
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,580
I like Bo Hyeon.

214
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,750
How about you?

215
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,900
How about you, Ms. Foxtail?

216
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,200
I have high standards.

217
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,220
Hey. Bo Hyeon is a good guy, okay?

218
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,990
I know. So, I'm considering liking him.

219
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,300
Wow, Bo Hyeon. Lucky you.

220
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,690
Stop being silly and finish the rest.

221
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,790
I'll stop by the post office on the way home.

222
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,610
That's okay, right?

223
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,580
I think we can get up to four rooms.

224
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,600
I think the size would be awkward.

225
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,080
It won't be impossible to extend the rafters.

226
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,370
- Okay.
- Oh, really?

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,700
If this becomes spacious, it'd feel more open.

228
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,300
The beams are stronger than expected.
I think it'd be okay.

229
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,790
Gosh, seriously.

230
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,700
You're so smart.

231
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,220
Pardon?

232
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,980
Huh?

233
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,970
- Stop.
- Well, no.

234
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,730
You're so intelligent and...

235
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,330
How should I say? Attentive.

236
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,180
You're like that.

237
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,910
You said you know a demolition team, right?

238
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,050
Pardon?

239
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,600
I got a call.

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,300
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,930
He got a call.

242
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,160
Don't worry about the construction team.

243
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,070
I'll assist you closely by your side.

244
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,810
By my side? Assist? Why?

245
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,380
Oh, he doesn't know.

246
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm pretty experienced in this field.
Pretty experienced.

247
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,520
- Okay, stop.
- Yes, I'll help you.

248
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,370
I'll do my best. Don't worry.

249
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,240
I'll stay right by your side.

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,050
I should go to Seoul to check out materials.

251
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,030
Really? Let me come with you.

252
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,000
Check out the materials,
meet the construction team

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,890
- and see our place, too.
- Okay, okay.

254
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,000
Should we go get makgeolli
since we're in a good mood?

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
- What makgeolli?
- How does that sound?

256
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,170
Let's go. You and I.

257
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,500
- Where? Where? Just us two?
- Get makgeolli.

258
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
- They would feel left out, then.
- It's okay.

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,110
Don't feel left out. Come!

260
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,650
- I'm sorry.
- W-What's wrong with her?

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,050
Thank you.

262
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,940
[Know More About Bumpaldt University of Berlin]

263
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,680
Sorry. I was going to go soon.

264
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,140
There are so many hidden hot spots here, right?

265
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,740
Yeah.

266
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,830
It's so pretty.

267
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,220
Follow me.

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,290
Sorry. What do I do?

269
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,980
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,900
- I'm sorry, too.
- No, I set my foot wrong.

271
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,950
I apologized in advance, okay?

272
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,780
Are you crazy?

273
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,430
No.

274
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,790
You're wet now.

275
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
You can cross daringly without being afraid now.

276
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,810
The worst that could happen is
your feet getting a bit wetter.

277
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,900
Don't be scared.

278
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,920
You're right.

279
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,490
I was scared for no reason.

280
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,740
It feels nice and cool.

281
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,350
Hey, you...

282
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,900
Stop!

283
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,620
Are you okay? Are you okay?

284
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,240
Am I okay?

285
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,570
Hold on. Hold on. Time out.

286
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,190
What are you thinking about?

287
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,220
What? I'm not thinking.

288
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,530
Let's leave at 10 tomorrow.

289
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,760
Okay.

290
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,970
Are you going somewhere?

291
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,920
I need to sort things out at home tomorrow

292
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,740
and your mom is meeting
with the construction team.

293
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,640
Will you really build that house?

294
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,590
Yes, I'll take care of it.

295
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,690
Don't try to argue.

296
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,900
<i>Are you dead?</i>

297
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,030
<i>Come quickly.</i>

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,670
Auntie, I'll go to Seoul tomorrow, too.

299
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,260
Did something come up?

300
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,300
Are you in pain, by chance?

301
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,570
I'm not.

302
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,070
I'm totally fine.

303
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,570
Hey, dry your hair first.

304
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,510
- We'll go.
- Okay, bye.

305
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,800
- Shall we?
- Yes.

306
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,840
We have a tight schedule today.

307
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,900
Take a nap. I'll wake you up when we arrive.

308
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,200
How could I sleep now?

309
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,190
Let's discuss the plan on the way

310
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,080
and we should check our schedule again.

311
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,990
We're in an emergency based
on the current schedule.

312
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,460
And I'm too sensitive to sleep
when someone's driving.

313
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,630
Emergency, she said?

314
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,120
What? Sensitive, she said?

315
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,490
You should have some, too.

316
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,260
I'm so relieved that you guys made up.

317
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,970
Because you're just like me,

318
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,700
you don't hold grudges, right?

319
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,320
I went to medical school because I resemble you.

320
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,230
- I couldn't go near it if I took after Mom.
- Right on!

321
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,710
You're exactly like me.

322
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,220
Of course.

323
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,990
You're perceptive and smart like me.

324
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,780
- By the way...
- Yes?

325
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm not sure...

326
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,410
what I should tell Sook about my illness.

327
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,670
Why would you worry?

328
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,510
It's Sook.

329
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,610
She understands how you feel better than you.

330
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,870
You're right.

331
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,460
It's Sook.

332
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,310
Why did I worry?

333
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,600
Even if you don't explain everything,

334
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,660
she'll feel it in her heart.

335
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,850
We're like that, too.

336
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,750
I...

337
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,480
don't always have to explain.

338
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,950
Hey!

339
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,860
Let's go. Let's go.

340
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,730
Just take it.

341
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,190
Lee Hyo Ri!

342
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm here.

343
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,090
- Be quiet.
- What took you so long?

344
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,580
What?

345
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,860
Hyo Ri!

346
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,800
Are you sure you made an
appointment? It's been an hour.

347
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,910
Fieldwork doesn't end on time.

348
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,850
Things always change.

349
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,900
You should know better.

350
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,050
Are you bored?

351
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,260
Should we play word chain?
Loser gets flicked on the head.

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,710

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,270
- Hey. Come on...
- Five. Four...

- Three.
- Jeong, jeong...

- Two.
- Jeongyok*. Jeongyok! (Also means "lust")

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,180
Hey, are you crazy?

361
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,770
Why did you hit me? I said the word.

362
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,090
You ran out of time.

363
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,300
The simpler the game, the more
suspenseful it needs to be to be fun.

364
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,500
And your word choice is too explicit.

365
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,620
Hey. You started it...

366
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,150
Let's start over.

367
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,350
I'll start.

368
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,940
- Sangiseuk*. (Means "foothill")
- Manager Lee!

369
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,480
Chief. Let's go.

370
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,000
Go where? We need to play another round.

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,090
Oppa, we're turning 50 soon.

372
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,300
Geez. Hurry up and come.

373
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,790
Shit.

374
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,380
I almost peed my pants
when I saw your mom that day.

375
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
I was scared. How are you still fine?

376
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,560
Congratulations on coming back.

377
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,200
- Congrats.
- My friend.

378
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

379
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,920
The sunset, the weather, and the beer.

380
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,250
I've been waiting for this day.

381
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,370
I'll finish the beer and talk.

382
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,560
The worksite isn't large,

383
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,260
but it won't be easy since it's an old building.

384
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,120
That doesn't matter.

385
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,970
It's Manager Lee's house.

386
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,630
I'll plaster the house even if
it were on top of the mountain.

387
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,030
You're all talk.

388
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,980
Another bottle of soju, please.

389
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,720
- Okay.
- Mr. Jeong should be coming, too.

390
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,930
Mr. Jeong?

391
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,590
He must be busy with the retail complex in Songdo.

392
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,360
I bragged to him that I'm building your house.

393
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,310
And he got angry, saying, "Why didn't she tell me?"

394
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,420
It's because I know how busy he is.

395
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,720
You realize it when the titles come off.

396
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
How you've lived your life.

397
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,950
Manager Lee, you led a good life.

398
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,240
Many people are helping you.

399
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,460
You heard him, right?

400
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,900
Here.

401
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,900
Manager Lee, don't disappoint us like this.

402
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,320
Hey!

403
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,740
- Seriously.
- Hello.

404
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,640
You bastards. They came as soon as they heard.

405
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,450
This is what's wrong with you. You're too selfless.

406
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,350
That's why I came so quickly.

407
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,440
Sit down quickly, then. Sit.

408
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,380
Bring us more soju.

409
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,860
- Okay.
- Manager Lee!

410
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,390
Come in! Come in! Sit.

411
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,260
A box of soju, please.

412
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,250
Hey, hey.

413
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,810
Manager Lee,

414
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,530
we bet on something.

415
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
- You need to tell us the truth.
- Okay.

416
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,500
- We go further back, right?
- What do you mean?

417
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,060
- We've known each other for 14 years.
- 14 years...

418
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,700
Right. Mr. Han started in Euiwang in 2014.

419
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,000
Mr. Choi started in Gwangju. So, it was 2018.

420
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,020
- Yes!
- Okay!

421
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,720
Let's drink!

422
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,190
Let's drink! Let's drink!

423
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,800
Free drinks taste the best.

424
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,160
It's been too long.

425
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,500
I had no one to come with since
you were gone. I'm so happy right now.

426
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,800
It's because you're too picky with people.

427
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,050
Who's she? Was it Min Jeong in your department?

428
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,650
- You said she's all right.
- Gosh.

429
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,420
I can't hang out with the MZ Generation.

430
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,500
Kids these days don't have
respect for their elders.

431
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,500
You can't be that elder,
who's only two years older, right?

432
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,380
Between her and I,

433
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,800
- there's a hurdle, which is her eyelashes.
- What?

434
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,880
She wears eyelashes that look like fingers.

435
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,860
Whenever she blinks when I'm talking to her,

436
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,600
I feel the wind on my face from her eyelashes.

437
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,150
- I can't hear anything she says.
- That makes no sense.

438
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,490
It's true.

439
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,350
What's this?

440
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,790
What is it?

441
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,440
What?

442
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,600
Lee Hyo Ri, what is it?

443
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,000
Sorry.

444
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,460
Fine. I'm not sorry.

445
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,400
I won't tell you to cheer up.

446
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,710
Let's have fun.

447
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,330
Quit your silly studies

448
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,450
and do whatever you want.

449
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,860
Fail, ruin things,

450
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,680
and live a messy and fun life.

451
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,130
Okay?

452
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,060
Let's really live however we want.

453
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,500
I swear I will.

454
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,130
Yes. That's it. Okay.

455
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,860
I'll go to Cheonghae when the semester ends.

456
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,100
Let's have tons of fun.

457
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,360
We sure will. You have to come, okay?

458
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,470
Okay, I'll come.

459
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,310
I'm off.

460
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,240
<i>Cheers!</i>

461
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,960
Someone's here.

462
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,360
- What?
- Hyo Ri.

463
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,560
- Lee Hyo Ri!
- Lee Hyo Ri!

464
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,970
Manager Lee, she's so pretty.

465
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,230
Right? She's my daughter.

466
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,080
She's pretty because she's my daughter.

467
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,860
[Hyo Ri]

468
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
[Are you dead? Come quickly]

469
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,800
<i>Daughter, where are you?</i>

470
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,300
- Dad.
<i>- You scared me.</i>

471
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,880
<i>Hey, why aren't you home yet?</i>

472
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,540
<i>Where are you?</i>

473
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,850
<i>Should I come arrest you?</i>

474
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,480
Dad.

475
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,840
<i>What?</i>

476
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,190
<i>I have no money.</i>

477
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,210
<i>Mom caught me giving you money and...</i>

478
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,330
<i>Hey, I'll die if I get caught again.</i>

479
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,420
<i>What?</i>

480
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,400
<i>What's wrong, Sook?</i>

481
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,300
<i>What's wrong?</i>

482
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,950
Dad,

483
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,500
H-Hyo Ri...

484
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,830
She's sick.

485
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,380
But not knowing that,

486
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,780
I texted asking if she was dead...

487
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,820
What do I do, Dad?

488
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,810
What do I do, Dad?

489
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,290
Dad, what do I do?

490
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,480
<i>Oh, no... Gosh.</i>

491
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,090
<i>Sook.</i>

492
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,170
Drink, drink.

493
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,310
Have another glass. Have another glass.

494
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,480
- Have some.
- Okay.

495
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,330
Don't be like that.

496
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,470
Thank you.

497
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,950
That doesn't taste good.

498
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,970
I don't get it.

499
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Just like Anchorwoman Baek Ji Yeon,

500
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,720
I'll become a carrier woman.

501
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
You want to become a carrier?

502
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
Career. Not carrier, you fool.

503
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,020
Don't be such a stickler.

504
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,820
You understand what I was saying.

505
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,510
Why would you be nitpicky?

506
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,870
If you're so smart,

507
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,300
why do you get chicken and kitchen mixed up?

508
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,310
That's not...

509
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,890
I'll be back.

510
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,780
- I'll pour you one.
- By the way...

511
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,060
Hyo Ri, you know...

512
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,870
Looking at her face,

513
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,130
I can tell she had an...

514
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,670
appendix surgery when she was in the 9th grade.

515
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,450
How did you know that?

516
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,300
To be honest,

517
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,030
that's why I became good friends with your mom.

518
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,100
The end has to be thicker.

519
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,830
Apply more on the side.

520
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:48,310
Why don't you do it yourself?

521
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,530
Why is she nitpicking?

522
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,090
I'm not nitpicking.

523
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,970
It's a necessary step. Fix it.

524
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,300
<i>A female manager at a construction site?</i>

525
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,840
<i>Gosh, it's hard.</i>

526
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,980
<i>You can't do that unless you're really gutsy.</i>

527
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,380
All the people in this field...

528
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,530
have quite a bit of temper.

529
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,990
Director, remove the pins

530
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,100
and polish the surface, too.

531
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,700
I was going to do all that, anyway.

532
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,900
I was going to check this first.

533
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,260
I already had a plan, okay?

534
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,550
Do I have to read your mind, too?

535
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,670
Work in the normal order.

536
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,680
Do you know how to finish walls?

537
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,140
I'm working hard. If you know nothing...

538
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,560
She was obviously right,

539
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,460
but she kept giving orders.

540
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,600
To be honest, I didn't like her at first, either.

541
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,830
A lot of you were...

542
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,200
determined to teach her a lesson, right?

543
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
Remember Mr. Park from Taean Supplies?

544
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,680
- Yes, yes.
- He even slapped her in the face.

545
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,860
Because the order got canceled.

546
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,140
But she didn't even bat an eye.

547
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,500
Gosh, she's tough. Yes.

548
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,230
I thought, "I shouldn't get involved
with her," at first.

549
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,960
But...

550
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,680
Geez.

551
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,700
Yes, it's me. Did you have lunch?

552
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,990
Hey, you need to take care of yourself.

553
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Tell the nurse you slept through
the lunch hour and eat right now.

554
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,200
You need to care for yourself if I can't be there.

555
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,380
Tell them right now.

556
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,970
<i>She was crying.</i>

557
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,690
<i>She said her daughter was hospitalized.</i>

558
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,200
But we were having a work emergency, too.

559
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,220
Imagine how she must've felt.

560
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,930
<i>I saw her forcing herself to eat</i>

561
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,700
<i>while crying silently.</i>

562
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,530
<i>Gosh, seeing that,</i>

563
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,220
<i>I finally thought,</i>

564
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,420
<i>"She's...</i>

565
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,700
<i>trying to survive, too."</i>

566
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,100
That was...

567
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,210
the moment I fell for her.

568
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,480
That's right.

569
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,410
- I'm sure everyone here is the same.
- Of course.

570
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,500
Yes.

571
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,700
Manager Lee's frustrating yet simple spirit.

572
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,640
You're hopeless once you fall for that.

573
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,630
I'm hopeless. I'm hopeless. Help me.

574
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,730
I got everyone a hangover cure.

575
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,000
Manager Lee is the best!

576
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,900
I haven't drunk this much in a while.

577
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,600
I feel... I feel sick.

578
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,080
Hey, if you throw up in here,

579
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,200
forget the house. Our friendship is over.

580
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,900
Should you hang a bag on your ears?

581
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,800
Wait a minute.

582
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,720
Gosh. Gosh. What do I do?

583
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,400
Gosh, I don't know.

584
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,300
- I don't know, don't know, don't know.
- What's with her?

585
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,520
W-What's the problem?

586
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,100
Oppa,

587
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,500
it turns out you're the...

588
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,210
first man to visit our place.

589
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,760
Gosh! What do I do?

590
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,150
I don't know what to do! Gosh.

591
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,140
<i>I feel so shy.</i>

592
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,130
Hey.

593
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm totally fine. What are you doing?

594
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,680
Let go.

595
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,250
I'm okay.

596
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,030
You bought everyone a hangover cure.

597
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,500
Why didn't you get one for yourself?

598
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,820
That's what I'm saying.

599
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,790
Ahjussi, I'll stop by the convenience store.

600
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,490
Okay, okay. See you.

601
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,390
Here, sit.

602
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,380
Geez.

603
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,660
Okay...

604
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,800
Where's the light switch?

605
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,180
Right there. Behind the door.

606
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,300
The light.

607
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,110
Here.

608
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,360
Drink water and sober up.

609
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Come to your senses.

610
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,200
Stop smiling. I don't want to get attached.

611
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,260
No! No.

612
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,400
No, don't get attached to me. No, no.

613
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,650
That'd be hopeless.

614
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,840
Because I don't want people to see my true charm,

615
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,400
I've been hiding it so hard.

616
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,500
So, don't get attached.

617
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay? I made it clear.

618
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,300
I can't be responsible, okay?

619
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,100
Oppa, you know what?

620
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,830
Your eyes...

621
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,940
haven't aged at all?

622
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,200
You're still handsome.

623
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,940
That makes me so happy.

624
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,900
Okay. Drink water and sober up first.

625
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,670
You don't know how it feels, do you?

626
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,510
How it feels...

627
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,100
when you're unsure if you're

628
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:07,410
facing the truth or avoiding it.
That weird feeling.

629
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,980
You're not okay at all,

630
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,370
but you're also okay.

631
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,350
I know it too well.

632
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,000
Bo Hyeon,

633
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,930
Mom has to catch a flight now. Okay?

634
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,030
<i>The feeling when you deceive yourself.</i>

635
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,430
<i>Because you have to hang in there,</i>

636
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,950
you try to appear okay.

637
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,750
- Mom is sleeping.
- Sorry.

638
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,570
It's okay.

639
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,850
Mom.

640
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,570
Wake up, Ms. Lee.

641
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,070
- Get up. Sleep inside.
- Yes, yes.

642
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,600
Yes.

643
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,450
- Yes, that's a good girl.
- Your arm.

644
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,020
Go to bed.

645
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,080
Should I make you some tea?

646
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,850
Here you go.

647
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,690
Is Mom sleeping?

648
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,850
Yes.

649
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,090
Her only strength is falling asleep immediately.

650
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,600
I know.

651
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,200
She should be on a talent show.

652
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,390
Not bad, right?

653
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,010
It's nice.

654
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,330
By the way,

655
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,170
why are you against building the house?

656
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,920
My mom's life keeps changing because of me.

657
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,940
I find it burdensome.

658
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,410
My mom...

659
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,440
never got to live her life.

660
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,290
She always put me first.

661
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,200
But she's making a decision like this again.

662
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,500
It makes me angry, and it upsets me.

663
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,720
At first,

664
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,370
when she told me she'll build a house,

665
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,590
I asked her...

666
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,280
why she wants to.

667
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,800
She said she's trying to live.

668
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,720
To live a fun life with you.

669
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,370
Her reason for building a house must be

670
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,140
the same as why you first came to Cheonghae.

671
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,500
It's the desire to do what you want
to do without further delay.

672
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,820
Go inside.

673
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,200
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

674
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,090
<i>You need to care for yourself if I can't be there.</i>

675
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,940
<i>Tell them right now.</i>

676
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,470
Ex...

677
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,300
Excuse...

678
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,520
I took my time because
I thought you were sleeping.

679
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,230
Your acting skills haven't improved.

680
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,830
Hey, by chance, last night...

681
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,570
Of course, you threw a drunken tantrum.

682
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,630
Mr. Ryu seemed very shocked.

683
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,730
I can't reveal my true self to him yet.

684
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,300
I couldn't control myself because
I hadn't drunk in a while.

685
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,950
Is this my room?

686
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,560
Looks like yours, telling from its size.

687
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,930
Why are they so close? Put them further apart.

688
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,050
Why are you suddenly making a suggestion?

689
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,970
Let's build the house.

690
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,990
And do it right if you're going to.

691
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,100
Are you serious?

692
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,100
Are you on board?

693
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,700
Yes, I'm on board.

694
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,070
Do you need my thumbprint or something?

695
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,010
Eat quickly. Mr. Ryu will be here soon.

696
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,730
Wow, you're an amazing driver.

697
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,710
It feels like I'm riding
a five-star hotel mattress.

698
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,820
What's the point? My customer is
either asleep or drunk.

699
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,060
She's unable to notice my driving skills.

700
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,580
Ahjussi,

701
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,100
can we have a full-sized window
in the living room?

702
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,440
- Full-sized window?
- Yes.

703
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,700
Full-sized window.

704
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,080
Yes, that'd look nice.

705
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,560
But that'd raise the heating cost, no ventilation,

706
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,450
and it provides no privacy.

707
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:46,400
Can we have a screening or
listening room in the basement?

708
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,100
That sounds good.

709
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,300
But the basement gets no fresh air,
and it gets moist.

710
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,950
We'd have to give up on a portion
of the yard space

711
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,970
and it'd cost a lot. It'd be better to add a story.

712
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,730
If you'd do everything the way you like,

713
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,750
don't call it "Hyo Ri's house."

714
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,550
Call it "Ji An's house" instead.

715
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,380
No, call it "Tyrant Lee Ji An's
However-I-want House."

716
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,900
"I'm-the-King. Suppress-your-opinion House."

717
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,230
How does that sound?

718
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,400
I'm being nice, yet you're talking back?

719
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,980
- Talking back? I'm kowtowing cautiously.
- Kow-

720
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,870
Do you know what "kowtow" means?

721
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,200
Do you know what "nice" means?

722
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,500
Gosh, she has to have the last word.

723
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,580
You know I do.

724
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,360
The bottom and the pillars weren't aligned.

725
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,550
We secured it with a belt.

726
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:01,850
Okay.

727
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,280
- Cheol Min.
- What?

728
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,930
- You're doing great.
- Really?

729
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:07,840
- Can I be a chief, too?
- The drain pipe will come out here.

730
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,280
You'll keep the circuit breaker where it is, right?

731
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,160
Yes. Focus on waterproofing the kitchen.

732
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
Okay. I'll have a look.

733
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,940
How big of a flat tie do you need?

734
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,140
We'll have the 350 ones.

735
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,980
Won't you measure with a ruler?

736
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,060
Follow the basic rules.

737
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,620
I know it's annoying, but measuring with a ruler

738
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,810
is important in this job.

739
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,010
How will you train your juniors later?

740
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,580
Okay.

741
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,570
- 400.
- So?

742
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,190
Since we're adding the wedge pins,

743
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,500
we'll get the 400 ones.

744
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,960
I said work is about the attitude, not experience.

745
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,290
If you're sloppy with the basics,

746
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:52,410
you end up looking sloppy
without showing off your strength.

747
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,210
Take a 30-minute break.

748

00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,430
Are you picking a fight on this hot day?

752

Wow, I haven't tasted your cooking in a while.

This is what a proper spread looks like.

Yes. I put extra effort into it.

762

768
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,650
I'm not hungry right now.

769
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,900
Why is the plastering surface so rough?

770
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,080
Eat without me.

771
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,850
I'll eat when I'm hungry later.

01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,230
<i>Why should I tolerate again?</i>

899
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,900
<i>You don't know how I endured all that time.</i>

900
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,190
<i>That's how tiring and hurtful it is.</i>

901
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,360
<i>It's because it's sweet.</i>

902
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,280
<i>I comforted myself watching the stars.</i>

903
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,140
<i>I think those two are each other's first love.</i>

904
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,540
<i>Don't try hard. You don't have to, Ji An.</i>

905
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,700
<i>♫ I'll be your ocean ♫</i>
