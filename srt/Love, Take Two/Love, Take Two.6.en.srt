1
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,670
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,400
I didn't know.

3
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,450
Why are you home?

4
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,050
I came early because I had a really bad headache.

5
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,950
Gosh. Even being sick is a crime in 12th grade.

6
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,090
Taking care of yourself is a skill, too.

7
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,200
Take this.

8
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,270
Why are you sick during the midterm?

9
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,470
Take it and go study.

10
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,990
Hey, I'll cook quickly. Eat first.

11
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,170
I'm too sick of their side dishes.

12
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,940
Being hungry helps me study.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,210
Really? Yes, the midterm is in just a few days.

14
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,880
Study hard. Study hard.

15
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,290
Are you awake?

16
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,790
They'll run a few tests and examine you tomorrow.

17
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,410
So, don't worry and sleep more.

18
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,370
You must've been stunned.

19
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,010
I was scared.

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,460
Me, too.

21
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,650
Let's adjust quickly.

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,270
Yeah.

23
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,550
Regretting doesn't change anything.

24
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,060
Lee Ji An,

25
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,500
get your act together

26
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,210
and do what you can do from now on.

27
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,310
[Episode 6. I choose to begin]

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,790
Don't come. You need to prepare for the opening.

29
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,600
We should reschedule the opening.

30
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,760
<i>Hey,</i>

31
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,090
we're CEOs now.

32
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,400
We can adjust our own schedule now.

33
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,300
Yes, we're CEOs.

34
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,500
Anyway, I'll be caring for Hyo Ri.

35
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,790
You care for the shop.

36
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,040
<i>Call me anytime you need me. You know, right?</i>

37
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,810
Yes.

38
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,860
<i>If you still don't want to run away</i>

39
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,200
<i>and want to endure it,</i>

40
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,600
<i>then, let me know. I'll support you.</i>

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
What? Does she already need me?

42
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,440
What took you so long? Aren't you hungry?

43
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,080
I made noodles.

44
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,850
Surprise.

45
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,600
Have you been well?

46
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,010
It's so delicious.

47
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,680
You still got it, Honey.

48
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
When I was pregnant with you,

49
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,150
I couldn't eat anything because
of really bad morning sickness.

50
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,710
I ate your dad's noodles three times a day then.

51
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,180
They were the only things I could eat.

52
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,570
What brings you to Korea all of a sudden?

53
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,660
I told you we were bidding on
the Cheonghae Cultural Center.

54
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,180
Our company was picked to do it.

55
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,680
With communication issues,

56
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,320
I came as a setting director.

57
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,120
Are you here for a long time?

58
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,270
About two to three months?

59
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,300
There will be a task force team
once things get set up.

60
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,200
Since we're on the topic,

61
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,030
can I stay here for a while?

62
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,400
What?

63
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,750
I wanted to stay with Bo Hyeon since I'm here.

64
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Since you're here?

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,400
You think you could just stop by here anytime?

66
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,220
You should've discussed it with me in advance.

67
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,140
Why would you get so angry?

68
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,410
You're always like this.

69
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,760
[Ryu Jeong Seok]

70
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,700
- What?
<i>- So...</i>

71
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>I called just in case you'd come to see the shop.</i>

72
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,030
- Is she okay?
<i>- Yes, she's okay.</i>

73
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,160
She'll be tested tomorrow

74
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,050
- and the doctor-
<i>- No, I meant you.</i>

75
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,500
What?

76
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
I'm sure you're taking good care of Hyo Ri.

77
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,790
But are you okay?

78
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,070
You must've been shocked.

79
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,990
You're not okay.

80
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm sure you'll manage.

81
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,500
But if it's tough, don't let it show
to her, and call me.

82
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,300
I'll yell at you so you come to your senses.

83
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,750
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

84
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,320
I'm about to ask you to be my sworn brother.

85
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,300
<i>I said I'm not an easy person.</i>

86
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,240
<i>Anyway, let's talk again. Go back in.</i>

87
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,700
Okay.

88
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,010
<i>Should I come meet you there?</i>

89
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,800
<i>Eat when you feel cranky.</i>

90
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,340
<i>Hunger is always the reason.</i>

91
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,400
It's delicious.

92
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,480
I'm going to eat more.

93
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,250
Bo Hyeon,

94
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,520
we're seeing each other in two years.

95
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,300
I was so excited.

96
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,200
I was disappointed that
I couldn't see you last year.

97
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,980
Mom, have you ever thought

98
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,300
what's exciting to you...

99
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,000
could be too sudden and confusing to others?

100
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,260
What?

101
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,190
I see you never have.

102
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,240
[Order or exams]

103
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,290
Gosh.

104
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,260
Ouch.

105
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,150
You embarrass me in various ways.

106
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,860
Who's more embarrassed now? Me.

107
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,140
Act cool. Act cool.

108
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,290
Yes.

109
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,600
I left early.

110
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,370
Really?

111
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,570
It's okay. I'll wait a bit.

112
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,930
You know where we're going, right?
Is this the right way?

113
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,250
No, no. Not this way. Wait.

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Take your time coming out of surgery.

115
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,050
I suddenly have something to do, too.

116
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,020
What's wrong, Hyo Ri?

117
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,740
- Should we sit somewhere?
- Wait...

118
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,420
Sit.

119
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,110
W-What are you doing here?

120
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,030
Did you follow us by chance?

121
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,950
Stop talking silly.

122
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,900
There's a reception desk around the corner.

123
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,960
Show them the info sheet and register now. Hurry.

124
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,020
Excuse me, we can manage ourselves.

125
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,120
You got a big gown.

126
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,780
Aren't you cold?

127
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,500
A little.

128
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,600
You feel better, right?

129
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes, I feel much better.

130
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,830
Wow, it's Monet's Garden at Giverny.

131
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,950
He painted in his garden, too.

132
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,650
Look at those colors.

133
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,100
How do you feel about Mom being here?

134
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,540
Twenty-four is a bit too old to
be enthralled about seeing mom, no?

135
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,730
I'm too old for that

136
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,030
and she came too late.

137
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,000
Also, I'm not a kid.

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,580
You don't have to worry about how I feel.

139
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,470
I can manage myself.

140
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
Yes.

141
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,390
You're right.

142
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,900
I was hired to do landscape at Hyo Ri's shop.

143
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,100
Right. I heard she was hospitalized.

144
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,780
- She suddenly fainted yesterday.
- Why? Is she okay?

145
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,470
I guess they're running tests.

146
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,310
I heard we don't have to worry too much.

147
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,530
Okay.

148
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,550
<i>That's why the ambulance was here yesterday.</i>

149
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,470
I asked the cook.

150
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,670
The girl's apparently sick.

151
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,660
Gosh.

152
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,370
They had their reason.

153
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,510
Gosh. She's young and pretty. Why is she sick?

154
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,400
How upsetting.

155
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,610
By the way,

156
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,590
who's... who's that?

157
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,530
Hello.

158
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,620
Here you go.

159
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,750
- Okay.
- Oh, here.

160
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
Thank you.

161
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,200
You live in Germany, and you're just visiting?

162
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,800
I've always been curious.

163
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,370
Bo Hyeon is so good-looking.

164
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,350
No matter how much I think,

165
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,790
there's no way it's Mr. Ryu. Who is it, then?

166
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,450
That's what I was thinking.

167
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,500
What's wrong with Mr. Ryu?

168
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,980
So, how long will you be in Korea?

169
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,690
About two to three months.

170
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,010
I might stay longer if things go well.

171
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,570
Two to three months is enough
time to build and disassemble

172
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,790
the Great Wall of China three times.

173
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,690
If you spend time together,

174
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,260
you and Mr. Ryu could say,
"Better the devil you know."

175
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,710
You're so random.

176
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,470
Guten tag.

177
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,090
- Did you speak German?
- Ich liebe dich.

178
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,340
Oh, my.

179
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,500
When I used to run a guest house,

180
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,760
I wanted the foreign guests to feel at home.

181
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,170
So, I learned a few sentences in their languages.

182
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,590
Bonjour. Hola.

183
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,720
Assalamu alaikum. Namaste.

184
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Wow, how impressive.

185
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,570
You're not random at all.

186
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,350
You're so knowledgeable that
you could become a doctor.

187
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,700
Isn't a guest house just a bed and breakfast?

188
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,300
- What? Guest-
- What's that?

189
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,380
Huh?

190
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,410
Isn't that Mr. Ryu's car?

191
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,200
Lee Yeo Jeong, seriously.

192
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,810
I'll just floor it.

193
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,490
Why would he speed on a small street like that?

194
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,300
Look at him go.

195
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,770
We can't tolerate behaviors like this.

196
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,800
What are you doing? What are you doing?

197
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,800
Gosh, seriously.

198
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,800
Gosh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

199
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,900
I didn't see your car, Mr. Ryu.

200
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,750
Do you expect me to believe that?

201
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,640
I'm so sad to hear that.

202
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,600
My reputation is better than that.

203
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,460
- Get in.
- Go without me.

204
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,760
I'll chat with the elders more.

205
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,510
Get in, I said.

206
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,000
- I'll go.
- Take care.

207
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,960
He's so petty.

208
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,220
You scared me.

209
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,460
You almost made my heart flutter.

210
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,020
Listen.

211
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,100
This is where Bo Hyeon and I live.

212
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,310
Don't make people start talking about us.

213
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,980
I see. You were worried.

214
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,880
When did you become so sensitive?

215
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,800
Fine. I'll be careful.

216
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Promise. I mean it.

217
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,900
Wait for me.

218
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Ms. Lee, I'll check your blood pressure.

219
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,950
So, what brings you here?

220
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes.

221
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,900
Something suddenly came up. I'll go now.

222
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,880
I love the view in this room.

223
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,300
You get just enough sun.

224
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,800
You probably don't know
how difficult "just enough" is.

225
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,310
It's easy to lack or have too much,

226
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,500
but having just enough is really hard.

227
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,450
I heard.

228
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,320
Is that so?

229
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,180
Someone thankfully alleviated my burden.

230
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,890
Dr. Kim,

231
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,940
I'm very sick.

232
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,800
You must know,

233
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,490
but you're the only one I could trust.

234
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,400
I should ask you to settle some stuff for me.

235
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,500
Right, I also came up with another
favor to ask you today.

236
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,870
Say ah.

237
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,900
- No more. I don't want any more.
- Hey, you didn't even eat.

238
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,330
Why do you keep turning me into a bad person?

239
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,570
If you were born during the
Japanese occupation period,

240
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,100
our country would've become
independent sooner. So vicious.

241
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,780
Where's the mansion lady?

242
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,860
I don't know.

243
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,900
She left all snooty when she got a call.

244
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,070
She seemed to be here for
another reason. What a relief.

245
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,820
I got scared.

246
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,020
The way she talks down to you

247
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,760
says she's done that a lot.

248
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,150
Anyway, I don't like her.

249
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,560
But I feel secure having her around.

250
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,970
I'm sleepy. I'll go to sleep.

251
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,710
That was smooth.

252
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,710
Brush your teeth first.

253
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,100
- Gosh.
- Ms. Lee Hyo Ri?

254
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,770
She was a doctor?

255
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,070
- She was a doctor at our hospital.
- Whoa.

256
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,400
Thankfully, a private room was available.

257
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,680
She's never asked a favor like this.

258
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,200
We never asked for this.

259
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I heard there was a fire
at your shop because of her.

260
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,200
She wants to compensate you in any way she can.

261
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,150
Does she have a family, by chance?

262
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,300
Her husband passed at the end of last year.

263
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,400
They wanted to go on a cruise
after her retirement,

264
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,490
but his condition worsened last year.

265
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,900
He passed away six months before she retired.

266
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,500
How about her children?
She needs her family's help.

267
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,820
She has a daughter, but...

268
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,870
Are you bringing that up again?

269
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,640
I'm not going. I'm not.

270
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,130
Your mom can manage herself.

271
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,840
I eat, sleep, and work just fine without you.

272
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,510
Dr. Jung wants you to call him.

273
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,600
He wants to confirm something regarding

274
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,630
Patient Han, whom you two are treating.

275
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm checking test results.

276
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,120
Tell him we can talk in the office in 20 minutes.

277
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,490
- Got it.
- I'm busy.

278
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,690
I can manage myself, so-

279
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,250
<i>It's because I'm struggling.</i>

280
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,230
<i>I'm struggling.</i>

281
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,340
Is something going on with you?

282
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,290
<i>A family should stay together
when things are hard.</i>

283
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,600
<i>We've been apart for too long, Mom.</i>

284
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,170
<i>Her daughter lived in the US for over 10 years</i>

285
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,860
<i>and Dr. Jung was very busy.</i>

286
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,940
<i>Even after her husband passed,</i>

287
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,500
<i>she probably thought they
could overcome on their own.</i>

288
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,520
<i>She was two months away
from retirement, but she wanted to</i>

289
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,960
<i>leave as soon as her daughter called.</i>

290
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,810
[My daughter]

291
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,130
I'm on the plane now.

292
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,760
<i>Are you related to Catherine Kim?</i>

293
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,820
Yes. I'm her mother.

294
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,120
<i>Catherine was in a serious car accident.</i>

295
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,580
<i>She went through an emergency surgery, but</i>

296
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,820
<i>unfortunately, she didn't make it.</i>

297
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,840
Sorry,

298
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,470
I-I don't understand.

299
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,200
What are you saying?

300
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,270
<i>I'm so sorry, but...</i>

301
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,090
<i>Catherine passed away during surgery.</i>

302
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,800
Ma'am, we're taking off soon.
Please put your phone on airplane mode...

303
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,900
<i>So, after she had a funeral for her daughter,</i>

304
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,810
she must've been in a great shock.

305
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,020
She suddenly started showing

306
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,870
delirium symptoms.

307
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,330
<i>I wasn't a plant in a greenhouse, but a foxtail.</i>

308
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,340
<i>You have to let wild plants grow naturally,</i>

309
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,270
<i>but my mom wanted to raise me well.</i>

310
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,320
<i>But she couldn't afford to put me in a greenhouse.</i>

311
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,040
<i>So, she kept watering the weed on the path.</i>

312
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,900
<i>I was like a sick foxtail
that barely managed to survive.</i>

313
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,280
<i>Right. I heard she was hospitalized.</i>

314
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,590
<i>She suddenly fainted yesterday.</i>

315
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,960
<i>Are you okay?</i>

316
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,130
<i>Are you very sick?</i>

317
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,600
<i>You're thinking about me, aren't you?</i>

318
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,400
<i>I have no reason to think about you otherwise.</i>

319
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:18,930
[You're thinking about me, aren't you?]

320
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,400
<i>Haha. I just said that because
I wanted to make money.</i>

321
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,580
<i>I was thinking about you
because I needed help at the farm.</i>

322
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,520
What...

323
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,560
<i>I'm in Seoul now.</i>

324
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,410
<i>I'm going back late tomorrow.</i>

325
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,750
<i>There's Dong Seok's birthday party tomorrow.</i>

326
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,400
<i>Come if you want.</i>

327
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,840
<i>I'll see.</i>

328
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,340
Thank you, Dr. Jung.

329
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,740
You made time to visit me.

330
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,600
I thought I should at least
see your face before I go.

331
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,880
Come over to my house next time.

332
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll cook you delicious food myself.

333
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,880
You're going home, right? I'll get you a taxi.

334
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,910
Just one second.

335
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
- Oh, it's the ER.
- Go.

336
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,600
You should go and sort things out.

337
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,820
I suppose I have a superpower.

338
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,810
See you next time, Dr. Jung.

339
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,520
I'll go.

340
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,640
That's what she went through?

341
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,600
Yes.

342
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,800
We're being pampered thanks to her, but I feel bad.

343
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm hungry.

344
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,890
I want a cup ramen.

345
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,650
No, it's bad for you.

346
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,110
Emotional comfort is most important for patients.

347
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,540
A little pick-me-up isn't bad.

348
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,370
I prioritize physical health over

349
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,890
emotional health as a caretaker. You can't.

350
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,140
You never let me win. Whatever. I don't want it.

351
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,870
I don't want it anymore.

352
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,130
Right, I forgot to buy a sausage.

353
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,810
That's enough. Sausages are bad for you.

354
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,350
You're no fun.

355
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,840
Eun Ju,

356
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,440
where were you?

357
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,160
There are too many people.

358
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,700
They're so scary.

359
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,490
Don't worry. You found me.

360
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,840
No matter how many people there are,

361
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,000
you don't have to fear if you know just one person.

362
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,850
You have me.

363
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,840
My daughter's here, too.

364
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,770
Come with us.

365
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,540
Come with us, okay?

366
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,730
I made a mistake again, didn't I?

367
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,860
I didn't know you were a doctor.

368
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,400
I thought you were a caretaker here
since you know the hospital well.

369
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Hey, caretakers are so warmhearted and kind.

370
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,740
Not everyone can do it. You have to be a saint.

371
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,400
Right?

372
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,200
How greasy.

373
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,470
I can't eat cup ramen without kimchi.

374
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,970
I'll have to eat it, then.

375
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,650
You give up faster than I thought.

376
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,010
There's a convenience store nearby.

377
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,110
I'm not that shameless.

378
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,260
I'll buy kimchi.

379
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,390
Get me the stir-fried kimchi.

380
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,480
I'll have a sausage, then.

381
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,800
Do you like sausages? Me, too.

382
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,950
I'll have one, too.

383
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,060
Get me one with cheese and chili.

384
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,900
Make it two.

385
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,090
What time is the appointment today?

386
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,090
Your doctor happens to be someone I know.

387
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,880
Why are you feeding the cat so sadly?

388
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,130
He'd have indigestion.

389
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,640
Here.

390
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,000
Come on in.

391
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,840
Gosh. I came comfortably, thanks to you.

392
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,530
I was worried because it was so heavy.

393
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,140
Are you opening this week?

394
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,810
No.

395
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,360
We can't because of a situation.

396
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,720
I see.

397
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,920
She must be worried.

398
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,150
Yes.

399
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,100
Hyo Ri's mom is going through a lot right now.

400
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,300
I know you're just as upset and sad as she is.

401
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,370
Don't worry. Hyo Ri looks sweet,

402
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,640
but she's tenacious.

403
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,000
I think she resembles you and
her mom half and half.

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,160
And feel free to let me know
if you need help at the shop.

405
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,580
- Really?
- Yes.

406
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
I saw rice in the yard. Should I move them for you?

407
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,280
I'd appreciate it.

408
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,600
He makes it impossible for me to like him.

409
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,720
Right.

410
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,220
Whenever Ji An is away to go to the hospital,

411
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,860
she must feel bad.

412
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,900
We'll have a simple job qualification test

413
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,160
for an official part-time recruitment.

414
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,030
I'm confident.

415
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,500
Please tell salt and sugar apart.

416
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,530
Salt...

417
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
S-Salt... is this...

418
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,170
This is su...

419
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,600
Su...

420
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,100
Salt.

421
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,120
Sugar.

422
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,470
Okay. Supertaster!

423
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,620
- Gosh.
- Wow.

424
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,610
Two medium bossam, one makgeolli,
and one steamed eggs.

425
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,570
How much is the total, then?

426
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,000
Two medium bossam.
It's 42,000 won each. It's 82... 83... 84,000.

427
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,600
Makgeolli is 4,000 won.

428
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,700
92,000... 92...

429
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,500
Hold on. Gosh. It's confusing.

430
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,770
90,000... Now add...

431
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,230
The steamed eggs. They're 7,000 won.

432
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,010
Gosh.

433
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,270
That was a trick question.

434
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,970
Steamed eggs are...

435
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,700
complimentary. Yes.

436
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,700
Genius.

437
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,280
<i>He's hopeless, but I have no choice.</i>

438
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,830
Okay. Business is all about strength.

439
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,400
Okay. Start tomorrow.

440
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,570
Work part-time for a month.

441
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,930
You'll go full-time if we're a good fit.

442
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,000
Let's make this work.

443
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,830
I think you're the perfect fit.

444
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,700
- Me?
- Yes.

445
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,700
- It's hard to be in sync like this.
- Thank you.

446
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,280
- I'll work hard.
- Okay.

447
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,370
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

448
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,120
Thank you!

449
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,960
A hug, too? Nice.

450
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,120
I wanted to become a chef when I was a kid.

451
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,420
- Really?
- I lied!

452
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,900
Ms. Lee, come inside.

453
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,210
- Get started.
- Okay.

454
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,500
This is the most recent scan.

455
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,960
And...

456
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,470
this is the previous scan.

457
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,020
It's hard to tell the difference on screen.

458
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,130
You need to remove it through surgery.

459
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,660
Why are you delaying it so much?

460
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,860
I have too many scheduled surgeries.

461
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,310
I scheduled it as quickly as possible,

462
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,510
but it's taking time.

463
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,830
The location isn't terrible.

464
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,040
No.

465
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,640
When an illness is showing its presence like this,

466
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,100
it's asking you to pay closer attention.

467
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,270
You just need to watch it more closely.

468
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,730
I'll try to schedule the surgery sooner,

469
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,650
but I need to care for other patients, too.

470
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,540
I have no other comments regarding the tests.

471
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,540
I'll change the prescription slightly.

472
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,700
Dr. Lee is kind, talented,
professional, and diligent.

473
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,380
He's a perfect doctor.

474
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,860
You can trust him and wait.

475
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,000
I can't believe I'm being complimented by you.

476
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,000
Mom, this must be how it feels
to have connections.

477
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,990
To be honest, I love it.

478
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I hate to admit it, but I love it, too.

479
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,400
<i>You prepared so much.</i>

480
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,040
Thank you for today.

481
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,170
How are you getting back to your lodging?

482
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,770
Someone's picking me up...

483
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,600
- Honey.
- Oh, do you know him?

484
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,070
- He's my ex-husband.
- Pardon?

485
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,400
Seeing him again in a while gets my heart racing.

486
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,970
- I see.
- Bye.

487
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,960
Honey!

488
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,900
Do I need to get divorced to get
my heart to race for my husband?

489
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,220
I'm so tired.

490
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,700
I'm still jet-lagged, and I must've
scheduled things too tightly.

491
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,000
But it turns out I present better when I'm drowsy.

492
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,320
Take a taxi next time.

493
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
By the way, are you seeing someone?

494
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,200
You aren't. I knew it.

495
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,880
Hurry up.

496
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,180
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

497
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,070
I'll get you discharged.

498
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,200
- I already did it.
- Pardon?

499
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,430
I'll pay up to this point.

500
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,390
I inconvenienced you many times.

501
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,700
I can't guarantee I won't do it again, either.

502
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,900
Gosh. You shouldn't have.

503
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,960
I'm sure you noticed it,

504
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,530
but I'm not like Sim Cheong.*
(Korean folktale character)

505
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,600
I don't get pushed around.

506
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,000
Why Sim Cheong?

507
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's a reference that suits her age.

508
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,300
I witnessed my mom being mean to you many times.

509
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,100
So, no need to feel bad.

510
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,200
Anyway, thank you so much.

511
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,380
Yes. I guess I feel the same.

512
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,140
I'll check if your prescription is ready.

513
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,330
Well...

514
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,200
my mom no longer has a mom.

515
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,270
But while staying at the hospital since yesterday,

516
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,760
it felt like she has a mom now.

517
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,050
I selfishly felt good about it.

518
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,170
Thank you.

519
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,190
You're sweet.

520
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,890
We just need to pick up the medicine.

521
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,700
Let's drive together. I'm going back, too.

522
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,120
Huh? Are you driving?

523
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,810
No. Give me the key.

524
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,610
It's dangerous to drive. Give it to me.

525
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,910
I'm not that...

526
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,730
Follow the directions exactly.

527
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,980
Don't exceed the speed limit.

528
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,450
Okay.

529
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,220
Don't worry and get some sleep.

530
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,770
I have never had an accident in 20 years.

531
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,620
She owned a car for five years.

532
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,930
But since it was a used car, it kept failing.

533
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,210
She probably only drove for less than two years.

534
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,370
You slept the entire time coming here.

535
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,000
You won't be able to sleep tonight.

536
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,870
Like I said, I only had my eyes closed.

537
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:56,290
Your mouth, too? Did you just keep it open?

538
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,870
Thank you for everything.

539
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,600
Don't mention it.

540
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,300
Rest well and make sure to take your medicine.

541
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,200
Okay.

542
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,840
Well...

543
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,180
What? Are you not done making fun of me?

544
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,500
I thoroughly enjoyed having you
pull some strings for us.

545
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,270
Thank you.

546
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,700
Wow, how did you clean up so much in a few days?

547
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,750
Hey, we have an employee.

548
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,700
I needed someone to fill in while you were gone.

549
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,150
I did everything with our future employee.

550
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:46,720
Who? Is it someone I know?

551
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,310
You probably made the right decision-

552
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,760
Say it isn't so.

553
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,010
Say it isn't so, please.

554
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,100
- There he is.
- Hello.

555
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,950
Right. Is Hyo Ri okay?

556
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,680
- Yes. She's okay.
- What a relief.

557
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,250
What's all that?

558
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,100
This is...

559
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,960
my gift to celebrate us becoming a family.

560
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,050
- Family?
- Family.

561
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,550
Family...

562
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,790
We're just an employer and an employee.

563
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:25,390
I want us to have a professional boundary.

564
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,400
- Yes, that's good.
- I see.

565
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,900
Actually, I made this as a surprise gift
while you were building the house.

566
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,850
Think of it as a gift from a neighbor, then.

567
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,080
Ta-da.

568
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,960
Ta-da.

569
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,300
Wow. I'm impressed.

570
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,870
When you open a business in the countryside,

571
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,300
you need to give away opening gifts.

572
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,530
Thank you so much. But how do we give this out?

573
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,800
Just trust me.

574
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,300
Really?

575
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,400
Really? I will.

576
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,020
You're so trustworthy.

577
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,630
Auntie.

578
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,410
Gosh, is this Ms. Lee Hyo Ri?

579
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,050
- You look so pretty.
- Really?

580
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,260
Hyo Ri, were you always this beautiful?

581
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,000
I'll stop by a friend's birthday party.

582
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,700
- I might be late.
- Hey, you aren't feeling well. Why...

583
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,300
Have fun. YOLO.

584
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
- YOLO?
- You only live once.

585
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,690
I'll be right back.

586
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,670
- Bye.
- YOLO.

587
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,000
Hyo Ri is YOLOing.

588
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,740
- Jae Dong.
- You made it.

589
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,150
- Hi. Hi.
- You came.

590
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,660
Have a seat. Have a seat.

591
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,200
- You know how to party.
- It's tasty.

592
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,300
- Congrats.
- What's this?

593
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,700
Dong Seok doesn't like receiving gifts.

594
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,100
You shouldn't have brought one.

595
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:54,330
This is what sets med students apart.

596
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,950
She's not like the bad students like you

597
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,740
who only brings his mouth to a birthday party.

598
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,000
I didn't just bring my mouth.
To let you treat me properly,

599
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,000
I starved as if I were having an endoscopy.

600
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,780
Be quiet. I'll try this on.

601
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,910
What do you think?

602
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,330
- Does it suit me?
- It does. It does.

603
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,270
- What do you think? Do I look okay?
- It fits you well, too.

604
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,900
Give me.

605
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,000
- Where's Bo Hyeon?
- He went that way.

606
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,120
Let's eat.

607
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,930
Gosh, hello.

608
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,600
Well, she said you were home.

609
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,430
You helped them so much in Seoul.

610
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,470
She wanted to have a meal with you,
but was acting shy.

611
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:55,770
So, I brought her with me.

612
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,440
Why don't you turn the lights on? It's dark.

613
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,260
It's my preference.

614
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,910
Oh, preference.

615
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,470
Come with us. She made tasty bossam to feed Hyo Ri.

616
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,540
Thank you, but I want to be alone.

617
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,360
I'm not hungry, either.

618
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,700
Yes. Then, that's too bad.

619
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,440
Here.

620
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,020
- Wait.
- Come with us.

621
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,860
I-I said I don't want to.

622
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,100
I'm not hungry.

623
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,500
I mean, I don't want bossam.

624
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,800
You're walking ahead of us right now, ma'am.

625
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,540
Let's just go since you're out.

626
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,550
Let's go. Let's go.

627
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,470
- You walk fast.
- Let's go.

628
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,350
Gosh, hello.

629
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,940
We'll wait inside. Let's go.

630
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,600
I stopped by to see Hyo Ri.

631
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,320
She left to see her friends.

632
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,120
Oh, for Dong Seok's birthday?

633
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,640
What about her?

634
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,230
Well, it's a long story. I'll tell you later.

635
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,160
Did something happen at the hospital? Your face...

636
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,860
Huh? What? What?

637
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Why did you come back looking uglier?

638
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,360
All of your features got uglier.

639
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,590
What are you saying?

640
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,900
I was the prettiest guardian at the hospital.

641
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,280
It must've been pretty empty.

642
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,140
There were over 1,000 people, okay?

643
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,320
Is someone in there?

644
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,200
Gosh, it's another long story. I'll tell you later.

645
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,400
Anyway, please let Hyo Ri know that
I was here to see her.

646
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,180
Tell her I was very worried.

647
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,200
Shouldn't you have brought something
to eat to tell me that?

648
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,100
- What?
- I was talking to myself.

649
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,750
Did you hear it?

650
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,810
Your hearing is so good. Seriously.

651
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,440
You must be extremely well
since you're goofing around.

652
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,290
I shouldn't have worried.

653
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,560
Anyway, you...

654
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,430
went through a lot.

655
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,010
Not at all.

656
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,230
I'll see you later.

657
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,030
- Okay.
- Rest well.

658
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,270
Hyo Ri must be eating there, right?

659
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,910
It's a birthday party. It'd be
criminal not to have food.

660
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,980
By the way,

661
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,200
she's eating a lot when she said
she wanted to be alone, right?

662
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,500
She wasn't even hungry.

663
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,700
When someone shows effort,

664
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,100
I try to reciprocate it appropriately.

665
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,130
She's like the grateful magpie.

666
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,100
- You're like the grateful magpie.
- Ji An...

667
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,900
Hey, did you see the woman in the car?

668
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,350
- Is she Bo Hyeon's mom?
- Bo Hyeon's mom?

669
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,000
Yes. The village leader said she lives in Germany,

670
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,690
but she's visiting Korea for business.

671
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,070
She apparently looks like Zendaya.

672
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,930
He said she looks exactly like her up close.

673
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,910
Who's Zendaya?

674
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,960
I wouldn't know.

675
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,590
When will you wisen up? At 60? 61?

676
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,720
Don't pick a fight with me.

677
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,540
I took a glance. I didn't care for her looks.

678
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,110
Right?

679
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,520
Would you like me to cut you more pork?

680
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,990
You're like Mondrian.

681
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,000
You're as simple as a Mondrian painting.

682
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,800
I know Mondrian.

683
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,580
His work is simple. With lines like this.
Don't you know?

684
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,330
Your head looks Mondrian, too.

685
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,810
Eat more bossam.

686
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,310
Why not me?

687
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,730
Why don't you like me?

688
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,090
We're friends. Very much so.

689
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,700
I won't say sorry, So Yeon.

690
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,850
Is it because of her?

691
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,260
Lee Hyo Ri?

692
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,800
Do you like her, by chance?

693
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,110
Is it because of her?

694
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,330
Hyo Ri is very sick.

695
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,800
Because she's very sick,

696
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:54,390
I hope you continue to be nice to her.

697
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,540
Hey.

698
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,150
Hey, if you're being nice to her for that reason,

699
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,950
it makes you a bad person.

700
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,340
You're being cruel to her.

701
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,930
Huh?

702
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,360
I think it will rain.

703
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,780
Rain?

704
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,940
- Let me do it.
- No, I'll do it.

705
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,100
- No, I want to.
- No, I...

706
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:52,900
Gosh.

707
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,120
It's okay. I put ointment on it.

708
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,800
My gosh.

709
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,130
<i>I got injured here, daughter.</i>

710
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,800
<i>How am I your daughter?</i>

711
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,190
Have a seat.

712
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,370
Hang in there.

713
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,100
<i>You're wet now.</i>

714
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,350
<i>You can cross daringly without being afraid now.</i>

715
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,060
<i>The worst that could happen is
your feet getting a bit wetter.</i>

716
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,770
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

717
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,700
<i>Yes, Hyo Ri.</i>

718
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,310
Should I give up or forge ahead?

719
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,910
What? What are you talking about?

720
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,880
Is something going on?

721
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,190
<i>No, so answer quickly.</i>

722
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,100
Should I give up or forge ahead for what I want?

723
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,600
Lee Hyo Ri, listen carefully.

724
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,700
Our family motto is, "Forge ahead, no matter what."

725
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,490
Don't be afraid and forge ahead,
whether you fail or not.

726
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,520
I see.

727
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,870
I didn't know.

728
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,650
Got it.

729
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,700
Where did Hyo Ri go? She always
disappears when there's work to do.

730
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,440
Put on raincoats. Hyo Ri came. Did you see her?

731
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,200
She gave me a T-shirt for my birthday.

732
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,700
- She came?
- Didn't you see her?

733
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,360
She asked where you were.

734
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,600
Geez.

735
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,100

Listen carefully.

Right foot at one.

744
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,240
Left foot at two.

745
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,900
Okay?

746
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,810
Right foot at one. Left foot at two.

747
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,910
Let's go.

748
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,240
One, two. One, two. One, two.

- Hey.

752
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,530
Hold on.

753
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,180
Here.

754
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,510
Dry yourself, too. You're wet, too.

755
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,100
You first.

756
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,290
<i>I know all of my new beginnings</i>

757
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,790

759
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,800
<i>I still want to give it a try.</i>

760
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:52,300
<i>So, I choose to begin.</i>

761
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,730
After I got sick,

762
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:03,450
my decisions became complicated.

763
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,960
I wonder if you pity me or are thoughtful

764
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,010
or just empathize or have pure affection.
My emotions...

765
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,410
are all tangled up,

766
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:23,200
but regardless, what's clear is...

767
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,220
that you make my heart flutter

768
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,930
and I like feeling that way.

769
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:37,330
I think I like you.

<i>Yesterday, from the US...</i>

<i>Don't leave it when it hurts.</i>

786
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,190
<i>It'd hurt less if you care for it.</i>

<i>Seon Yeong, we need to find Dr. Jung now.</i>
