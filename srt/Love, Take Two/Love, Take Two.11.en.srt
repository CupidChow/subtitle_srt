00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,770
It's so great, but...

I guess I still can't believe it.

It's scary.

It's a relief,

but it makes you worry, and you're scared, too.

8
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,620
It's natural to feel that way.

9
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,020
But look.

10
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,120
Hyo Ri has such a dependable mom,

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,750
and there's Chef Kim, who's always on her side.

12
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,800
And she has her friends.

13
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,110
She'll hang in there.

14
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,670
Yes.

Right.

I think it's your turn to lean on me, Ji An.

18
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,050
I'll be by your side.

19
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,860
Let's make sure to protect Hyo Ri.

20
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,830
You just need to keep doing
what you've been doing.

21

You've been doing a good job
without the need to do more.

So, I know it's hard to hear this,

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
but there are some things
you should know before the surgery.

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,960
You'll hear it with Hyo Ri
once you get to the hospital.

25
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,450
I thought it'd be better if you knew in advance.

26
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,890
<i>In Hyo Ri's case, she'll be having awake surgery.</i>

27
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,720
So, the surgery process might be harder for her.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,190
Nerve damage, seizures,

29

<i>Be aware that dangerous things
like those could occur.</i>

<i>The location of the tumor</i>

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,360
is near the part that's
in charge of language function.

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
After the surgery,

34
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,900
she might end up having language
disability as a side effect.

You really know how to play this?
This is a very old game.

70
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,700
While my friends studied English
and Math, I studied this game.

71
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,540
Whenever my mom was stressed at work,

72
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,220
she brought me to the arcade to play this.

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,990

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,420
I guess, a little?

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,350
It's because she's never been in a relationship.

151
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,580
She adopted me when she was 23.

152
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,850
She skipped over to be a mom even
before she had a chance to date.

153

But thanks to you, she looks so happy these days.

it'd be "fighting."

She might look dogged,

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,400
but she's straightforward, soft-hearted,

160
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,710
and she can't be calculative.

161
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,900
She has just endured things
with child-like sincerity.

it aches right here.

165

<i>That means she feels for her.</i>

166
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,980
But when I think of Mom, it also feels...

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,950
We finished a bit late today.

183
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,650
I was just with Hyo Ri.

184
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,320
I won't cry.

185
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,680
You don't have to cry. But it's okay if you do.

186
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,300
Say anything you want.

187
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,870
And you don't have to say anything.

188
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,410
Just do whatever you want to do.

189
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,340
You can do that with me.

190
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,470
I swear I won't cry.

191
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,340
You woke up when I was sleeping.

192
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,510
I don't know why we're doing this so early.

193
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,730
The doctor told you to work out.

194
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,510
Walking barefoot like this
makes me feel energized.

195
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,150
Doesn't it already make you feel healthy?

196
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,830
You know how to influence people.

197
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,350
Dr. Jung.

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,200
I feel so reassured having you
by Hyo Ri and Ji An's side.

199
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,140
So, I won't worry about Hyo Ri and feel anxious.

200
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,630
I just hope it goes the way it should.

201
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,330
When does Tae Oh come back to work?

202
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,160
I told him to enjoy his time with his mom fully.

203
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,480
Good job.

204
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
You're so generous, Chef Kim.

205
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,750
Did you just compliment me, Dr. Jung?

206
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,770
Seeing that side of you when I had no expectation

207
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,010
moves me a lot more.

208
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,270
You aren't just generous.

209
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,130
You're very thoughtful.

210
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,170
I'm not that great.

211
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,710
It'd be nice if you were
a little better at reading the air.

212
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,870
When I was in school, kids said
I had an eye on the back of my head.

213
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,600
Because I was so quick, they said
I had an eye on the back of my head.

214
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,710
That's what they used to say. You know?

215
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,210
Really?

216
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,310
Let's just say it's true.

217
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,770
She offends subtly.

218
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,940
It's strangely offensive.

219
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,230
But I lose if I get offended now.

220
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm not offended.

221
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,030
I don't get affected so easily.

222
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,270
- You came.
<i>- Hey.</i>

223
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,180
Let's lend our hands at Hyo Ri's shop.

224
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,120
We can each pick a day.

225
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,130
And don't ask Hyo Ri detailed
questions about the surgery.

226
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,900
I'll do research. Ask me instead.

227
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,540
She must be anxious already.

228
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,260
How about you? Won't you do anything?

229
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll take care of her mental state.

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,400
I'll tell her not to cry and get her act together.

231
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,350
Did you do military training secretly?
She's like a military senior.

232
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,150
Leave her alone, you bastard.

233
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,910
- What did I do?
- Shit.

234
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,960
It breaks my heart.

235
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,100
She's tough, but she's delicate.

236
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,730
She may sound tough, but she gets easily scared.

237
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,460
She's fragile. What do we do?

238
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,340
She probably can't show her struggles.

239
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,190
That makes me even sadder.

240
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,570
It's okay.

241
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,780
She'll be okay.

242
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,500
So, cry all you want here,
and don't cry in front of her.

243
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,000
Why does he look so skinny already?

<i>Bo Hyeon.</i>

247
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,850
I'll be driving Hyo Ri to the hospital tomorrow.

248
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,900
Have you seen her?

249
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,270
We'll meet briefly later.

250
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,400
How do you feel?

251
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,560
Complicated.

252
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,530
I'm thinking about what I can do.

253
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,100
You share the same worry as I do.

254
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,490
I've heard sincerity is powerful.

255
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,280
Let's ask ourselves how we really feel.

256
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,050
When will it stop raining?

257
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,180
It'll stop soon.

258
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,960
<i>We aren't open yet.</i>

259
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,280
Huh? Tae Oh.

260
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,330
I know.

261
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,010
You missed me a lot since I've been gone, right?

262
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,470
You're right.

263
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,280
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

264
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,710
Gosh, the crown daisy will flower soon.

265
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,860

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,660
Gosh. Why are you back so early, Tae Oh?

267
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,920
I told you to rest more.

268
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,490
You look happy because you've
spent time with your mom.

269
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,900
What? What?

270
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,510
Huh?

271
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,680
Why? Did something happen?

272
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,710
Thank you.

273
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,310
Gosh, yes. You did a good thing.

274
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,950
Isn't this great? Good job. Good job.

275
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,070
Where did she go?

276
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,510
You really did a good thing.

278
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,490
- Yes, ma'am.
- At ease.

279
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,040
- Take this.
- Yes, ma'am.

280
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,670
- Wash it.
- I will wash it.

281
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,340
Okay.

282
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,100
- Where are you going, Hyo Ri?
- To Bo Hyeon's.

283
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,240
Bo Hyeon said I need to face my enemy.

284
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,790
Your enemy?

285
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,480
I'll be right back.

286
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,260
What are you doing?

287
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,980
Are you here to see me?

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,550

Take care of your skin, no matter what happens.

290
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,210
I packed the basic and advanced care stuff.

291

Having this bag at the hospital

292
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,830
would give you full coverage.

293
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,230
Here.

294
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,630
Do you like me?

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,280
Don't be so sour.

296
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,700
To go surfing in Hawaii, we've
been saving up for three years.

297
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,720
It's a kitty party just for us, bonded by blood,

298
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,850
but I decided to let you join.

299
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,740
I'll send the bank account number.

300

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,920
- Okay.
- Promise.

304
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,390
Promise.

305
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,350
You know, right?

306
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,510
I don't have many friends.

307
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,830
Come back soon because I'll get bored.

308
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
Okay.

309
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,800

00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,700

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,740
Wait for me. Wait for me.

312
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,850
Where are you going?

313
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,070
- To see my boyfriend.
- Gosh, so annoying.

314
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,800
- Give me your hand.
- Are you crazy?

315
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,180
- Come.
- It hurts.

316
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,050
Gosh.

317
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,510
Do I have to know so much
about my mom's dating life?

318
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,310
I know. They're like loose children.

319
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,740
I keep worrying about them.

320
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,660
- Done.
- Huh? Okay.

321
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,930
Wait just a second.

322
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,150
Done.

323
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,860
Okay.

324
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,730
- Bo Hyeon.
- Yes.

325
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,330
Let's do a little better.

326
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
It's harder than I thought.

327
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,380
I don't know if this is any consolation,

328
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,030
but I taste a bit more salt this time.

329
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,260
But when your boyfriend cooks for you,

330
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,700
shouldn't you say, "I like my food blend"
or something like that?

331
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,810
I don't want to lie to you about anything.

332
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,800
Since we're on the topic...

333
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,900
The surgery worries and scares me.

334
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,230
After I get the surgery,

335
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll be confronting the fact that
I'm sick every day.

336
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,630
Would I be able to handle that?

337
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,730
How about my mom?

338
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,150
How about you?

339
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,690
Would everyone around me be able to handle it?

340
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,490
It's an unknown world to me.

341
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,320
It scares me so much that it makes me tear up.

342
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,570
I want to cry a lot,

343
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,260
but I'm holding it in
because I shouldn't cry already.

344
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,440
I'll be crying a lot more from now on.

345
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
Crying already would tire me out.

346
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,280
Hyo Ri,

347
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,740
to be honest,

348
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,670
my biggest fear now is that...

349
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,500
my clumsy words of comfort or rash
encouragement might burden you.

350
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,700
That's my biggest fear.

351
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,270
It's hard for me to assess how you feel. So...

352
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,150
To be honest, I'm not sure what I should say.

353
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,570
- It's okay.
- But...

354
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,060
I know one thing for sure.

355
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,140
I love you the most in this world after Ahjumma.

356
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,200
After the surgery,

357
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,680
if you're scared because
your world changed, talk to me.

358
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,290
And only look at me.

359

00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,500
Seon Yeong.

540
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,560
<i>Yes.</i>

541
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,820
Did you know?

542
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,550
Love is visible.

543
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,620
<i>Right. Here.</i>

544
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,790
<i>Eat.</i>

545
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,930
Love was something you could see.

546
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,840
<i>What are you saying?</i>

547
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,400
Hey, I saw the devil
while you were seeing love today.

548
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,160
<i>What will you do about the Village Leader?</i>

549
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,910
<i>She would've been a slave hunter
if she were born in the Joseon era.</i>

550
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,670
<i>Jang Hyuk* is nothing compared to her.</i>
(Actor, referring to his drama)

551
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,550
<i>What do I do?</i>

552
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,150
<i>What do I do, Ji An?</i>

553
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,340
<i>I'm so lonely and exhausted. I'm hungry, too.</i>

554
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,800
Aigoo, aigoo. I'm sorry.

555
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,610
[Seoul Yushim Hospital]

556
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,350
The test results looked good.

557
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,030
We'll proceed with the surgery as planned.

558
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:57,520
The tumor is in the frontal lobe,
which is called Broca's area.

559
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,000
It's in charge of language function.

560
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,170
The size is about 3 cm.

561
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,560
As I said, it will be an awake operation.

562
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,970
The duration will be about six hours.

563
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,350
Can you remove the entire tumor?

564
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,920
We need to have a look...

565
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,030
We need to have a look at it first to find out.

566
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,500
Since it's near the language function area,

567
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,040
we're doing an awake operation.

568
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,160
But we won't remove it forcibly.

569
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,970
If we can't remove the entire tumor,

570
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,580
we'll treat it in another way while monitoring it.

571
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Don't worry.

572
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,670
We'll do a mock test before the surgery to

573
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,100
get familiar with the flow
of the procedure. Don't worry.

574
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,600
I heard you were in medical school.

575
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,670
Yes.

576
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,430
You must know how I feel, then.

577
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,850
I'll make sure to do my best.

578
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,200
Let's trust each other and calmly work together.

579
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,520
Okay.

580
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,760
There are some complications

581
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,080
you should be aware of after the operation.

582
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,690
During the operation, there could be complications

583
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,720
such as bleeding, seizure, and cerebral edema.

584
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,240
After the operation,

585
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,500
there could be a language
disability, mental deterioration...

586
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,000
Hello.

587
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,660
Hey, Sook.

588
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,210
Hello.

589
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,020
Hello, Dr. Jung.

590
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,680
Long time no see.

591
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,730
I'll make sure to cheer Hyo Ri up.

592
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,880
I'll hurry back.

593
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,140
Take your time. There isn't much going on today.

594
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,990
Sook.

595
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,490
Hey, why do you look so good in the gown?

596
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,770
I know. Why do I make everything look hip?

597
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,700
Do you have another one?
I think I would look good, too.

598
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,120
What's that?

599
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,100
When you have too much on your mind,

600
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,890
Sakuragi Hanamichi is the best.

601
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,300
This would be perfect for the next three days.

602
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,140
Time to meet Rukawa again.

603
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,410
It's a problem that the kids
these days don't read books.

604
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,850
Comic books or webtoons are nice,

605
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,470
but read something serious to improve
reading comprehension skills.

606
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,080
I was just talking to myself. Don't mind me.

607
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,630
Okay.

608
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,310

612
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,770
It's okay.

613
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,630
Again?

614
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,320
Your father did it again?

615
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,450
It's okay.

616
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,550
I have you. So, it's okay.

617

<i>We just felt bad for each other.</i>

618
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,050
<i>We planned to start a hair salon in Seoul.</i>

619
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,640
<i>So, we attended a beauty school.</i>

620
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,810
<i>But she unexpectedly got pregnant with Hyo Ri.</i>

621
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,450
<i>The baby's father was a hopeless kid.</i>

622
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,080
<i>It was obvious what would happen
if her family found out.</i>

623
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,170
<i>So, we ran away to Seoul and had Hyo Ri.</i>

624
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,370
<i>Lee Hyo Ri was the biggest star then.</i>

625
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,900
<i>I wanted our baby to be as cool as her.</i>

626
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,320
<i>That's why we named her Hyo Ri.</i>

627
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,750
<i>That's how childish we were.</i>

[Han Cho Rong]

629
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,720
You're making me feel bad.

630
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,260
Why are you smiling so beautifully?

631
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,170
It's been too long, hasn't it?

632
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,720
I just couldn't muster up the courage to see you.

633
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,490

634
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:26,910
Hey.

Huh?

636
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,650
Okay.

637
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,040
Here.

638
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,090
I'll raise Hyo Ri like a princess.

639
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:59,080
Yes. Let's not raise her like
our parents raised us.

640
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,570
Ji An,

641
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,510
I won't...

642
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,400
even think about raising her differently
than my parents did or things like that.

643
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,600
I'll make sure my Hyo Ri never
finds out how I was raised.

644
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,820
I'll only give her good things.

645
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,290
I'll only make her happy.

646
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,360
I'm serious.

647
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,760
Let's do that.

648
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,740
For sure.

649
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,560
Let's make sure to do that.

650
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,210
Cho Rong,

651
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,670
I don't think I was able to.

652
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:07,810
I wanted to...

653
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:13,240
but I don't think I raised her that way.

654
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,540
I didn't want to.

655
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,390
But since I'm not a good mom,

656
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,020
I knew nothing.

657
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,880
Hyo Ri was sick, but I had no idea.

658
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,280
I was too ashamed to come and visit you.

659
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,970
Sorry.

660
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,950
I'm sorry, Cho Rong.

661
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,000
But please protect Hyo Ri.

662
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,350
I keep thinking about it,

663
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,230
but you're the only person I could ask.

664
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,850
Cho Rong, please protect...

665
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,910
Please protect our Hyo Ri. Please...

666

All right. Here they are. Enjoy.

You're the best. Welcome.

672

- Welcome.
- Have a seat over there.

675
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,900
Yes. Yes, I heard. Sorry.

676
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,860
Are you okay?

677
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,890
Yes. Ever since Village Leader Go came,

678
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,630
we're getting so many customers. It's hard.

679
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,080
Hyo Ri will be okay.

680
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,970
Yes.

681
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:34,760
Saying, "You must be tired," would be normal.

682
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,680
But I want to ask, "Do you even feel tired?"

683
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,260
Back in my day, I ran a baekban* place briefly.
(Home-made style meal)

684
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,430
My gosh, because I was reminded of those days,

685
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,240
my old spirit kicked in.

686
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,960
No wonder.

687
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:59,260
Anyway, I'm tired. But I feel so secure
because you're here.

688
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,350
- Really?
- Yes.

689
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,300
Your body is here, but your heart is in Seoul.

690
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,970
Our Hyo Ri is incredibly strong.

691
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,690
And she even went to medical school.

692
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:35,360
I'm sure she knows a lot more than we do.

693
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,330
Why should I worry?

694
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,300
I should be trusting and supporting
her now, and that wouldn't be enough.

695
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,540
You know how people tell me,

696
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,900
"Ms. Go, you're so strong."

697
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,690
That I look so easygoing and magnanimous.

698
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:55,760
People say that often to me.

699
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,180
But in here.

700
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,400
Right in here. A fragile girl is living here.

701
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,290
I could tell you're...

702
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,180
similar to me.

703
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,010
You don't easily say you're struggling, right?

704
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,860
But Chef Kim,

705
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,580
don't live like that.

706
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,030
Pardon?

707
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,320
Stop crying inside.

708
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,770
Just cry openly.

709
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:36,730
That way, someone would
hold your hand and hug you.

710
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,620
It might not be much,

711
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,470
but you can hear some words of comfort, you know?

712
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,610
Isn't that what affection is?

713
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:52,180
Isn't that why we're all living together
like this and nagging each other?

714
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,740
Right?

715
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,090
Give me Volume 5.

716
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,520

Wow. Rukawa is so cool.

720

Hey, you got funnier.

723

Hush. How dare you compare him to Rukawa?

724
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,890
To be honest, Bo Hyeon has
a face you easily get sick of.

725
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,200
His face is too tiny.

726
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,200
He doesn't feel like a real man, you know.

727
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,540
Lucky you for having a big manly face.

728
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,780
My face isn't big. It's medium-sized.

Hi.

730
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,760
Lee Sook, isn't this your teacher?

731
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,630
I bet no one messed around with you.

732
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,730
When I was in 10th grade,
a teacher-in-training used to bow to me.

733
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,250
Right. He did that for a whole semester.

734
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,760
I got caught by the dean,

735
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,890
so I ran on the track until I threw up.

736
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,810
But it was fun.

737
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,750
By the way, when was Hyo Ri ever not pretty?

738
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,100
I'm sure I could find some pictures.
But I really don't remember.

739

I missed you so much when
I didn't see you for only a day?

Yes.

764
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,630
I'll come before you go in
for the surgery tomorrow.

765
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,240
And I'll be by your side when you wake up.

766
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:17,200
Do you know the hardest thing when you're sick?

767
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,740
That my everyday life and the lives
of those people around me pause.

768
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,300
They even disappear.

769
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,200
My surgery will go well, and I'll come
back after my treatment.

770
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,960
So, don't come.

771

While you keep living your everyday life,

772
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,200
I'll find my new everyday life and come back.

773
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,930

When you got sick when we were on our trip,

776
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:04,490
I was so upset to see you in pain.

777
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,590
That's when I thought...

778
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,570
you must've felt...

779
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:19,300
a lot more pain than I do while seeing me sick.

Thank you.

kept saying I didn't look like you.
