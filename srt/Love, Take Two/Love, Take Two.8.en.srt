1
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,821
Ji An, let's cry.

2
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,701
Crying doesn't make you weak

3
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:14,311
and not crying doesn't make you okay.

4
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:18,051
You have a shoulder to lean on today.

5
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,761
Use that as an excuse to cry a lot.

6
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,591
It's your hometown oppa advantage.

7
00:01:55,631 --> 00:02:00,931
[Episode 8. First Love Advantage]

8
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,631
<i>It's your hometown oppa advantage.</i>

9
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,191
Honey, let's eat.

10
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,371
Eat without me.

11
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,951
Bo Hyeon is waiting.

12
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,591
It was like love for humanity.

13
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,401
Out of the kindness of the heart, probably.

14
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:17,121
Lee Ji An, are you conjuring up
those feelings again?

15
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,421
- Hey.
- You scared me.

16
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,571
Are you a cow or something?

17
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,321
Why are you regurgitating this morning?

18
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,151
Hey.

19
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:34,061
You know the first sign of aging
is talking to yourself, right?

20
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,721
You talk to the orchid while cleaning it,

21
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:39,581
talk to the ground after you fall,

22
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,021
and talk to the porridge and ladle like you do now.

23
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,491
That's a classic sign of aging.

24
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:47,841
You know?

25
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,181
Gosh, look at you.

26
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,951
Hyo Ri, bring this porridge to Dr. Jung.

27
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,681
I don't want to.

28
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,631
That little...

29
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,161
I'll go home now.

30
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,221
You should recover and go
to the hospital with me tomorrow.

31
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,631
I said I'm going home.

32
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,821
People are so selfish.

33
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:30,051
I feel angry, resentful,

34
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,281
and I want to ignore you, too.

35
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,171
But I don't want to teach Hyo Ri to live that way.

36
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:39,341
Even when you want to give up on everything,

37
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,371
you need to overcome, fight it, and lean on others.

38
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:45,001
That's what I want to teach her.

39
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,191
So, for Hyo Ri and me,

40
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:53,131
please stay with us for now.

41
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:56,081
Use this room because it's empty.

42
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,541
And we're busy since the shop just opened.

43
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,231
It'd be nice if you could help count the money.

44
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,321
Please eat.

45
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,821
Gosh. What's this? Why am I looking around?

46
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,621
Ryu Jeong Seok, don't take it too far.

47
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:17,861
Wow. The air is so amazing here.
The view is amazing, too.

48
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,031
Yeong Su heard you came to Korea and asked

49
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,261
if you could do a presentation at the conference.

50
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:26,821
I just told him to ask you directly.

51
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:30,821
Presentation? It'd be strange if I suddenly gave one.

52
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:33,021
I refuse.

53
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,911
By the way, Honey,

54
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,421
let's talk privately sometime.

55
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,681
We should talk about Bo Hyeon.
I have something to tell you, too.

56
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:44,691
Gosh, my, my, that's dangerous. Why...

57
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:48,011
She needs to balance while pedaling.

58
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:06,171
Hello.

59
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,321
D-Did you see me?

60
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:15,919
I rode smoothly from all the way back there.

61
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,721
You don't know what smooth means.

62
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:23,281
Looks like you're surprised by my motor skills.

63
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,521
You've got to be kidding me.

64
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:30,621
This is what it's like to laugh
out loud. Laugh out loud.

65
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,441
- Is Dr. Jung okay?
- Yes, she's okay.

66
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:40,921
It's just torture for me, stuck
between Hyo Ri and Dr. Jung.

67
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:44,131
You need a change of scenery at times like that.

68
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,651
I'm going to Seoul this week for a conference.

69
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,391
You can join to get some fresh air.

70
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,721
I can't because of the shop.

71
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,091
I should do that.

72
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,721
- Presentation.
- You said you won't.

73
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:02,721
No, it'd be nice to meet people
in the industry there.

74
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:07,631
Our school asked me to

75
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,591
give a presentation regarding my current project.

76
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,961
I see.

77
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,941
They won't leave me alone, right?

78
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:19,181
It'd be nice if you came.

79
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:21,641
But since the subject matters are so deep,

80
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,801
you'd find it very boring.

81
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,101
Right?

82
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,951
So, you said you'll go?

83
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,421
"You'll find it very boring."

84
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,231
She pissed me off when she said that.

85
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,321
So, I said I'll go, and that I like stuff like that.

86
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,751
She's really something.

87
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:47,601
How did she know that you conk out at those things?

88
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,261
I mean,

89
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:56,441
why is that woman so nasty?

90
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:59,991
Even if you fell off the stairs during the lecture,

91
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:02,021
your bones will break, not hers.

92
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,751
Why does she care? Go.

93
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,771
Gogeon University, did you say?

94
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,721
Anyway, I want you to go there to prove yourself.

95
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,141
There's a famous donut shop by that school.

96
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:15,791
I want you to prove yourself
and bring those back, too.

97
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,461
Hey.

98
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:19,471
Donuts have nothing to do
with that nasty one, right?

99
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,041
Right. You're pissed off already.

100
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,791
Not buying the donuts will double your loss.

101
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,421
Gosh, I got the chills.

102
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,621
How are you so logical?

103
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,821
Gosh, I love it.

104
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:37,631
Your chemistry has been bothering me a lot.

105
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,611
Our chemistry...

106
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,431
Are you sick?

107
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,111
I'm okay.

108
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,911
He seems sick after jumping
into the ocean. So I told him to rest.

109
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,321
- But he won't listen.
- I'm...

110
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:56,251
a total man of steel.

111
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,191
Do you want to see it?

112
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,691
Steel!

113
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,931
Steel!

114
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:03,621
So good.

115
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,701
He's so good. I can't see his feet.

116
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,621
Two, three, four...

117
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:11,421
- So fast. I can't see his feet.
- One, two, three, six.

118
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:14,401
[Farmer]

119
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,021
- Yeah.
<i>- Come out now.</i>

120
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,961
- What?
- <i>It's urgent. Come out now.</i>

121
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,441
What is it? What?

122
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:37,021
- Look.
- So what?

123
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,351
It's the sprout that came out a few days ago.

124
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:41,991
They grew at least 2 mm each.

125
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,661
Can't you tell?

126
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,021
Hey.

127
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,451
They grow while hearing the farmer's footsteps.

128
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:51,821
You should come, walk around,

129
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:55,821
and tell them they're doing great,
so they grow bigger.

130
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:03,521
Should we get some sun since we're here

131
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:06,821
and have fun weeding, too?

132
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:12,421
Let's. Let's have fun weeding

133
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,721
- and clear our thoughts, too.
- Okay.

134
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:54,201
Hello.

135
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,731
It's too hot.

136
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,861
Let's call it a day.

137
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,231
Take care.

138
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:35,241
Why won't the color deepen?

139
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,591
Is it because I switched the soy sauce?

140
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,141
Is it?

141
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,361
Why are you sweating so much?

142
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:47,071
I'm sweating because we're making broth.

143
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,121
I know.

144
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:51,621
The vegetables are boiling.
But why are you sweating?

145
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:02,021
Gosh, you have a fever.

146
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:08,321
- You're right.
- You got sick from jumping into the ocean.

147
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,221
- I mean-
- I'm okay.

148
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:13,321
I'm really okay.

149
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:19,121
You aren't okay.

150
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,781
You need to rest.

151
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,261
Follow me.

152
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:27,301
We have a guest room for times like this.

153
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,501
Look at your sweat. Goodness. My gosh.

154
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:37,121
I'm okay.

155
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:42,111
I recover quickly after taking a quick nap.

156
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,561
Gosh.

157
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:47,121
I want you to promise me.

158
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:50,021
Not when you think you're okay,

159
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:53,971
but come back to work
when you've completely recovered.

160
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,121
I'm really strong.

161
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:00,571
I said I can work with full energy tomorrow.

162
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:05,121
Unexpectedly, you follow your head.

163
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,791
I've been told...

164
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,981
I have the brain of a genius

165
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,821
pretty often.

166
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,321
Not your brain. Your head.

167
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,821
You look like you'd follow your heart,
but you follow your head.

168
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,711
Your body is saying, "I'm sick."

169
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:23,931
But your head is saying, "No, you're strong."

170
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,401
Why won't you listen to your body?

171
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,151
When you're having a hard time,

172
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,841
you need to know how to bend and fall.

173
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:34,231
That makes you truly strong.

174
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:42,891
Rest well and come back
with a healthy body and mind.

175
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:44,541
Sleep.

176
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,981
Why won't you ask me anything?

177
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:09,501
A few words can't comfort you.

178
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,991
I'll just...

179
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:15,241
be by your side quietly.

180
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:24,201
And if you no longer want to wander alone

181
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:27,841
or you've sorted things out... Anyway,

182
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,641
if you need someone at some point,

183
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:34,591
I'll be by your side then, too.

184
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,101
How's it? Is it good?

185
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,121
Hey.

186
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,251
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

187
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,521
Aren't you too underdressed for a conference?

188
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,621
I'm not presenting. Aren't I
just supposed to clap hard?

189
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,551
Is that right?

190
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,611
They're here.

191
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:29,421
I didn't know she was so pretty.

192
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,221
Her scarf is nice, too. She's like Audrey Hepburn.

193
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:35,701
- Isn't the scarf too much?
- It's too much.

194
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,601
It'd make her neck sweaty.

195
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,821
She'll step on it or get it caught in a door.

196
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:43,621
That'd be better. If you get caught
on a car window, you die.

197
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,481
Why is her skin so taut?

198
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,211
Look at Ji An.

199
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:53,141
She hit the passage of time honestly with her face.

200
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,321
That's enough.

201
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:57,431
Should I bring out my jewelry?

202
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:59,221
You're falling behind in looks.

203
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,161
You'd have to wear jewelry and
show off wealth instead.

204
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,961
Seriously.

205
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,501
- Where's she going?
- Where are you going?

206
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,731
Where's she going?

207
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,921
- I'll be right back!
- Hey!

208
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,331
Hey, hey!

209
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:15,621
Hey!

210
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,751
She's wearing a scarf. She's wearing a scarf.

211
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,971
She's wearing a scarf. All set. It's over.

212
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,861
She just needed a scarf.

213
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,121
I heard Dong Min and Hyeon Su were coming, too.

214
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,521
Do you see them sometimes?

215
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,821
No. I just see Yeong Su sometimes.

216
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,921
The school has changed so much.

217
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:40,881
They expanded the pharmacy
building and built the new central library.

218
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:44,021
That's why it felt different.

219
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:50,041
Being back on campus makes me
want to go back to my 20s.

220
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,641
Don't you agree?

221
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:06,721
Gosh, why is this field so huge? I'm dying.

222
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,951
Since Hyo Ri and Bo Hyeon did a lot,

223
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,961
there are hardly any weeds.

224
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:12,991
I was surprised.

225
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,901
Yes. That won't let you leave early.

226
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,221
We need to weed this whole place to go home today.

227
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:21,021
- Who said I won't?
- Get to it.

228
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,581
It's a hot day. Let's not overdo it.

229
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,291
Gosh, Bo Hyeon. Are you very hot?

230
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:33,201
Should we not overdo it and go home?

231
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:37,671
Bo Hyeong must hate her acting like that.

232
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,221
Hey, I'm smart.

233
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,481
I refused to study. I wasn't bad at it.

234
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,611
Okay.

235
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,621
I'm serious. Really.

236
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,731
Hey, you know. Tell her.

237
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:54,441
Okay, fine.

238
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,621
Anyway,

239
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:03,621
the academic background is the
only thing you're better at than I am.

240
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:07,021
Let's fight fair and square for love-

241
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,121
You know, we smooched.

242
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:16,271
Or a kiss?

243
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:25,511
Kiss?

244
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,601
You bitch. Hey.

245
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,221
Hey...

246
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,281
You little vixen... Hey, when did you...

247
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,361
When did you kiss?

248
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,831
Where... Where did you?

249
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:42,191
Stop. Hey!

250
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,721
Let go.

251
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:45,391
Where did you kiss?

252
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,064
Where did you kiss? Hey!

253
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:51,121
I just thought I should make things clear.

254
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:57,821
Well, I'm not sure if this was the
only way to do that, but...

255
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,061
it wasn't bad.

256
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,241
[Gogeon Architecture Annual Forum -
Speaking of Living Space]

257
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:15,281
It's going to be super boring.
Are you ready for it?

258
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:18,251
I'm more academic than you think.

259
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,641
Jeong Seok.

260
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:21,661
Excuse me.

261
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,771
Gosh, hey.

262
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:30,021
They're so happy to see each other after 10 years.

263
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:34,021
- Isn't it fascinating?
- You must know everyone.

264
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:36,621
I used to be kind of famous.

265
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,621
I went up on stage during
a school festival my freshman year

266
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:42,061
and confessed my feelings to Jeong Seok.

267
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:45,001
Everyone knew me since then.

268
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:49,521
He's my first love.

269
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:53,081
I thought we were meant to be,
but it didn't work out.

270
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,841
But I can get him back.

271
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,921
- Sunbae.
- Yeo Jeong.

272
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,521
Long time no see, Sunbaenim.

273
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:07,661
How could you always be so beautiful?

274
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,961
Come on.

275
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,271
Everyone's looking forward to the Cheonghae project.

276
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,521
You came briefly for work, right?

277
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:18,921
It's for work and for love, too.

278
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,861
Are you getting back together?

279
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,491
No, right?

280
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,251
Well, maybe.

281
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,341
Look forward to it.

282
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:33,021
So wonderful.

283
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:35,451
- Wow.
- Let's stand by.

284
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:38,141
- Go fill up the seats.
- Okay.

285
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,851
I'm so nervous.

286
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,101
Do you think I could do well?

287
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,871
- Let's go upstairs.
- Yes.

288
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,951
The fundamental principle of organic architecture

289
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,281
is coexisting with the surrounding nature.

290
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:10,341
I spend most of my time thinking about that.

291
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:14,021
The nature was the land's owner
for thousands of years.

292
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:17,281
Considering its fate with the
building that will join them

293
00:23:17,281 --> 00:23:19,621
for the next hundreds of years...

294
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:22,381
<i>Considering the future of the building for the</i>

295
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,861
<i>next decades and hundreds of years,</i>

296
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,881
<i>it'd be good to listen to the ones
who worked hard on the site-</i>

297
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,321
<i>I understand.</i>

298
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,821
<i>We'll make the decision.</i>

299
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:36,311
By working closely with the environmental
groups, who experienced

300
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,221
and thought about the local ecosystem for years,

301
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:42,821
I worked to achieve their coexistence.

302
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,921
Nature isn't just a backdrop
or an accessory to the building.

303
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:49,121
It holds an equal value...

304
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,401
I'll go to the restroom.

305
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:53,211
and an attitude to understand as its partner.

306
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:55,721
Yes. Architecture can no longer

307
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:58,711
stay a human-centered sculpture.

308
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,511
Gosh, I feel achy.

309
00:24:01,511 --> 00:24:04,461
Studying really isn't for me.

310
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,721
<i>Is she impressive or shameless?</i>

311
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:12,421
<i>Jeong Seok supported her
for years while caring for their son.</i>

312
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:14,621
How could she cheat on him there?

313
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,431
If Jeong Seok is acting that way knowingly,

314
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:19,971
he'd be stupid, not saintly.

315
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,251
See you later.

316
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:41,141
Thank you.

317
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:43,581
There will be an after party. You're coming, right?

318
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:46,171
Ji An would probably feel uncomfortable, right?

319
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:50,531
How far will you drag me down?

320
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,831
What?

321
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,751
Is it because I mentioned us getting back together?

322
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:00,311
I didn't drag you down.

323
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:03,151
I was sincere.

324
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,101
I want us to start over.

325
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:08,531
I wanted to tell you properly.

326
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,351
You haven't changed.

327
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,291
You think and act selfishly.

328
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:17,921
You act as if you're being nice by being

329
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:21,621
honest without caring about
what the other person thinks.

330
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:27,221
Lee Yeo Jeong, people suffer losses,

331
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:30,521
and let the other person win
for his sake and endure.

332
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:34,521
Some people call that caring or even love.

333
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:38,431
But you know what I learned from you?

334
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,921
That I can't waste that gesture

335
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:45,311
on someone who doesn't know its value.

336
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,681
We'll never get back together.

337
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,721
Watch your mouth in front of people.

338
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:54,481
I won't tolerate it next time.

339
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,981
Is it because of Ji An?

340
00:25:57,781 --> 00:25:59,261
Get your facts straight.

341
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:01,701
It's because of you, not Ji An.

342
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,101
Seriously!

343
00:27:57,851 --> 00:27:59,211
Hey!

344
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:33,721
We were a bit like stars
in a coming-of-age movie, huh?

345
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,221
Oppa, don't I look sweet
and innocent when I'm wet?

346
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,921
Hey, acting like this at our age

347
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:43,421
makes us look pathetic, not sweet and innocent.

348
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,921
Why can't you clean yourself properly?

349
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:48,831
Come here.

350
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,651
My goodness. Seriously.

351
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:55,611
You're acting as if we're close.

352
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,551
It's okay. I'll do it.

353
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:03,111
Why were you checking out
the building so thoroughly?

354
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:04,921
Is it your occupational obsession?

355
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:08,031
I worked on this building's construction site.

356
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:11,241
- Really?
- Yes.

357
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:13,601
When I worked here,

358
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,821
I entered the campus with the college students.

359
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,021
I felt excited because
I felt like I was one of them.

360
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:24,481
<i>I understood the meaning of youthfulness.</i>

361
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:26,691
<i>They looked so sweet.</i>

362
00:29:45,691 --> 00:29:47,351
<i>I wonder if that why.</i>

363
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,521
<i>I didn't usually think about my dad,</i>

364
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,231
<i>but I thought of him a lot while working here.</i>

365
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:57,131
<i>"Some people build memories on campus,</i>

366
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,721
<i>and I build brick walls instead.</i>

367
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:03,491
Do you pay to go here? I get paid to come here."

368
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,351
I tried to act all cool,

369
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:09,441
but if my dad were alive,
would my situation been different?

370
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,101
That's when I first thought that.

371
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,231
You must've been sad.

372
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:16,561
No.

373
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,721
Thinking now, the result probably

374
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:23,421
would have been the same in the end.

375
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,701
I have Hyo Ri.

376
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:33,491
It would've been her in the end,
no matter what happened.

377
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:35,621
Yes, it would've been Hyo Ri.

378
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:38,871
Since I have her, I don't feel at a loss or upset.

379
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,851
I cheered myself up thinking that.

380
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,721
So, you also did the right thing.

381
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:51,661
Did I do something?

382
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:57,921
Even when you felt wronged, exhausted,

383
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:01,421
or upset, you probably endured things,

384
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:04,451
by waiting and accepting them because of Bo Hyeon.

385
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,711
That's how you probably have lived.

386
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:09,371
So, you did a good job.

387
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:11,151
You hung in there well.

388
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:18,551
I'll go to the restroom.

389
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:29,361
<i>Jeong Seok supported her for years.</i>

390
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:31,561
<i>How could she cheat on him there?</i>

391
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:34,711
<i>If he's acting this way knowingly,</i>

392
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:36,991
<i>he'd be stupid, not saintly.</i>

393
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:49,461
I know how that feels a little bit.

394
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:52,621
That's why I suddenly wanted to tell you that.

395
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:57,401
Other people might not know, but I do.

396
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:01,821
How you hung in there all this time.

397
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,421
So, you did great.

398
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:12,181
By the way, you...

399
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:14,181
Huh?

400
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:18,371
Don't fall asleep.

401
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:21,361
I'd get sleepy while driving if you fell asleep.

402
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:26,521
I told you. I can't sleep because I'm sensitive.

403
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,321
Yeah, right.

404
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,121
I was exhausted that day.

405
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:36,761
How could you not know yourself at that age?

406
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:40,561
You think you know me better?

407
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,811
<i>Other people might not know, but I do.</i>

408
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:52,841
<i>How you hung in there all this time.</i>

409
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,331
What a fool.

410
00:32:57,341 --> 00:32:59,111
Why did he tear up?

411
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:03,101
I almost wiped his tears.

412
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,991
<i>By the way, you...</i>

413
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:09,251
<i>Huh?</i>

414
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:15,631
You looked pretty today.

415
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,301
Auntie.

416
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:32,921
Huh? Hyo Ri.

417
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,231
Hey, are you crazy?

418
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:14,821
Get out.

419
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:21,001
Because you were mopey like seaweed,

420
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:23,671
you got Seon Yeong to kick me out, too.

421
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,001
Because you keep zoning out,

422
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:28,061
she was frustrated and kicked me out, too.

423
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:30,041
We have nothing to do outside.

424
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,371
Whatever.

425
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:33,481
Let's have fun since Seon Yeong told us to.

426
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,821
Or I'll get slapped on my back again.

427
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:49,221
- Chef Kim
- Gosh, hello.

428
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,391
Why are you alone?

429
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:55,761
Tae Oh is home because he's sick.

430
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:58,421
Hyo Ri and her mom went downtown briefly.

431
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:01,911
Right. I wanted to give you this.

432
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,151
It's my homemade bread.

433
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,141
Gosh, thank you.

434
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,821
Do you bake bread, too?

435
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:12,881
Well, it's for someone else.

436
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,581
Who?

437
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,321
Hello.

438
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,791
Try some of this.

439
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:29,821
I made this potato bread myself.

440
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:41,141
What a well-built house.

441
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:44,501
The views are pretty everywhere.

442
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,981
Try some of this.

443
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:52,211
Try it.

444
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,571
The potatoes were delicious.

445
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,131
What do you think?

446
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:02,161
It's delicious.

447
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,541
I'm happy that you like it.

448
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:18,441
I...

449
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:22,911
heard about your situation.

450
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:27,661
At our age,

451
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:30,921
some of us let our kids go first.

452
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:37,741
I did, too.

453
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:41,671
When my son was less than 30,

454
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:44,441
I sent him away before me, too.

455
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,991
It's already...

456
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:50,241
been 10 years.

457
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:53,891
That's why...

458
00:37:54,821 --> 00:38:00,121
I can kind of understand how you feel. Just a bit.

459
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,991
There are...

460
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,091
hundreds of reasons to die.

461
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,521
But you can't...

462
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:15,041
think of a single reason to live.

463
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,141
I know how that feels.

464
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,681
So,

465
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:29,121
did you find the reason to live?

466
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:32,981
I...

467
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,301
have to remember him.

468
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,601
I need to live...

469
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,671
to remember my son for a long time,

470
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:45,471
love him,

471
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:50,831
and cry...

472
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,541
for my son.

473
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:56,951
His mother has to do that.

474
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:02,151
Otherwise, his life seemed...

475
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:04,241
too empty.

476
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,761
You should think about it, too.

477
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:13,721
Even with a hundred reasons to die,

478
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:18,721
if you have just one reason to live,

479
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:22,571
you can hang in there...

480
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,941
in our lives.

481
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,721
- Chef Kim, I'm back.
- Tae Oh.

482
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,501
- Gosh.
- You must've been worried.

483
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:45,321
My gosh.

484
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:49,151
Gosh. Okay.

485
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,951
Yes. I was very worried.

486
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:56,291
I'm glad you recovered quickly.

487
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:59,051
As you told me to, I rested well

488
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:02,721
and returned with a healthy body

489
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,011
and pure spirit.

490
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:05,421
Yes. Okay.

491
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:08,521
Thank you for getting back your health.

492
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:12,571
But your pure spirit...

493
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:15,621
is a bit concerning.

494
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,921
Just go back to being an attentive spirit.

495
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,331
Got it.

496
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:24,231
I'll start cleaning first, then.

497
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,561
Go.

498
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:27,671
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go.

499
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:36,951
I'm so happy to see your face.

500
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,381
Okay.

501
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:52,311
See? There's so much to see.

502
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,121
It's fun.

503
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:57,521
- Can we try the shikhye?
- Of course. Try it.

504
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,471
My husband made it.

505
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,781
Hello.

506
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:08,941
So pretty.

507
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:10,721
Mom...

508
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,681
- Why did you laugh?
- No, it's pretty.

509
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,541
- Isn't it funny?
- It's pretty.

510
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,731
Should we get one for Auntie, too?

511
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,861
These would be so comfortable in the kitchen.

512
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:21,501
They're so soft.

513
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,751
- What do you think?
- Put this on you.

514
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:30,011
- Does it look okay?
- This, too.

515
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:36,891
Hey,

516
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,281
this is so good.

517
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:40,521
Should we sell this, too?

518
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:42,821
Don't you have business ethics?

519
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:45,921
Sell what you're good
at making without overlapping.

520
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,461
You're always right,

521
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:50,961
but you strangely make me not want to accept it.

522
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,111
It's because I take after you.

523
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:54,581
Aren't you so clever?

00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,961

Hello.

Hello.

530
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:16,981
Is this your first painting class?

531
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,121
Yes, we've never done anything like this.

532
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:21,931
Is that so? Let's make it easy.

533
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:23,471
- Let's go slow.
- Okay.

534
00:42:23,471 --> 00:42:25,721
Today, we'll paint a self-portrait.

535

From your phone,

536
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:30,301
find a photo you like the most.

- A photo of yourself?
- Yes.

538
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,121
You must have a lot of self-love.

539
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,631
- Well, yes.
- Wow...

00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:43,071
Put this carbon paper on the canvas.

542
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,021
- Carbon paper.
- Do you know what it is?

543
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,491
Of course. I've used it in school.

544
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:51,681
Making art has to be fun.

545
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:52,871
Yes.

546
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,701
We'll draw lines tracing this photo.

547
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:57,631
- Use the pen.
- Okay.

548
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:03,471
Ma'am, ma'am, you can't shave off your jaw.

549
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:06,261
- It was when I gained weight.
- No, no.

550
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:08,711
I look a bit different now. So...

551
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,421
it needs to look like me now.

552
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,081
You look the same. Trace it exactly, still.

553
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:14,421
I don't think so...

554
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:20,501
We'll choose the colors for the skin.

555
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:24,301
Have a look. This is a summer tone.

556
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,651
Yes.

557
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:27,311
There are many kinds, right?

558
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:31,871
- All are nice.
- Don't just enjoy them. Choose one.

559
00:43:31,871 --> 00:43:33,721
- Recommend one for me.
- Should I?

560
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,561
For the daughter...

561
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,061
How's pink?

562
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:39,451
- Pink?
- It represents possibilities.

563
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:41,851
- That's cool.
- Okay.

564
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:43,711
For the mother...

565
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:47,191
How's this one? It's like Hulk.

566
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,821
Hulk? Why?

567
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:50,141
Looking at your lines,

568
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:52,021
even though you've never drawn before,

569
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,231
but with this talent,

570
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,721
I think you might have a hidden superpower.

571
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:59,491
Really? I should do Hulk, then.

572
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,391
You're doing great. Just like that.

573
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:04,021
Don't go over the lines.

574
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:07,351
Mother, use your hidden superpower
as much as you can.

575
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:10,161
She's good.

576
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:14,181
Looks like you've done this before.

577
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:17,291
It's my first time.

578
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,581
There.

579
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:26,231
Isn't it fascinating?

580
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,711
I thought only artists could do this.

581
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:30,501
You have a talent.

582
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,121
You should start nurturing it.

583
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:35,221
Come on. Everyone can draw like me.

584
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:38,011
- You know your paintings we have at home?
- Yes.

585
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,841
I'm not sure if they're good,

586
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:43,751
but they're very Lee Ji An.

587
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,691
I can't tell if it's a compliment or not.

588
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:49,921
Not Mom, Manager Lee, or Ms. Lee.

589
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,621
But exactly Lee Ji An.

590
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:56,711
I could sense a side of you I don't know of.

591
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:59,311
So, I thought it was very Lee Ji An.

592
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:02,131
I liked it.

593
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,781
So, you should nurture your talent.

594
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,641
Okay. Once the shop gets settled down,

595
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:12,481
I'll think about it later.

596
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,921
By the way, are you feeling okay?

597
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,261
Aren't you tired?

598
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:18,531
The new meds seem to agree with me.

599
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:21,221
My heart doesn't palpitate anymore, either.

600
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:25,851
Huh? Look, look.

601
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,021
Give me a lot.

602
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,071
No. They're all kids.

603
00:45:31,071 --> 00:45:34,061
Hey, kids don't care about the
ambience or trend at that age.

604
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:36,111
They only care about getting good deals.

605
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,151
Let's go. It has to be good.

606
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:49,221
How surprising.

607
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:52,271
Why is eating tteokbokki
while listening to the waves so romantic?

608
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:53,421
I know.

609
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:56,101
How could tteokbokki be so atmospheric?

610
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:04,321
Why have you been in a bad mood lately?

611
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:07,631
It doesn't seem like you fought with Bo Hyeon.

612
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:10,531
Is it because of Dr. Jung?

613
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,821
You could be mad at her, but-

614
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:15,551
I'm not mad at her.

615
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:18,531
You aren't?

616
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,141
What's wrong, then?

617
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:24,711
The entire family tiptoes around you.

618
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:30,521
- It's because of you.
- Me?

619
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:34,431
What about me?

620
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,671
Thank you for enjoying them.

621
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:43,271
I feel great.

622
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,221
I enjoyed them.

623
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,421
Okay.

624
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:51,621
Call me if you crave more later.

625
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:57,521
By the way, Hyo Ri...

626
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:03,521
probably thought of her mom looking at you.

627
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:07,041
"If I'm gone,

628
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:12,221
would my mom also..."

629
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:13,711
Thinking that.

630
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:16,121
I'll go now.

631
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:21,161
<i>I was afraid...</i>

632
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:26,381
I was afraid you'd end up

633
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,611
like Dr. Jung...

634
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:31,911
if I'm gone.

635
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:38,631
The biggest fear I had
when I found out about my condition...

636
00:47:41,671 --> 00:47:44,081
"My mom only cares about me.

637
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:45,691
If...

638
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:52,071
I end up dying, how would she live?"

639
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,431
That was my biggest fear.

640
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:13,171
Wait here.

641
00:48:22,261 --> 00:48:23,861
- Sir.
- Yes.

642
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:52,801
[Art studio yearly membership]
Happy now?

643
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,871
Listen carefully.

644
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:59,551
I can't believe I'm saying this,

645
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,221
but by chance...

646
00:49:02,221 --> 00:49:04,721
by a slim chance,

647
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,201
if something happens to you,

648
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,501
I'll live my own life.

649
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:15,301
I'll live the rest of my days fully

650
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:16,921
and spend each day

651
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:20,671
by working hard and cherishing it.

652
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:23,151
I swear that on my name.

653
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:37,781
That's what I wanted to hear the
most since I became sick.

654
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,211
Thank you.

655
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:08,411
We're...

656
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:13,971
finally learning how to truly live for each other.

657
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,241
Right?

658
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:40,521
Gosh!

659
00:50:42,631 --> 00:50:46,711
Can I learn how to use this?

660
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:52,681
I'm not so sure.

661
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:54,261
It's very hard.

662
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:56,071
Would you be able to?

663
00:50:56,731 --> 00:50:58,561
I know.

664
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:00,281
Wouldn't it be...

665
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:02,521
better if you kept a ledger by hand?

666
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:03,861
Yes, that'd be better.

667
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,641
I...

668
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:09,391
I am a doctor.

669
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:13,331
Okay. Let's see, then.

670
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:15,121
First of all,

671
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:17,921
if you press this button...

672
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:22,491
Gosh, the computer is on.

673
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,341
Next...

674
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,311
- Welcome back.
- Where's Hyo Ri?

675
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:34,281
She went to see Bo Hyeon.

676
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:35,951
What's she doing?

677
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:40,651
She wanted to learn how to use the register.

678
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,841
Wouldn't an abacus be better?

679
00:51:43,841 --> 00:51:46,501
I said I'm a doctor.

680
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:50,351
Yes, Doctor.

681
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:52,351
Shall we start, then?

682
00:51:52,351 --> 00:51:55,401
Select a table first.

683
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,051
Table.

684
00:51:57,051 --> 00:51:58,981
Gosh, this is hard.

685
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,021
That's it.

686
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:04,451
Okay. Now select bossam.

687
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,751
Press it. Bossam.

688
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,621
You're so impressive.

689
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:16,321
- Next.
- Can you select order next?

690
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:19,421
Order.

691
00:52:19,421 --> 00:52:20,781
Can you? Can you? Can you?

692
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:23,161
Yes! Success.

693
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:26,501
Wow. I'm so impressed.

694
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:29,421
Not just anyone can be a doctor.

695
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:36,621
Can you finish the sash enforcement by tomorrow?

696
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:38,841
Yes. So, we can get lumber tomorrow.

697
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:40,621
I made it clear with them.

698
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:42,671
Team Leader, everything okay, right?

699
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:45,421
Of course, I'm very okay.

700
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:48,721
I really nagged the sash team.

701
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,331
So our schedule doesn't get disrupted.

702
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:52,221
I'm monitoring them very closely.

703
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:54,401
Good job, Team Leader.

704
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,981
Thank you, brother.

705
00:52:57,011 --> 00:52:58,281
And...

706
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:01,721
I'll schedule the library construction in advance.

707
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,091
- No, no.
- Gosh.

708
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:04,791
Don't betray me.

709
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,181
- No.
- Don't feel pressured and keep it.

710
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:09,401
Seriously.

711
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,851
Isn't this from the restaurant nearby?

712
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:16,111
- Yes.
- It tells you to only take one.

713
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,301
This is what Ji An likes.

714
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:27,351
Bo Hyeon.

715
00:53:28,151 --> 00:53:29,821
I just had a date with my mom.

716
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:30,861
I see.

717
00:53:30,861 --> 00:53:33,111
- Did you come to brag about it?
- Yes.

718
00:53:33,111 --> 00:53:35,221
I painted a picture, too.

719
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:39,391
Ta-da.

720
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,011
It's a self-portrait.

721
00:53:43,311 --> 00:53:44,661
What?

722
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:47,621
- Do you want to be an alien?
- Hey.

723
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:49,281
This shows my potential.

724
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:50,431
I see.

725
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:52,381
Do you want to see something funny?

726
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:53,851
What is it?

727
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,171
She must love Shrek.

728
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:05,331
It's a Hulk green, not Shrek green.

729
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:07,051
The title is,

730
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:09,621
"I'm finally using my superpower."

731
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,881
Yes. That's perfect for her.

732
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,641
- Right?
- Yes.

733
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,411
My mom...

734
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:19,581
said she'll never live like Dr. Jung.

735
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:22,821
Mom said she'll...

736
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:26,641
live each day of her life fully from now on.

737
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,301
She got a membership at the art studio, too.

738
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:40,311
Is that what you were scared and worried about?

739
00:54:49,101 --> 00:54:50,531
Yes.

740
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:01,211
You must've been so scared.

741
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:13,251
But you're by my side.

742
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,821
You'll be by my side.

743
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:19,321
I can just come to you.

744
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:21,521
So, I didn't feel that scared.

745
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:17,711
- Hyo Ri.
- Hello.

746
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:19,641
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

747
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,571
- Well...
- Yes?

748
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:37,481
I took a trip to this village...

749
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,881
to see you, to be honest.

750
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:41,901
Me?

751
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:44,711
<i>So, how does it look, Mr. Ryu?</i>

752
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,321
<i>My mom is tough as nails,</i>

753
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,181
<i>but she sparkled like a girl</i>

754
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:51,071
<i>when she talked about her first love.</i>

755
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:53,911
<i>So, I was always curious</i>

756
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,991
what her first love was like.

757
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:59,461
And I saw an article about you in a magazine.

758
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,731
The name and the hometown were the same.

759
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:04,361
So, I got excited and looked for you.

760
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:05,541
Really?

761
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,631
I heard Mom was totally smitten with you.

762
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:10,041
Because she kept following you around,

763
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:13,931
you got scared and ran away from her, she said.

764
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,821
So, I corrected her.

765
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:22,421
That you weren't her first love, but her first unrequited love.

766
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,491
First unrequited love?

767
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:33,591
I...

768
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:38,421
feel too ashamed to face you and Hyo Ri.

769
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:45,991
I wondered how much you must've struggled.

770
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:50,011
I tried to understand how you felt.

771
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:54,061
All I could do was cry.

772
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:57,501
You knew you shouldn't,

773
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,771
but you didn't want to live.

774
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,981
I understand that feeling so well.

775
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:04,921
Really,

776
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:07,151
all I could do was cry.

777
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:14,591
Hyo Ri keeps worrying about me these days.

778
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:19,121
I thought it was because she was sick,

779
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,511
but I guess she's always been like that.

780
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:27,001
Since I lack in so many ways as a mom,

781
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,111
she worried that I'd worry.

782
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:32,801
She was struggling, but she couldn't even show it.

783
00:58:33,571 --> 00:58:35,511
She never even threw a tantrum.

784
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:37,341
That's how she grew up.

785
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:43,351
But since I came here,

786
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,091
she started...

787
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:47,981
sharing her worries and disappointments with me.

788
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:52,561
I finally feel like I'm doing my job as her mom.

789
00:58:56,611 --> 00:59:00,181
I heard your daughter asked you
to come while struggling.

790
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:03,981
Doctor,

791
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:07,741
you were so dependable that she could

792
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:10,071
be honest about her struggles.

793
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:15,191
So,

794
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:19,051
you need to keep being a cool mom

795
00:59:19,881 --> 00:59:22,001
whom she trusted and relied on

796
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:24,681
when she was struggling the most.

797
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,011
And...

798
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:34,821
if you still feel like life is a burden,

799
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:37,871
lean on Hyo Ri and me.

800
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:39,871
We'll do the same.

801
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,321
Ji An,

802
01:00:05,321 --> 01:00:08,521
can I ask you a favor?

803
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:12,001
How did you end up coming together?

804
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:13,741
I ran into him on the way.

805
01:00:13,741 --> 01:00:17,081
He said he was stopping by to see you briefly.

806
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,921
Were you waiting for Hyo Ri?

807
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,001
My telepathy reached you.

808
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:21,991
I was going to ask you something, anyway.

809
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:23,681
Go inside, Hyo Ri.

810
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:53,221
I felt I owed you a proper apology.

811
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:57,461
I'm sorry.

812
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:02,981
I shouldn't have done that,
regardless of the reason.

813
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:06,701
I'm sorry.

814
01:01:07,901 --> 01:01:09,661
I'm sorry.

815
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,651
That won't happen...

816
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,901
anymore, right?

817
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:34,171
Someone told me...

818
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,231
that even if you have hundreds of reasons to die,

819
01:01:37,231 --> 01:01:40,121
one reason to live lets you go on.

820
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:44,111
But your mom...

821
01:01:44,921 --> 01:01:48,921
told me a reason for me to live.

822
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:53,711
She told me...

823
01:01:55,301 --> 01:01:58,401
to stay as a dependable mom...

824
01:01:58,401 --> 01:02:01,031
whom my daughter could rely on.

825
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,121
I want to give that a try.

826
01:02:45,191 --> 01:02:49,361
To get Dr. Jung and Hyo Ri to talk,

827
01:02:49,361 --> 01:02:52,461
I have to take a walk at night with you?

828
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,651
It's nice that you get to exercise.

829
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:58,221
Exercising is crucial during menopause.

830
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:02,221
I'm sorry, but I'm nowhere near male menopause.

831
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:08,291
Your body is definitely aging.

832
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:09,821
I'm not.

833
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:12,321
Your face gets red when you're angry.

834
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,621
You shake when you're cold.
You can't stand the heat.

835
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:17,471
Your hands and feet feel numb
when you sit for too long, right?

836
01:03:19,631 --> 01:03:20,831
It's 100%. 100%.

837
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,871
Definitely in male menopause.

838
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:27,241
I said I'm not.

839
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,021
I love how you react.

840
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:33,821
You've been easy to tease since the 1990s.

841
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,521
Having silly talks with you like this

842
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,291
makes me feel a lot better.

843
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,611
I wanted to live casually,

844
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,991
but serious things keep happening.

845
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,791
I guess I've been tired lately.

846
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,971
Really?

847
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,921
If so, I should...

848
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:54,911
boost your energy, then.

849
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:56,551
Here!

850
01:03:57,511 --> 01:03:58,861
I love these.

851
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:00,111
It's a hometown oppa advantage.

852
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:02,571
Call me when you run out. I'll replenish them.

853
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:04,721
You're happy.

854
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:08,381
All right, then. Buy one and get one free.

855
01:04:08,381 --> 01:04:11,121
Hometown oppa advantage
and the first love advantage.

856
01:04:11,121 --> 01:04:14,521
I'll let you act bratty on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.

857
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:17,851
First love?

858
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:20,821
W-Who says you were my first love?

859
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:22,531
I know I am.

860
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:26,721
No. You weren't my first love.

861
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:29,621
When did I say I was your first love?

862
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:33,391
You were my first love.

863
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:36,091
That's why I'm giving you the first love advantage.

01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:03,941
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

870
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:25,261
You were...

871
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,391
my first love.
