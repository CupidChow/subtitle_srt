Gosh, what was that?

5

Didn't you fall asleep watching a TV drama?

6
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,071
Mr. Ryu said something like that?

7
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,521
That makes no sense.

8

I'm telling you.

9

It does make sense.

Yesterday, Jeong Seok called me Hyung and...

12
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,571
asked me about love.

13
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,771
So, I taught him.

14
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,821
"Jeong Seok, love is
about decisiveness and courage."

15
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:41,261

Come on.

19
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,891
He probably was like, "Hey, Byeon."

20

- So...
- Yes.

26

- Yes.

So, I was doing a morning briefing.

What did you see?

54
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:29,231
I don't know. What did I see, Mr. Ryu?

55
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,011
Do I have to know that?

56
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,801
Should I bring you coffee?
I got good beans for the office.

57
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,801
No. I don't drink coffee on an empty stomach.

00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,031
Okay. I'll pick you up when you go to the studio.

- What do you mean, it's okay?
- Aigoo...

72
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,471
Of course, he didn't call you Hyung.

184
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,211
I'll go on my own.

185
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,861
Yeah. I'm going on a weekday, too.

186
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:41,601
I'm going when Dr. Jung has an appointment.

187
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,531
Let's go together. When are you going?

188
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,391
When?

189
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,551
Next week. Next week sometime.

190
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,311
So, when next week? When?

193

A weekday.

194
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,411
A weekday. Don't you know what a weekday is?

195
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:02,761
Seriously. Anyway. I can't talk to you.

196
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,891
Anyway, I told you.

197
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:10,011
Am I the only one who thinks
it was a strange conversation?

198
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,521
Gosh, I have a hunch.

199
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,771
What?

200
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,001
She's all grown up.

201
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:24,051
In life, romance turns into a melodrama
and it turns into erotica.

202
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:25,631
Gosh, our Hyo Ri.

203
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:27,361
I'll take a shower and leave.

204
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,671
I should talk to her...

205
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,201

Huh?

211
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:54,381
Bo Hyeon and Hyo Ri are going on a trip.

212
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:01,141
- We know nothing about it.
- Pardon?

213
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,431
We have no clue.

214
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:05,021
Why? Because we're very dense.

215
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,401
Okay?

216
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,431
Yes, Chef.

217
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,081
Are you lonely these days?

218
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,991
You get clingier and clingier.

223
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:27,311
Yes, Chef.

224

I sliced the meat too much.

226

233
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,061
You should care for your wrists.

And someday, you could...

235
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:08,451

There you go.

243

Didn't you get these for yourself?

244

No.

245
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:41,013
I bought them as a gift for my mom,
but I didn't get to.

246
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:50,831
I had no idea you had a situation like that.

247
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,791
Since you're so positive.

No, Bo Hyeon-

258
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,801
Bo Hyeon is also going somewhere by coincidence.

259
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,711
So, I asked him to drive me downtown.

- Sook.
- Yes, Sook.

267
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,121

I'll put this away.

277
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:55,781
Shouldn't she have shown more effort to trick us?

278
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,421
Or do a better job at acting.

279
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:02,431
She has a long way to go.

280
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:04,831
Did she pack her meds?

281
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,211
Maybe I shouldn't have let her go.

282
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,281
Don't worry.

283
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,011

instead of forcing her to study.

286

You had no experience, either.

287
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,931
You became a mom when you were younger than her.

00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:53,151
I don't want to think about my age
and what people think.

362
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:56,671
We've waited too long.

363
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:58,561
At this very moment,

364
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:03,241
let's enjoy what makes us happy proudly.

365
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,511
We can't go fast enough.

366
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,401
Your reins are loose, seriously.

367
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:12,141
Deal! Why shouldn't we be proud?

368
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,676
I knew you'd say that.

369
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:15,516
So, I was going to say...

370
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,921
let's take a photo.

371
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,011
A photo?

372
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,331
I can't act pretty in front of the camera.

373
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:24,671
It's embarrassing.

374
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:29,321
The last time I went to your place,
I only saw photos of Hyo Ri.

375
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:33,046
Since it's just you and her,
you always take pictures of her.

376
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:36,946
There are no pictures of you together,
and of you alone, either.

377
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,321
I was like that, too.

378
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:44,301
Who cares if you're embarrassed
if it leaves memories?

379
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,311
Okay. Cheese.

380
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:49,931
Cheese?

381
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,401
I look better from the left.

382
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:53,631
Could you take photos from that angle?

383
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,101
So pretty.

384
00:23:57,101 --> 00:24:00,071
I love it.

385
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,661
Okay. I love it.

386
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:07,051
Do the flower stem. The flower stem.

387
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,701
Flower stem. Flower stem.

388
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,251
Nice.

389
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,491
Let's take photos of you now.

390
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,851
Okay, okay. Here.

391
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:17,191
Oppa, laugh, laugh.

392
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:20,591
Laugh.

393
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,191
What's that?

394
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,961
You can't be both handsome and cute.

395
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,601
Cute, cute.

396
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,761
Nice. Nice.

397
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,551
My gosh.

398
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,391
I like this pose.

399
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,401
It's cool. Can we do this?

400
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:42,041
Should we try? Okay.

401
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:45,031
- It's working. It's working.
- Really?

402
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,891
- Hold still.
- Like this?

403
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:48,511
Okay, okay.

404
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:51,181
Hold on. Wait.

405
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:52,671
Together?

406
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,921
One, two, three.

407
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:00,911
Got it.

408
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:04,741
- Wow.
- Did it work?

409
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:07,091
It looks great. It looks great.

410
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:12,791
We look pretty good.

411
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,281
You're a good photographer.

412
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,181
Gosh, no.

413
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,991
So, that's how I smile.

414
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,551
You smile the same way you did
when you were a kid.

415
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:37,091
You're extremely pure, I guess?

416
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:40,041
It's because I'm with you.

417
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,061
I smile like this because I'm with you.

418
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:49,171
I learned that I smile like this,
thanks to you, too.

419
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:53,001
Why do you flirt without a warning?

420
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,731
You got me flustered.

421
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:58,141
If so,

422
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,581
since I'm flustered, let me...

423
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:06,711
suggest an idea for our next date.

424
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,531
Whoa, I'm excited.

425
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:10,061
What is it?

426
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:13,451
Ramen.

427
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,271
Ramen?

428
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:16,901
Ji An,

429
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:22,091
do you want to eat ramen
at my house and sleep over?

430
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:34,541
I have no choice since we decided
to enjoy ourselves proudly.

431
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:37,111
Okay.

432
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,281
Right now? Right now?

433
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,371
- Huh?
- Can we go now?

434
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:43,541
Well, right now? Well... wait...

435
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,311
Hey...

436
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,871
It's my house. You need to wait for me.

437
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:57,151
Why is she so good on her bike?

438
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,421
Wait for me!

439
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:08,121
Here they come. Brace yourselves.

440
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:11,371
What's the theme of the day?

441
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,731
It's "E.T." It's "E.T."

442
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,801
Today's theme is "Roman Holiday."

443
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:20,741
Right?

444
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,911
Wow. You make a single lady feel sad.

445
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,791
Why do you have to show off to everyone

446
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:32,731
and say, "We're dating"? How obnoxious.

447
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,191
And are you copying me?

448
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:39,931
How could I not show off
when my boyfriend is this handsome?

449
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,221
We'll keep showing off from now on.

450
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:44,621
Please hang out as a group like this often.

451
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,421
- Let's go, babe.
- Okay.

452
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:51,771
Wait for me, babe.

453
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,461
Did they both have a heat stroke?

454
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:59,151
- So sweet.

You weren't quite on that level, to be honest.

00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,821

You're poking with a needle,
instead of a medical treatment?

543
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,151
Do you want a medical treatment?

544
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:08,441
Yes. I don't want stuff like this-

545
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:13,221
Hey, you should've warned-

546
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:16,551
Hey...

547
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,221
Hey,

548
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:19,631
I teared up just now.

549
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:23,731
I learned this medical treatment
from Dr. Heo Jun, okay?

550
00:35:32,701 --> 00:35:36,491
What do we do? This is our first trip.

551
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:41,871
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:44,121
Don't say stuff like that.

553
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,841
Follow me.

554
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,251
Get some sleep.

555
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,731
You'll feel much better then.

556
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:04,451
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

557
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,671
So refreshing.

558
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:15,681
Did Bo Hyeon tell you that
he was taking a trip with Hyo Ri?

559
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,901
He said he was going to a seminar in Seoul,

560
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:19,561
and he got all decked out.

561
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:21,441
He washed his car the day before, too.

562
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,241
I just knew something was up.

563
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:32,661
Don't you feel uncomfortable about them dating?

564
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:33,711
Why would I?

565
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:37,661
I mean, Hyo Ri... You know.

566
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,761
I just trust Bo Hyeon.

567
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:46,961
And I like Hyo Ri.

568
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:53,791
You don't know that your
decisions are special, right?

569
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,551
People usually don't make the same decisions.

570
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,441
But you make them like they're nothing sometimes.

571
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:04,391
Even though you can avoid them
if you feel uncomfortable.

572
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:08,001
I know you're a special person like that.

573
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,621
That's why I like you.

574
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:13,571
Was that a confession or a monologue?

575
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:16,231
I was flirting.

576
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:18,471
Look at you. You're acting cute now.

577
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,261
Was it cute? Was it cute?

578
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:21,451
Should I do more of it?

579
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,191
Bboo-ing. Bboo-ing.

580
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,101
- Right back at you.
- Right back at you.

581
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:26,201
Right back at you.

582
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,291
Right back at you.

583
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,281
Right back at you.

584
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,411
Right back at you.

585
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:35,661
Right back at you!

586
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:41,051
- Oppa.
- Yeah?

587
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,881
I said we're turning 50 soon.

588
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:45,611
What's wrong with you?

589
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,401
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here!

590
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,571
Oh, no. Stop, stop!

591
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:52,471
I have no mercy.

592
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:56,011
Stop now! Stop. Stop.

593
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,701
What are these?

594
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,431
Laundry. It's my laundry.

595
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,891
It doesn't look like it. Hold on.

596
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,161
What?

597
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,951
A-Are these matching pajamas?

598
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:17,011
Well, y-you need them t-to sleep over.

599
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,791
S-So, you bought matching pajamas?

600
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,471
To match with me?

601
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:24,911
Hey, don't wear them
if you don't want them. Don't.

602
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,571
I can just wear them alone.

603
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,821
Gosh, he's really...

604
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:33,851
He's more aggressive than he seems.

605
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:35,681
You're so sly.

606
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,721
As if you've been waiting for this day.

607
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:40,791
It's not that. As I said,

608
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,641
since my blood type is A, and I'm a Capricorn,

609
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,211
I'm sensitive and deliberate.

610
00:38:44,211 --> 00:38:47,901
I swear I'm not a sly person.

611
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:49,761
Oppa,

612
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,291
I'm not easy to read.

613
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,751
I'm as difficult to read as ancient literature.

614
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:59,141
I'm like Encyclopedia Britannica, then.

615
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:02,981
By the way,

616
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:06,821
do we need pajamas?

617
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,961
I don't think you need to wear them, either.

618
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,601
I love pajamas.

619
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:15,421
I'll wear them both
if you don't want to wear them.

620
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:20,791
What?

621
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,981
By the way,

622
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,971
why...

623
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,981
d-do you not need to wear them?

624
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,854
I don't know...

625
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:05,621
You're pretty.

626
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:16,311
It's nighttime. It's nighttime.

627
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:18,061
It's nighttime.

628
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:02,411
What? Are you sick?

629
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:05,051
No.

630
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,731
I feel alive.

631
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:12,861
Yes. You look okay.

632
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,531
This was our first trip.

633
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,071
But I zonked out.

634
00:42:23,011 --> 00:42:25,361
It's okay.

635
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:27,851
Should we go out?

636
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:31,171
Should we?

637
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:32,991
Let's.

638
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:34,681
Okay.

639
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:43,211
We need to go out, but...

640
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,031
I know.

641
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,691
Wow. It's delicious.

642
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,851
Is it because the view is nice?

643
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,941
Is that so?

644
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,571
I'm embarrassed. Stop looking at me.

645
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:40,151
Look forward. Look forward.

646
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,501
- Huh?
- Look forward.

647
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:44,931
Okay.

648
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:51,051
Are the kids having fun? They aren't calling.

649
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,921
<i>You must feel okay.</i>

650
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:58,351
A former med student sure is different.

651
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,421
You looked so skilled at poking my finger.

652
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:03,231
- I'm all healed now.
- Really?

653
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,631
Yes.

654
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:11,301
After I learned I was sick, I quit
medical school, saying it's not for me.

655
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,611
Maybe I shouldn't have.

656
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,681
But I think differently now.

657
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:19,851
Watching you, So Yeon,

658
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:22,201
and the rest of the guys,

659
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:28,621
I wanted to live according to
my thoughts, not the other way around.

660
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:30,741
Instead of stopping blindly,

661
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:35,621
maybe I should've asked,
"How do I want to live?" first.

662
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:40,021
So, I keep thinking...

663
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:42,761
about what I really want.

664
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:47,521
You'll definitely find it, but it'd take time.

665
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:51,811
You need to collect the wrong answers one by one

666
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:54,831
to find your own answer.

667
00:44:56,121 --> 00:44:59,791
But I'm still collecting wrong answers, too.

668
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,131
What?

669
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:16,694
Since you're by my side
and my mom is living her life now,

670
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:18,224
I...

671
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:24,271
I want to live.

672
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,771
I want to live well.

673
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,371
Don't worry. You will.

674
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:41,891
It's raining.

675
00:45:43,481 --> 00:45:45,251
Huh? It's raining.

676
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:47,781
Huh? Let's go inside...

677
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:07,881
I said you'll walk flowery paths
if you follow me, right?

678
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:14,861
<i>Was having someone to cover me in the rain</i>

679
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:18,551
<i>so heart-fluttering like this?</i>

680
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:20,151
Are you tired?

681
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,951
Should we go inside?

682
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:27,361
Why, Ji An? What's wrong?

683
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:30,041
Why am I so happy?

684
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:33,551
I'm not used to feeling nothing but happiness.

685
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:35,891
It doesn't feel like it belongs to me.

686
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:42,081
This is all yours.

687
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,721
I know.

688
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,611
- Aren't you cold?
- Huh?

689
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,771
I'm not cold at all.

690
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:19,441
Hyo Ri,

691
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:22,436
let's enjoy romantic feelings for the first time

692
00:47:22,436 --> 00:47:25,676
by doing things we can do, like this.

693
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,811
Even if you have sad memories,

694
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:32,646
if you remember romantic ones as well,

695
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,986
the sad ones will end up

696
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:40,921
being replaced by romantic ones.

697
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,351
Replacement of memories.

698
00:47:50,161 --> 00:47:51,791
Let's do that.

699
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:59,321
We can decide what we'll end up
remembering in the end.

700
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,661
It stopped raining.

701
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,951
Crunchy peaches.

702
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:23,301
Should we make peach mul kimchi with these?

703
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,571
Look. Look at this huge chicken.

704
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:28,661
That's a duck. A duck.

705
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:33,071
It's tasty, right? This is a secret spot.

706
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:44,801
If you visit the market sometimes

707
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:46,511
and look at different ingredients,

708
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,981
you get new menu ideas.

709
00:48:48,981 --> 00:48:52,211
You learn how to choose ingredients
by talking to the merchants, too.

710
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:55,841
I see. This is so fun.

711
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,361
Invite me next time, too.

712
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:59,091
Should I?

713
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,231
Okay.

714
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:06,031
Where does your family live?

715
00:49:06,031 --> 00:49:07,871
Do you know Jangsu-dong?

716
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:08,891
Yes.

717
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:11,971
They live in Olympic Apartments there.
That's where I grew up.

718
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:14,831
You lived in a nice place.

719
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,371
Hey.

720
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:25,121
See your mother today.

721
00:49:25,121 --> 00:49:28,341
I made side dishes
with the greens I got yesterday.

722
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,191
Take this with you.

723
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:35,781
No, I'm not-

724
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:41,561
People's feelings change day after day.

725
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:49,271
Because of the built-up feelings,
true feelings keep getting buried.

726
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:52,871
But that doesn't change how you really feel.

727
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:55,371
You become so wistful whenever
you talk about your mom.

728
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,681
Why do you suffer alone?

729
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:00,651
Let's go.

730
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:04,111
Okay? Go and tell her that you missed her.

731
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:11,301
Let's go.

732
00:50:47,681 --> 00:50:49,501
Long time no see.

733
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,421
Mom doesn't feel comfortable seeing you.

734
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:56,641
I told you.

735
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:58,471
That's why I came to see you.

736
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:01,201
She doesn't want to see you.

737
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,851
- Later, I'll-
- No.

738
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:06,731
I need to hear it myself today.

739
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,191
Hey.

740
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,911
You're always like this.

741
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:16,251
You do everything however you want.

742
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:18,191
You haven't changed.

743
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:21,441
Did you quit drinking?

744
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:25,521
Aren't you still drinking?

745
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:32,341
Yes, I've been well. Are you in good health?

746
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:35,891
We're still a family.

747
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,821
I thought I should ask how you are.

748
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:44,421
Your brother's been keeping me updated
about you. You don't-

749
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:48,221
Mom, I said I know.

750
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:52,501
I know I ruined both of our lives.

751
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:57,651
I'm sorry.

752
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,741
But could you forgive me now?

753
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,871
You're having a hard time, too.

754
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:05,691
You remind me of the past.

755
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:08,351
You make things even harder!

756
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:14,071
<i>Gosh.</i>

757
00:52:14,071 --> 00:52:18,431
<i>Geez. What a shitty life.</i>

758
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:23,411
<i>So what if I hurt myself? So what?</i>

759
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:42,701
I won't live for that long.

760
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:46,141
I-I want to live the rest of my life...

761
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,561
in peace.

762
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,611
Why did you come out so soon?

763
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,501
I don't think she's home.

764
00:53:35,441 --> 00:53:37,361
I see.

765
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:42,991
I'll get a coffee at a cafe nearby.

766
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:46,961
- Okay.
- I don't want to get drowsy while driving.

767
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:49,521
It might take some time. Wait for me.

768
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:52,221
- Okay. Take your time.
- Okay.

769
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:28,451
Why don't you just be honest with Tae Oh?

770
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:32,731
You know how soft-hearted he is.

771
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:37,061
If he finds out I had a stroke that day,

772
00:55:38,061 --> 00:55:41,941
he'd blame himself for the rest of his life.

773
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:47,961
- He looked well, right?
- Yes.

774
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:51,061
He looked as pure as his old self.

775
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,721
Gosh. You missed him so much.

776
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,921
You got your wish, Mom.

777
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:00,981
Mom.

778
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:06,731
Mom.

779
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:11,431
Tae Oh.

780
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:13,501
Let's go.

781
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,291
Let's go. Let's go.

782
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:20,251
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

783
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,131
You should've told me.

784
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:32,691
Mom...

785
00:56:33,931 --> 00:56:36,391
you should've told me.

786
00:56:38,101 --> 00:56:41,561
Look... Look...

787
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:44,251
Why...

788
00:56:44,251 --> 00:56:47,511
- Let's go.
- You should've told me.

789
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:53,791
Why... Mom...

790
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,051
Mom, you should've told me.

791
00:56:57,051 --> 00:57:02,211
You should've told me, Mom.

792
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:07,011
Gosh...

793
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:12,691
Mom.

794
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:17,241
Why didn't you tell me?

795
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:21,411
Mom...

796
00:57:22,561 --> 00:57:26,471
Mom. Why...

797
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:28,821
- Mom...
- It's okay, it's okay...

798
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:31,511
- If you're this sick...
- I'm okay.

799
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:34,131
I'm sorry, Mom...

800
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:38,091
Why didn't you tell me...

801
00:57:52,861 --> 00:57:56,521
<i>I'll sleep at Mom's and go back tomorrow.</i>

802
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:58,401
<i>Thank you.</i>

803
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:12,801
Huh? Why didn't you take a shower?

804
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:13,881
Where's Dr. Jung?

805
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,101
She's sleeping.

806
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:16,841
I'm tired from traveling to Seoul.

807
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:18,081
She must be tired, too.

808
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:19,921
You should still rest inside.

809
00:58:19,921 --> 00:58:23,371
I'm all done here.
I'll greet Hyo Ri and go to bed.

810
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:26,341
Why do you look so happy?

811
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:29,201
- What are you saying?
- You look happy.

812
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:30,491
Why do you look so happy?

813
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:32,911
- I'm home.
- Hey.

814
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:35,911
Did you have fun with Sook, Hyo Ri?

815
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:38,061
It was very fun.

816
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:42,901
What? Why do you look so happy, Mom?

817
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,611
Right?

818
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:45,821
That's what I'm saying.

819
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:49,761
Ma'am, did something good happen?

820
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:51,221
Yes.

821
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:56,441
Mr. Ryu Jeong Seok must be passed out by now.

822
00:58:56,441 --> 00:59:01,341
For one night and two days,
he's been swimming in my charm.

823
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:02,771
I'll stop now.

824
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,211
Did you do something to him, Mom?

825
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,691
I won't take more questions.

826
00:59:05,691 --> 00:59:07,131
Ma'am.

827
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:08,361
Hold on.

828
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:13,571
Is there a reason you specifically said,
"One night and two days"?

829
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,801
Don't go, ma'am.

830
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,721
My goodness!

831
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:32,901
So, what did you do with him?

832
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,951
I can't sleep because I'm curious.

833
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,291
Why would you be curious?

834
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,561
I'm curious. I'm curious. Tell me. Tell me.

835
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:41,201
Gosh, seriously.

836
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:47,261
First, we biked around the village once.

837
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:50,121
He said I had a girlish smile.

838
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:52,631
And we took photos outside.

839
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,521
Yes.

840
00:59:54,521 --> 01:00:01,191
And we had a beer in their garden
and spoke candidly a bit.

841
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:05,171
I drank the delicious coffee he made, too.

842
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:09,321
Hey, if I knew dating was this nice,

843
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:12,441
I would've done it sooner.

844
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:15,951
No. It's nice because I've been saving it, right?

845
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:21,431
And we told the village elders that we're dating.

846
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:24,131
And most importantly,

847
01:00:24,131 --> 01:00:29,221
I almost had a heart attack
because of him in the shade.

848
01:00:29,221 --> 01:00:31,011
He...

849
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:35,321
What? What's wrong?

850
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:36,961
I'm happy.

851
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:42,211
I'm happy that you're excited.

852
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:47,081
Gosh. I'm always excited. Why?

853
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:54,711
You know what, Mom?

854
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:59,141
We have sad memories.

855
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:05,481
If you add a romantic memory at the end of them,

856
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:08,301
those memories end up being romantic.

857
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:13,261
So, don't get hung up on sad memories.

858
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:16,821
We can keep making new memories.

859
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:22,061
Someone shared great wisdom with you.

860
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:27,411
Which reminds me...

861
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,361
When I first came to Cheonghae,

862
01:01:33,801 --> 01:01:38,091
you insisted on being by my side.

863
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:40,711
I was grateful for it.

864
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:44,001
Thanks to your decision, we get to...

865
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:49,221
build these new romantic memories.

866
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:53,931
Mom.

867
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,411
Yes.

868
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:59,871
Thank you for not giving up on me.

869
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:05,351
Gosh.

870
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:06,951
Hey.

871
01:02:06,951 --> 01:02:10,341
Why are you crying? Seriously.

872
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:15,171
You took a nice trip. Why are you crying?

873
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:18,861
Don't cry.

874
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:23,371
Why are you crying?

875
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:27,791
Only good things will happen now. Don't cry.

876
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:31,301
Don't cry.

878
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:39,441
Here's coffee.

879
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:41,071
Thank you.

880
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:42,251
You came, Director.

881
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:43,761
Good morning.

882
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,811
- Would you like some coffee?
- Iced, please.

883
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:47,831
Okay.

884
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:50,961
Mr. Ryu, it's the document from the county office.

885
01:02:50,961 --> 01:02:52,441
Okay.

886
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:59,731
Is my eyesight getting bad?

887
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:02,261
I keep thinking Bo Hyeon is a woman.

888
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:05,371
Huh?

889
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:08,451
Huh?

890
01:03:09,221 --> 01:03:12,441
Haven't you ever seen someone in a relationship?

891
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:14,281
Wow. Wow.

892
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:15,891
Courage of the dating newbie.

893
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:18,151
I respect you, Mr. Ryu.

894
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:20,161
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

895

<i>I thought I could look at the photos
when I miss you,</i>

896
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:57,361
<i>but seeing the photo makes me miss you more.</i>

897
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:59,781
<i>I'm realizing that, thanks to Lee Ji An.</i>

What are you doing?

901
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:22,681
Where are you going? Where are you going?

902
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:28,731
<i>Spring. It says it will be spring once again.</i>

903
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:33,331
<i>It tells you to feel free to have hopes
and feel warmth.</i>
