This brighter and lumpy part is the tumor.

2
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:10,008
The footage suggests it's likely a
protopathic tumor from the brain.

3
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,948
For an accurate diagnosis,

4
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:15,128
the tumor needs to be removed
through surgery for a biopsy.

5
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:20,468
I suspect it's a glioma tumor, the most
common protopathic tumor.

11
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,218
if I give treatment and diagnosis willy-nilly,

I'd be in huge trouble.

00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,328
it's customary for the Material Management Team
to check the order and the worksite

183
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,868
and I was told everything was good.

184
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,918
I see.

185
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,468
Is that so, Manager Lee?

186
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,868
Yes.

187
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,538
I increased security on the worksite, and

188
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:20,418
we installed more security
cameras inside and outside

189
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:22,698
to prevent further loss.

190
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:25,638
It's only been a month since
she came to this worksite.

191
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,708
We need to talk to the former
manager, Manager Jang...

192
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,398
so we could...

193
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,838
How interesting.

194
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,738
Are you two dating?

195
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:40,248
Why would you always defend her otherwise?

196
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:43,008
She didn't check the supply count
when she took over the job.

197
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,088
That's negligence of duty.

198
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,848
Oh, right.

199
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,138
Did you two plot and steal supplies together?

200
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:52,138
And you agreed to blame the former manager?

201
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:53,218
Did you?

202
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:58,148
Make a reasonable excuse so
I can at least pretend to listen!

203
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:00,388
Seriously! I'm so pissed.

204
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,508
Move.

205
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,108
Move it!

206
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:06,288
So annoying!

207
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,198
Geez.

208
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:17,728
Sir, Manager Lee was sent
to the worksite urgently, so-

209
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:20,088
So what?

210
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,738
What about it?

211
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,828
I'll make sure to fix the problem.

212
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:30,018
Geez, you're so pathetic.

213
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:33,618
Move! The door won't close.

214
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,198
Is it me?

215
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,688
What are you doing? Close the door.

216
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:40,068
The door is closing.

217
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,238
What a coldhearted bastard.

218
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:45,848
It's a harmful consequence
of studying abroad too young.

219
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,338
Son of a bitch.

220
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:50,298
He's a psychopath pretending to be a sociopath.

221
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,418
That was good defense.

222
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,478
Manager Jang is missing, right?

223
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,608
What do we do?

224
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,288
I asked people to look for him.

225
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:02,208
The company would understand, right?

226
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,378
P-Professor, here's the chart.

227
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:16,068
Are you nagging me right now?

228
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,188
You bastard.

229
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:25,638
You can read it to me when we're at the ward.

230
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:27,308
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,378
- Making a round?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:38,538
For Assemblyman Lee's sibling,

233
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,458
you collected the previous hospital's
medical record, right?

234
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,058
Pardon?

235
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:47,818
Well, I only collected ours.

236
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:52,128
You're slow, dumb, can't read the
air, and have poor instincts.

237
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,878
Wow, Myeong Su,

238
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:57,058
if you insist on your own way of doing things,

239
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:00,098
- you should've gone to a seminary.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:03,258
Why do you tire innocent people around you?

241
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,888
You and the other students...

242
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,308
Huh?

243
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,708
You were still here.

244
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,958
There are always a few each year.

245
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,538
The ones who faint in the OR.

246
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:17,258
Let's be honest.

247
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:20,858
If you can't even handle that,
you should quit being a doctor.

248
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:24,558
So, would you be able to even hold a scalpel?

249
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:29,258
Why does a girl look like this?

250
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:31,808
You lack skills, and you can't even put on makeup.

251
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:34,458
That's enough.

252
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:39,358
Next time, leave the OR later than the patient.

253
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:41,048
Promise.

254
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,168
Promise me.

255
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,148
Forget about finishing it off nicely.

256
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:55,568
Bravo.

257
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:59,158
At the team dinner, Professor Hwang
from the anesthesiology

258
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:02,158
said you'd win the Nobel Prize if you were as good

259
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:04,818
a surgeon as you are at bullying the students.

260
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:07,368
No. He said, "Can he not focus on

261
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,168
surgery since he wastes energy

262
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,688
on bullying students before the surgery?"

263
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:15,178
And he burst out laughing so everyone
in the restaurant could hear.

264
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:19,128
But I don't think so.

265
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,578
Professor Kim,

266
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,318
you're a true teacher who by means of

267
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,058
using unreasonable and inhumane authority,

268
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:30,818
you constantly cause students to ask themselves

269
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:34,728
"Why am I trying to become a doctor?"

270
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:39,458
Please continue to maintain this vibe and...

271
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:43,798
Fighting.

272
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,098
Let go.

273
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:51,838
Go.

274
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,297
Come up later.

275
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,058
I have to go up, too.

276
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,248
[You can do it. You have to do it]

277
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,278
[My health comes first...]

278
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,238
[Study like a dog and make rounds proudly]

279
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,408
[Lee Hyo Ri]

280
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:37,858
Where are you?

281
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,488
It cured well.

282
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,238
Yes, it cracked less. It turned out well.

283
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,098
Yes, spray more water on it.

284
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:45,278
Okay.

285
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,698
I don't have to worry about
your worksite, Chief An.

286
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:50,548
Don't flatter me.

287
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,868
Oh, right. What happened
to the missing supplies case?

288
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:55,208
I'm upset about it.

289
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,328
It was that bastard Manager Jang, obviously.

290
00:18:57,328 --> 00:19:00,088
Why would he disappear if he's innocent?

291
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:01,508
That's what I'm saying.

292
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,638
You can just tell by looking into his eyes.

293
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,018
That's what I'm saying.

294
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,608
I didn't like his eyes.

295
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:12,388
He acted like a boss when he came to eat, too.

296
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,228
The special meal is ready, right?

297
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:15,958
Everyone's tired after pouring concrete.

298
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,428
I talked to Deputy Kim from the HQ

299
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:21,778
and put abalone in the chicken soup.

300
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,238
I love it.

301
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,518
You love me that much?

302
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,578
- No, the chicken soup and abalone.
- Just fess up your love.

303
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:29,178
Don't be like this.

304
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,208
Yes, General Manager.

305
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,248
Audit Team?

306
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,858
But why me...

307
00:19:36,858 --> 00:19:40,638
Okay. Got it. Call me.

308
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,258
What did he say?

309
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,488
The Audit Team is handling the case now.

310
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:49,028
I'll count on you and do this job, Chief An.

311
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:51,888
I'll go to the plan site. Talk to you later.

312
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,898
Okay, bye.

313
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,368
Hey!

314
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:59,088
Look how rude you are.

315
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:09,188
Don't act like you're my friend.

316
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:27,458
Yes, hello?

317
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,218
Hi, I'm a medical student, Lee Hyo Ri's mom.

318
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:32,998
I had a question.

319
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,328
When is the second-semester tuition due?

320
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,458
Pardon?

321
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,568
No, there must be a mistake.

322
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:48,428
Lee Hyo Ri, third year in medical
school. Lee Hyo Ri.

323
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:54,018
That can't be.

324
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:56,838
Could you check one more time?

325
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,888
She submitted a dropout request? That can't be.

326
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:06,138
[Mom]

327
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,448
Answer it.

328
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,188
Hello?

329
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,678
You, shit. You...

330
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,858
I just called your school.

331
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:26,568
- Where are you right now?
- I said I was leaving.

332
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,138
Hey! Your school said you...

333
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:32,248
submitted a dropout request.
It's a system error, right?

334
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,538
I dropped out.

335
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:35,598
I told you from the get-go that
med school's not for me.

336
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,428
I went all this time as you wished.

337
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,718
So, I want to stop now.

338
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:40,348
Hey, Lee Hyo Ri!

339
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:41,578
I ran away from home. Don't look for me.

340
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:42,998
I won't pick up, either. So, don't call me.

341
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:44,608
Hey, Lee Hyo-

342
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:46,758
[Block]

343
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:48,558
This girl...

344
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:58,698
What's wrong with this?

345
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,628
Did you finally drop out?

346
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,298
Yes, aren't you proud of me?

347
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,678
I guess your mother had no clue.

348
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,768
Well, let's just leave it at that.

349
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:19,578
- You just said you ran away from home.
- Yeah?

350
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:23,008
Did you mean you're on an outing? Or...

351
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,938
a runaway or something like that?

352
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:26,848
I'm a runaway.

353
00:22:28,058 --> 00:22:30,458
So, I'm sort of an accomplice

354
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,288
- in your runaway plan?
- That's right.

355
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:38,318
Then, I'm one of your mom's targets now, right?

356
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,598
Geez, this is nuts!

357
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:44,998
It's your mom.

358
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:47,598
Block her number for your mental health.

359
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:49,714
You know how she nags nonstop.

360
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:50,808
Of course, I do.

361
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:53,358
She caught us when we went

and Bo Hyeon will get the part and fix it.

I asked you not to call me Hyung, didn't I?

651
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,998
And my front yard isn't a public parking lot.

652

from strangers, either.

Well, it's everywhere.

All empty fields are basically
public parking lots.

657
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:13,418
But since we're in the countryside,

658
00:40:13,418 --> 00:40:17,118
the empty fields get filled
with stray dogs at night.

00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:11,708
A life that was going well?

717
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,028
What kind of life is that, exactly?

718
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:16,888
I told you from the get-go that
med school's not for me.

719
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:20,058
Do you know how I've managed to last there?

720
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:24,348
What's with you? W-What's wrong?

721
00:44:24,348 --> 00:44:26,858
They can't move because the camper broke down.

722
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:30,458
Auntie Seon Yeong, go back with Sook.

723
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,648
I need to tell Mom something.

724
00:44:34,268 --> 00:44:37,208
I'm sorry, Sook. I'll call you later.

725
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:45,658
Hey, I've never seen Hyo Ri like that.

726
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:49,278
- Comfort her and come back together.
- Okay.

727
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:51,738
- Let's go, Sook.
- Okay.

728
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:12,642
You said you had something
to say. What are you doing?

729
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:14,227
Make it quick so we leave before the sun sets.

730
00:45:14,227 --> 00:45:16,257
What's this about?

731
00:45:22,498 --> 00:45:24,468
I have a brain tumor.

732
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:27,718
What?

733
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:31,278
I have a brain tumor.

734
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,088
Geez, you brat. You little.

735
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:38,448
You can't say stuff like that.
How could you say that?

736
00:45:54,578 --> 00:45:56,148
Hey...

737
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:01,158
Is it true?

738
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,748
Huh?

739
00:46:02,748 --> 00:46:04,198
Is it true?

740
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,908
When did you find out?

741
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:13,858
Which hospital?

742
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,228
Huh?

743
00:46:19,388 --> 00:46:22,078
Let's go together. Right now...

744
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:24,928
Let's... let's go now...

745
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:28,048
There must be a bus.

746
00:46:33,148 --> 00:46:37,968
It's okay. With medical breakthroughs
these days, all that's...

747
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:43,448
Let's see. Let's take a taxi to the bus terminal.

748
00:46:43,448 --> 00:46:45,348
Where are we, by the way?

749
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:46,788
Hold on...

750
00:47:17,718 --> 00:47:22,538
This brighter and lumpy part is the tumor.

751
00:47:22,538 --> 00:47:27,208
The footage suggests it's likely a
protopathic tumor from the brain.

752
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,158
For an accurate diagnosis,

753
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:33,988
the tumor needs to be removed
through surgery for a biopsy.

754
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:56,178
Is that why you ran away?

755
00:47:57,228 --> 00:47:58,548
Hey,

756
00:47:58,548 --> 00:48:01,318
you need to be alert and try your best to live.

757
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:03,798
I've been living like that all along.

758
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,308
I've been trying desperately
and tenaciously all my life.

759
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:09,028
But I don't want to.

760
00:48:09,778 --> 00:48:12,038
I don't want to live tenaciously anymore.

761
00:48:12,038 --> 00:48:14,298
What difference does it make?

762
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:18,558
Will my illness go away? No.

763
00:48:20,058 --> 00:48:24,358
I'll just live a boring life and die.

764
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:28,618
Who says you can die?

765
00:48:30,008 --> 00:48:33,058
Don't worry about anything. I'll try to...

766
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:36,058
Why don't we go to different hospitals and-

767
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:38,268
I've already been to them.

768
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:44,898
Just leave me alone.

769
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:47,518
Don't try to do anything.

770
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:49,798
Just...

771
00:48:54,638 --> 00:48:56,998
I need some time alone.

772
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,068
I'll stay in Cheonghae for now

773
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:02,908
and go back to Seoul once I get sorted out.

774
00:49:03,758 --> 00:49:06,858

- Please.

[2:55 a.m. May 28th, Wednesday]

778
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:10,758
I don't want to live tenaciously anymore.

779

What difference does it make?

00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:14,618
I'll just live...

Who says you can?

783
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,338
Hello?

784
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,438
Will you live your life like this?

785
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:23,858
Hello? Who's this?

786
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,708
Yes, Ji An.

787
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,178
Hey, what time is it?

788
00:52:33,428 --> 00:52:34,478
Are you crazy?

789
00:52:34,478 --> 00:52:38,288
Is there a time difference
between Cheonghae and Seoul?

790
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:39,718
It's 5 a.m.!

791
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:42,268
I'm in Seoul, okay? I'm not in Cheonghae.

792
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,948
- What will you do with yeolmu?
- What? Who?

793
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,058
Who's Yeolmu?

794
00:52:46,058 --> 00:52:48,088
- Yeolmu kimchi.
- Yeolmu kimchi?

795
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:50,099
Keep making it for me if you are going to.

796
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:51,934
You should've never given it to me
if you were going to stop.

797
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:54,964
Why do you tease me by being inconsistent?

798
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,108
Hey.

799
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:03,148
Hello? Are you sick?

800
00:53:03,148 --> 00:53:04,458
Are you crazy?

801
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,848
Hey,

802
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,898
what's the matter?

803
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,008
Are you ignoring me?

804
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:12,448
I'm not sick, you bitch.

805
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:16,988
Hello? What?

806
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,578
Is she crazy?

807
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:22,548
Why am I a bitch?

808
00:53:38,058 --> 00:53:39,988
Who's dying?

809
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:42,968
Who says?

810
00:54:10,268 --> 00:54:11,678
Hey.

811
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,858
Hey. What's with you?

812
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:16,758
What do you mean?

813
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:20,528
Hey, are you really sick or something?

814
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,778
Huh? Ji An.

815
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:24,568
It's not me.

816
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:26,558
Hyo Ri is sick.

817
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:28,868
She's sick, but I didn't know.

818
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:34,168
Hey, what are you talking about?

819
00:54:34,168 --> 00:54:37,088
Why is she sick? How?

820
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:39,178
She has a brain tumor.

821
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,178
Brain...

822
00:54:47,848 --> 00:54:50,548
- Brain tumor?
- Yes.

823
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:52,788
But I didn't know.

824
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:56,118
She went to a hospital on her own.

825
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:03,378
I took for granted that I'd die before her.

826
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:07,448
Why can't I take normal things for granted

827
00:55:07,448 --> 00:55:09,558
like everyone else?

828
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,638
But she'll be okay once she gets treated.

829
00:55:46,488 --> 00:55:48,458
What's going on?

830
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:53,308
Why Hyo Ri?

831
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:58,568
Why Hyo Ri?

832
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:04,438
Why Hyo Ri?

833
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:20,538
Why Hyo Ri? Why Hyo Ri?

834
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:31,908
Gosh, what would our Hyo Ri do?

835
00:56:59,788 --> 00:57:03,518
There comes a moment when
it becomes scary to even cry.

836
00:57:05,498 --> 00:57:08,338
Because if I get caught being scared,

837
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,668
what I fear might actually happen to me.

838
00:57:15,328 --> 00:57:17,648
If I don't cry,

839
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:21,078
it might end up being a temporary worry

840
00:57:21,078 --> 00:57:25,118
and pass as if it were nothing.

841
00:57:32,388 --> 00:57:35,218
As long as I don't get caught being scared.

842
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,398
As long as I don't cry.
