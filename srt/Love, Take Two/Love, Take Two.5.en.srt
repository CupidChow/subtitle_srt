1
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,810
[1995]
Yeah.

2
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,260
Yeah.

3
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,930
I'm home!

4
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,540
Did you bring something tasty?

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,000
No. It's something better than that.

6
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,510
Ta-da.

7
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,500
Isn't it so stylish?

8
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,940
Isn't it cool?

9
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,770
It's so pretty.

10
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,200
I bought it at a department store at a sale.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,390
Here. Don't I look like a French actress?

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Dad told you to be just pretty like a flower.

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,560
Don't spend money.

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,000
You think flowers only need water?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,300
They become more fragrant with the sun and wind.

16
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,390
If I become a famous actress someday,

17
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,770
I'll be traveling often for shoots.

18
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,610
I invested in myself in advance.

19
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,970
Mom,

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,300
let's beg Dad and...

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,140
go on a trip.

22
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,470
Should we suggest going to Onyang Hot Springs?

23
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,400
If I carry this suitcase,

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,910
they'll think we're traveling abroad.

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,060
Wasn't it a good purchase?

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,160
- It is.
- Of course, it is.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,030
Let's go. Let's go.

28
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,800
I took too long, didn't I?

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,400
My daughter, have you been waiting for me?

30
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,920
[Episode 5. My Love from the Sad Star]

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,950
I know this lady.

32
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,720
I've met her before.

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,120
Where?

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,000
She's from this neighborhood, then.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Are you angry that I took too long?

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,170
And you pretend not to know me?

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,490
My mom died more than 20 years ago.

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,260
Grandma, you're mistaken.

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,420
She's not your daughter.

40
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,720
You know nothing. Don't meddle.

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,600
She's my friend.

42
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,030
What's this about?

43
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,740
Well...

44
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,500
Gosh. Hello, ma'am.

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,000
She lives in that mansion in the forest.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,700
- I see.
- Do you remember me, ma'am?

47
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,580
About two years ago,

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,580
you and your husband were leaving the beach

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,500
and we gave you a ride on our tractor.

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,390
You were too afraid to ride the tractor,

51
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,580
but your husband said, "I'm your seatbelt."

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,450
He held you tightly the whole time.

53
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,770
Don't you remember?

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,270
My husband is dead.

55
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,160
Aigoo.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,700
I heard you scared wild dogs away.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,510
They're basically like thugs.

58
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,600
They go around in packs.

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
I gave them sausages.

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,130
Good job. Good job.

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,900
Ma'am, let's go home now.

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,370
Yes. We'll take you back home.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,500
- This is her suitcase, right?
- Yes.

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,210
- You carry it.
- Okay, okay.

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,760
Let's go.

66
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,180
Let's go.

67
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,280
Hello?

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,980
<i>Is this Ms. Lee Ji An?</i>

69
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,740
Yes.

70
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,280
<i>This is Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.</i>

71
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,580
<i>You know Ms. Hwang Hyeon Sun, right?</i>

72
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,110
<i>Hello?</i>

73
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,380
Why do you ask?

74
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,000
<i>You're her daughter, right?</i>

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,400
<i>Well, she passed away in Vietnam.</i>

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,560
<i>- So, I'm contacting her family-</i>
- I don't know her.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,950
<i>Pardon?</i>

78
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,460
I said I don't know her.

79
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,720
Why are you out so early?

80
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,370
I didn't know the colors were
so pretty in the early morning.

81
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,440
It beats the evening sunset.

82
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,230
There's a morning smell, too.

83
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,930
It smells like land and sky touching.

84
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,080
That's the luxury of living in the forest.

85
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,430
You're lucky to have a mom like me.

86
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,720
Why did you get up so early, Mom?

87
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,500
Did you not sleep well because of that lady?

88
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,970
No. I don't worry about stuff like that.

89
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,740
Of course, you shouldn't.

90
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,000
All sorts of things happen in life.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,140
- Did you sleep well?
- Auntie.

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
Seeing you makes me hungry.

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,180
You're hungry?

94
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,200
I should show off my skills, then.

95
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Stretch, stretch. Let me rest a bit first.

96
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,740
I love you, Hyo Ri.

97
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,060
Me, too.

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,600
Gosh, you sweetie.

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,300
Did you sleep well, Hyo Ri?

100
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,150
I'll give you some beef.

101
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,460
Taste it.

102
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,590
What do you think?

103
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
It tastes just like short ribs.

104
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,690
Really? It's too soon to be impressed.

105
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,750
I'll work my magic now.

106
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,600
Where's soy sauce?

107
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,650
Yes.

108
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,870
Let's add some.

109
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,360
Here I come. Okay. Come, come.

110
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,100
No one can say no to this.

111
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
- Here it is.
- Open it.

112
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,590
Open it. Open it.

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
- Let's eat.
- Try it.

114
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,530
- What should I start with?
- Let me try it.

115
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,870
It looks so tasty.

116
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,590
Try it. Try it. What do you think?

117
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,410
What do you think?

118
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,760
Tell me.

119
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,850
You can be my mom.

120
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,090
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,140
- Be my husband.
- Should I?

122
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,390
I'm not that easy.

123
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,430
Is it delicious?

124
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,500
It's great.

125
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,000
Did I make this?

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,670
- It's so good.
- So good.

127
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,730
It's missing something.

128
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,660
- Is it?
- It's tasty.

129
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,100
- Just one second.
- What's missing?

130
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Hey, where are you going? What's missing?

131
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,600
It's so pretty.

132
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,590
- Wow.
- Nature is the greatest masterpiece.

133
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,590
"Nature is a masterpiece"?

134
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,920
We have the name of the shop.
"Nature is a Masterpiece."

135
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,510
Hey.

136
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,750
It suits the environment perfectly.

137
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,600
Nature is a Masterpiece.

138
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,890
Yes.

139
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,770
It suits you, too. It's perfect.

140
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,590
Does it suit me?

141
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,320
My body is a sujak*, right?
(Means "masterpiece")

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Sujakjil*. Make a pass and you fall for him.
(Means "make a pass")

143
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,060
Hey.

144
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,460
Don't be rude to Unni.

145
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,930
Making a pass isn't a bad thing.

146
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,820
You look a bit old,

147
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,980
but only healthy single women can make a pass.

148
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,600
Who else?

149
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,170
Don't say I look old.

150
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,970
Do you want me to...

151
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,680
- teach you a thing or two?
- You look older than your age.

152
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,490
Lee Ji An, should I teach you a lesson?

153
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,920
Should I? Use your muscles.

154
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,950
Come on!

155
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,850
Where did the old lady go?

156
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,580
Shouldn't we fix up the shop's garden?

157
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,020
- I already asked Bo Hyeon.
- Really?

158
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,170
He did landscaping for Oppa's office building, too.

159
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,560
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,490
He looks too studious.

161
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,790
Do you think he could work in the field?

162
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,170
I'm not sure.

163
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,000
He's not studious-looking.
He's reasonable and efficient.

164
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,070
What's his MBTI?

165
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,200
He's obviously ENFJ.

166
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,700
What's his blood type?

167
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,190
Type O, probably. He's positive.

168
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,450
- What's his favorite color?
- White.

169
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,230
He only wears white.

170
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,960
You know everything about him.

171
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,110
You sound like Wikipedia.

172
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,700
I can just tell because I'm smart.

173
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,800
Okay. You have a job since you're so smart.

174
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,220
Friends can talk about anything, right?

175
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,750
Anything?

176
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,500
Like what?

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,100
- Friend discount.
- Dream on.

178
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,690
Why? You can bring it up naturally.

179
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,510
It's hard to say no, too.

180
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,150
He might give you a neighbor discount, but-

181
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,100
- What?
- Watch what you say.

182
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Don't say that. Friend discount?
You're putting him on the spot.

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,590
Pretend you didn't hear it, Bo Hyeon.
What's with her?

184
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,500
Of course, I can offer it.

185
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
But it's farming season now.
So, we're short-handed.

186
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,400
Don't worry about that. She has two hands.

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
I won't go easy on you or anything.

188
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,790
Want to start now?

189
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,400
Yes. We need to pick something up.
You two go ahead.

190
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,990
- Thank you.
- Sure.

191
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Are you that happy? Look at her smile.

192
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,630
She must be so happy.

193
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,290
Walking so peppy.

194
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,510
Are you that happy, Hyo Ri?

195
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,220
Look at her. She's dancing.

196
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,680
It might not look like much,

197
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,250
but tilling the land is the most important part.

198
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,640
We're pretty much ready here.

199
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,700
Let's put down fertilizer and

200
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,970
plant a few veggies and edible flowers like

201
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,400
nasturtium, violet, and cornflower.

202
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,270
Okay. Got it, but...

203
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,730
this is...

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
It's...

205
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,370
Seriously.

206
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,610
Look.

207
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,090
Farming isn't just about using force.

208
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,840
Don't just use force.

209
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,040
Dig around the root with a hand plow

210
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,800
and pull out like this... Hold on.

211
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,970
- Use both hands.
- Okay.

212
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,020
Hold on. This is strange.

213
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,500
Move.

214
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,840
- Let's do it together.
- Together?

215
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,300
I'll make sure to pull this out today.

216
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,070
Let's go.

217
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,400
One. One.

218
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,740
- One.
- One.

219
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,090
Two. Three.

220
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,700
Hey.

221
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,300
I said I'd pull it out, didn't I?

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,770
Wow. I'm a weeding expert starting today.

223
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
I'll weed this entire place today.

224
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,100
I'll turn this place upside down.

225
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,000
Dig with a hand plow...

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,820
Easy.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,460
Why are you smiling?

228
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,800
Me?

229
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,460
I wasn't. I just have a smiley face.

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,050
I'm seeing Tae Oh later.

231
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,100
Let's call it a day.

232
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm on a roll. I'll do a little more.

233
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,290
You go ahead.

234
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,240
One more.

235
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,400
Okay...

236
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,980
Crazy. I'm crazy.

237
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,320
Definitely crazy.

238
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,820
If we make this smaller,

239
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,360
we can have some parking space.

240
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,640
Or tilt it a bit to make space.

241
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,510
Okay.

242
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,300
- Fix it.
- Pardon?

243
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,630
Me?

244
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm busy with the Forestry Committee project, too.

245
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,500
I need to check all those documents
for the welfare center.

246
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,080
Who's busier? Me or you?

247
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,420
Yes, sir.

248
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,680
- Mr. Ryu.
- Yes.

249
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,760
Here is the invoice for the forest restaurant.

250
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,030
Leave it here.

251
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,970
After I get off-

252
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,710
It's lunchtime.

253
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,920
I have time. I'll go.

254
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,310
I thought he was busy.

255
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,700
Hey, your oppa must have something exciting today.

256
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,650
But he's headed toward our shop.

257
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,110
Why is he going there?

258
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,580
He's too fast.

259
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,810
Hello.

260
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,860
Hey, Hyo Ri.

261
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,300
Oppa.

262
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
What is it? Is something going on?

263
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
You were in such a hurry.

264
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,230
We came because we were worried.

265
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,700
Well, I wanted to give you something.

266
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,000
- What?
- What is it?

267
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,580
Isn't it a love letter? A love letter?

268
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,110
- A love letter?
- Come on.

269
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,770
I can tell.

270
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,520
Geez, I knew it.
[Invoice for Architectural Services]

271
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,300
Are you that excited to get paid?

272
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,040
It's exciting. It's exciting.

273
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,910
Woohoo!

274
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,380
Have lunch since you're here.
It's lunchtime, right?

275
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,800
Yes, lunchtime.

276
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,130
You must love money.

277
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,630
A little.

278
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,650
Everything's good, right?

279
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,700
It's delicious.

280
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,200
You eat well. Here's the abalone.

281
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,650
Do you like meat or veggies?

282
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
- I like meat and veggies.
- Together?

283
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,860
You're so much fun.

284
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,390
I crack up whenever you talk.

285
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,260
Okay. Let's get to business now.

286
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,580
Okay.

287
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,270
I need to pay in this order, right?

288
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,720
Yes.

289
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,160
Is she a guest?

290
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,280
You used to beg me to come.

291
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,870
How could you treat me like this now?

292
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,660
Why do you make your mom
come down out of hunger?

293
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,070
M-Mom?

294
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,250
No, no. Pay no attention. She's a bit ill.

295
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,990
The payment dates are here.

296
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,760
I just need to check the amounts.

297
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,340
It's a bit more than I expected.

298
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,400
The numbers don't add up.

299
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,370
Try adding these two. It's incorrect.

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,900
Huh? It really is incorrect.

301
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,150
I told you to be thorough.

302
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,860
You need to care for yourself without me.

303
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,790
Grandma.

304
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,490
Grandma, have you eaten?

305
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,900
Yes, well...

306
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,000
Would you like to eat something? Lunch.

307
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,630
<i>You know I can't come.</i>

308
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,420
<i>Why would you tell me that?</i>

309
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,970
The school needs parental consent.

310
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,030
<i>You can just sign it and hand it in.</i>

311
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,900
<i>Are you doing this to make me feel guilty?</i>

312
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,500
<i>Take care of yourself smartly
based on the situation.</i>

313
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,400
<i>- How frustrating.</i>
- Just die.

314
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
I won't have to make a call like this
if you didn't exist.

315
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,780
Just die, I said!

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,800
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

317
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,100
Should we discuss money to refresh the mood?

318
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,500
I'd be happy to discuss money with you.

319
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,070
Well, there was one article missing.

320
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,830
I see. One was missing.

321
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,300
Will it change the total?

322
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,690
No, no, no, let's just leave it at that.

323
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,800
Really?

324
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,610
Forget about it.

325
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,570
Thank you.

326
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,500
How nice. It's so airy.

327
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
- Isn't it great?
- So refreshing.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,950
Hyo Ri, go home and bring me an egg.

329
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,500
Okay.

330
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,510
Move, move, move!

331
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,890
Gosh. Ji An!

332
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,250
<i>Fire!</i>

333
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,310
Fire.

334
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,640
- Fire extinguisher!
- Get out of the way!

335
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,150
Gosh, wait.

336
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,670
How scary...

337
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,690
Oh, no. Looks like she's in shock.

338
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,340
My goodness.

339
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,190
Are you okay?

340
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,200
Yeah.

341
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,660
- Did you get hurt, Oppa?
- No...

342
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm okay.

343
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,960
I got injured here, daughter.

344
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,020
How am I your daughter?

345
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,350
I tolerated you since you're sick.

346
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,200
But I can't take it anymore.

347
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Give me the number of
your daughter, son, or anyone.

348
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,180
I'll call the police otherwise.

349
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,400
Stop. You're scaring her.

350
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,740
Stop? She needs to compensate for the damage.

351
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
Mom.

352
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,150
Why are you so angry at me?

353
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,800
Is it because I came too late?

354
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,020
My mom died!

355
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,260
To seek happiness,

356
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,540
she left with a man, leaving me behind

357
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,930
and died in an accident.

358
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,100
I hate to even think about it.

359
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,800
It's painful enough that you're reminding me of it.

360
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
So, stop saying I'm your daughter.

361
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,880
I can't take it anymore.

362
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,750
You know she's ill. Why would you berate her?

363
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,400
Keep it together.

364
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,500
You know nothing. Don't tell me that.

365
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,980
Do you know how I endured that time?

366
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Why should I keep it together?

367
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,400
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

368
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Fine. Do as you wish.

369
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,270
Come on.

370
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,970
I'll drive her back home.

371
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,820
Come with me, ma'am.

372
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,450
What are you doing in front of my house?

373
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,560
What the hell are you doing?

374
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,580
Why cause a scene in front of my house?

375
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,060
How ridiculous.

376
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,410
Go home and get to bed if you drank.

377
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,990
Why are you lying on the streets?

378
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,160
Did you buy me a drink?

379
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,260
Huh?

380
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,200
Don't you know who I am?

381
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm an actress! An actress!

382
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,350
Give me a break. How ridiculous.

383
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,040
Was she in a TV drama as a passerby

384
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,190
- for 2 seconds?
- Yes.

385
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,100
How many years did you milk that?

386
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
Gosh.

387
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,520
Let's go.

388
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,740
My daughter's here.

389
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,630
My pretty daughter.

390
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,820
It's because I'm upset.

391
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,930
I'm upset.

392
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,340
Why am I living like this?

393
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,710
I shouldn't be living like this.

394
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:36,320
I shouldn't be here like this!

395
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,040
It's so unfair...

396
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,670
What's going on?

397
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,840
Let go.

398
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,680
It's so unfair.

399
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,550
That kid doesn't deserve this.

400
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,740
Her dad cherished her and

401
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,000
raised her with all his devotion.

402
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,010
Hey.

403
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,890
Well...

404
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,580
I won't tell anyone.

405
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,270
Don't worry.

406
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,840
Yes, Mr. Kim.

407
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,780
This is Ryu Jeong Seok.

408
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,820
I have a favor to ask you.

409
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,990
I should test anaphalis and anemone.

410
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,220
I can test them on lines one and two, right?

411
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,020
Huh? What?

412
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,450
What is it?

413
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,780
What do you mean?

414
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,510
This is no good. Let's stop and go there.

415
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,140
I'm not going. I'm not in the mood today.

416
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,870
- No whining. Let's go.
- No, I'm not going.

417
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,330
- Listen to your boss. Let's go.
- I'll work hard, boss.

418
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,320
- I won't be distracted.
- Let's go. Let's go.

419
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,470
You go on your own.

420
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,630
I'm not going anywhere.
We come as a set. Let's go together.

421
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,080
Let's go. Let's go.

422
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,670
Where are you going?

423
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,120
I definitely want to go, too.

424
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,560
There was a fire?

425
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,100
Knowing your mother, she must've been furious.

426
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,090
Yes. I witnessed her fury and rage.

427
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,520
So, did you have a fight with her again?

428
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,600
Wow. How could you fight endlessly?

429
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,820
You have so much energy...

430
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Are you angry that your mom was mean to the lady?

431
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,780
Hyo Ri seems very angry, right?

432
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,840
Don't you know her?

433
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,940
She's not angry.

434
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,630
It's because she feels bad.

435
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,260
She feels bad for the sick old lady

436
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,070
and she feels even worse for you.

437
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,320
That's why, probably.

438
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,000
<i>I'm not angry. I just feel bad.</i>

439
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,460
Since I didn't know how to express that,

440
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,500
I just let it out.

441
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,670
<i>My mom died!</i>

442
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,880
<i>I saw the way she was looking at the lady.</i>

443
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,770
<i>She left with a man, leaving me behind...</i>

444
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,300
<i>Her mom brings my mom...</i>

445
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,200
<i>that much stress and pain.</i>

446
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,190
I could totally feel that pain.

447
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,370
That's why I felt bad.

448
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,500
Once you start not getting along with your mom,

449
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,630
it's hopeless.

450
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,410
Today is my mom's birthday.

451
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,600
I got a call from my older brother this morning.

452
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,100
He said he called just in case I came by.

453
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,810
Mom didn't want me to.

454
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,370
Where should I begin?

455
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,520
I used to play baseball.

456
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,500
When I used to...

457
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,540
be successful as a baseball player,

458
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,700
I got into a huge motorcycle
accident and couldn't play anymore.

459
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,550
After that, I became a total mess and a loser

460
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,360
and upset my mom.

461
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,700
Since then, Mom refuses to see me.

462
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,950
She gave up on me.

463
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,580
So, did you give up on her, too?

464
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,760
One thing I learned from my mom is that

465
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,970
if one of the two doesn't give up,

466
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,500
a family can never cut ties.

467
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,900
That's why I'm curious if you
gave up on your mom, too.

468
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,320
My head... Bo Hyeon, oh, no...

469
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,050
I used my brain too much today.

470
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,400
Well, I will contemplate for a while

471
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,200
and think about the answer to your question. Bye.

472
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,930
Don't sleep.

473
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,170
How could I sleep right now?

474
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,050
Have a good time.

475
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,550
<i>Stop saying I'm your daughter.</i>

476
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,800
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

477
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,330
It really must be my time to go.

478
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,480
[Professor Kim Ju Hong]

479
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,270
Yes, Professor Kim.

480
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,910
Of course, I remember.

481
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,310
Yeah...

482
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,100
I can go on my own. Don't worry.

483
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,800
Okay. See you tomorrow.

484
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,590
- Be careful.
- Okay.

485
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,900
- Come this way.
- Okay.

486
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,800
Hello.

487
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,100
- What's the problem area?
- Have a look here.

488
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,400
The valve is here. Please check.

489
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,820
Let's see.

490
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,470
It's the range valve issue.

491
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,640
Since you turned it on while it was loose,

492
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
a flame suddenly erupted here.

493
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,200
You should just replace the equipment.

494
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm glad you noticed it before you opened.

495
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
Hey, what a relief it didn't happen
in front of customers.

496
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,080
Might as well check the gas pipe back there, too.

497
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,310
Gosh, okay.

498
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,590
Today was my day off.

499
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,470
Mr. Ryu came to my office

500
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,280
and kept insisting that I have to come.

501
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,100
- So, I made an exception.
- Thank you.

502
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,520
Let's go.

503
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,570
A blessing in disguise, they say.

504
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,310
Life has its ups and downs.

505
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,050
Gosh, it's too bad.

506
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,830
The technician left. Everything else is fine.

507
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,080
You don't have to worry.

508
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,340
- Okay.
- Geez.

509
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,040
Mr. Ryu never contacts me.

510
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,600
But he suddenly reached out,
saying it was an emergency.

511
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,280
I was so scared for a moment.

512
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,670
I know.

513
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,600
This isn't a big deal at all.

514
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,200
But if Mr. Ryu calls me...

515
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,220
Geez. He never plays along.

516
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,360
Will it cost you anything?

517
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,200
Well, once Bo Hyeon starts settling down,

518
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,270
you should...

519
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,540
consider joining a temple.

520
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,370
It'd improve your personality

521
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,500
and the rest of us won't be so traumatized.

522
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,620
It sounds like a good plan in many ways.

523
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,310
As I always say, I can take care-

524
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,490
Gosh.

525
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,760
Wipe all corners thoroughly. Right here.

526
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,380
Geez.

527
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,650
Does my face make people nag?

528
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,760
It kind of does.

529
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,900
They always nag when they see me.

530
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,810
Why can't you be more thorough?

531
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,100
Hyung will sleep for two nights if we leave him.

532
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,870
Your mom would be worried. You should...

533
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,830
call her in advance.

534
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,410
Are you scared?

535
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,620
I'm not.

536
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,580
Public display of affection is legally a crime.

537
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,810
You and Ahjumma.

538
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,760
Stop showing off your affection.

539
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,220
You're making a person without a mom sad.

540
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,200
Well,

541
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,320
is your mother...

542
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,230
She's in Germany.

543
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,360
Go back on your own.

544
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,850
I need to go somewhere because
of you and Ahjumma.

545
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,540
Because of us?

546
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,040
Where?

547
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,600
Thank you for taking the time to help us.

548
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,370
You went through a lot.

549
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,010
We'll treat you properly to celebrate the opening.

550
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,400
Don't worry about the fire too much.

551
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,740
According to the village tradition,

552
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,450
if you have a fire at your home,

553
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,110
- something good happens immediately.
- Really?

554
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,150
The rice shop owner had a fire last winter

555
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,520
- and hit the jackpot.
- Did his business hit it off?

556
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,260
He got remarried.

557
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,380
To someone 12 years younger!

558
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,440
I've never felt jealous.

559
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,800
Anyway, your daughter is so
smart and looks just like you.

560
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,740
You look like twins from a distance.

561
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,510
- That much?
- Yes.

562
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,700
- I'm a little better looking, right?
- Sure.

563
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,300
She has a good personality, unlike her mom.

564
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,400
- She's a sweetheart.
- Shut your mouth.

565
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

566
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,360
Let's cut the nonsense and get some rest.

567
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,700
- Take care.
- See you.

568
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,040
Bye.

569
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,410
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

570
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,490
Why bring that up?

571
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,910
- Being too honest is my problem.
- Geez.

572
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,560
Why isn't Hyo Ri coming? She must be hungry.

573
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,980
She's not a kid. She can eat on her own.

574
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,370
She probably didn't take her medicine.

575
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,400
She needs to take it on time.

576
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm sure she took that, too.

577
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
There are wild dogs in our village.

578
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,650
What if she runs into one?

579
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,480
I hope she runs away.

580
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,980
What if she tries to fight it?

581
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,220
Just have a funeral already.

582
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,890
I got too imaginative, didn't I?

583
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,700
Try calling her, at least.

584
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,260
- I don't want to.
- Seriously.

585
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,400
You two are making me old.

586
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Whatever. I'll go inside. Wait for her
to come back, okay?

587
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,100
I don't want to.

588
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,400
By the way, that Ahjussi...

589
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,200
Why can't he bring himself to go home?

590
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,560
I'm leaving.

591
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,770
I don't know where we're going,

592
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,220
but the route isn't so pleasant.

593
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,540
So, why did you follow me?

594
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,200
- I-I think it's a boar over there.
- A boar?

595
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,510
- Hey.
- It's a tree.

596
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,990
No.

597
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,490
You must've committed a lot of sins.

598
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,190
You should've been a nicer person.

599
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,370
Geez.

600
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,260
Don't pretend you aren't scared.

601
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,100
Ever since I saw a real ghost as a kid,
I don't get scared like that.

602
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,430
Ghost?

603
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,100
G-Ghost? Stop lying.

604
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,100
People think ghosts don't have feet,
have holes instead of eyes,

605
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,490
or have a tongue dangling and bleed like this-

606
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,650
Geez.

607
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,950
They think they bleed or something like that.

608
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,770
But that's all a lie.

609
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,600
The ghost I saw looks just like us,

610
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,560
but he kept smiling.

611
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,890
I don't know if we should talk
about this right now.

612
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,470
I didn't know he was a ghost at first.

613
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,000
But I thought, "Why does he keep smiling?"

614
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,880
I looked at him closer,
and his mouth kept widening.

615
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,260
Endlessly.

616
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,200
Hey. I'm not scared of stuff like that at all.

617
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,110
- But what's even scarier is that...
- Yeah.

618
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,570
behind the smiley face, there was
another white face...

619
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,960
It was a branch.

620
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,560
Are you okay?

621
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,680
- You must've been scared.
- Huh?

622
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,250
You got scared by your own story. How funny.

623
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,500
No... I was just acting scared.

624
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,050
How far do we have to go?

625
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,030
I'm tired.

626
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,410
What?

627
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,310
Will you tell me a ghost story again?

628
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,880
Stop testing your courage.

629
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,690
I've never seen this many stars in my life.

630
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,470
It's so nice.

631
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,510
Why did my mom and I make you want to come here?

632
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,400
I come here whenever I'm reminded of my mom.

633
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:40,470
Because she's an alien.

634
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,200
<i>Around when I was in third grade,</i>

635
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,720
<i>my mom and dad got divorced.</i>

636
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,520
<i>She's been living in Germany since then.</i>

637
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,540
<i>I visited her or she visited me every vacation.</i>

638
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,270
<i>That was the only way I saw her.</i>

639
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,210
<i>So, I always missed her.</i>

640
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,320
<i>Dad.</i>

641
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,370
<i>Yes.</i>

642
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,500
<i>Where's Mom?</i>

643
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,300
<i>She lives on that star over there.</i>

644
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,490
<i>Do you see it? Over there.</i>

645
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,020
That was it.

646
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,350
Mom was an alien.

647
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,680
<i>"Yes.</i>

648
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,300
<i>My mom is an alien.</i>

649
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,220
<i>Unlike the earth moms
who are always by their children,</i>

650
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,940
<i>she has to protect her planet.
That's why she isn't here.</i>

651
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,400
Mom probably misses me, too.

652
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,590
Since the two planets are far away,

653
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,600
we can't communicate well.

654
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,430
I should be patient and wait."

655
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,800
Whenever I thought of Mom,

656
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,970
I comforted myself while looking at the stars.

657
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,360
But hearing about you and Ahjumma,

658
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,790
I was reminded of my mom.

659
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,140
There's a mom like her, too.

660
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,860
She tirelessly tries to land on her daughter's

661
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,930
planet, no matter what.

662
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,380
There's a mom like that, too.

663
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,660
But why is my mom...

664
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,130
And...

665
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,900
you're heartbroken about your mom's childhood.

666
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,500
What star are you from?

667
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,600
I'm jealous.

668
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,400
You two are like each other's first love.

669
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,500
You're awkward, clumsy like first love.

670
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,100
But you're completely sincere.

671
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,700
That makes me annoyingly jealous.

672
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,240
My mom...

673
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,960
is my second mom.

674
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,710
They were apparently childhood friends.

675
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,590
Gosh.

676
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,430
You're good at drawing.

677
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,700
You came.

678
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,330
<i>Their grandpas had stores side by side.</i>

679
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,100
<i>People mistook them for twins.</i>

680
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,840
<i>They wore the same clothes
and had the same hairstyle.</i>

681
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,610
<i>They grew up like sisters.</i>

682
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,370
<i>They couldn't be without each other.</i>

683
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,910
<i>In happy or sad times,</i>

684
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,180
<i>they kept each other company.</i>

685
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,880
<i>They were more than just friends.</i>

686
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,860
Cho Rong,

687
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,750
my mom...

688
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,600
My mom left me.

689
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,940
<i>Anyway, they grew up together,</i>

690
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,600
<i>went to beauty school together,</i>

691
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,280
<i>and moved to Seoul together.</i>

692
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,100
Ji An...

693
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,190
<i>My first mom, who was a single mom,
had a car accident.</i>

694
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,690
<i>That's why my mom ended up with me.</i>

695
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,310
So, we...

696
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,620
are very desperate for each other.

697
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,410
Because we don't take each other for granted,

698
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,120
we've always been desperate for each other.

699
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,950
Because we had to be mother
and daughter more than anyone.

700
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,920
But I guess we've tried too hard.

701
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,000
I got tired...

702
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,890
and my mom doesn't understand me.

703
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,940
On top of that, I...

704
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,110
So, don't be jealous.

705
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,720
You know, Ahjumma?

706
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,530
More than when her mom left her,

707
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,480
she must've felt sadder about

708
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,430
herself who waited for her every day.

709
00:50:58,570 --> 00:50:59,960
Let's go.

710
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,910
<i>She knew she won't come back,</i>

711
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,780
<i>but she kept waiting for her return.</i>

712
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,380
<i>She couldn't give up hope.</i>

713
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,100
<i>And that time she spent hating herself.</i>

714
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,010
<i>That pain lasts longer.</i>

715
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,000
So, go home and give her a hug.

716
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,980
Don't make her wait for you.

717
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,480
Here.

718
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,890
Pretty.

719
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,350
What?

720
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,700
The stars. The stars are pretty.

721
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,800
Yes, the stars, right? I was
talking about them, too.

722
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,820
You're kind of pretty, too.

723
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,970
Aren't you too enthusiastic?

724
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,840
Let me make it clear. I won't pay you extra.

725
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,050
I'm not being excessive. I'm detail-oriented.

726
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,660
Details make a difference in the end.

727
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,480
Does this make any difference?

728
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,000
Just look normally. Why do you hurt your arms?

729
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,150
D-Don't come into my space like this.

730
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,960
Sorry.

731
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,030
I'll go inside.

732
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,750
Y-You raised Hyo Ri well.

733
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,490
You're so harsh to her,

734
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,200
but she says exactly what she wants to say.

735
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,540
She's smart. She turned out well.

736
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,110
I'm no good, but she's great.

737
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,400
Okay.

738
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,700
This is perfect.

739
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,210
Have a seat.

740
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,630
Use your hands.

741
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,580
Extend all the way.

742
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,860
I'm giving you an opening gift ahead of time.

743
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,470
How did you know I like to draw?

744
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,820
<i>I thought a lot about what gift I should get you.</i>

745
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,470
In the end, I wanted to gift you...

746
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,210
the time for you to be yourself.

747
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,910
You must be busy caring for Hyo Ri and the shop,

748
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,270
but you should set time for yourself aside, too.

749
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,490
Roam around the neighborhood on the bike,

750
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,670
stop somewhere you like,

751
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,720
and catch a break.

752
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,000
Let yourself be nothing but yourself.

753
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,560
And that lady...

754
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,260
Don't try too hard.

755
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,400
It's okay if you don't.

756
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,940
I know you very well.

757
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,880
It's okay for you to not try.

758
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,810
You should stop suffering.

759
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,230
You probably never tried,

760
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,500
but run away when it's too much.

761
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,960
That's not cowardly. It's self-preservation.

762
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,770
If you still don't want to run away

763
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,360
and want to endure it,

764
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,190
then, let me know.

765
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,400
I'll support you.

766
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,900
While living here,

767
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,200
rely on nature and people.

768
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,500
You should feel at ease now.

769
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,270
I'll actually tell you everything.

770
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,930
Hyung.

771
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,610
Hyung.

772
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,780
He's not here.

773
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:14,500
<i>So, did you give up on her, too?</i>

774
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,560
[Mom]

775
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,830
<i>- What?</i>
- Put Mom on the phone.

776
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,640
<i>She doesn't want to see you.</i>

777
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,540
<i>Hand me the phone.</i>

778
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,600
<i>Okay. I'll tell you directly since
you want to hear from me.</i>

779
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,070
<i>It's hard for me to see you.</i>

780
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,220
<i>I don't want you contacting me, either.</i>

781
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,970
<i>You were a successful athlete,</i>

782
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,920
<i>but you ruined your life yourself.</i>

783
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,100
<i>That's when you ruined my life
after I've been devoted to you.</i>

784
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,810
So, are you giving up on your child?

785
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,410
<i>When you suffered from alcoholism,</i>

786
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,730
<i>you abandoned your family first.</i>

787
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,300
<i>Geez.</i>

788
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,400
<i>Please come to your senses.</i>

789
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,920
- You'll hurt yourself!
- Let go!

790
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,320
So what if I hurt myself?

791
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,680
I can't even play. I'm useless.

792
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,460
So what if I hurt myself?

793
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,740
What a shitty life.

794
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,020
Shit!

795
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,310
Shit. So what if I hurt myself?

796
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,590
So what if I hurt myself?

797
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,530
I broke down because I knew.

798
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,100
I knew so well that your life depended on me.

799
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:20,400
That's why I broke down when
my career ended. Okay?

800
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:24,590
Stop playing a martyr. I can't stand it.

801
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,110
I planned this for you.

802
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,400
Wow...

803
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,310
It's quite grand, just like me.

804
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,300
Does looking at the night sky
make you feel close to it

805
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,040
and you feel like the stars are yours?

806
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,400
What are you saying?

807
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,170
Someone told me...

808
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,710
that moms are aliens.

809
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,580
What?

810
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,130
But you're nice for an alien.

811
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,730
Really?

812
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,600
Should you feel that attached to your mom?

813
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:55,840
[Hyung, have we been hating Mom or missing her?]

814
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:02,660
<i>Have we been hating Mom...</i>

815
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,370
<i>or missing her?</i>

816
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,400
<i>Why are we so attached to her?</i>

817
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,260
Hey, I think I just saw a shooting star.

818
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,500
Don't lie.

819
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,540
Don't let go.

820
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,930
Should we take a photo?

821
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,960
Let's.

822
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,920
Stand here.

823
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,020
- Here?
- By myself?

824
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,660
Here?

825
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,400
- Take sequential photos.
- No.

826
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,570
Gosh, stop.

827
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,170
Try to be more natural.

828
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,100
Be natural. No, don't look at the camera.

829
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,510
Look at the stars.

830
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,650
Don't look at me and look at the stars.

831
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:30,810
That's right. That's right.

832
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,630
I'll take one.

833
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,090
Hurry up. My face is going numb.

834
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,260
Hurry, Hyo Ri. Hurry.

835
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,300
Hyo Ri!

836
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,730
Hyo Ri!

837
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,180
Hyo Ri!

838
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,930
Hyo Ri!

839
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,740
Hyo Ri!

840
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,760
Hyo Ri!

841
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,570
Hyo Ri!

842
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,100
<i>Why are we so attached?</i>

843
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,490
Hyo Ri!

844
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,280
Hyo Ri!

845
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,890
Hyo Ri!
