LINK

2
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,522
Is he sleeping already?

3
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,441
I need to tell him.

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,153
RECENT CALLS
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

5
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,712
Why do I feel like this?

6
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,085
This happened before too.

7
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,376
Eun Gyehoon.

8
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,562
I felt this way before.

9
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,234
<i>Suddenly, I was overcome with
a strange emotion I couldn't explain.</i>

10
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,404
<i>And whenever I felt
this strange and unfamiliar emotion,</i>

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,030
<i>Eun Gyehoon was crying</i>

12
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,277
<i>or something terrible happened to him.</i>

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,340
Dahyun.

14
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,799
<i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,627
I miss you.

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,640
Where are you?

17
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,642
<i>I'll go there.</i>

18
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,891
Okay?

19
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,061
Where are you?

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,939
Where are you?

21
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,277
<i>I know this sounds crazy,</i>

22
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,122
<i>but I can feel</i>

23
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,657
your emotions.

24
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,748
<i>No way. What he said was all true?</i>

25
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,292
You have a superpower.

26
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,299
-Fine. You can tease me.
-Can you fly too?

27
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,588
I'll practice.

28
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,715
<i>He wasn't playing around or joking.</i>

29
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,844
<i>Why are you doing all this for me?</i>

30
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,467
Because someone has trouble sleeping,
I can't sleep either.

31
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,055
So I'm trying to help them.

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,140
I hope you won't have
any nightmares tonight.

33
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,727
How did you know that
I've been having nightmares?

34
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,228
<i>That's why whenever
I was suffering from nightmares,</i>

35
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,034
<i>was heartbroken…</i>

36
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,609
Would you like some food?

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,623
-Noh Dahyun!
<i>-…or whenever something happened to me…</i>

38
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,121
What's going on? Are you okay?

39
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,703
I'm always worried about you.

40
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,751
<i>…you showed up.</i>

41
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,714
<i>You've been sensing
my emotions all this time.</i>

42
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,019
<i>And now, I can feel your emotions too.</i>

43
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,395
<i>Your agony, sadness, and…</i>

44
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,403
<i>your loneliness.</i>

45
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:11,666
THE LINK

46
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,051
So that's what happened.

47
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,049
Mr. Cho

48
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,343
did that to Gyeyoung.

49
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,135
How could he do that?

50
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,892
How could someone…

51
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,146
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,019
Who am I to be upset in front of you?

53
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,739
It's never-ending.

54
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,326
If…

55
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,789
Please help me.

56
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,118
Jeez, just my luck.

57
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,504
<i>-If he…</i>
-Please help me. Please take me home.

58
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,879
<i>hadn't turned his back on Gyeyoung,</i>

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,340
<i>or if</i>

60
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,679
<i>she had turned herself in</i>

61
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,096
<i>and searched for Gyeyoung one more time…</i>

62
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,467
<i>If I hadn't lost my memory,</i>

63
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,519
<i>or if her hand
hadn't slipped through mine…</i>

64
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>No, even before that,</i>

65
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,149
<i>if I hadn't left Gyeyoung
by herself that day…</i>

66
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,111
Gyeyoung! Where are you?

67
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,239
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

68
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,412
<i>I endlessly blame and resent myself,</i>

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
<i>and regret.</i>

70
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,078
After all, I…

71
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,172
I can't forgive myself.

72
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,588
And…

73
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,850
you were right, Dahyun.

74
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,979
Let's break up.

75
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,021
Okay.

76
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,857
Let's do that.

77
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,115
We really broke up.

78
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,903
What are you waiting for? I said kill me.

79
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,438
Kill me and kill yourself too.

80
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,611
There is no way out for you anyway.

81
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,824
You've committed too many wrong deeds.

82
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,068
On top of that, I'm a police officer.

83
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:56,123
They'll find out soon that I was with you.
Do you realize that?

84
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,078
Yes, I do.

85
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,379
I was already prepared for that
when I killed Lee Jingeun.

86
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,552
Why would you do this then?

87
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,509
What's important

88
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,100
is how many people I'll be able to kill
before I get caught

89
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,265
and who I should kill first.

90
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,483
That's what matters, Jungho.

91
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,107
Please don't.

92
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,534
Just end it with me.

93
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,907
Let's do that, okay?

94
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,326
EPISODE 15

95
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,382
<i>The call can't be connected.
Transferring to voicemail.</i>

96
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,262
Why isn't this guy picking up?

97
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,512
Who are you talking about, sir?

98
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,675
I heard that's one of the signs of aging.

99
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,677
Referring to people
as mere this or that guy.

100
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,637
That little… Hey!

101
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,358
An. Okay? An Jungho. Lt. An. Satisfied?

102
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,901
He heard everything.
I guess he can still hear well.

103
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,612
He didn't seem well.

104
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,453
Did something happen to him?

105
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,491
I brought you coffee, Chief.

106
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,172
You made this?

107
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,961
For me?

108
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,007
-Did you spit in it?
-I wouldn't dare.

109
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,053
What's with that smile?

110
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,008
What's wrong with her?

111
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,235
Please allow me.

112
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,670
It tastes quite good, doesn't it?

113
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,248
It tastes really good, but you're
making me feel so uncomfortable.

114
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,165
-Is there water--
-Here you go, sir.

115
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,842
-Is there a tissue…
-Here, sir.

116
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,013
Let's go.

117
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,732
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

118
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,984
I heard the two of you ate something.

119
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,824
You ate sushi without us?

120
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,074
Follow me.

121
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,527
You're so cheap.

122
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,247
Minjo, I know what you're up to.

123
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,668
Did Ji Wontak ask you to do this?

124
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,550
Did he ask you to bribe me
and pave a way for him?

125
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,459
He would never do that.

126
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,717
I have to persuade you first,
and then Ji Wontak next.

127
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,549
Wait. Should I call him Han Sejin now?

128
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,519
I don't really know
what happened in the past.

129
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,769
So I have no desire to criticize you

130
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,272
or feel sorry for Ji Wontak.

131
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,860
But what I know for sure is
that Mr. Han Euichan, Ji Wontak's father,

132
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,321
was already acquitted 18 years ago

133
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,453
and that should be respected.

134
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,076
But as you know, you didn't do that, sir.

135
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,080
Hey, that's because--

136
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,923
So both of you need to let it go

137
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,329
and just call it even.

138
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,168
And please forgive him

139
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,259
for assaulting you.

140
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,847
Please rescind his resignation letter.

141
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,426
Please, sir.

142
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,571
I guess I won't be able
to see you anymore.

143
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,119
You aren't going to tell me?

144
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,951
The thing is that Wi-Fi…

145
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,078
Gyehoon…

146
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,174
I mean, Chef Eun can
sense my feelings, right?

147
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,549
I can't tell you anything
without Gyehoon's permission.

148
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,459
So I'm right.

149
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,764
That's what happened.

150
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,967
-I'd like to remain silent--
-But why?

151
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,973
Why is this happening?

152
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,683
I'm dying to know too.

153
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,926
What could it be?

154
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,267
Destiny?

155
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,232
That's tacky.

156
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,733
You and Gyehoon have the same reaction.
He said it was tacky too.

157
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,240
He's been sensing it all this time.

158
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,912
And perhaps, he still does.

159
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,423
I shouldn't have cried.

160
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,213
Dahyun.

161
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,836
Gyehoon wanted me to tell you this.

162
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,892
You're closing the restaurant?

163
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,930
Yes.

164
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,981
I never thought you really would.

165
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,483
What about Dahyun?

166
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,025
This is why you should
never date a colleague.

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,617
Tell me about it.

168
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,674
I'm sorry for doing this
after bringing you onboard.

169
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,288
Please don't apologize.

170
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,750
I was the one who came with
an ulterior motive. I should apologize.

171
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,339
That's that,

172
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,257
but you need to keep me. Take me with you.

173
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,636
I've come to like you guys.

174
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,265
You should feel sorry for me.

175
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,857
I don't have anyone except you guys.

176
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,906
If you promise
not to wield a knife ever again.

177
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,786
Of course, I wouldn't.

178
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,554
Wow, awesome. It's going to taste amazing.

179
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,339
-Try it.
-Looks great.

180
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,882
Wow, it looks fabulous.

181
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,719
What's wrong?

182
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,055
I think I can kind of understand him now.

183
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,063
-What?
-It's bitter, sweet, sour, and salty.

184
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,895
Didn't that chef say that before? Jeez.

185
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,449
Eun Gyehoon isn't Voldemort.
You can mention him.

186
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,164
I don't mind.

187
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,289
What kind of taste is this?

188
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,920
You're really something, Mom.

189
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,705
Grandma, it tastes like…

190
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,350
Honey, I heard everything.

191
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,469
You must be so heartbroken.

192
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,141
Eunjung, taste this.

193
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,846
-A very interesting taste.
-No thanks.

194
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,898
What do you think?

195
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,437
Why am I laughing?
I'm the one who made it.

196
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,150
Isn't it insane?

197
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,700
I don't get it. What's funny about it?

198
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,868
-<i>I'm going to have fun.</i>
-Let's have this for dinner.

199
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,955
<i>I'm going to laugh.</i>

200
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,877
<i>So that you'll laugh too.</i>

201
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,837
Come back. I already talked to Chief Seo.

202
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,876
-Forget it.
-Don't act like a child.

203
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,764
How long will you act like this?

204
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,175
Watch what you say.
You don't know anything.

205
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,518
You don't want to hear it? Then tell me.

206
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,345
So that I'll know how to be considerate.

207
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,477
If you don't say anything,

208
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,154
how will I know
if Mr. Han Euichan is your father or not?

209
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,653
This is all I am to you?

210
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,238
I'm so insignificant

211
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,776
that you can't even tell me?

212
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,157
Seriously, what am I to you?

213
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,374
My former boss.

214
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,166
My ex-girlfriend.

215
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,881
Someone…

216
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,297
I still have feelings for.

217
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,430
I don't have feelings for you.

218
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,266
Not yet.

219
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:31,317
If you want me to like you again,
go take back your resignation letter.

220
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,824
That's a separate matter.
You're being unreasonable.

221
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,702
You won't catch him?

222
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,084
You won't catch the culprit
who got Mr. Han falsely accused?

223
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,622
If you want to catch him, come back.

224
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,129
Learn to back down when necessary.

225
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,625
We can discuss us after that.

226
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,737
<i>Did Gyeyoung
get into Euichan's car or not?</i>

227
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,662
<i>Answer me!</i>

228
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,279
I'm telling you!
Han Euichan is the killer!

229
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,447
Where is the girl?

230
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,285
Where were you and what were you doing
yesterday and the day before that?

231
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,791
Sejin, please stop. Okay?

232
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,415
Let's go, Sejin.

233
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,481
Look at you. Look how proudly
you're holding your head up high.

234
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,607
I came to take back my resignation letter.

235
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,525
You should know that you had me
because you sneaked up on me.

236
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,953
You ambushed me out of nowhere

237
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,576
and threw me off. That's why I lost.

238
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,488
I would've won if we fought fairly.

239
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,123
So you guys want to catch
the culprit from 18 years ago?

240
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,455
Fine. Bring him before me.

241
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,468
Then I'll kneel down…

242
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,637
and apologize to you and Han Euichan…

243
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,141
and resign.

244
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,355
Yes, sir. I'll make sure you do.

245
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,201
This is awful.

246
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,531
Why do I feel this emptiness in my heart?

247
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,584
I have a big void in my heart.

-Thank you for showing it. We'll call you.
-Thank you.

256
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,829
It looks bigger than
the actual size I mentioned, right?

257
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,923
You don't have to pay a premium.
The monthly rent is reasonable too.

258
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,303
Every corner is also photo-worthy,

259
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,722
-so it'll be very space efficient.
-I see.

260
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,219
And because you can rent
both the first and the second floors,

261
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,972
you don't have to worry about the size.

Sure.

00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,821

265
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,826
<i>I was barely surviving.</i>

-I see.

-Like this.
-I see.

Right here. Like this.

Don't get younger by yourself and share.

270
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,270
We're in line already. Don't cut in.

271
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,389
It'll be fair that I lend it first
to someone with the most wrinkles.

272
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,017
I'm disqualified then.

273
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,154
I'm last then.

00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,148
-Why me?
-Forget it then.

00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,034
-Let me see it. Where?
-Right here.

277
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,781
-Apply it horizontally. On the wrinkles.
-Like this.

278
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,366
-The wrinkles are all gone.
-It looks all shiny and smooth.

Tap it gently.

280
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,252
Where are you guys going all dressed up?

281
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,961
Going somewhere nice without us?

282
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,251

According to the lunar calendar?
It's correct then.

Ms. Hong Bokhee is your daughter, right?

-We're searching for something else.
-Something else?

312
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,608
Yes. There is a man
that Lee Jingeun met with.

313
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,034
Oh, right. You were there too, Chief.

314
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,160

Shouldn't you go see her?

00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,555
I'm going to ignore it all.

348
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,033
Thank you, but I'll just walk home.

349
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,364
Why?

350
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,487
I just want to take a walk.

351
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,486
Will you do that then?

00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,414
Yes.

353
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,955
Okay, then.

00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,508
<i>that I recognized him.</i>

357
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,096
By the way…

358
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,237
Have we ever met in the past?

359
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,106
<i>It used to be just a vague feeling</i>

360
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,369
<i>from that time.</i>

361
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,461
<i>Now I remember it.</i>

362
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,788
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

363
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,501
Wait, kid.

364
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,219
Did you drop this?

365
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:36,972
No.

366
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,055
Can you take a closer look?

367
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,401
What do you think? Do you remember it now?

368
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,294
No, it's not mine.

369
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,129
I see. What a good girl.

370
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,630
I'll give it to you as a gift.

371
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,335
Here.

372
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:21,143
<i>He was trying to see if I remembered him.</i>

373
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,363
Well, then. See you later.

374
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,940
Bye.

375
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,092
HONG BOKHEE

376
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,641
Hello, Mom?

377
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,720
Can you come meet me?

378
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,236
-Mom.
-What is it?

379
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,166
Where is Chef Eun?

380
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,168
He was saying he'll ignore
Wi-Fi or whatever. Who is he kidding?

381
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,418
He rushed out at once.

382
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,839
What's going on with everyone?

383
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:37,891
Why?

384
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,138
The ladies from the stew place
were rushing to somewhere too.

385
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,433
What?

386
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,880
Why am I doing this again?

387
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,212
MISSED CALL
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

388
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,466
<i>The person Lee Jingeun met
after leaving the cart bar.</i>

389
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,678
I saw him while coming back
from the restroom.

390
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,055
-Who was it?
-Who was it?

391
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,102
Well…

392
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,859
Isn't that the stalker?

393
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,787
<i>It was Younghoon.</i>

394
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,705
-Pardon?
-The fish.

395
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,501
The fish store at the Jihwa Market?

396
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,132
That's right.
I definitely saw him that night.

397
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,340
It looked like he was having
a serious conversation with the stalker.

398
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,766
Could it be…

399
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,983
that he's the culprit?

400
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,898
No way.

401
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,561
No, right?

402
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,767
EUN GYEHOON

403
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,399
Hello?

404
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,864
What?

405
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,950
Got it.

406
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,831
I need to head out at once.
Something happened to Noh Dahyun.

407
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,119
What?

408
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,332
What's going on? What now?

409
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,916
Hey, let's go.

410
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,394
Do you want me to call the police?

411
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,232
Yes.

412
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,586
Where are you going? Hey!

413
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,928
<i>The call can't be connected…</i>

414
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,471
Where on earth is she?

415
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,483
Excuse me, ma'am.

416
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,938
Was the customer a woman in her twenties

417
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,272
with long hair and big eyes?

418
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,568
Oh, the one that was sitting here?

419
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,152
Yes. A pretty girl
with long hair and fair skin.

420
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,778
She was just here
eating alone and then left.

421
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,118
Do you know which way she went?

422
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,911
I think she went down that alley.

423
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,044
Thank you.

424
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,615
What the heck are you doing?

425
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,101
I got you.

426
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,986
But how did you know?

427
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,488
How did you remember me?

428
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,624
Why does that matter at this moment?

429
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,498
I'm not good at holding in my questions.

430
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,998
Besides, this is the only time
that I get to ask you.

431
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,509
I can't ask a dead body.

432
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,378
Don't you think?

433
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,181
I'm in the redevelopment block.

434
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,187
I've shared my current location with you.

435
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,938
She's somewhere around here.
Come as quickly as you can.

436
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,646
Turn right here.

437
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,521
<i>This feeling I have…</i>

438
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,306
<i>is the same fear…</i>

439
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,559
<i>that I felt that day.</i>

440
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,875
<i>If there is a God,</i>

441
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,549
<i>or whoever else is out there,</i>

442
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,720
<i>please help.</i>

443
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,796
<i>Please don't…</i>

444
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,141
<i>let me lose anyone ever again.</i>

445
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,187
Dahyun. Dahyun!

446
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,143
Dahyun.

447
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,299
Gyehoon.

448
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,096
Eun Gyehoon.

449
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,335
It was you, wasn't it?

450
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
My sister

451
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,137
and my dad.

452
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,691
It was you, wasn't it?

453
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,730
Does that matter at this moment?

454
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,984
Answer me!

455
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,895
I'll tell you if you need a motive
to do something to me.

456
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,645
You're right. I did it.

457
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,567
And…

458
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,789
there will be more.

459
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,831
You don't think I can stab you?

460
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,044
Try me. Come on!

461
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,709
Dahyun.

462
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,866
It's too dangerous for you.

463
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,825
Dahyun.

464
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,288
Dahyun.

465
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,586
Dahyun, are you okay?

466
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,215
Dahyun.

467
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,969
Stay with me, okay?

468
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,561
Dahyun. Stay with me, okay? Dahyun.

469
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,172
Lee Younghoon!

470
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,378
-You bastard.
-Put down your weapon.

471
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,590
No.

472
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,008
<i>No.</i>

473
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,889
-No.
-Gyehoon.

474
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,104
You'll be fine.

475
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,519
<i>These tears are not mine.</i>

476
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,981
<i>-It's not me.
-It's not me.</i>

477
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,027
<i>It's my brother.</i>

478
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,911
My brother is crying because of me.

479
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,245
<i>I remember it now.</i>

480
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,918
<i>I know now</i>

481
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,040
<i>why we're linked,</i>

482
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,630
<i>and why you can sense my feelings
and I can sense yours.</i>

483
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,470
<i>I know now, Gyehoon.</i>

484
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,644
Gyehoon.

485
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,772
Don't talk, okay? Don't.

486
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,822
This is my favorite sticker.

487
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,275
Really? It's my favorite too.

488
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,649
-Really?
-Yes. Really.

489
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,918
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

490
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:12,758
<i>-Cinderella lost her parents as a child
-Cinderella lost her parents as a child</i>

491
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:17,560
<i>-Her stepmother and sisters mistreated her
-Her stepmother and sisters mistreated her</i>

492
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,730
<i>-Shaba shaba aishaba
-Shaba shaba aishaba</i>

493
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,485
What's wrong? Are you scared again?

494
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,533
It's not me.

495
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,250
It's my brother.

496
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,753
What?

497
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:48,379
My brother is crying because of me.

498
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,010
We're twins.

499
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,006
When I'm mad, he's mad too.

500
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,595
When I'm happy, he's happy too.

501
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:03,391
We feel the same emotion
even if we're apart like this.

502
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,897
I see. And?

503
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:11,608
Usually, I can't sense his feelings well,
but my brother can sense mine.

504
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,613
But I just felt it too.

505
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,950
My brother is crying
because he's so scared for me.

506
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,536
I can really feel that
he is crying because of me.

507
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,958
That's why I feel so sad.

508
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,553
Don't cry. Everything will be fine.

509
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,455
Gyeyoung, let's escape.

510
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,252
Escape?

511
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,165
I think the window over there might open.

512
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,714
We'll be able to escape through that.

513
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,932
But I can't even walk.

514
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,550
I'll help you.

515
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,507
Just hold my hand and come with me.

516
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:31,648
But if I fail and only you make it out,

517
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,188
please do me a favor.

518
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:36,895
What is it?

519
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,783
Can you find my brother
and tell him something for me?

520
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,831
Tell him what?

521
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,247
My brother…

522
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,665
My brother Eun Gyehoon

523
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,707
is feeling more scared
and is crying more than me.

524
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,676
So please go tell him this.

525
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,603
Gyehoon.

526
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,563
<i>I have to tell you</i>

527
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,444
<i>what she said.</i>

528
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,234
Dahyun. Tell me later, okay?

529
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,980
Please go now.

530
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,174
Dahyun.

531
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,343
Dahyun, look at me.

532
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,051
It's me, sweetie. I'm right here.

533
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,342
Oh, gosh.

534
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,158
Gyehoon.

535
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,537
She wanted me to tell you this.

536
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,754
<i>Gyehoon. Remember this.</i>

537
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,498
It's not your fault.

538
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,626
It's really not your fault.

539
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,756
So stop crying.

540
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,087
Promise me.

541
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,103
It's not your fault.

542
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,812
It's really not your fault.

543
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,937
So stop crying.

544
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,727
Promise me.

545
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:05,446
That's correct.
Tell my crybaby brother to stop crying.

546
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,822
Okay?

547
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:09,987
A crybaby.

548
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,702
You have to tell him, okay?

549
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,908
Okay, I promise.

550
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,942
Gyehoon. Remember this.

551
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,154
It's not your fault.

552
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,202
It's really not your fault.

553
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,200
So stop crying. Promise me.

<i>Rumor has it that he was
the killer from 18 years ago.</i>

557
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,612
Please open your eyes.

559
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,532
<i>I should've gotten there sooner.</i>

560
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,609
<i>Whenever I miss you,</i>

561
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,985
<i>I imagine you in my mind, Gyehoon.</i>

562
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:40,539

with my long-lost family.</i>

563
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,542
<i>I don't feel anything anymore.</i>
