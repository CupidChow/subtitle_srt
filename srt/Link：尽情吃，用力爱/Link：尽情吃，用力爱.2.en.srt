<i>All right.</i>

00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:13,857
<i>He has an amazing talent.</i>

00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:15,527
<i>Let's find out.</i>

5
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:17,987
<i>He just needs to lift it up.</i>

6
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,197
<i>Will he manage?</i>

7
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,327
<i>How amazing!</i>

EXCLUSIVE!
FASCINATING WORLD

00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,877
<i>Talent shows and tricks
were popular back in the day.</i>

10
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:37,127
<i>Some were truly talented and eccentric.</i>

11
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:39,587
<i>But there were also scammers</i>

12
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:41,757
<i>who brazenly lied in front of the cameras.</i>

13
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:45,177
How long have you two
been living together?

14
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:49,597
Next up are an adorable set of twins.

15
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:50,937
Please come to the stage!

16
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:59,857
I heard that you guys are telepathic.

17
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,697
It's not telepathy.

18
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:04,907
He-- I mean, my brother

19
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:07,827
can feel exactly what I feel.

20
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:10,117
I see. Give me an example.

21
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:14,207
If I'm afraid or in pain,

22
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,797
he's also afraid or in pain.

23
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:19,417
It doesn't happen all the time.
It comes and goes.

24
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:24,257
Can you prove that you're special?

25
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:27,007
-Not really--
-Yes, we can.

26
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,687
<i>Our father, an overly eager man,</i>

27
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:33,847
<i>turned us into eccentric twins.</i>

28
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,437
<i>Twin telepathy?</i>

29
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,737
Stop teasing us.
You don't have that superpower.

30
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:45,157
-That's not a superpower.
-Stop it.

31
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:46,277
I don't want to.

32
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,537
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

33
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,457
I don't need it.

34
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,087
I wish I never had it.

35
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,337
Why do you say that?

36
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,967
I'm pretty jealous.

37
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:08,007
There must be a good reason…

38
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:13,267
for your abilities.

39
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:16,687
<i>No.</i>

40
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,107
<i>There was no reason, Father.</i>

41
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:25,907
<i>-All I could do was feel.</i>
-Gyeyoung.

42
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:28,367
<i>-I couldn't do anything.</i>
-Gyeyoung.

43
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,197
Gyeyoung!

44
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,757
<i>So what use was this ability?</i>

45
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,397
<i>Hello?</i>

46
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:03,357
<i>Hello--</i>

47
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,107
Jeez.

48
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,067
About that woman from the restaurant…

49
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:53,617
-I'll come back another time. Bye.
-What? Tell me your address.

50
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,697
-Hello.
-Wait.

51
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,957
You two may be questioned…

52
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,127
Do you think she's okay?

53
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,087
I'm not sure.
But she'll come back if she isn't.

54
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:07,837
Ma'am.

55
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:09,677
Right. Probably.

56
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:13,507
<i>Back then,</i>

57
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:17,687
<i>we had no idea whom we had sent.</i>

58
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:21,397
<i>And I bet he has no idea</i>

59
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:23,857
<i>what's in that fridge either.</i>

60
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:29,197
<i>Because we never thought</i>

61
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,067
<i>he'd take our fridge.</i>

62
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:46,457
ROSE RESTAURANT

63
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,337
Hello.

64
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:49,797
Can I help you?

65
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:51,177
Well…

66
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,637
Is everything okay?

67
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,937
I'd like to ask you the same.
Are you okay?

68
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,017
Sorry?

69
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,347
Of course.

70
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,267
I'm fine.

71
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:07,817
I'm totally fine.

72
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,607
Don't be ridiculous.

73
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,697
I'm jobless
and have nothing to worry about.

74
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:13,737
You look pretty concerned about something.

75
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:18,157
You see, I was just passing by

76
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,827
and thought I should say hi.

77
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:22,457
We were never close enough to say hi.

78
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:26,087
-And I wondered if you had dinner already.
-When were you so interested in my dinner?

79
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:30,337
That's why I came.

80
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,427
I simply came to say hi
and see if everything was fine.

81
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:41,517
You came to say hi at 2:30 a.m.?

82
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,227
What a great question.

83
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:47,527
-Shouldn't you be clocking out?
-That's also a great question.

84
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,357
I'm going to. We were just about to leave.

85
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,987
Wait.

86
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,497
What did you have for dinner?

87
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,167
<i>What am I saying?</i>

88
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,417
<i>-Gimbap.</i>
-I had <i>jjajang ramyeon</i>.

89
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,047
<i>What am I talking about?</i>

90
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,177
What did you have for lunch?

91
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:16,967
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

92
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:20,517
For lunch, I had…

93
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:25,977
Let's be honest now.

94
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:30,647
-About what?
-You know you're being very suspicious.

95
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,067
Am I?

96
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,317
You're talking nonsense.
Your face is pale, and you're sweating.

97
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,907
Your hands are trembling,
and your mouth is dry.

98
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,577
Why did you come here?

99
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:46,077
You see…

100
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:48,667
I…

101
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,007
Did something…

102
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,467
happen a while ago?

103
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,017
Don't look back.

104
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:06,727
Look here! Look at me!

105
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:17,237
<i>What should I do now?</i>

106
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:19,947
What are you doing?

107
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,287
I like you.

108
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,247
<i>What am I spewing?</i>

109
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,957
I like you.

110
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:36,007
LIES

111
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,597
You look glum.

112
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:46,477
When someone tells me
that they like me, I feel happy.

113
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:47,687
Not you?

114
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:49,307
No.

115
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,727
I see.

116
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:55,187
What if…

117
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:56,777
Just what if…

118
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:01,027
there's a 0.1% chance that it's her?

119
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,997
-Then what should I do?
-What do you mean?

120
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:06,997
Your Wi-Fi?

121
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,457
No.

122
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,127
<i>That she's my sister, Gyeyoung.</i>

123
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,637
EPISODE 2

124
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,687
SIMMER ON LOW HEAT FOR TWO MINUTES!

125
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,377
HOW DOES THEIR TELEPATHY WORK?

126
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:16,857
Hi, son.

127
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:23,487
Didn't I tell you not to skip your meals?

128
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,487
Nagging me already?

129
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,077
You're making me do it.

130
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:32,997
What should I do? I love hearing you nag.

131
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,547
I'll get it ready soon, so come and eat.

132
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:54,307
Look here! I like you.

133
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,107
Are you insane?
Why would you let him take the fridge?

134
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:02,567
Do you want a loudspeaker?

135
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:04,157
Trying to let all the neighbors know?

136
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,157
This is driving me crazy.

137
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,987
This is driving me nuts.

138
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,787
Here comes our heroine.

139
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,417
You must've encouraged him
to take it, didn't you?

140
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:21,337
What could I do? It was his to begin with.

141
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:24,007
Not anymore if he had thrown it away.

142
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,677
You're making no sense.

143
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,217
It doesn't matter if it does or not.

144
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,717
Have you already forgotten
what's inside that fridge?

145
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,557
Then what? He would've suspected me
had I stopped him.

146
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,227
You should've carried it
on your back and run away!

147
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:37,437
-Can you carry it on your back?
-Why not?

148
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,687
-You're ridiculous.
-What did you say?

149
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:43,487
Why did you have to put
that thing in there?

150
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,947
You caused all of this, you know?

151
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,987
I know that. I'm the one to blame. Happy?

152
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:49,327
You little--

153
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,827
<i>Code zero.
They're at the nearby intersection…</i>

154
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:54,287
I don't want to hear it.
What's your plan now?

155
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,787
I'll have to get it back.

156
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,127
Exactly how?

157
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,087
I'll have to think about it first.
Leave it up to me.

158
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,587
Grandma, leave it up to me.

159
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,927
What can you do on your own?

160
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:11,517
It doesn't matter.
I did this, so it's my responsibility.

161
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:14,097
Don't be ridiculous.
This is no longer about you.

162
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:16,727
I need to take care of this, not you.
Remember that.

163
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,567
-Grandma.
-Mom?

164
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:24,237
Mom!

165
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:29,697
Mom!

166
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:40,957
-What should we do?
-Let's just go!

167
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,497
-Wait!
-Hurry!

168
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:59,307
MOTHER'S TASTE

00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:02,817

CHURCH OF GOD'S WAY

171
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,827
<i>Charlie Chaplin once said</i>

172
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,827
<i>that life was a comedy
when seen from afar.</i>

173
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,377
<i>He also said</i>

174
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:25,837
<i>that when seen up-close,</i>

175
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,467
<i>life was a tragedy.</i>

176
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,367
It smells nice.

177
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:28,997
It feels like yesterday
was just a nightmare.

178
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:32,127
What will you do now?

179
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,757
We'll get it back at all costs.

180
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:35,887
When?

181
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:37,887
Tonight.

182
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,467
What if he opens it before then?

183
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:44,137
I'll stop him even if it means
I'll have to chop his wrists off.

184
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,057
And if he still opens it?

185
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,357
-I'll make sure he doesn't tell anyone.
-Shouldn't you chop its head?

186
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,817
Yes. I should.

187
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:57,487
Chop the head off.

188
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:05,997
My god!

189
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:09,127
Why were you standing there
without saying anything?

190
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,877
Don't shout at her.

191
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,297
Her mind is troubled enough already.

192
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:17,927
Why are you staring at me?

193
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:20,967
Did you…

194
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,017
and Grandma…

195
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,187
go through something similar in the past?

196
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,867
Come on. Why are you still in here?

197
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,867
-What?
-Hurry up.

198
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:42,987
What is it?

199
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,117
This is a high-tech surveillance camera.

200
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,247
Infrared rays with two million pixels.

201
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:52,707
It'll cover almost
all the nooks and crannies.

202
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,417
Everything that it records

203
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,797
will be sent
to the control tower in real-time.

204
00:15:57,877 --> 00:15:59,507
-Twenty-four hours a day.
-Real-time…

205
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,677
-It'll be monitored.
-Twenty-four hours…

206
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:02,847
Any questions?

207
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:09,937
When will it start recording?

208
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,107
As soon as it gets installed.

209
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:16,067
They just had to be a day late.

210
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:21,447
What are you getting at? Tell me.

211
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,537
She means we could've caught
who broke the window.

212
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,387
What?

213
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:43,387
It wasn't locked.

214
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:45,597
Thank you.

215
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:50,597
Gyehoon, they'll replace the glass today.

216
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:52,807
That's a relief.

217
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:54,517
Gyehoon, did you see her?

218
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,317
I did.

219
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,277
She couldn't even look at you.

220
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,987
Confessing to you must've made her shy.
She doesn't look the type, though.

221
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,697
Maybe that's why.

222
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:09,917
Or…

223
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:10,867
Or?

224
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,757
-Tell me.
-Okay.

225
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,547
Does she look sane to you?

226
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:26,637
-Hello, they're under construction.
-Hey.

227
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:35,937
Mom!

228
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,647
No, she doesn't.

229
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:42,527
I thought so too.

230
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,237
This looks good.

231
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:52,117
This is pretty fresh.

232
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,957
Sir, did you make this yourself?

233
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,627
Of course, I did.

234
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,207
GOBLIN UNDERWEAR
3 FOR 10,000 WON

235
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,587
Bye. I think you could cook this
for five more minutes.

236
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:04,547
That shop over there--

237
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:12,807
Nice to meet you.

238
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,307
Same here.

239
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,267
Hello.

240
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:21,947
I was going to invite you guys
to our restaurant.

241
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:22,897
Right.

242
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:25,237
-Us?
-Why…

243
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:26,947
I wanted to cook for you.

244
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:30,827
We're pretty much family
since we live so close. Right?

245
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,117
No, I don't think so.

246
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:33,827
Right. I agree.

247
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,457
Then how about today?

248
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:42,167
-Let's have a welcoming party.
-Thank you but--

249
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,837
Come if you're thankful.

250
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,047
I have a busy schedule today so--

251
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:51,727
Come on. Life doesn't always go our way.

252
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,687
Things suddenly come up at times.

253
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,307
Maybe next time--

254
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:59,647
There's no guarantee there will be
a next time for an old lady like me.

255
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,277
She's right. What time suits you?

256
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:08,027
-How about 1 o'clock--
-See you at 11:30.

257
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,877
What will you do when they come?

258
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,007
I'll prevent them
from opening that fridge.

259
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,917
They're the ones who stole our fridge.

260
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,627
It wasn't ours to begin with.

261
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,467
They said to keep our enemies closer.

262
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:32,017
They're not our enemies.
It's the other way around.

263
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,677
Who are you talking about?

264
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,597
-Someone.
-Someone.

265
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,277
Can you debone two of these?

266
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:52,617
CLOSED FOR LUNCHTIME

267
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:04,207
We just prepared
what we normally eat. Dig in.

268
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,147
What's your drink of choice? <i>Makgeolli?</i>

269
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,937
-Or soju and beer?
-I'm good. Thank you.

270
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:25,937
Come on. It's okay.
Let's have a drink together.

271
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:29,027
Let's just close
our restaurants for the day.

272
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:34,237
We'll make them drink so much
that they'll pass out

273
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,077
and leave the fridge unattended.

274
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,407
JIMYUNG MAKGEOLLI

275
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:41,917
Then this?

276
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:44,167
I see.

277
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:48,797
What's wrong? This is just…

278
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,597
We don't need to drink.

279
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:54,557
<i>This is a fail.</i>

280
00:20:56,307 --> 00:21:01,227
All the residents in this neighborhood
treat each other like family.

281
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,277
We step in and look after
each other's business.

282
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:07,437
We know each other's passcode.

283
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,317
We share keys too.

284
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,987
Are you asking me
to hand over the keys to my restaurant

285
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:18,157
and tell you the passcode?

286
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:25,167
-Don't be ridiculous.
<i>-This is a fail too.</i>

287
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:30,127
They do it all the time online.

288
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:32,637
Bartering.

289
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,507
-Exchanging items.
-Right, that's the one.

290
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,097
It'd be nice to exchange goods

291
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,897
that you have plenty of
or sell something you don't need.

292
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,227
We have many plates.

293
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:46,687
We have two fans too. Do you want one?

294
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,317
Right. We need a new fridge too.

295
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:53,407
I wonder if I can get one secondhand.

296
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:58,827
So you want me to sell my fridge.

297
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,667
I never said that.

298
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:06,917
I wasn't directly asking you for a fridge.

299
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,167
<i>This is also a fail.</i>

300
00:22:09,257 --> 00:22:12,927
I heard you're a famous chef.

301
00:22:13,007 --> 00:22:14,717
How's our food?

302
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,137
Yes, evaluate our dishes.

303
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:21,597
Well…

304
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,937
The meat still smells.

305
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,437
The dried radish greens are limp.

306
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:34,447
-This is tasteless.
-What? Is it bland?

307
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,027
No, I don't taste anything.

308
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,237
Fried food can't be this soggy.

309
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:40,367
This mushroom pancake is
almost like coffee.

310
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,497
It's bitter, sweet, sour,

311
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,617
and salty as well.

312
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,747
Fascinating.

313
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:51,547
Your choice of ingredients,
storing method, and cooking skills

314
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:54,007
are all just terrible.

315
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:55,837
Then don't eat--

316
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,097
<i>Everything is a fail today.</i>

317
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:04,187
Going out to eat?

318
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,097
Me? Yes. Why?

319
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:08,857
You're going to Choonok Stew, right?
You're a regular.

320
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,437
Why are you tagging along?
I thought you didn't like their dishes.

321
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,147
Come on. I can't always eat what I want.

322
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:16,737
I also need to speak with them.

323
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:18,617
You do?

324
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:28,127
Come on. You better not pee there.

325
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,217
What?

326
00:23:43,307 --> 00:23:44,477
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

327
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,847
Are they closed today?

328
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,567
This is sour?

329
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,107
Are you not open?

330
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:01,447
-Hello.
-Yes, we are. Come in.

331
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,537
Sit here.

332
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:04,947
-We're done eating.
-No, you're not.

333
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,707
Hello.

334
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:24,017
Did you get home safe last night?

335
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:28,937
Me?

336
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:34,477
-Yes.
-Yes. Of course.

337
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:38,947
It's a bit late to ask,
but why did you visit us last night?

338
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,697
Do you mind me asking?

339
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:41,817
She came to us?

340
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:48,667
You must have a lot of free time.

341
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:51,247
Why would you worry about her
when she's just fine?

342
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:56,417
Someone that's fine wouldn't visit
the police in the middle of the night.

343
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:57,667
That's common sense.

344
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:02,297
And victims aren't the only ones
who come to the police.

345
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:03,467
Perpetrators come too.

346
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,687
Then shall we finally have a talk?

347
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:12,057
I…

348
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:16,477
I'm sorry, but I have to be somewhere.

349
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:19,947
There's someone I agreed to meet,
and it's…

350
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:21,197
Well…

351
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,327
You have business with me.

352
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,327
I was first, so…

353
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,297
Did you hear him? I'm a bit busy.

354
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,047
All right.

355
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:09,947
By the way, who was that guy?

356
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:12,037
He looked familiar.

357
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:13,167
Beats me.

358
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:16,247
He's apparently a famous chef.
But who knows?

359
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,707
-Really?
-Yes. He's incredible.

360
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,587
He tasted bitter, sweet, sour, and salty

361
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,007
all in this one food.

362
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,637
He sure is incredible. Try some yourself.

363
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:28,967
Bitter, sweet, sour, salty…

364
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:34,597
-I think they're out to get her.
-I can't hear you.

365
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,727
-They're out to get her.
-I said I couldn't hear you.

366
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:38,107
I think the police are after her.

367
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,857
That's not true.

368
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:42,317
I need to go to the toilet.

369
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:53,827
Are you okay?

370
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,417
Of course, I am.

371
00:26:56,497 --> 00:27:00,337
You don't even know what I'm asking about,
so how could you say that?

372
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:03,627
That's because

373
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:06,547
I'm really fine about everything.

374
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,807
Excuse me.

375
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:19,977
Mom!

376
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:39,247
What's wrong with me?

377
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:42,507
You're not okay.

378
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,047
Sorry?

379
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:48,637
What happened…

380
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,217
last night?

381
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,267
I said nothing happened.

382
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:57,807
Who did this to you?

383
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,317
-Answer me.
-Why do you care?

384
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:04,397
Because I do! So who did this?

385
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,117
Let me take a look.

386
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:17,367
-Does it hurt?
-My arm is okay.

387
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:20,537
You're in a lot of pain
for this to just be a bruise.

388
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:25,337
<i>Let's take a CT scan
and see if you have any fractures.</i>

389
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:29,757
JOINT CENTER

390
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,827
I'm only saying this
in case you're worried.

391
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,207
I only have a mild fracture,
and it'll heal in a month or two.

392
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:06,507
So don't worry.

393
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:08,627
That means it'll take eight weeks to heal.

394
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:11,137
That's a serious injury.
You shouldn't take it lightly.

395
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:16,097
I won't ask who he is.
Just end it with him.

396
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:19,267
If it's your boyfriend, break up.

397
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:20,727
If it's a family member,

398
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:22,727
move out.

399
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,227
Who in the world is he?

400
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:29,487
Didn't you say you wouldn't ask?

401
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:32,367
Report him.

402
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:33,657
There's nothing to report.

403
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:37,077
Someone once said
people lie three times a day.

404
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:38,537
Another psychologist claimed

405
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,957
people lie 200 times a day.

406
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:44,287
I'm guessing that's including
the lies you tell yourself.

407
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:45,707
That many?

408
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,587
The average number doesn't matter.

409
00:29:47,757 --> 00:29:51,627
One thing for sure is that
you're well above the average.

410
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:53,467
Everything you say is a lie.

411
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:56,137
I don't lie all the time.

412
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:59,177
And even if I did,
I must have a good reason for it.

413
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:02,517
But if that reason hurts you like this…

414
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:07,567
don't just take it.

415
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,527
Ask someone for help.

416
00:30:12,907 --> 00:30:14,157
You can even ask me.

417
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:23,037
How long have you lived in Jihwa-dong?

418
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:24,747
Since I was little.

419
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:26,957
-Exactly how little?
-Are you interrogating me?

420
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,417
I'm just curious.

421
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:34,047
I don't remember.

422
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:37,807
Why can't you remember?
What's your earliest memory?

423
00:30:38,557 --> 00:30:40,347
Why are you asking these questions?

424
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:43,977
You said you liked me.

425
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:46,477
Shouldn't you be happy
that I'm interested in you?

426
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,777
Yes, I am happy.

427
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:51,777
I'm getting butterflies.

428
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:54,317
All you do is lie.

429
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,737
Let me ask you something.

430
00:31:00,907 --> 00:31:02,537
If you were attacked

431
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:07,127
by someone like I was,

432
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,377
what would you do?

433
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:11,207
Let's say it was someone close to me.

434
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,377
If this happened to my younger sister,

435
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:18,597
that attacker

436
00:31:19,597 --> 00:31:20,927
would've died by my hands.

437
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,735
<i>I've been having
the same nightmare ever since that day.</i>

438
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,375
The weather is lovely.

439
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:30,055
<i>It became harder and harder
to retrieve the fridge.</i>

440
00:33:42,985 --> 00:33:44,235
<i>But thankfully</i>

441
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:47,365
<i>and strangely enough,</i>

442
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,825
<i>they haven't opened the fridge yet.</i>

443
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:54,205
PROS OF TURNING YOURSELF IN

444
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:56,755

EVERYTHING ABOUT TURNING YOURSELF IN

449
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:12,595
It's only a matter of time
until they find out.

450
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,005
HWA PATROL UNIT

451
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,095
Hello?

452
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:52,185
Delivery?

453
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:58,015
You see, I moved.

454
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:00,105
Yes.

455
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:03,065
Okay, I'll go pick it up.

456
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:04,775
Thank you.

457
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:06,865
She came back again.

458
00:35:08,285 --> 00:35:10,535
Yesterday, and the day before too.

459
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,425
Why did you join the police?

460
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:30,265
To make ends meet.

461
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,635
Did you come here
because you knew I was here?

462
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:36,095
I would've never become a police officer
had I known I'd come here.

463
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:37,975
You're good at offending others.

464
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,645
Wait. I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

465
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,735
I wasn't trying to offend you.

466
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:49,275
I don't regret our past

467
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,945
or dislike seeing you again--

468
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:53,705
Forget it. Just stop talking.

469
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:54,995
Okay.

470
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,205
I'm your superior.

471
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,295
Answer me if you understand.

472
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:01,915
Yes, ma'am.

473
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,425
What is that? Whatever.

474
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:09,465
Oh, come on.

475
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,515
-No, thanks.
-I'm hungry.

476
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:13,175
-What do you want to eat?
-Pasta.

477
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:15,185
I knew it. I bought some already.

478
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,265
-Really?
-Yes.

479
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:18,725
No way.

480
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:43,125
Look.

481
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,845
Back then--

482
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:53,765
<i>Geumdo Villa, Mangwon-dong.</i>

483
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,925
<i>People have reported
a foul smell from there.</i>

484
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,845
Tell him we'll go.
We're probably the closest.

485
00:36:58,475 --> 00:36:59,935
<i>Which unit is available?</i>

486
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:01,685
This is patrol 11. We'll go.

487
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:33,555
<i>Are you the one who sent them?</i>

488
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:35,215
You didn't like them?

489
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:38,175
<i>I was really curious</i>

490
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:41,015
<i>why you kept throwing them away.</i>

491
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:03,165
-I can't believe this.
-Me neither.

492
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,295
There's been a murder.

493
00:38:05,545 --> 00:38:07,455
-Goodness.
-Unbelievable.

494
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,095
By the way, where do you live?

495
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:20,685
Do we live in the same neighborhood?

496
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:23,805
That one.

497
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:30,895
I live on the third floor.
The one with the white curtains.

498
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,275
I see.

499
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:49,755
GEUMDO VILLA

500
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:58,005
They're coming out!

501
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:47,515
Excuse me.

502
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,165
Where are you going?

503
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:07,995
MOTHER'S TASTE

504
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,375
Is Ms. Noh here?

505
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:17,295
Dahyun?

506
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,545
<i>Dating abuse, domestic abuse,</i>

507
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,505
<i>stalking, and revenge porn.</i>

508
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,175
<i>The number of abuse cases against women</i>

509
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:26,015
<i>has been increasing every year.</i>

510
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,145
<i>A man in his thirties, who had fled</i>

511
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:32,355
<i>after murdering a restaurant owner,
was apprehended yesterday.</i>

512
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,565
<i>The police found out that the perpetrator</i>

513
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:37,445
<i>had stalked his victim since last July.</i>

514
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:39,735
<i>At the time, the perpetrator was given</i>

515
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,535
<i>a restraining order to stay
at least 100 m away from her.</i>

516
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:44,865
<i>He was also banned
from contacting the victim</i>

517
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:48,035
<i>and was warned about stalking her.</i>

518
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,165
<i>About 30% of murder cases</i>

519
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:51,875
<i>and 20% of sexual assaults against women</i>

520
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:54,755
<i>are reported to have started off
with stalking.</i>

521
00:40:55,045 --> 00:40:58,505
<i>The women could file
for a restraining order.</i>

522
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:01,845
<i>But would a 100m restraining order</i>

523
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,385
<i>truly keep them safe?</i>

524
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:05,885
<i>It'll only take 20 seconds
for the perpetrator to reach them.</i>

525
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:09,145
<i>And the perpetrator will only be fined
for breaking the restraining order.</i>

526
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,025
<i>Dahyun?</i>

527
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,815
<i>She could be at the coffee shop
near the main road.</i>

528
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:19,695
<i>She goes there once in a while.</i>

529
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,415
What am I doing?

530
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:45,345
Ms. Noh.

531
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:50,055
-Are you okay?
-Sorry?

532
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:53,855
I mean…

533
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:56,985
It was a simple greeting.

534
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:58,605
I was wondering how you were doing.

535
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,735
Yes, I'm fine.

536
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:04,695
<i>Because I survived.</i>

537
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:15,335
<i>I was…</i>

538
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,165
<i>a survivor.</i>

539
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,175
<i>I came out alive.</i>

540
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:34,895
I'll take care of the rest.
You should go wash up.

541
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:36,645
Make me some coffee.

542
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:42,195
What is this…

543
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:44,115
Hey.

544
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:47,865
-What is this smell?
-It's the smell of a rotting body.

545
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:52,115
Can you please take a shower, Minjo?

546
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:54,535
Jeez. How could a woman--

547
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,125
Go.

548
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,965
-Take those out of your nostrils!
-Come on.

549
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:06,505
Officer Ji, how was it?
It was your first time seeing a body.

550
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:08,385
I almost died, sir.

551
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:11,305
Good work.

552
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:23,195
It seems to have been quite a while
since it rotted. Stay outside.

553
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,315
I'm okay, ma'am.

554
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:28,115
Seeing a decaying body is tough.
It's your first time.

555
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:29,485
I'm really fine.

556
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:05,985
Is this instant coffee?

557
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:07,655
Enjoy.

558
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:13,955
Here you go.

559
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:16,285
Thanks.

560
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:21,705
Here you go.

561
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:26,715
Look at this. I haven't been served coffee
in a very long time.

562
00:44:28,215 --> 00:44:30,755
Nowadays, my subordinates
don't make me any coffee.

563
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:34,765
They're so heartless and indifferent
toward those older than them.

564
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:37,685
I bet Confucius and Mencius
are turning in their graves.

565
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:40,725
But they're Chinese, and we're Korean.

566
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,065
Thanks, my dear rookie.

567
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,065
Be careful, sir.

568
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:52,695
What if I put poison in there?

569
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:02,585
That was a blood-chilling joke.

570
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:06,375
Anyway, thank you.

571
00:45:17,305 --> 00:45:18,345
Mom.

572
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:23,895
Mom?

573
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:26,105
Grandma.

574
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,815
Where are they?

575
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,585
BANKBOOK

576
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,465
<i>To Noh Dahyun, my beloved daughter.</i>

577
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:55,425
<i>I've never written you a letter before.</i>

578
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:58,095
<i>So I'm sorry that this first letter
has to be like this.</i>

579
00:45:59,475 --> 00:46:02,475
<i>But I hope you won't be sad.</i>

580
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:04,895
<i>I'm…</i>

581
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:06,815
<i>going to turn myself in.</i>

582
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:11,315
<i>I was the one who killed
that scumbag in the fridge.</i>

583
00:46:12,195 --> 00:46:13,865
<i>I put him in there single-handedly.</i>

584
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,785
<i>So I am solely responsible.</i>

585
00:46:17,495 --> 00:46:21,035
<i>Don't worry about me
and live a good life with Grandma.</i>

586
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,745
<i>I do have one favor.</i>

587
00:46:29,835 --> 00:46:31,215
<i>I hope</i>

588
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:34,635
<i>you will live a better life</i>

589
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:38,015
<i>-than I have.</i>
-Are you serious?

590
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:47,475
<i>I'd also like to make this clear.</i>

591
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:49,935
<i>Don't be sorry.</i>

592
00:46:52,695 --> 00:46:54,405
<i>Don't forget</i>

593
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:59,405
<i>that one worry for you
means a thousand more for me.</i>

594
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:01,455
I LOVE YOU, MOM
THANK YOU FOR RAISING ME

595
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,785
Done.

596
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,035
Thank you for raising me.

597
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,335
I love you, Grandma.

598
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:08,835
My baby.

599
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:12,255
I love you so much.

600
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:13,925
What's wrong? You can fold this.

601
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:16,465
Who folds their school uniform?

602
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,805
I can't believe
she'll be in middle school.

603
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:22,975
Let's take another one. One, two, three.

604
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:26,645
It's my first time wearing this. My baby.

605
00:47:26,725 --> 00:47:28,435
<i>Thank you so much</i>

606
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:31,735
<i>for being my daughter.</i>

607
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:35,065
<i>I hope you know that.</i>

608
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:40,655
<i>I will always love and adore you.</i>

609
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:43,865
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

610
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:46,875
<i>Hong Bokhee.</i>

611
00:47:52,255 --> 00:47:53,755
SAFE JIHWA, RELIABLE POLICE

612
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:58,255
How may I help you?

613
00:47:58,465 --> 00:47:59,885
You killed whom?

614
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,725
Whom did you kill, ma'am?

615
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:03,765
Mom?

616
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:05,555
Goodness.

617
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:07,355
Why are you here?

618
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:10,185
Have you gone insane?

619
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,145
Why are you here?

620
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,815
This has nothing to do with you. Go home.

621
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,485
Mom.

622
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:17,235
Didn't you hear me?

623
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:21,945
Please calm down, both of you.
Please continue what you were saying.

624
00:48:22,495 --> 00:48:24,825
You said you killed someone.

625
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:25,955
Yes, I did.

626
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:30,085
I killed that man.

627
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:34,415
So exactly who are you talking about?

628
00:48:35,255 --> 00:48:37,635
Sorry? He's…

629
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:39,755
He's…

630
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:43,215
So… I…

631
00:48:45,015 --> 00:48:46,135
My father.

632
00:48:49,265 --> 00:48:50,355
She…

633
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:52,855
killed my father.

634
00:49:00,025 --> 00:49:02,485
The sound of his beating her
is still so vivid.

635
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:06,995
You can't relate, can you?

636
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:12,625
Even after all these years,
I still can't forget it.

637
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:17,005
I'll remember it until the day I die.

638
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:19,385
It's so vivid.

639
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:21,845
She's been dreaming

640
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:25,555
of killing him every night.

641
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,055
And in the morning,

642
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,145
she'd say

643
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,645
that she had killed him.

644
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:37,025
But he died ages ago.

645
00:49:37,945 --> 00:49:39,985
She still dreamed of getting beaten.

646
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:41,155
She wanted to survive.

647
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:47,075
I know you're out of it,
but this isn't right, Mom!

648
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,865
You're just dreaming!

649
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:52,745
Please don't do this. Mom.

650
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:55,625
Don't do this!

651
00:49:57,715 --> 00:49:58,915
Is it Alzheimer's?

652
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:03,175
Mom.

653
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:07,805
Grandma.

654
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,475
Dahyun.

655
00:50:09,555 --> 00:50:10,435
Dahyun.

656
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:26,365
Are you insane?

657
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:29,995
Why would you turn yourself in?

658
00:50:30,075 --> 00:50:31,415
Then what about you?

659
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:34,835
You were going to do the same.
Why did you do that?

660
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,335
Were you really going to?

661
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:38,545
What choice did I have?

662
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,625
They were bound to find out.
I had to save her.

663
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:43,755
She still has so much to look forward to.

664
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:45,135
So I should be the one.

665
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:46,885
That's why I went.

666
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:49,765
Not you, Mom!

667
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:51,685
I won't be able to live if you go!

668
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:53,145
Bokhee.

669
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:54,975
Neither of you is going.

670
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:58,355
No. None of us are going.

671
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:00,235
I won't allow it.

672
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:04,195
I did nothing wrong.

673
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:08,035
Grandma… I'm the victim here.

674
00:51:10,705 --> 00:51:12,495
I thought long and hard.

675
00:51:13,165 --> 00:51:15,455
Even if I went back in time, I would…

676
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:18,495
No!

677
00:51:18,955 --> 00:51:20,335
Mom!

678
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:25,385
<i>I'll strive to survive.</i>

679
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,555
<i>And if my only choice is by killing him,</i>

680
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:33,305
<i>I will do it again.</i>

681
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:36,355
So let's not give up.

682
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,685
Okay? Let's find a way to stay together.

683
00:51:42,735 --> 00:51:44,155
Okay. Let's do that.

684
00:51:58,165 --> 00:51:59,295
It's okay.

685
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:02,875
-It's okay.
-Of course, it's okay.

686
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:05,965
-It's okay.
-I'm okay too.

687
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:07,965
I'm okay.

688
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:14,265
It's okay.

689
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:34,155
All right, then.

690
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:35,915
What do we do now?

691
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:49,795
<i>If push comes to shove, we'll have to…</i>

692
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,555
<i>kill him.</i>

693
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:09,195
You guys can't take a joke, can you?

694
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,575
Jeez, Mom.

695
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:15,995
Seriously, Grandma.

696
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:19,535
You're still so strong.

697
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:21,915
I'll look for a way.

698
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:26,835
I'll try to find out the passcode
or whatever to get the refrigerator back.

699
00:53:28,545 --> 00:53:29,675
At all costs.

700
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,103
We're not open yet.

701
00:53:46,893 --> 00:53:47,933
It's me.

702
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:58,943
What are you doing here so early?

703
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:02,783
What was that yesterday?

704
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:07,123
What do you mean?
It's exactly what I said.

705
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,913
Don't you know me? You can't fool me.

706
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:14,253
Come on. I'm not fooling anyone.

707
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:22,933
We'll open in a bit.

708
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,733
I'm also suspicious of that young chef.

709
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:38,943
He rented the restaurant downstairs
and even the floor above far in advance.

710
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:40,943
-The one above too?
-Yes.

711
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:42,573
But he left it vacant for a while.

712
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:45,453
He only moved in
three months into the contract.

713
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:48,373
What about the rent? Did he pay on time?

714
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:49,283
Yes.

715
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,083
He must be loaded.

716
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,963
MIJIN REAL ESTATE

717
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,513
-Goodness! Let me help.
-What?

718
00:55:10,603 --> 00:55:12,143
-Let me help a neighbor out.
-It's okay.

719
00:55:12,223 --> 00:55:13,983
-This is heavy.
-I'm surprisingly strong.

720
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:16,273
It runs in the family. Let me.

721
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:18,863
But you have a fracture. Give that back.

722
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:20,613
-Let me.
-I'm really okay.

723
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:23,823
-Give them to me.
-Don't worry and just come.

724
00:55:24,073 --> 00:55:26,663
-But you're worrying me.
-No, I'm perfectly fine.

725
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:41,553
Do you want to exchange numbers?

726
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:44,173
We can do that as neighbors, right?

727
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:45,843
Does this restaurant have a number?

728
00:55:45,923 --> 00:55:47,223
What is it? And your birthdays?

729
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,223
Mine is--

730
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:50,183
Don't tell her.

731
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:52,313
-Why not?
-Why not?

732
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:55,143
She's being suspicious.
Who knows what her motives are?

733
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:59,983
That's rich coming from you
who asked me where I used to live.

734
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:13,123
I'll tell you if you play
rock-paper-scissors with me.

735
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:17,923
What?

736
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:22,343
All right, fine.
You better keep your word.

737
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,093
Okay.

738
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:31,393
Rock-paper-scissors.

739
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,063
Rock-paper-scissors.

740
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:36,313
Rock-paper-scissors.

741
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,693
Rock-paper-scissors.

742
00:56:39,273 --> 00:56:40,313
They look like fools.

743
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:43,023
Rock-paper-scissors.

744
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:46,363
Rock-paper-scissors.

745
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:51,533
<i>It wasn't fun or fascinating.</i>

746
00:56:52,873 --> 00:56:54,083
<i>It was just childish.</i>

747
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:59,043
<i>Our so-called superpower
had only turned us into a laughingstock.</i>

748
00:56:59,123 --> 00:57:03,673
Rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:08,803
Shoot. Shoot.

750
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:16,223
<i>This can't prove anything.</i>

751
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:19,313
<i>But still…</i>

752
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,733
No.

753
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,203
<i>But now I know that I'm linked…</i>

754
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:33,743
<i>to you.</i>

755
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,293
That's enough.

756
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,463
Yes. Please stop.

757
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,373
That was unbelievable.

758
00:57:42,463 --> 00:57:44,923
We're both so competitive.
Neither of us lost.

759
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:47,713
<i>The emotions I've been feeling all along</i>

760
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,133
<i>belonged to you.</i>

761
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:52,803
So what's your number? Birthday?

It's you, the famous chef.

768
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:33,223
Right. We met at Choonok Stew.

769
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:34,843
You have a good memory.

770
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,263
Goodbye, then.

771
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:38,603
The weather is lovely.

772
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:42,603
Right.

773
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,733
Why did you come back?

774
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,753
Why did you come back
to this neighborhood?

775
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,053
It's one of you!

776
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:04,313
One of you is the culprit!

777
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:23,913
<i>They're in this neighborhood.</i>

778
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,413
<i>It's the truth.</i>

779
01:00:52,153 --> 01:00:53,573
Because rent was cheap.

780
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:56,363
That's why.

781
01:00:58,283 --> 01:00:59,113
Is that so?

782
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:02,283
The rent…

783
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:04,953
is cheap indeed.

How dare you come here?

787
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:30,063
Get out.

788
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:32,233
Get out this instant!

789
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,113
It's your fault.

790
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:40,573
It was you! You killed Gyeyoung.

791
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:43,243
You're the killer.

792
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:45,033
You should've died instead.

793
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:47,703
My poor Gyeyoung.

794
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:49,833
What will you do about her?

795
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:56,963
Mom… Dad…

796
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:04,593
My poor Gyeyoung.

797
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:09,223
Bring her back!

798
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,693
Not you.

799
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,153
My daughter.

800
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,993
Bring my baby back.

801
01:02:21,743 --> 01:02:24,873
Bring back my dear Gyeyoung.

802
01:02:26,073 --> 01:02:29,703

What?

828
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,543
Gosh, that was easy.

829
