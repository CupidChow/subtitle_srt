RECOMMENDED PRODUCT OVERVIEW

3
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>I'm busy doing a translating gig.</i>

4
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,975
<i>I'll finish up and go home safely,
so don't worry.</i>

5
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,145
She's making me blush.

6
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,655
STEW PLACE

7
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:45,995
Hello?

8
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:47,245
Yes, I reviewed it.

9
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:50,785
But the most important aspect
of the meal kit business is a heart--

10
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,755
I mean, convenience is very important.

11
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:56,755
What you've sent…

12
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:08,265
<i>Something happened to Dahyun.</i>

13
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:33,285
I had no idea…

14
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,835
Lee Jingeun was still after you.

15
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,085
I thought he had disappeared,
so I let my guard down.

16
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:40,545
It's all my fault.

17
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:46,675
-From now on--
-No. Don't apologize.

18
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:48,095
I'm at fault.

19
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,635
To be honest…

20
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,855
I know your sister.

21
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:02,565
What?

22
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,775
I think I know her.

23
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:08,995
What do you mean?

24
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,825
<i>Words are powerful.</i>

25
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,585
<i>What had been mere speculation</i>

26
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,835
<i>becomes certain</i>

27
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:21,005
<i>the moment it is verbalized.</i>

28
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:24,835
I think I have…

29
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:30,265
something to do with Gyeyoung.

30
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:38,775
Why do you think that?

31
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:41,355
Lee Jingeun said this to me.

32
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,105
What's wrong?

33
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,615
<i>You know everything too.</i>

34
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,405
He said I know everything too.

35
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:52,325
That's all there is to it?

36
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,625
Who cares
what that attention-hogging punk says?

37
00:02:56,035 --> 00:02:57,955
You're right.
That's what I thought at first too.

38
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,205
-But it's still strange.
-What is?

39
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:03,625
I have no recollection whatsoever
of your sister going missing.

40
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,715
Something so horrendous occurred
in this small neighborhood.

41
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,595
So how's it possible that I don't remember
a single thing? Isn't it strange?

42
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:14,935
It happens.

43
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:17,185
No, I don't think so.

44
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,975
I'm certain something happened to me.

45
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,985
After I met you and Lee Jingeun showed up,

46
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:29,325
I'm regaining my memory bit by bit.

47
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:30,485
Then remember it.

48
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,865
Remember it this second.

49
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:35,285
It doesn't work like that.

50
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,785
Then don't think at all until then.

51
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,125
What?

52
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,625
Don't act so rashly like this

53
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,875
ever again.

54
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,795
I said I didn't mean to.

55
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,385
I made a mistake while pondering over it.
I didn't mean to meet Lee Jingeun.

56
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:50,965
Before pondering over it
and making such a mistake,

57
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:53,465
why couldn't you discuss it with me?

58
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:57,895
It's just a mere memory.

59
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,765
Mere memory? It might have
something to do with your sis--

60
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:01,725
So what?

61
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,985
I don't want to look for my sister…

62
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,695
if it means you'll be in danger.

63
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,535
It's a fact that
you looked for Lee Jingeun

64
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,205
because I was feeling anxious
not being able to find him.

65
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,165
-That's…
-Do you even know

66
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:30,005
how I felt as I rushed over here?

67
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,175
You said you wouldn't disappear.

68
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,275
But nothing

69
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:46,775
happened.

70
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,275
Nothing…

71
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,615
happened?

72
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,695
I'm sorry for getting angry.

73
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,195
No, I should apologize.

74
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:26,035
<i>You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.</i>

75
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,665
There's a reason for that.

76
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:31,465
And you'll find out soon enough.

77
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:10,415
THE WITNESS

78
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:21,805
All right.

79
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:27,305
<i>Lee Jingeun.</i>

80
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,395
Eighteen years ago,

81
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,775
did we go to a certain house together?

82
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,565
The red gate.

83
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,415
I searched everywhere.

84
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,625
But it's been such a long time.
I'm sure things have changed.

85
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,775
Dahyun, hurry up.

86
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,445
Wait for me!

87
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,785
It's fascinating.

88
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:09,115
How does he know
every time I have a nightmare?

89
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,775
What? Where are they?

90
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,065
Mom.

91
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,985
Grandma!

92
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,575
Why are they
at the restaurant at this hour?

93
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,785
What?

94
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:54,745
Say it again.

95
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,465
That scumbag showed up again?

96
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,375
So she didn't tell you.

97
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:05,095
How did Dahyun seem earlier?
Do you remember?

98
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,385
Was she hurt at all?

99
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,675
Nothing serious,

100
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,135
but he strangled her a little.

101
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:15,815
My goodness.
She must've been so frightened.

102
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:21,025
What's wrong with you?
You'll wake up the neighbors.

103
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,945
-Bokhee.
-Don't you dare call my name!

104
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:26,155
I'll kill them all.

105
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,985
He'd better not show his face.

106
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,445
Don't even joke about it. It scares me.

107
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:34,325
Joke? Does it sound like I'm joking?

108
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,085
One or two makes no difference.

109
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:39,705
Only the first time was hard.
I can do it again.

110
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:42,875
Be quiet. I told you
not to bring that up ever again.

111
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,295
I mean every word.

112
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,045
I'll never

113
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:49,385
lose Dahyun ever again.

114
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,425
Never.

115
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:11,785
<i>Eun Gyehoon,</i>

116
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,155
how is your father?

117
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,325
Be happy, Gyehoon.

118
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,335
Like others.

119
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,595
<i>Lee Jingeun said this to me.</i>

120
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:32,845
He said I know everything too.

121
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,595
I think I know her.

122
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,685
Just stay right here, okay?

123
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,365
EPISODE 11

124
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:57,455
Thank you for the food.

125
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,755
Why aren't you telling us about yesterday?

126
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:10,465
What happened yesterday?

127
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:13,385
You really don't know?

128
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,095
No, I don't.

129
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,975
I heard that Lee Jingeun showed up again.

130
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:22,515
I heard that scumbag found you
at the library and hurt you.

131
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,485
-So what?
-"So what?"

132
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,315
You need to tell us
about such things right away.

133
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:28,445
Then what?

134
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,235
What?

135
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,525
If I tell you,

136
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,785
will you and Grandma
find Lee Jingeun and bury him?

137
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,415
Will you find him and kill him?

138
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:44,665
Dahyun, that's…

139
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,415
What are you talking about?

140
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:48,755
Why are you spewing nonsense?

141
00:12:49,505 --> 00:12:51,135
What I meant was

142
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,925
that you should tell us
if anything is going on.

143
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,675
So that Grandma and I can help you!

144
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,265
Okay, I got it.

145
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,605
Then what about you guys?
Don't you have something to tell me?

146
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:05,275
Is there anything
that I don't know or can't remember,

147
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:06,985
but should know?

148
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,485
There's no such thing.

149
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,615
Me too then.

150
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,035
It wasn't anything serious
that you should worry about, Grandma.

151
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,995
I'll tell you if I need any help,
so don't worry.

152
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:20,035
Okay.

153
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:31,965
I said I'm fine.

154
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,965
Okay. Get going then.

155
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,805
I'll be back.

156
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,565
She left.

157
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:57,905
-What?
-You should control your temper.

158
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,285
Don't blame me.

159
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,745
I was just upset.

160
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,035
Of course, I know.

161
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,955
But Mom, I think she sensed something.
Don't you think?

162
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:10,665
I don't know.

163
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,505
For our spring seasonal menu,
how does sea squirt sound?

164
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,305
We can put it in the carpaccio sauce too.

165
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,765
I'm sure it will taste good.

166
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,015
But it's hard to store
and difficult to cook.

167
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:24,225
We can cook it sous vide.

168
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:25,435
Dahyun.

169
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,065
Can you help me?

170
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,605
Yes, sure.

171
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,865
Please put each ingredient
into separate pans.

172
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,115
Yes, chef.

173
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,165
Is your neck okay?

174
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,205
It's just slightly bruised.

175
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,085
How are you feeling?

176
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:55,085
Thanks to you, I feel fine.

177
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,135
Charlie Brown said,

178
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:03,765
we should "only dread one day at a time."

179
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,765
I'm going to become simple-minded
and not worry unnecessarily.

180
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:09,645
Good idea.

181
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,605
-By the way…
-Yes?

182
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,365
Dating secretly has its thrills.

183
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,035
You're right.

184
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,665
Just pretend you can't see or hear, okay?

185
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:28,495
Why do we have to suffer
when they're the ones dating?

186
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,995
But it's entertaining to watch.

187
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,205
That's true.

188
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,885
It smells good.

189
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,885
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

190
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:06,515
Hey, there.

191
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,765
What?

192
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,225
Why are you glaring?

193
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,125
You punk.

194
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,585
What's wrong with you?

195
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,545
Lt. An was looking for you, sir.

196
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:39,925
I think it's urgent.

197
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:45,255
That darn punk.

198
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:48,765
Follow me.

199
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:58,395
What's wrong with you?
Did something happen? What is it?

200
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,235
Nothing.

201
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:04,735
Of course, there's something.
Just now and yesterday too…

202
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,445
Let's stay like this for a while.

203
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:12,955
Hey.

204
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:15,995
Don't get ahead of yourself.

205
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,665
Even though I hugged you yesterday,

206
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:21,255
there is almost no chance
our relationship will change.

207
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,755
So it's not a zero chance.

208
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:26,595
What? Yes, it is.

209
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:36,105
I have a favor. I need access
to CCTV footage off the record.

210
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:38,105
-CCTV?
-Yes.

211
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:40,605
I need to find a person named Lee Jingeun.

212
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,395
Lee Jingeun…

213
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:44,155
Oh, that one?

214
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,115
How do you know him?

215
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,655
What about you?

216
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,245
Hello?

217
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:54,665
Oh, really?

218
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,415
When?

219
00:18:58,745 --> 00:18:59,795
I see.

220
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,375
Okay.

221
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:10,765
Dahyun.

222
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:15,225
Can you come with me somewhere?

223
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,605
Sorry?

224
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:25,515
We're going to a supermarket
instead of a market?

225
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,515
Yes. I need various ingredients today.

226
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:31,225
Why?

227
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,355
Because

228
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,895
I have no idea what he likes.

229
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:41,195
So, Korean, Western, Chinese,

230
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,655
Japanese, Asian, African, and more.
I'll cook dishes from all over the world.

231
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,455
You didn't do that for me.

232
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:57,965
Of course, you're my priority.
He's just benefitting on the side.

233
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:00,635
I'm telling the truth.

234
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,185
Wait.

235
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,645
What's that?

236
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:16,605
It's called kohlrabi.
I want to try putting it in a salad.

237
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,655
-Have you seen bell peppers like these?
-Wow, never.

238
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,115
They're huge.

239
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:24,445
Meat!

240
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,655
You carry meat scoring marble nine?

241
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:29,075
-Yes, we do.
-It looks fresh.

242
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:33,455
If the meat is glossy overall
and is marbled evenly like this,

243
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:34,545
the more umami--

244
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:42,005
You look so excited.

245
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:44,505
Do I? Let's look around.

246
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,305
Are you looking for dessert wine?

247
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:52,645
Oh, yes.

248
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:56,105
That winery was established
in 1737 in London.

249
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,145
It has a very long history.

250
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,695
Then in 1831--

251
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,115
It made its way to Porto, Portugal, and
started producing port wine thereafter.

252
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:06,945
The wine you're holding
is strong and full-bodied,

253
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:08,405
and has caramel, mocha--

254
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:12,495
It has a mixed aroma of pepper, walnut,
and wood spice, and in particular…

255
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,995
This is a 2016 vintage port.

256
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,125
A good mix of balsamic and spicy scents--

257
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:21,045
It has an intense and complex aroma,

258
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,135
so you can truly enjoy
the vintage port wine.

259
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,305
Were you jealous?

260
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,845
I wasn't jealous.

261
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,845
I was just trying
to share my expert knowledge.

262
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,055
Never mind. I'll play along.

263
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,015
Play along?

264
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,895
He was handsome.

265
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,905
-Who? Who was handsome?
-What?

266
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,315
No, never mind.

267
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:45,445
Open up.

268
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:49,615
I'll take one, please.

269
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,185
Still a long way to go?

270
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:23,105
No, it's almost done.

271
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,315
-Do you want to taste it?
-Yes.

272
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:27,405
Here you go.

273
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:32,075
It's delicious.

274
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:38,205
-What else should I do?
-What? Nothing. It's almost done.

275
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:53,765
I'm not the owner, but please have a seat.

276
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:55,725
Make yourselves comfortable.

277
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:00,775
What an awkward gathering.

278
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,605
Officer Ji is looking for Lee Jingeun too.

279
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:06,735
That's right.

280
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:08,365
Let's share information.

281
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:10,405
What on earth did Lee Jingeun do

282
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:12,195
and why is he stalking you?

283
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:17,575
It's a long story.

284
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:24,335
I see. You mean,

285
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:28,385
you almost died,
so you attacked back and killed him.

286
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:30,885
No, I didn't kill him.
He's still alive after all.

287
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,175
Right. You didn't kill him.

288
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:38,055
You put Lee Jingeun in the refrigerator
thinking he was dead, right?

289
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,565
I was really torn, Officer Ji.

290
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,935
I wasn't sure if I should let someone
so dangerous roam around freely.

291
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:46,775
It's understandable.

292
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:55,285
That must've been hard.
You suffered so much.

293
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:57,245
I'll help you as much as I can.

294
00:23:58,165 --> 00:23:58,995
Thank you.

295
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,585
Then let's eat now.

296
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:08,545
By the way, this tastes good
if you wrap it in dried laver. Try it.

297
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,715
Okay. I'll figure it out.

298
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:22,315
-What's between you two?
-Tell me about it.

299
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,485
He used to follow me around
all the time when we were kids.

300
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:31,615
Hey.

301
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:33,735
No, it wasn't like that.

302
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:35,945
I never did that.

303
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:39,455
He's talking nonsense.

304
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:45,165
By the way, it's been a while
since I've had such fancy food like this.

305
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:46,835
Me too.

306
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:49,925
The last time I had it was
when we were dating. Not since then.

307
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,545
Seriously? You eat it all then.

308
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:54,345
What's between you two?

309
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:03,145
Nothing between us two.

310
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:06,105
-Yeah. You can handle it yourself.
-Okay.

311
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:07,145
Do you buy that?

312
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,315
No way.

313
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:20,665
What about you two?

314
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:28,005
We're just in lov--

315
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:29,875
-What?
-We're just work colleagues.

316
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,135
It's delicious.

317
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,365
-Well…
-Well…

318
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,705
-You can go first.
-No.

319
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:01,955
You go ahead.

320
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:04,625
Well…

321
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,835
I really enjoyed the food. Thanks.

322
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:12,175
Thanks for enjoying it.

323
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,715
Don't thank me.

324
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,345
I should be thanking you.

325
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,395
Did you go see your father?

326
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,475
How could I?
That would be so shameless of me.

327
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:33,815
About ten years ago,

328
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,525
my dad came to see me.

329
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,455
Do you remember me, Sejin?

330
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:51,085
What are you doing here?

331
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,005
Well, the thing is…

332
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:57,255
If you have nothing to say, just leave.

333
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,055
I…

334
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,845
I didn't hurt anyone.

335
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:08,225
I've never hurt anyone, Sejin.

336
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,525
I'm telling the truth. Please believe me.

337
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:20,155
I have a favor.

338
00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:25,495
Tell me. I'll do anything for you.

339
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,495
From now on,

340
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:31,795
if we happen to run into each other
whenever and wherever,

341
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:33,915
please don't act like you know me.

342
00:27:36,795 --> 00:27:38,675
Don't come see me like this ever again.

343
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:43,305
Please.

344
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,725
<i>Looking back, perhaps my dad</i>

345
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:52,935
<i>came to see me</i>

346
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,605
<i>hoping that I would
understand him more by then</i>

347
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,235
since I had become a grown-up.

348
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:05,865
But I…

349
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,535
But I still

350
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:11,995
envy you.

351
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:18,045
Isn't it odd?

352
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,925
It makes no sense.

353
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:23,135
Someone took the refrigerator?

354
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:24,555
Yes, exactly.

355
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:28,135
It was left outside to be recycled,
but it was gone before being picked up.

356
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,305
Why would anyone take it?

357
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:31,055
What refrigerator?

358
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,395
The one that Lee Jingeun was in.

359
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:35,145
It was left in front of the restaurant,
and it disappeared. Right?

360
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:36,485
Yes.

361
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,065
By any chance,

362
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:41,365
was it really big

363
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,695
with many doors?
It used to be right out in the front?

364
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:46,445
-Yes.
-That's the one.

365
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:56,545
You seemed happy earlier.

366
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:00,675
Did I?

367
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:03,595
Yes. You two seemed to get along well.

368
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,925
We used to be such close friends.

369
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:10,015
But…

370
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,805
many things happened.

371
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,855
And more than anything, I feel so bad.

372
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:20,105
I hope Ji Wontak

373
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,065
can become happy now.

374
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:25,235
I hope so too.

375
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:28,195
-So I'm thinking about it.
-About what?

376
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:30,155
I observed earlier

377
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:33,575
that he seemed awkward and uncomfortable
eating really fancy food.

378
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:38,005
He might've felt that way.
I felt like that too at first.

379
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:39,295
Right?

380
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,875
So,

381
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:46,385
I want to create a menu
that Wontak can eat comfortably.

382
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:49,725
If it were up to me, I would want him
to come eat here whenever he wants.

383
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:51,305
But knowing him, I doubt he would.

384
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:56,395
I should create a more casual menu
suitable for this business district.

385
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:00,775
Creating an ambience where one can
drink alone at night may be good.

386
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:02,735
-That sounds good.
-Doesn't it?

387
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:03,695
Yes, totally.

388
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:05,985
So I have another idea.

389
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:08,195
Yes, what else?

390
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:10,445
I'm thinking about revising the wine list.

391
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,285
Do I have to revise it?

392
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:13,995
-Well, hear me out first.
-Okay.

393
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:16,705
There are a lot more wines out there

394
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:18,745
that are more economical
and customer-friendly.

395
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:22,545
And to go with such wines,
I should create a simpler snack menu.

396
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,925
For example, <i>gambas</i>

397
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:27,925
or a simple cheese platter.
Something like that.

398
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:34,935
I finally feel better.

399
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:37,185
Let me.

400
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:40,815
What's wrong? Did something happen?

401
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:42,235
Not much.

402
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:44,775
What about you?

403
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:47,945
You don't look good either.
Is something going on?

404
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,245
Eun Gyehoon came to the market
to see me not too long ago.

405
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,365
Why?

406
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:55,575
Because I was the witness
who saw Han Euichan a long time ago.

407
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:56,875
What did you tell him?

408
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,455
I just told the truth

409
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:02,045
that I testified because of Chief Seo
even though I wasn't sure.

410
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,965
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell Eun Gyehoon,

411
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:08,095
so I told Dahyun instead.

412
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:12,215
I see.

413
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:14,685
How will I face Chief Seo now?

414
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,765
Should I just leave Jihwa-dong?

415
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,065
-What?
-Darn it.

416
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,855
-Hey, what's going on? You got here early.
-Hello.

417
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:24,485
Did you start drinking already?

418
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,905
I needed a drink badly.

419
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:30,025
-Let's talk again later.
-Okay.

420
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,785
What? Is something going on?

421
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,785
Not really.

422
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:37,165
What about you?
It seems like you're up to something.

423
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:38,955
-Me?
-Yes.

424
00:31:39,785 --> 00:31:43,125
My goodness. You're so nosy.

425
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:46,175
What now? What's bothering you this time?

426
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:50,635
The thing is that the stalker
showed up at the stew place again.

427
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,555
-The stalker?
-Yes.

428
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,345
-That guy from before?
-He showed up again?

429
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,265
Yes. Do you remember him?

430
00:31:58,055 --> 00:32:00,935
Of course. We saw him
sitting over there last time.

431
00:32:01,015 --> 00:32:04,315
Right, I remember him too.
The guy with a scar on his face.

432
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,195
-We saw him.
-Right.

433
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:08,315
Just tell them to report him.

434
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,365
The laws are better nowadays.

435
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:11,735
I guess

436
00:32:13,195 --> 00:32:14,695
the situation is a bit complicated.

437
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:15,995
Is that right?

438
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:21,335
Then there isn't much we can do.
Our hands are tied.

439
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:45,025
The refrigerator keeps coming back.

440
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:47,605
I know.

441
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,655
You don't think
there is anything inside, do you?

442
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:56,995
I doubt it.

443
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:00,325
Shall I open it?

444
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:25,395
-Sorry.
-Jeez.

445
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:28,565
I…

446
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:31,735
didn't have a fridge,
so I had brought it up.

447
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:34,365
It looked nice.

448
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:41,705
My goodness. But it's huge.

449
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:42,825
What floor does he live?

450
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:43,915
Third…

451
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:44,915
On the third floor…

452
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:53,635
<i>The restaurant is free today,
so feel free to use it as you wish.</i>

453
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:54,925
<i>You can study there.</i>

454
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:00,975
Is something going on at home?

455
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:02,845
Why would he be there all day?

456
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:13,405
Zero, four, two, three.

457
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,075
Zero, four, two, three?

458
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:19,785
I thought the passcode was his birthday.

459
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:21,905
APRIL 23

460
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,535
It's Gyehoon's birthday today.

461
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:28,795
How could I not realize
my own boyfriend's birthday?

462
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:31,875
Why didn't he say anything?

463
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:33,925
He should've told me it was his birthday.

464
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:39,555
<i>It's Gyeyoung's birthday too.</i>

465
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:05,825
Mother, I'm home.

466
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:13,375
You're here.

467
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:17,925
Yes.

468
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:23,905
What's the point of all this?

469
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,955
I don't even know
if my daughter is dead or alive somewhere.

470
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,215
That's enough, Gyehoon.

471
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:47,885
Are you hungry? Wait just a little longer.
I'm almost done.

472
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,525
Is everything well with you?

473
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:07,955
Yes, it is.

474
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:10,785
What about the restaurant?

475
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:14,245
It's going well.

476
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:17,165
Which neighborhood did you say it was?

477
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:21,835
Don't worry about it.

478
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,595
How about you, Mom?
Are you feeling okay these days?

479
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:30,935
Yes.

480
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:37,065
Are you making sure to take your medicine?

481
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:39,275
I'm trying.

482
00:37:42,945 --> 00:37:46,025
Does the food suit your taste?

483
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:48,695
Yes, it's delicious.

484
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,535
That's good to hear.

485
00:38:33,915 --> 00:38:35,495
You should get going.

486
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:39,755
I want to stay longer.

487
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:45,795
You don't have to say
things you don't mean.

488
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:51,925
<i>Even though I'm doing my best,
I still feel suffocated.</i>

489
00:38:52,975 --> 00:38:55,055
It's your birthday too.

490
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,685
I'm sure you have your own plans.

491
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,735
<i>Even though I believe she isn't,</i>

492
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,695
<i>I can't help but think
she is blaming me saying,</i>

493
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:13,245
<i>"You're off and well by yourself."</i>

494
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,255
Then I'll get going.

495
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:29,845
What about Dad?

496
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:35,015
Has he contacted you?

497
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:42,105
No.

498
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:45,485
But I think he's doing fine.

499
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:47,565
So please don't worry.

500
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:49,655
I'll go now.

501
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:51,695
<i>And</i>

502
00:39:52,695 --> 00:39:54,445
<i>I'm getting used to telling lies.</i>

503
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:11,695
I miss you.

504
00:41:13,695 --> 00:41:14,525
Who?

505
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:21,575
Who do you miss?

506
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,215
What are you doing here?

507
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,255
Well, the thing is

508
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:36,005
I came here
knowing that it was your birthday,

509
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:39,685
but I wondered if you wanted to be alone.

510
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:41,555
I missed the right timing to pop out.

511
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:44,225
Have you been waiting for me
since I was at my house?

512
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:45,855
Yes.

513
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:55,695
Should I leave?

514
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:57,535
No.

515
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:09,085
Thank you for coming.

516
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:17,255
It's so pretty.

517
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:19,975
Yes, it is.

518
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:21,515
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

519
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:25,975
But you're prettier.

520
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,435
You even know how to give compliments?

521
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:33,025
-To be honest…
-Yes?

522
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:35,905
I'm surprised at myself too.

523
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:38,825
What?

524
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:54,175
Don't you know?

525
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:56,715
If you catch a falling flower petal,
your wish will come true.

526
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,015
I'm not a little kid.

527
00:43:06,095 --> 00:43:09,105
I don't believe in
such childish, unscientific superstitions.

528
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:12,775
But I didn't have enough time
to buy you a gift,

529
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:16,195
so I was hoping
that your wish would come true.

530
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:24,245
But the thing about belief is that
it can change at any moment,

531
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:28,085
and I think today is the day to do so.
I believe it now.

532
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,625
I'll give you your real gift soon.

533
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:35,715
This is more than enough.

534
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:25,642
-Go on in.
-Okay. Good night.

535
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:56,012
<i>Gyehoon, happy birthday.</i>

536
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:58,182
<i>Look inside the refrigerator.
It's not homemade though.</i>

537
00:45:47,732 --> 00:45:49,182
It looks similar.

538
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:56,112
Why do I get such a bad feeling?

539
00:46:30,022 --> 00:46:31,692
Happy birthday, Gyeyoung.

540
00:46:33,942 --> 00:46:35,232
I promise…

541
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:39,862
I'll find you.

542
00:46:45,242 --> 00:46:46,332
Surprise.

543
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,622
Happy birthday.

544
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:53,542
Lee Jingeun.

545
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:55,672
Well,

546
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:59,302
-I came to give you a gift.
-From this moment on,

547
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:01,592
if you spew a single word of nonsense,

548
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:05,592
I'll kill you.

549
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:07,102
Jeez, I'm terrified.

550
00:47:10,722 --> 00:47:12,142
Shall we go somewhere first?

551
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:41,092
My goodness, don't glare at me like that.

552
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,422
You missed me too, didn't you?

553
00:47:44,472 --> 00:47:47,092
Yes, you're right.

554
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:49,642
I missed you a lot for a different reason.

555
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:55,482
Oh, right.

556
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:59,482
You and Noh Dahyun
looked so chummy earlier.

557
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:01,652
What?

558
00:48:03,192 --> 00:48:04,442
That's why I came.

559
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,782
I believe now is a good time to tell you.

560
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:11,792
I'll tell you everything
you want to hear, Eun Gyehoon.

561
00:48:15,912 --> 00:48:16,832
Fine.

562
00:48:17,832 --> 00:48:20,962
That day, the night you disappeared,

563
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,722
-the person that was with you--
-No. Gosh, seriously.

564
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:27,472
Much before that.

565
00:48:28,142 --> 00:48:31,472
Eighteen years ago,
the day Eun Gyeyoung disappeared.

566
00:48:31,932 --> 00:48:34,312
Let's start from what happened then.

567
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:36,942
Eighteen years ago?

568
00:48:37,022 --> 00:48:40,442
I told you. I know
what happened to Gyeyoung in the end.

569
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:43,732
What? You're not that curious?

570
00:48:46,032 --> 00:48:48,822
Of course, I am. But why now?

571
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:52,992
You've kept it to yourself all this time.
Why are you bringing it up now?

572
00:48:55,622 --> 00:48:56,962
Well,

573
00:48:57,962 --> 00:48:59,212
it's your birthday gift.

574
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:01,342
Consider it that.

575
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:05,382
Although I suppose it's not a gift
you wanted to receive.

576
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:12,102
Do you remember this?

577
00:49:26,402 --> 00:49:28,072
I really wanted it so bad.

578
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:33,412
<i>So I had been eyeing it for days.</i>

579
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:38,042
-Bye.
-Okay, take care.

580
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:39,252
Bye.

581
00:49:39,332 --> 00:49:41,292
YEONNAE STATIONERY

582
00:49:42,002 --> 00:49:43,252
<i>But one day,</i>

583
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:45,712
<i>someone approached me</i>

584
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:48,552
<i>and asked me a question.</i>

585
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:51,132
<i>"Do you want that?</i>

586
00:49:52,682 --> 00:49:54,012
<i>Do you want me to get it for you?"</i>

587
00:49:54,352 --> 00:49:56,062
Of course, I said yes.

588
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:59,942
But the person said he had a favor to ask,

589
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:04,612
and I had to do it
to get this game device.

590
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:11,742
The favor was…

591
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:24,462
Do you want to come to my house?

592
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:29,882
What…

593
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:33,472
What are you talking about?

594
00:50:36,102 --> 00:50:37,392
Tell me.

595
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:42,232
I'm asking you what happened!

596
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:48,192
Do you want to come to my house?

597
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:49,902
Why?

598
00:50:50,652 --> 00:50:53,412
It's nearby. I'll give you medication.

599
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:56,322
If you put that on, it'll heal right away.

600
00:51:27,402 --> 00:51:29,902
Is this really your house?

601
00:51:54,132 --> 00:51:55,592
Hey, Lee Jingeun!

602
00:51:56,842 --> 00:51:57,892
Where are you?

603
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:04,272
Don't joke around!

604
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:20,242
It was me.

605
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:22,742
I was the one…

606
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:25,502
who took your sister Eun Gyeyoung.

607
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:32,052
I got that game console
that you're holding

608
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:34,842
from that person back then.

609
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:52,152
You…

610
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:57,112
did that to Gyeyoung

611
00:52:58,612 --> 00:52:59,702
over this?

612
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:06,162
You took Gyeyoung over this? Did you?

613
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:08,872
How could you…

614
00:53:10,172 --> 00:53:11,252
How could you?

615
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:24,512
Who was it?

616
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:27,522
Who told you to bring Gyeyoung?

617
00:53:27,732 --> 00:53:28,562
Who was it?

618
00:53:29,562 --> 00:53:31,192
Noh Dahyun didn't tell you?

619
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:38,742
She also knows who it was.

620
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:40,782
Oh, right.

621
00:53:41,362 --> 00:53:42,742
Maybe she doesn't remember it yet.

622
00:53:43,202 --> 00:53:46,202
Or maybe she's pretending not to know
even though she does.

623
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:49,662
Aren't you curious

624
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:52,712
how she knows that person?

625
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:56,092
I already know that Dahyun
was a possible witness as well.

626
00:53:57,632 --> 00:53:58,762
What?

627
00:53:58,842 --> 00:53:59,802
A witness?

628
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,802
A wit…

629
00:55:06,782 --> 00:55:08,082
This is it.

630
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,272
<i>A witness?</i>

631
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:45,572
My goodness. You're mistaken.

632
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:48,582
Dahyun wasn't a witness.

633
00:55:50,332 --> 00:55:53,412
The game…
I didn't have any game cartridges.

634
00:55:54,412 --> 00:55:55,332
What?

635
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:58,922
I thought the console
surely came with a game,

636
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:00,302
but it didn't.

637
00:56:01,172 --> 00:56:02,302
So I…

638
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:18,522
Do you want to play with me?

639
00:56:21,942 --> 00:56:24,572
We're all playing together over there.

640
00:56:25,072 --> 00:56:26,452
You don't want to come?

641
00:56:31,282 --> 00:56:32,742
<i>So I took another.</i>

642
00:57:16,962 --> 00:57:18,162
Eun Gyeyoung.

643
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:35,722
Gyeyoung. Are you there?

644
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:18,392
I chose her.

645
00:58:19,982 --> 00:58:22,232
I chose Noh Dahyun.

646
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:25,192
But

647
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,192
we met again like this.

648
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:31,782
This is what you call fate, okay?

649
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:37,912
This is what you call fate, Eun Gyehoon!

650
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:34,972
Eun Gyeyoung.

651
00:59:38,512 --> 00:59:39,762
Gyeyoung.

<i>who made it out alive?</i>

I left her behind, Gyehoon.

that I left your sister behind.</i>
