00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,795
<i>Thinking back,</i>

3
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,933
<i>this moment was when our misfortune began.</i>

4
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,103
<i>It was the day my one and only sister
introduced me to her boyfriend.</i>

5
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,056
Eunjung, this is Lee Jingeun.

6
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,056
Jingeun, this is my sister.

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,819
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

8
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,189
Hello. I heard a lot about you.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,276
I should've visited you sooner.
I'm sorry I'm so late.

10
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,453
That's okay.

11
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,635
It's pretty.

12
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,230
Are you okay?

13
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,769
<i>Perhaps I had already sensed it
at the time.</i>

14
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,068
<i>Eunjung, I'm going to clear my head
and come back.</i>

15
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,952
<i>Then she disappeared.</i>

16
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,157
Her boyfriend seems suspicious.

17
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,742
I think they argued often
up until she went missing.

18
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,578
Maybe she was a victim of dating abuse.

19
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,963
We were going to question him later.

20
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,209
There he comes.

21
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,667
So, have you heard from Dajung yet?

22
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,965
Sir, please hurry.

23
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,426
I'm sorry if I had the wrong impression--

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,767
It's okay. That's understandable.

25
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,145
By the way…

26
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,647
Don't look for her.

27
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,736
She's never coming home.

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,701
That's my bus.

29
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,215
No.

30
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,845
Sir! Please open the door!

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,443
Stop the bus! Stop!

32
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,726
No!

33
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,441
<i>Lee Jingeun vanished after that.</i>

34
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,664
I'd like to ask you a question.
Does this guy live here?

35
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,778
He quit.

36
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,036
Then is there a way for me to contact him?

37
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,868
He never gave me his number.

38
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,584
<i>I went to all the places he went
and met those who knew him.</i>

39
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,206
<i>I wandered everywhere.</i>

40
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,965
Lee Jingeun.

41
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,511
Lee Jingeun.

42
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,182
LEE JINGEUN

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,980
Lee Jingeun.

44
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,985
I found you.

45
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,961
TASTY RESTAURANT, SECRETLY DATING, DATE

46
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,369
Who are you?

47
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,936
<i>Don't look for her.</i>

48
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>She's never coming home.</i>

49
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,824
I'm going to kill you.

50
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,406
Long time no see.

51
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,208
I'm going to kill you.

52
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,205
I'll end you myself.

53
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,551
Die!

54
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,110
Eun Gyehoon.

55
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,868
-Hey! That guy!
-What?

56
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,622
The fridge guy is back.

57
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,552
Don't stop me.

58
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,800
Don't stop me either.

59
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,591
That's enough, Lee Jingeun. Stop it.

60
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,594
Let me go!

61
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,514
I said I'd kill you if you returned.

62
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,100
-Mom.
-Mother.

63
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,680
I told you not to call me that!

64
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,862
-Put that down!
-Stop it!

65
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,816
Lee Jingeun! Put it down!

66
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,486
-Let go!
-Don't do this!

67
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,985
-Where's my knife?
-What are you doing? Stop her!

68
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,368
Move!

69
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,247
No.

70
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,843
-Hey!
-Let go of it!

71
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,636
-Let me go!
-That's enough!

72
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,716
-Let me go!
-Stop it!

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,178
-Everyone, stop.
-Mom!

74
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,057
-Lee Jingeun, stop it.
-Let me go!

75
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,654
Put that down!

76
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,018
-Let me go!
-Stop it this instant!

77
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,958
I'm the victim here!

78
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,253
She was about to stab me!

79
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,302
Is it true?

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,050
Ma'am, did you really try to stab him?

81
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,483
No.

82
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,314
That never happened.

83
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,806
Why are you making things up?

84
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,982
Let's not lie.

85
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,991
He's right.
She never tried to stab her. Right, Mom?

86
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,663
Yes. She never did that.

87
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,162
It's true. She never did.

88
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,536
I mean. Of course not.

89
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,076
She's not a thug.
Why would she try to stab anyone?

90
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,707
That never happened.

91
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,709
I'd show you the CCTV footage if I could,

92
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,087
but we haven't installed one yet.

93
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,894
And the one outside
just happens to be broken.

94
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,434
I wonder who did that.

95
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
-Eun Gyehoon.
-Even if that was the case,

96
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,608
it's hard to understand
what we just witnessed.

97
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,531
It seemed like all of you
were ganging up on him.

98
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,993
-Am I wrong?
-That was because…

99
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,881
they were all just trying to protect me.

100
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,212
Because…

101
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,433
he's my stalker.

102
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,221
The reason why I visited you many times

103
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,056
and why they always carried around tools

104
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,187
was all because of him.

105
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,813
If you need proof, I can show you.

106
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,944
Is that true?

107
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,621
What would you like to do?

108
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,751
Should we all go to the patrol unit
and find out who's at fault, Mr. Lee?

109
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,610
Don't stare at me like that!

110
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,606
You know what?

111
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,317
You'll regret this.

112
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,454
You'll be kneeling before me
and sobbing soon.

113
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,166
So don't be arrogant, Eun Gyehoon.

114
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,556
Eunjung!

115
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:58,657
THE CHILDREN OF JIHWA-DONG

116
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,451
This way.

117
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,039
Lie down.

118
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,256
Thanks.

119
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,522
Do you want to change
into something comfortable?

120
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,373
How dare you treat me like this?
You don't know anything…

121
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,868
You will regret this.

122
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,589
Isn't he… that stalker?

123
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,052
How dare you do this to me…

124
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,404
Why are you still standing there?

125
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,402
Are the police gone?

126
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,606
No, they're not.

127
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,406
Stay like that forever.

128
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,792
My leg's asleep. Darn it.

129
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,503
It's asleep.

130
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,756
Gyehoon.

131
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,472
What's going on?

132
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,894
Tell me.

133
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,057
Why did Eunjung
try to stab Dahyun's stalker?

134
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,679
She must've had her reasons.

135
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,846
And why were Dahyun's family
wielding their tools?

136
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,645
They had their reasons too.

137
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,105
Gyehoon, tell me.
Don't leave me in the dark.

138
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,638
Where are you going?

139
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,816
Don't you have a ton of questions for me?

140
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,026
I do.

141
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,071
What's the point of delaying it? Ask away.

142
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,720
I thought Jingeun was your brother.

143
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,431
I used to have a younger sister.

144
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,771
She used to date him.

145
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,356
Then she suddenly disappeared.

146
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,319
He probably…

147
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,914
murdered her.

148
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,367
I'm sure it was him.

149
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,868
I just know he did it.

150
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,170
But I can't do anything
due to a lack of evidence.

151
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,394
I thought

152
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,520
you were hiding him away.

153
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:39,686
-What?
-I thought you'd at least be in touch.

154
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,732
I thought you two were close.

155
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,322
<i>The posts on his social media seemed odd.</i>

156
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,525
<i>And you had my sister's scarf.</i>

157
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,987
Lee Jingeun is going to come back anyway.

158
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,908
-I don't want to wait--
-Jeez.

159
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,916
<i>You even said some suspicious things.</i>

160
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,672
<i>Plus…</i>

161
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,090
Plus?

162
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,998
Your family was suspicious too.

163
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,046
-She's talking about you.
-You were the strange one.

164
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,221
I'm sorry.

165
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,508
I must've been insane.

166
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,427
The moment I started thinking like that,
everything seemed to be that way.

167
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,274
It never even crossed my mind
that you could've been

168
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,144
a victim as well.

169
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,309
That's okay.

170
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,648
I almost killed you.

171
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,145
You're right. You almost killed me.

172
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,448
To be honest,
your glare is still terrifying.

173
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,451
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,498
Silly me.

175
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,125
I hope

176
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,593
that…

177
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,795
you get to find your sister.

178
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,184
I did.

179
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,227
Hunches can be really scary.

180
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,978
For some reason,

181
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,653
<i>I just couldn't take my eyes
off of that news report.</i>

182
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,574
<i>The police called.</i>

183
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,993
They said…

184
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,697
they had found Dajung.

185
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,212
They wanted me to confirm it.

186
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,328
But you see,

187
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,504
there wasn't much to check.

188
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,546
There wasn't much left of her.

189
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,590
Gosh.

190
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,140
I take that back.

191
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,558
I should be grateful
that she was found, right?

192
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,226
I should be very thankful.

193
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,899
Right?

194
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,585
What? He already cleaned up.

195
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,022
Is Chef Lee okay?

196
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,194
Yes, she is. Goodbye.

197
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,233
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you…

198
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,395
about her.

199
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,526
I had only found out yesterday
from a fellow chef.

200
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,581
But I had no time to tell you.

201
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,541
-You don't need to explain yourself.
-If I don't,

202
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,422
it could turn into a lie.

203
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,630
You pretended not to know
and tried to hide what happened.

204
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,631
That's a lie in a way.

205
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,088
And I can't stand such lies

206
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,375
<i>anymore.</i>

207
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,144
I wasn't feigning ignorance

208
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,601
or pretending to be fine.

209
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,185
You have a good memory.

210
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,938
But you forgot the most important part.

211
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,940
That it's over between us.

212
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,441
I asked you not to meddle in my affairs

213
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,357
especially if it was about Lee Jingeun.

214
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,697
But what have you done?
You intervened today.

215
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,663
Then was I to just sit still and watch?

216
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,833
Yes.

217
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,081
Then he wouldn't have said

218
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,213
that you'd regret it

219
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,789
or kneel and sob before him.

220
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,795
-If something happens to you, then I--
-That won't happen.

221
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,379
I won't die. I won't get hurt.

222
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,549
That guy…

223
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,049
won't be able to harm me.

224
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,929
So don't worry about me.

225
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,477
Would you like to eat something?

226
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,648
What are you craving?

227
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,905
Don't make me laugh.

228
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,746
It's too late.

229
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,587
<i>That day…</i>

230
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,549
I like you

231
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,763
I mean, I liked you.

232
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,803
<i>I made a ridiculous love confession.</i>

233
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,216
Let's end it.

234
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,265
I want to end things between us.

235
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,142
<i>And I had a ridiculous break-up.</i>

236
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,907
<i>Then I regretted my ridiculous behavior.</i>

237
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,922
<i>And I let go…
of the ridiculous hope that I had.</i>

238
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,513
<i>Then I made a not-so-ridiculous decision.</i>

239
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,756
<i>"I will never get swayed again."</i>

240
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,312
I'll hand in
my resignation letter tomorrow.

241
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,062
Please handle it as soon as possible.

242
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,491
Okay.

243
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,501
I'll consider that.

244
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:17,058
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

245
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,621
What are you doing?

246
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,708
Cooking, what else?

247
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,423
My, what is the world coming to?

248
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,674
You're actually cooking.

249
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,132
What do you think? Not bad, right?

250
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,561
-Look at this.
-Let me see.

251
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,058
Look.

252
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,930
How are you this good, my puppy?

253
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,727
Goodness, it looks so pretty.

254
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,572
-Does it?
-Of course.

255
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,396
I agree. What a pretty sight.

256
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,237
Good going.

257
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,242
Mom, I'm holding a knife.

258
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,954
I worked like a dog
to pay for your college tuition.

259
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,615
And all you've learned is how to chop
zucchinis across the street?

260
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,665
You'll be the death of me.

261
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:22,168
Perhaps things like this are what matter
the most in life. You have no idea.

262
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,552
Did college teach you how to talk back?

263
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,168
Yes, and I'll be getting
a master's on it too.

264
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,795
Is that so?

265
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,586
-Right. You.
-What is it this time?

266
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,967
What did you mean yesterday?

267
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,099
You went to the police again?

268
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,064
What about you?

269
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,232
When did you tell Lee Jingeun
not to call you Mother?

270
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,977
I asked you first. Answer me.

271
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,527
Did you guys meet him
behind my back? Seriously?

272
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,279
You drive me crazy.

273
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,033
I could say the same about you.

274
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,405
-I told you to stay away from him.
-I told you not to turn yourself in.

275
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,793
-So how could you secretly meet him?
-Why didn't you listen?

276
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,750
Be quiet.

277
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,829
-Don't you agree, Grandma?
-She's crazy. What should I do?

278
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,495
-She'll be the death of me.
-I ought to lock her up.

279
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,883
-Shut it.
-Look.

280
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,089
-Hear me out.
-She kept--

281
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,339
Zip it up, will you?

282
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,925
Unbelievable.

283
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,564
No, I mean, hello.

284
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,470
I'm sorry.

285
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,311
It felt like I was watching a sitcom.

286
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,033
You're all so adorable.

287
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,291
So this is how it feels
not to sleep a wink.

288
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,223
Gyehoon.

289
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,299
It's an emergency.

290
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,306
Do you have any eye drops? Do you?

291
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,022
Aren't you curious about why I need them?

292
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,481
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

293
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,355
What you told me yesterday
was too shocking.

294
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,820
I was so stunned.

295
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,742
Now that I'm aware of everything,

296
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,276
I don't see them the same way anymore.

297
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,077
My world has turned upside down.

298
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,709
Look at that glass.

299
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,297
It's top quality.

300
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,722
We bought the most expensive one.

301
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,981
I think it's thinner
than the previous one.

302
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,265
You're wrong.

303
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,561
It looks great.

304
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,854
Don't leave your print on it.

305
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,192
We won't break it again.

306
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,823
I'm not too sure about that.

307
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,939
Not for the third time.

308
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,493
You idiot.

309
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,033
I knew it.

310
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,869
<i>No matter the reason,</i>

311
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,119
<i>these two shoved a man</i>

312
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,247
<i>into a fridge.</i>

313
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,787
<i>And also her.</i>

314
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,588
<i>And Eunjung tried
to stab someone with a knife.</i>

315
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,847
-Isn't that heavy?
-No, I'm fine.

316
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,232
Have <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

317
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,019
-I had it yesterday.
-Then have <i>jjamppong</i>.

318
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,058
-I want <i>budaejjigae</i>.
-Hello.

319
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,517
Sure, hi.

320
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:34,237
<i>That man ran someone over
and tried to bury him.</i>

321
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,156
It's freezing.

322
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,119
Hurry up!

323
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,731
<i>Life is a horror movie.</i>

324
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,193
<i>Will we be able
to get out of this neighborhood alive?</i>

325
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,817
I'd like…

326
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,539
to quit.

327
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,249
Really?

328
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,754
I would only be a headache
if I continued to work here.

329
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,337
And I can't guarantee you
that I wouldn't try to stab him again.

330
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,677
I don't mind it.

331
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,429
You can do anything you want.

332
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,353
However, just don't do anything here.

333
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,307
That's all I ask of you.

334
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,023
But I'm not confident
that I'll behave here.

335
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,278
That wasn't a joke?

336
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,327
Go home and rest for the day.
We can talk again next time.

337
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,712
Me too.

338
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,709
I'd like to quit today.

339
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,731
You can't.

340
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,274
-What?
-I said no.

341
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,150
You said you'd consider it.

342
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,441
I did, and I decline.

343
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,322
-What?
-This is a workplace.

344
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,242
I never said that.

345
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,030
It's not someplace
you can come and go as you please.

346
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,115
An employee could have a situation arise.

347
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,201
The employment contract
should be taken seriously.

348
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,786
Did I sign a slave contract?

349
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,081
No, it was a regular employment contract.

350
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,575
-Did I sign it in blood?
-No, you used a pen.

351
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,337
-Are you kidding me?
-Who?

352
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,843
Me?

353
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,514
I'm serious right now.

354
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,554
Likewise.

355
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,012
Both of you

356
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,814
will have to stay here
until your contract is terminated.

357
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,403
Chef Lee, take as much time as you need
before coming back to work.

358
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,282
As for Ms. Noh,
come to work exactly on time

359
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,649
and don't clock out early.

360
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,071
Make sure you work full-time.

361
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,291
Aren't you curious about how I'm feeling?

362
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,336
I would if I were you.

363
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,009
It's obvious.

364
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,219
I'm glad I found my sister.

365
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,759
But I'm also in pain
since there's no hope anymore.

366
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,218
They come and go.

367
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,436
But still,

368
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,766
I'm able to laugh and have fun
if I see something funny.

369
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,647
That's good.

370
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,323
This morning…

371
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,115
-Please eat.
-Okay.

372
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,868
-Eat up.
-Okay.

373
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,291
Thank you for the meal.

374
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,872
Jeez.

375
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,046
Is this eggplant?

376
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,262
<i>The eggplant was like snot.</i>

377
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,053
Everything was a mess.

378
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,852
But I could tell
that they wanted to feed me well.

379
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,685
They told me to come over often
to eat and sleep.

380
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,193
But I'm not going to.

381
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,480
Why not?

382
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,324
Because I might fool myself
into thinking I could be happy.

383
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:54,121
Just because I finally found my sister…

384
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,131
doesn't mean the rage and hatred
have gone away.

385
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,945
-Where's Dahyun?
-She clocked out

386
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,866
at 7 p.m. precisely, not a second sooner.

387
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,452
Did she go home?

388
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,616
No. She went with someone who was waiting
for her in front of the restaurant.

389
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,754
What?

390
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,464
Could it be--

391
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,670
It was a woman.

392
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,419
Who could it be?

393
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,720
Is something going on between you two?

394
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,469
Why does she want to quit out of the blue?

395
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,444
You do know she likes you, right?

396
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,453
I know.

397
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,776
What about you?

398
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,830
Don't you like her too?

399
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,037
What difference would it make if I did?

400
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,835
That was delicious.

401
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,641
Not bad.

402
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,429
-Sir, two more beers filled to the brim.
-Okay.

403
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,144
You're not bad yourself.

404
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,189
Why did you come see me?

405
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:47,067
You should've asked the police
for help if you were being stalked.

406
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,993
Would that have changed anything?

407
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,410
We could've filed a restraining order
or protected you.

408
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,584
You could've also gotten a smartwatch
to call us whenever you needed to.

409
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,584
I often see victims

410
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,792
on the news who suffered
even though they did those things.

411
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,882
Well, there are such cases too.
But still--

412
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,972
I was scared he'd retaliate
if he knew I reported him.

413
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,799
And…

414
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,510
I was also afraid
he might harm others too.

415
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,266
There are lunatics who threaten
and harm the victim's family or friends.

416
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,522
I was worried about my mom and grandma.

417
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,478
And…

418
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,436
And?

419
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,070
And…

420
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,113
Do you have more family members?

421
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,004
Yes. My terrible boss.

422
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,966
I'd still like you to report him.
He deserves punishment.

423
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,007
I will.

424
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,850
And…

425
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,522
-I'll turn myself in.
-Good thinking--

426
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,599
Turn yourself in?

427
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,446
PROMOTIONAL PROPOSAL FOR CAVIAR

428
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,592
Does she even know what time it is?

429
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,677
Where in the world is this brat,
and why isn't she picking up?

430
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,610
Why is she holding that bat?

431
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,104
Hey, terrible boss. Why are you out here?

432
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,562
Why are you out alone at this hour?

433
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,527
What's going on? You look like Gyehoon,
but sound like my mom.

434
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,790
You obviously had a drink.

435
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,957
How could you drink
when you need to be extremely careful

436
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,547
at times like this?

437
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,132
I wasn't alone.

438
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,637
I was with a police officer. Happy?

439
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,178
A police officer?
Did you do something again?

440
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,433
No, I didn't.

441
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,024
Goodbye then.

442
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,983
It's just too strange.

443
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,950
Are you a pervert?

444
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,081
Why would you suddenly call me that?

445
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,964
You can't keep making me feel confused.

446
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,421
You act friendly one minute
then ice-cold another.

447
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,207
What's it to you
whether or not I come home?

448
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,510
Because I feel the same way.

449
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,846
What do you mean?

450
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,221
If something

451
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,137
happens to you while I'm away…

452
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,361
I'd feel bad.

453
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,324
Why?

454
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,792
Why would you feel bad?

455
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,666
Talk about humanism once again,
and I'll kill you.

456
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,745
Answer me.

457
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:22,973
Do you like me?

458
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,635
Or are you scared I'd disappear?

459
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,139
What if I am?

460
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,359
Dahyun!

461
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,488
Dahyun!

462
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,717
I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,138
I won't disappear.

464
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,136
Hey, good--

465
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,685
Something just passed me by.

466
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,233
About the Geumdo Villa murder case.

467
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,436
-Geumdo Villa?
-Yes.

468
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,395
Minjo, I was talking to you--

469
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,986
Who was the officer in charge?

470
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,702
I've identified a man
who might've lived there.

471
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,701
Where do you live?

472
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,155
I live on the third floor.
The one with the white curtains.

473
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,285
GEUMDO VILLA

474
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,171
<i>Since we've identified a suspect,</i>

475
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,499
we could compare his DNA
to the one found at the crime scene.

476
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,795
-Who is he?
-Before that,

477
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,342
who told you that?

478
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,512
How did you find this out?

479
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,469
It was from an anonymous tip.

480
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,432
-Anonymous?
-Yes.

481
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,930
Make sure you get the facts straight.

482
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,060
If not, you could be
accusing an innocent civilian.

483
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,353
That individual's future is on the line.

484
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:03,694
I'm just saying you shouldn't be swayed
by false reports, that's all.

485
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,686
Okay?

486
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,040
-What is it?
-Don't tell me

487
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,201
you were laughing at me.

488
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,379
Did I laugh just now?

489
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,709
You little--

490
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,549
Aren't you craving a late-night snack?

491
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,759
It's on me.

492
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,422
-Really?
-Yes.

493
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,341
Officer Ji, why are you still here?

494
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,547
-Go home.
-Yes, ma'am.

495
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,354
Darn it.

496
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,530
<i>If something
happens to you while I'm away,</i>

497
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,991
I'd feel bad.

498
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,531
I'm not going anywhere.

499
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,657
I won't disappear.

500
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,791
He looked like a kid who just got hurt.

501
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,247
What? Oh, no! What do I do?

502
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,299
I'm late!

503
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,139
Come home early and pick up your phone.

504
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,048
Okay.

505
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,934
I looked for you all night
with a bat in my hand.

506
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,136
Why would you go out all by yourself?

507
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,146
And don't carry around a bat.

508
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,478
It's all because of you.

509
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,943
Here. You didn't get much sleep. Eat up.

510
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,534
-I'm late. It's okay.
-Good girl.

511
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,324
-I'm off!
-Have one more.

512
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,413
-What's with her?
-Bye!

513
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,819
Sorry about that.

514
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,718
Three minutes tardy.

515
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,293
Look at those lovebirds.

516
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,410
It's my day off,
so I'm headed to the library.

517
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,617
Are you eating well?

518
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,665
My mom and grandma wanted
to give you some porridge.

519
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,212
Porridge? No, that's okay.

520
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,257
That's really okay.

521
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,799
I eat well. I'm a chef after all.

522
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,430
-That's true.
<i>-By the way, honey,</i>

523
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,184
have you ever visited
Lee Jingeun's social media page?

524
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,852
Yes. I didn't look at it
too closely though.

525
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,935
Then can you take a good look at it?

526
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,324
Something just feels off.

527
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,065
POSTS

528

DESTINED AND REUNITED
I RECOGNIZED YOU RIGHT AWAY

529
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,332
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE,
FINALLY DATING, DESTINY

530
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,249
A NOSTALGIC PLACE
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY?

531
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,291
What does this all mean?

532
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,625
<i>When did I first</i>

533
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,916
come into your life?

534
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,506
Are you sure you remember it correctly?

535
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,511
Dahyun.

536
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:01,096
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

537
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,137
<i>Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?</i>

538
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,226
Eun Gyehoon. You'll regret this.

539
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:12,019
You'll be kneeling before me
and sobbing soon.

540
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,898
So don't act
like you're all that, Gyehoon.

541
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,862
I found you.

542
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,115
STEW PLACE

543
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,245
Yes, what is it?

544
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,215
You want to talk with me?

545
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,636
Why did you run over here?

546
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,481
What's the emergency?

547
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,611
This is just a suspicion of mine.

548
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,324
Lee Jingeun may have lived
in Jihwa-dong when he was little.

549
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,322
Although I don't remember,

550
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,533
we may have known each other in the past.

551
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,195
What do you mean?

552
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,288
A NOSTALGIC PLACE
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY?

553
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,998
Do you not remember anything?

554
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,761
What about you? You used to live here too.

555
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,256
Nothing rings a bell.

556
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,935
Something did bother me.

557
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,611
<i>Don't act like you're all that, Gyehoon.</i>

558
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,191
Don't act like you're all that, Gyehoon.

559
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,317
Don't act like you're all that, Gyehoon.

560
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,485
So don't act
like you're all that, Gyehoon.

561
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,237
-Put on your seatbelt.
-What?

562
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,385
My mom and aunt
aren't home right now. You can come in.

563
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,640
Okay.

564
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,526
Wait here while I look for something.

565
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,533
Do you want anything to drink?

566
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,080
May I have a glass of water?

567
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,246
Sure.

568
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,271
Here--

569
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,900
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

570
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,704
Wait here.

571
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,456
That's me.

572
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,680
<i>Guys, slow down!</i>

573
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,555
Do you want to play with us?

574
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,442
Hi, I'm Eun Gyeyoung.

575
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,161
Eun Gyeyoung and I…

576
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,658
were in the same class.

577
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,545
Dahyun.

578
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,762
Did I startle you?

579
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,479
I'm sorry for barging in here.

580
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,765
We had moved to forget about Gyeyoung.

581
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,687
But then my mom
decorated this room exactly like hers.

582
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,325
Did you know

583
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,455
my sister?

584
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,333
I didn't really know her.

585
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,541
But…

586
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:01,981
Let's go.

587
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,055
Lee Jingeun had gone
to the same school as we did.

588
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,152
And there was…

589
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,361
someone else too.

590
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,816
Someone else?

591
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,949
-Go in first.
-What about you?

592
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:24,492
<i>There's this amazing boy,
but I don't remember anything about him.</i>

593
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,998
<i>He always came to my rescue.</i>

594
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,246
<i>I think he must've liked me.</i>

595
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,876
Are you okay?

596
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,553
That kid…

597
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,259
was Eun Gyehoon.

598
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,881
It's been a while. How have you been?

599
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,879
I don't think you and I were ever close.

600
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,011
That's true.

601
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,763
But you were pretty famous back then.

602
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,555
Han Sejin, the son of a murderer.

603
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,108
<i>Actually…</i>

604
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,277
<i>my dad had…</i>

605
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,284
<i>blood on his clothes.</i>

606
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,817
But now, your name is Ji Wontak.

607
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,740
Look at that.
You even changed your surname.

608
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,236
Just cut to the chase.

609
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,287
Why did you want to see me?

610
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,125
You don't like Eun Gyehoon, do you?

611
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:07,141
-What?
-I want to get rid of him.

612
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,352
Thanks to him, you guys ran away
in the middle of the night

613
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,517
after your dad became a murderer
and you, a murderer's son.

614
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,693
Don't you despise him?

615
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,020
How is that even possible?

616
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,397
That's enough.

617
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,450
And who says my dad isn't guilty?

618
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,656
He's a murderer, and I'm a murderer's son.

619
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,454
It's the truth.

620
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,828
So what?

621
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,830
That's not true.

622
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,586
You got it all wrong.

623
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,843
Did you really think
your dad was a murderer?

624
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,012
You're unbelievable.

625
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,354
That's not true.

626
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,557
Do you know why?

627
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,557
Because I was there that day.

628
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,284
I saw it all.

629
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,452
What?

630
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,239
This is all because of Eun Gyehoon--

631
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,870
It's all his fault.

632
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,480
<i>So we were all…</i>

633
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,321
I'm Noh Dahyun, a new transfer student.

634
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,910
I hope we get along.

635
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,495
-Goal!
-Yes!

636
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,215
Gyeyoung.

637
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,135
-Eun Gyeyoung.
-Gyeyoung!

638
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,555
Say it! I said, say it!

639
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,314
Say it! I said, say it!

640
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,147
Say it!

641
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,349
What brings you to Jihwa-dong?

642
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:58,982
I'm going to live here.

643
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,689
I'm policeman Ji Wontak. I was
just transferred to the Jihwa Patrol Unit.

644
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,728
All right!

645
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,208
I told you to get out of my way. Jeez.

646
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,920
<i>We were all the children of Jihwa-dong.</i>

647
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,920
<i>Four of us grew up to become adults.</i>

648
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,818
<i>And…</i>

649
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,464
<i>one who couldn't grow up.</i>

650
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,720
<i>Go in first.</i>

651
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,176
<i>What about you?</i>

652
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,016
Don't tell me

653
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,146
he's meeting Lee Jingeun.

654
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,150
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

655
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,950
Do you finally remember who I am?

656
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,541
Unfortunately, I do.

657
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,043
But you're a scumbag
who doesn't deserve to be remembered.

658
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,548
I just can't forget you.

659
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,299
Do you know why?

660
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,304
You were too busy having fun
that you had no idea

661
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,894
your injured sister
was being dragged somewhere.

662
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,508
So how could I forget you?

663
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,847
Enough with this nonsense.

664
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,153
Tell me.

665
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,614
What's this garbage about?

666
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:57,145
<i>I know who took your sister.</i>

667
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,027
If this is a joke,

668
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,414
you will pay for it.

669
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,333
Answer me.

670
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,499
And if I do, will you believe me?

671
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,547
I want to tell you the truth,

672
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,134
but I'm worried you won't believe me.

673
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,415
Don't play word games with me.

674
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,928
It's your fault for leaving
your injured sister all by herself.

675
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,734
Hey, you're making me
not want to tell you.

676
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,686
You're exactly as I expected.

677
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,443
You know nothing.

678
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,573
You just want to rub salt
into my wound, don't you?

679
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,191
What a load of bull.

680
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,946
-That's enough.
-Let go.

681
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,677
Officer, are you just going to watch?

682
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:13,940
Bastard.

683
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,981
You jerk.

684
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,146
That's enough.

685
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,243
-Stop it or I'll arrest you.
-Let go of me!

686
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,155
Darn it.

687
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,787
You little…

688
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,535
I told you to stop.

689
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,133
Hey, come at me.

690
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,053
-That's enough.
-Hey.

691
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,005
Just stop it, will you?

692
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,597
Just cut to the chase.
My patience is running low.

693
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,650
How boring.

694
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,235
I'm just happy

695
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,368
that we've reunited once again.

696
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,634
And Gyehoon, I'm not lying.

697
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:25,222
I know who took your sister.

698
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,890
Are you still talking about that?

699
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,509
Let me go!

700
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,095
Hey, you.

701
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:31,808
Hey.

702
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,016
I love your expression.

703
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,402
Come on!

704
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,194
All right.

705
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,777
Once you're willing
to kneel before me and beg,

706
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,862
we can talk again.

707
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,243
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Come back.

708
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,914
Just stop it!

709
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,922

<i>What difference would it make

717
