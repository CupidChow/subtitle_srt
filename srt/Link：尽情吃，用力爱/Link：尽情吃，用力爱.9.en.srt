00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,372
Did you have a nightmare again?

3
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,695
It's okay.

4
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,285
It means you're growing.

5
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,039
Other kids dream
about falling from high places.

6
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,495
But I always have the same dream, Grandma.

7
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,260
<i>Where on earth is that place?</i>

8
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,350
<i>Whenever that happened, my grandma
told me all sorts of fairy tales.</i>

9
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,180
…and the nice girl
married into a wealthy family.

10
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,057
<i>-All stories had one thing in common.</i>
-One day, a monk was passing by.

11
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,439
The monk said to the nice daughter-in-law,

12
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,074
"Don't ever turn around.

13
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,071
If you do…"

14
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,528
<i>You either turn into stone…</i>

15
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,662
God said to Lot,

16
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,624
"Don't ever turn around.

17
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,464
If you do…"

18
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,674
<i>…or a pillar of salt in those stories.</i>

19
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,558
<i>Why in the world
do I keep dreaming of the same thing?</i>

20
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,978
<i>Every time I got scared or curious</i>

21
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,149
<i>about the meaning of this dream,
my grandma said to me…</i>

22
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,033
Don't turn around, my child.

23
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,244
Don't turn around, Dahyun.

24
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,922
Having too much on your mind
will make you ill.

25
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,959
Dahyun, do you know why
people can walk well facing forward,

26
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,634
but not backward? Do you?

27
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,795
And why do you think you have eyes
in the front and not in the back?

28
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,099
Jeez, Grandma. You've said that
ten million times already.

29
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,469
-Have I?
-Yes.

30
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,431
<i>"Don't let useless regrets
or worries get to you</i>

31
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,685
<i>and just keep moving forward.</i>

32
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,270
<i>Live for today."</i>

33
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,192
<i>But…</i>

34
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,741
That's me.

35
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,412
<i>Do you want to play with us?</i>

36
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,709
Hi, I'm Eun Gyeyoung.

37
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,169
<i>What should I do, Grandma?</i>

38
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,722
<i>My past…</i>

39
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,215
<i>is haunting me.</i>

40
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:27,179
DON'T TURN AROUND

41
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,705
Are you still talking about that?

42
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,843
Once you're willing
to kneel before me and beg,

43
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,091
-we can talk again.
-Let me go!

44
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,136
-Hey, where do you think you're going?
-I said that's enough!

45
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,426
Are you going to fight to the death?

46
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,532
Hey, this really is a reunion.

47
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,162
Do you finally remember me?

48
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,748
No.

49
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,712
I don't.

50
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,221
Lee Jingeun.

51
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,796
I'm going, you punk.

52
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,314
Call me.

53
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,533
Wait here.

54
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,031
Han Sejin.

55
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,794
Sorry for not recognizing you.

56
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,875
No thanks.

57
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,796
I no longer want to be involved
in your affairs, so just keep ignoring me.

58
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,858
You just wait.
You guys will end up looking for me.

59
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,362
Desperately.

60
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,413
Did you really think
your dad was a murderer?

61
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,616
That's not true. Do you know why?

62
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,915
Because I was there that day.

63
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,224
JUNKYARD

64
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,688
Darn it. Why did I come here?

65
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,482
You were too busy having fun
that you had no idea

66
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,772
your injured sister
was being dragged somewhere.

67
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,696
I know who took your sister.

68
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,034
What are you thinking about?

69
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,575
Lee Jingeun said some strange things.

70
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,213
He said that on the day she disappeared,

71
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,590
Gyeyoung was hurt

72
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,998
and that he knew who took her.

73
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,133
She was hurt?

74
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,264
No.

75
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,298
Lee Jingeun likes the attention.

76
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,636
You're right.

77
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,769
He enjoys drawing attention to himself
by rubbing salt into others' wounds.

78
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,809
If I react to this,
it'd just make him more excited.

79
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,614
But do you feel uneasy?

80
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,742
By the way, what did he say to you?

81
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,414
Nothing much. I won't let
what that lunatic said get to me.

82
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,169
-What's wrong?
-Jerk!

83
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,130
-Me?
-No, Lee Jingeun.

84
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,795
He completely messed up your face.

85
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,430
Did he?

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,852
I said I'd kill that scumbag
if he touched you.

87
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,437
By the way, did you just say, "me?"

88
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,686
Sorry?

89
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,151
When I said, "jerk,"

90
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,025
-you asked, "me?"
-That's because…

91
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,866
I guess you do feel quite guilty.

92
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,201
You have a conscience at least.

93
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,913
-That's…
-Come on. Let me treat you.

94
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,089
Why did you stop midway?

95
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,011
I'm already done.

96
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,351
Let me see it.

97
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,678
-It's okay.
-What if it leaves a scar?

98
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,542
Were you close to Mr. Ji Wontak?

99
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,875
We were best friends at one point.

100
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,336
Oh, I see.

101
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,296
But he changed his name,

102
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,854
and I forgot all the kids
from elementary school.

103
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,810
But once I realized that I knew them,
the memories flooded back.

104
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,356
I remember Han Sejin,
I mean, Ji Wontak, Lee Jingeun,

105
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,360
and everyone else too.

106
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,898
What about me?

107
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,988
You don't remember me?

108
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,464
I guess not.

109
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,183
But I don't have
a good memory to begin with.

110
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,216
I can't remember
people's faces in particular--

111
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,056
But didn't you say a minute ago
that you started remembering everyone?

112
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,951
It's fine. I don't remember you either.

113
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,281
Jeez. You're no different…

114
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,084
We're even then.

115
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,462
Good for you.

116
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,547
-Can you be more gentle?
-You're a crybaby, aren't you?

117
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,878
I'm not a crybaby.

118
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,303
Why does it hurt now? It didn't hurt
when I actually got hit earlier.

119
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,177
That's why you're a crybaby.

120
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,887
I can handle pain.
I'm just not good with these minor ones.

121
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,399
My first love used to be cool,
not like this.

122
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,397
Your first… What?

123
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,906
I remembered my first love
looking through the album.

124
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,617
<i>Who was it?</i>

125
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,495
<i>Eun Gyehoon.</i>

126
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,120
<i>It's you.</i>

127
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,459
But you were just a snotty little kid
in elementary school. First love, my foot.

128
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,424
-I wasn't snotty.
-You were still a little kid.

129
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,005
He was a real cool heartthrob.

130
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,630
-I'm sure he's changed for the worse.
-I doubt it.

131
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,178
People tend to romanticize their past.

132
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,973
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous? No way.

133
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,725
-That's enough now.
-Just a little more.

134
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,236
How dare he mess up this face
I cherish so much, that jerk…

135
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,743
<i>What am I spewing?</i>

136
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,960
Don't laugh.

137
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,378
Okay.

138
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,779
How is the preparation coming along?

139
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,321
What do I do?

140
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,949
-What are you doing?
-What do I do…

141
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,786
-Hello.
-Hi.

142
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,325
-What are you doing?
-Can you hang out with me?

143
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,634
-Doing what?
-I feel dizzy.

144
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,627
I don't know,
but I really want to hang out.

145
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,881
But we need to go home.

146
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,686
All done.

147
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,577
Does Lee Jingeun bother you?

148
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,706
Kind of.

149
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,088
I shouldn't be talking.

150
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,638
If what he said bothers you,
why don't you just ask?

151
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,308
Ask that prime suspect or witness
or whatever he was.

152
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,149
He did say this to me once.

153
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,479
I was supposed to take Gyeyoung with me…

154
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,189
Why was he supposed to take her?

155
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,869
In what situation
are you supposed to take someone with you?

156
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,325
My gosh. Is she still here

157
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,536
watching the CCTV footage
around Geumdo Villa?

158
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,048
Why is she doing
the detectives' jobs for them?

159
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,720
Leave her alone, Chief.

160
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,178
It wouldn't hurt
to have another pair of eyes.

161
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,473
You're right.

162
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,510
Hello?

163
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,389
What? Eun Gyehoon?

164
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,636
Eun Gyehoon?

165
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,396
Yes.

166
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,686
What?

167
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,895
Over here.

168
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,913
Sorry.

169
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,331
I left my phone inside,

170
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,906
but I thought it'd complicate matters
if I go in looking like this.

171
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,758
What happened?

172
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,175
Nothing serious.

173
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
Are you okay?

174
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,926
Thanks.

175
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,104
What's going on?

176
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,144
Hey, Officer Ji! Come over here.

177
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,899
You shouldn't have come.

178
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,278
Why not?

179
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,658
He's our patrol unit's rookie.

180
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,160
Since he lives in Jihwa-dong too,
he's qualified to be one of us, right?

181
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,998
"Rookie" is so old-school.

182
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,501
What?

183
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,972
Hey.

184
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,755
My bad.

185
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,223
That rude punk.

186
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,313
Let's see if he spills
my drink by accident too, okay?

187
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,729
If he does, he's a rude punk indeed.

188
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,388
-I'll pour it properly, sir.
-Okay.

189
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,027
I'm sorry, sir.

190
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,239
-That punk.
-What a silly fellow.

191
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,833
Ma'am, I left money on the table.

192
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,248
Enjoy the food.

193
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,050
Who was that? Your friend?

194
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,136
No, sir.

195
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
What's wrong with your faces?

196
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,192
What happened?
Did you two get into a fight?

197
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,360
He's not a policeman. He's a thug.

198
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,154
It's not like that.

199
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,953
Besides, he's a stalker.

200
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,121
Stalker? Who is stalking whom?

201
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,028
His name is Lee Jingeun. He's stalking
the girl from the stew place.

202
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,908
-Dahyun?
-Yes.

203
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,960
That scumbag…

204
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,498
Don't be like that, man.

205
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,418
Just drink, okay?
We're off duty right now.

206
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:52,088
By the way,
why did Eun Gyehoon call you earlier?

207
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,052
He asked me something
about Mr. Han Euichan.

208
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,390
That man who urinates in public? Why?

209
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,640
Maybe he wants to get his revenge.

210
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,983
Men shouldn't forget any grudges.

211
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
-I'll get going first.
-Sure.

212
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,026
-Where are you going?
-I need to use the restroom.

213
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,666
I came to ask you something.

214
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,848
Would you like some warm barley tea?

215
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,103
No thank you.

216
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,891
It's okay.

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,980
Come on in.

218
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,788
Last time,

219
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,839
you said to me

220
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,421
that you were supposed
to take Gyeyoung with you.

221
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,796
Why? Why were you supposed to
take Gyeyoung with you?

222
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,765
Gyeyoung definitely knew her way home

223
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,268
and she was more than capable
of going home alone. So why?

224
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,061
Because she was hurt.

225
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,396
At the time, Gyeyoung…

226
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,203
<i>injured her leg.</i>

227
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,488
Gyeyoung, are you hurt?

228
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,583
<i>That's why she wasn't able to go home.</i>

229
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,699
She was hurt and I was her teacher.

230
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,125
But I just left her there
even though she could barely walk.

231
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,674
If I had taken her with me…

232
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,505
It's my fault.

233
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,973
I'm sorry, Gyehoon.

234
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,854
I'm really sorry.

235
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,407
Gyeyoung injured her leg…

236
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,155
You were too busy having fun
that you had no idea

237
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,038
<i>your injured sister
was being dragged somewhere.</i>

238
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,547
I KNOW WHO TOOK YOUR SISTER

239
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,305
That man…

240
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,112
Why are you looking for him?

241
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,030
I needed to ask him something.

242
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,648
It's important

243
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,066
to both you and me.

244
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,954
It's important to me too?

245
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,121
What is it? Tell me.

246
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
There is a chance that Mr. Han Euichan,

247
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,423
your father,
might have been falsely accused.

248
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,668
You too?

249
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,458
Lee Jingeun said to me

250
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,463
that he isn't the culprit.

251
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,923
But…

252
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,546
so what?

253
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,432
-What do you mean, so what?
-You heard me right. So what?

254
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,354
What difference would it make?

255
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,443
<i>I have something to confess.</i>

256
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,984
<i>He became a suspect
because I wrote a letter.</i>

257
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,943
If he had been accused of murder,
my heart would've been at peace at least.

258
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,025
But he was released immediately

259
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,065
due to a lack of evidence.

260
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,065
But the ridiculous thing is

261
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,077
that the police kept insisting
he was the murderer

262
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,870
even though they had no evidence.
Seriously.

263
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,712
What do you want?

264
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,424
What do you want from me?

265
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,839
<i>-People have called me</i>
-Say it!

266
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,460
-Say it!
<i>-the son of a murderer my entire life.</i>

267
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,047
-I said, say it!
<i>-So what now?</i>

268
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,594
What difference would it make now…

269
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,022
if he's not a murderer?

270
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,138
-Sejin--
-Shut your mouth.

271
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,520
Don't you ever call me that again.

272
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,858
I know it's a messed-up thing to say

273
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,485
and I feel sorry for you,

274
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,527
but you should've
looked after her to begin with.

275
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,449
You should've taken care
of your little sister.

276
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,075
Don't you dare

277
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,298
linger around me or him ever again.

278
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,089
I'll really kill you.

279
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,235
You still live here?

280
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,912
I'm impressed.

281
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,037
But do you remember who I am?

282
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
It's okay. I don't have to take this call.

283
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,890
EUN GYEHOON

284
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,057
<i>Lee Jingeun.</i>

285
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,439
<i>Hello? Lee Jingeun.</i>

286
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,651
-Hello?
-Where are you now?

287
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,736
I'm a bit busy at the moment.

288
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,413
<i>What?</i>

289
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,577
Can we talk later?

290
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,578
<i>No way.</i>

291
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,079
What did you mean by that?

292
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,871
<i>What did you mean by</i>

293
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,285
<i>Gyeyoung was hurt
and that you knew who took her?</i>

294
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,625
Me?

295
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,172
I never said that.

296
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,634
<i>Nonsense!</i>

297
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,723
No. Wait.

298
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,968
Answer me straight.

299
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,098
I'm with someone right now.

300
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,181
I coincidently ran into this person
after such a long time.

301
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,225
This person has a question for you.

302
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,648
-What?
<i>-Eun Gyehoon,</i>

303
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,861
how is your father?

304
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,214
What?

305
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,212
What did you just say?

306
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,469
<i>Lee Jingeun.</i>

307
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,813
<i>The call can't be connected.
Transferring to voicemail.</i>

308
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,179
<i>You will be charged after the tone.</i>

309
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,785
RESTROOM

310
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,257
Isn't that the stalker?

311
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,468
What's he doing?

312
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,407
What's wrong?

313
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,740
You know everything too.

314
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,121
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

315
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,036
<i>What am I supposed to know?</i>

316
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,913
<i>Don't turn around, Dahyun.</i>

317
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,785
Why do you look like that?

318
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,665
What did he say?

319
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,001
What Lee Jingeun said was true.

320
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,505
And Lee Jingeun asked me about my father.

321
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,795
He asked me how he was doing.

322
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,176
What does that mean?

323
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,555
He asked you about your father?

324
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,645
What in the world could it mean?

325
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,701
I totally spilled it everywhere.

326
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,779
What? They aren't back yet?

327
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,575
Where did they all go
in the middle of drinking? Jeez.

328
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,659
-How would I know?
-You startled me.

329
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,075
Just drink up.

330
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,123
Okay.

331
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,964
When did he get so drunk?

332
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,880
Jungho.

333
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,749
What are you thinking so hard about?

334
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,416
It's just that

335
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,545
it explains why they carried around
the tools all the time.

336
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,466
So I feel bad.

337
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,215
What are you talking about?

338
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,095
He's talking about the stew place.

339
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,556
You mean Bokhee.

340
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,765
It's freezing.

341
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,444
Where have you been going around?

342
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,533
I went to see someone.

343
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,189
Did you get yourself a girlfriend? Jeez.

344
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,317
Where's Mr. Cho?

345
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,033
He left a while back. Something came up.

346
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,124
Is that right?

347
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,117
How much did you drink?

348
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,536
Goodness.

349
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,796
Gyehoon.

350
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,839
Did you do this with Dahyun?

351
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,806
What happened to your face?
Did Dahyun punch you?

352
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,016
In any case, I deserve a metal
for being a loyal friend.

353
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,654
I suppose, you mean a medal.

354
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,321
Do you even know
what I've been doing because of you?

355
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,566
Why in the world…

356
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,740
am I dancing here?

357
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,079
How did I end up here?

358
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,172
-Where do you think you're going?
-Sorry?

359
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,758
Hey, young man.

360
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,808
You can't leave yet.

361
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,098
Shall we go have some more fun?

362
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,765
-Let's go!
-Yes!

363
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,818
Well, the thing is

364
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,399
that since I don't
get to see him much at all,

365
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,239
-I get confused sometimes.
-Right.

366
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:09,698
"Is that man my husband
or the next-door neighbor?" You know?

367
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,210
What do you mean, what should you do?

368
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,539
Just go for it.

369
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,591
Should I just go for it?

370
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,958
Look at him. He looks shocked.

371
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,087
Open your mouth. Here you go.

372
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,103
Are you having fun?

373
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,677
Do we seem funny to you?

374
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,436
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,321
Why aren't you eating that?
If you're sorry, chow down now.

376
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,817
-Chew well.
-It's okay.

377
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,077
It's still scary just thinking about it.

378
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,945
By the way, Gyehoon.

379
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,787
Yes?

380
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,372
I think the ladies really want to know.

381
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,917
By the way,

382
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,973
why did Eun Gyehoon
return to this neighborhood?

383
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,860
<i>What Lee Jingeun said was true.</i>

384
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,242
When did I first come into your life?

385
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,945
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

386
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,077
<i>We met right in this alley
a very long time ago.</i>

387
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,916
<i>Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?</i>

388
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,835
What's wrong? You know everything too.

389
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,116
What are you doing?

390
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,417
What are you doing at this hour
with all the dishes from the restaurant?

391
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,051
That's a good question.

392
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,715
If it is, you should answer me.

393
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,764
What are you doing?

394
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,597
Questions are more important than answers.

395
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,683
Einstein said that.

396
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,283
Your forehead feels hot as I had expected.

397
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,451
You have a high fever.

398
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,160
If the Earth's temperature
rises by two degrees,

399
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,781
it'll bring mass extinction.

400
00:33:58,995 --> 00:33:59,825
What?

401
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,825
It's a tragedy.

402
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,918
Forget it. In any case,
you're going to be very sick today.

403
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,724
When someone has a fever,
they end up saying nonsense and collapse.

404
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,589
Thus, we'll close shop for the day.

405
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,734
Wake up and eat!

406
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,567
You said, you can't be even a minute late!

407
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,283
You're as loud as a train.

408
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,284
-That little…
-Okay. Leave it to me. I'll go get her.

409
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,615
Dahyun.

410
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,130
You were awake?

411
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,422
-Yes, Grandma.
-Why are you just sitting around?

412
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,051
Can you tell me that again?

413
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,715
That one saying.

414
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,640
-Did you have a nightmare again?
-Yes.

415
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,556
Get rid of useless thoughts

416
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,104
and don't turn around.

417
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,191
Let it all go

418
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,113
and just keep going forward,
okay, my child?

419
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,401
Okay.

420
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,963
Lee Jingeun and I were alumni.

421
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,296
-We went to the same elementary school.
-What?

422
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,219
Maybe that's why I had
that nightmare from the past.

423
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,224
But it's fascinating.

424
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,261
I haven't had that dream in a while,

425
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,385
but it felt so fresh and vivid.

426
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,226
Hey, how vivid could it be?

427
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,651
It's still just a dream.

428
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,109
Exactly.

429
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,109
As luck would have it, that lunatic
went to the same school as you.

430
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,027
Are you sure he didn't have a crush on you
from your elementary school days?

431
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,243
He has high standards as a stalker.

432
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,204
If he ever shows his face again,

433
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,325
I'll gouge out his eyeballs
and turn them into lollipops.

434
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,083
-My goodness.
-Jeez.

435
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,746
What? I still wouldn't be satisfied.

436
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,967
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

437
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,510
<i>We're closed today.</i>

438
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,653
<i>Are you okay?</i>

439
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,566
<i>I hope you aren't terribly ill--</i>

440
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,223
The detective in charge
of Dajung's case called me.

441
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,101
Lee Jingeun has become
a suspect in another case.

442
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,931
The detective said, it might be possible
to reinvestigate Dajung's case too.

443
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,228
That's great to hear.

444
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,557
You reported him, didn't you?

445
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,822
Yes.

446
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,241
I'm glad you did. Thank you.

447
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,164
I hope they catch him soon.

448
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,209
I feel so anxious.

449
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:38,213
If I could, I'd just catch him myself.

450
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,391
Eunjung, why don't we leave this
to the police for now

451
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,022
and go have some fun?

452
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,441
-Isn't that pretty?
-Yes, it is.

453
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,231
I like this one. The color is pretty.

454
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,645
Do you like it?

455
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,192
-Yes.
-Please give me the whole set on display.

456
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,567
I can't believe you bought
everything for me.

457
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,244
Thank you. I'll really enjoy them.

458
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,624
Oh, no.

459
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,949
Hey, man. Watch where you're going!

460
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,414
Eunjung, we're both at fault.

461
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,754
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

462
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,789
-He needs to watch where he is going.
-I'm fine. Let's go.

463
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,541
The color is so beautiful.

464
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,462
I think it'd look good on you.

465
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,714
Eunjung, this is so pretty.

466
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,625
-It's so cute.
-The white one.

467
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,091
-Eunjung, what do you think?
-It looks so radiant and beautiful.

468
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,219
This one's nice too, right?

469
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,184
-Could you ring us up?
-I got these, Eunjung.

470
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,564
-I got it.
-Please use this one.

471
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,230
-No, I got it.
-Please use mine.

472
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,153
Oh, that one's so cute--

473
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,518
Do you like that one?

474
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,693
It's so cute. How much is it?

475
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,452
Do you want to get matching pairs?

476
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,869
Aren't they so cute?

477
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,868
There are so many cute ones here.

478
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,254
<i>People who live</i>

479
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,091
<i>looking backward, not forward.</i>

480
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,843
<i>A long time ago,</i>

481
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,683
I owed a friend five packs of <i>ramyeon.</i>

482
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,847
<i>But…
now I'll never be able to do it for her,</i>

483
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,064
<i>and perhaps I'm doing it for you instead.</i>

484
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,691
<i>Unresolved feelings,</i>

485
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,228
<i>regrets,</i>

486
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,402
<i>and longing. They live with such feelings.</i>

487
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,275
<i>Who they see before them is not me…</i>

488
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,170
-Splash!
-Stop it!

489
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,795
<i>…but the people they left in their past.</i>

490
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,432
How does this look?
Isn't the color so pretty?

491
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,270
Everyone needs one of these.

492
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,937
Eunjung.

493
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,493
I'm not your little sis.

494
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,945
But I'll be a new little sis to you.

495
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,964
Okay.

496
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,338
Thanks.

497
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,220
And I'm sorry.

498
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,852
You should get going.

499
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,815
As I was thinking about my sister,
you were thinking about someone else too.

500
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,896
I'll let you go.

501
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,287
What's wrong?

502
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,430
<i>I was really determined
to stop liking Eun Gyehoon.</i>

503
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,888
But it won't last one day,
let alone three.

504
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,429
I have to tell myself once a day,
"Let's not like him."

505
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,683
"You've got to let him go."
"Don't you have any self-esteem?"

506
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,387
Ridiculous, isn't it?

507
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,147
Yes, it is.

508
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,694
Is it?

509
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,533
Eun Gyehoon, what a lucky man.

510
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,448
You think so too, right? He's so annoying.

511
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,363
He is annoying.
He has a terrible personality.

512
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,037
But he isn't that annoying, you know?

513
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,002
Shall I handle him?

514
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,828
Sorry?

515
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,708
I'm your big sis now.

516
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,126
How dare that snob make my little sis cry.

517
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,093
Strictly speaking, he didn't make me cry.

518
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,046
I just cried on my own.

519
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,690
Come on, Eunjung.

520
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,574
It's because we've lost someone.

521
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,489
We've lost someone precious to us.

522
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,874
That's why he and I
can't hold on to someone.

523
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,785
We're afraid of losing them again.

524
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,004
Dahyun.

525
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,003
What? What are you doing here?

526
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,714
It's not even late.
Why are you out here? It's so cold.

527
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,551
What's that?

528
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,923
Well, I ended up getting them.

529
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,257
You got clothes?
Don't tell me you only bought yours.

530
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,642
I'll let you borrow them.

531
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,469
How can I borrow them?

532
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,564
Your clothes don't fit me.
They aren't elastic.

533
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,305
Grandma, aren't you cold?

534
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,021
Come home before it gets dark.

535
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,149
I'm not a high school student.

536
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,569
-Before it gets dark.
-You're in no position to say that.

537
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,859
-Come on, Grandma.
-Your mom's right.

538
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,242
-"Your mom's right."
-Why do you always call out to Grandma?

539
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,539
By the way, I heard
the chef's face got all beaten up.

540
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:43,997
How did you know?

541
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,119
This neighborhood is tiny.
Word spreads quickly.

542
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,207
Was it Lee Jingeun?

543
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,207
Yes.

544
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,130
-What?
-Mom, don't tell me…

545
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,223
-What?
-What's this?

546
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
What? This?

547
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,425
I'm just carrying it around.

548
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,864
Seriously.

549
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,819
Ta-da.

550
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,914
-What's that?
-Those are horrendous.

551
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,489
-You can't even use them.
-Grandma, you poke their eyes with this.

552
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,406
-How scary.
-Oh, really?

553
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,285
You're the scariest one here.

554
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,455
-Gosh, seriously.
-Put that away now.

555
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,210
-What are you doing? Put that away.
-Come on, Grandma.

556
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,220
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

557
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,300
A soft opening is around the corner,
so there is a lot to do. Let me stop by.

558
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,012
What would you do there
with only men around at this hour?

559
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,428
What else? I'll work.

560
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,886
But you said you're off today.

561
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,306
Your daughter is the troublemaker.

562
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,685
Those nerdy men couldn't harm her.
Come on in.

563
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,032
That's my point. I don't trust her, Mom.

564
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:55,939
Don't worry.

565
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,076
What brings you here now?

566
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,372
Weren't you sick?
What are you doing down here?

567
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,587
I took a fever reducer
and feel much better now.

568
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,052
And I really hate just lying around.

569
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,221
You're so odd.

570
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,089
I love just lying around.

571
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,465
You're so pale. You don't look fine.

572
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,060
Let me get you some warm tea.

573
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,819
Stop trying to do things for me
and allow me to take care of you too.

574
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,486
Thank you.

575
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,964
Aren't you dying to know?

576
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,006
You've been waiting
to ask me since yesterday.

577
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,015
Actually,

578
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,394
I came here to look for my father.

579
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,231
After Gyeyoung disappeared, my father

580
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,815
literally spent his entire life wandering

581
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,275
looking for Gyeyoung.

582
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,835
I'll be back.

583
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,228
Have a safe trip.

584
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,198
Hello?

585
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,594
REGISTRATION CARD
EUN CHULHO

586
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,169
<i>Father's wallet.</i>

587
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,683
This was found in Jihwa-dong?

588
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,892
There are no credit card,
banking, or phone call records.

589
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,983
There are no traces of his existence.

590
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,477
I would like to report him missing.

591
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,534
<i>Perhaps my father…</i>

592
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,117
Maybe

593
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,488
he just isn't able to contact you.

594
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,328
He might be okay
looking for your sister somewhere.

595
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,922
The family of a missing person
would never just vanish into thin air

596
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,923
without contacting the family.

597
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,010
Because they know more than anyone

598
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,641
how painful it is
for those who are left behind.

599
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,061
But I completely lost touch with him

600
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,023
and there are no traces of him whatsoever.

601
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,521
So I believe my father…

602
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,239
passed away.

603
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,456
That's why I came back to Jihwa-dong

604
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,421
to look for his final traces.

605
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,549
But the only worry I have…

606
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,965
<i>is my mother.</i>

607
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,888
Is Dad… doing well?

608
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,901
Yes, he is.

609
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,318
<i>I ended up lying to her.</i>

610
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,034
<i>But if she were to find out
that my father had passed away,</i>

611
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,862
<i>I doubt she'd be able to endure.</i>

612
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,527
What about Eun Gyehoon?

613
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:14,947
Sorry?

614
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,199
Not your sister,

615
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,287
not your father,

616
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,828
and not your mother either.

617
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,460
Eun Gyehoon.

618
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,377
Is Eun Gyehoon all right?

619
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,724
I'm curious about Eun Gyehoon.

620
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,559
<i>Sometimes, questions are…</i>

621
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,765
<i>more important than answers.</i>

622
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,268
How was it

623
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,404
for Eun Gyehoon?

624
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,909
<i>How was it for me?</i>

625
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,474
Isn't it pretty?

626
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,732
<i>I thought it would work
if I made the effort.</i>

627
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,855
Three orders of today's recommended dish.

628
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,570
Two ravioli. One salmon.

629
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,820
-Yes, chef!
-Yes, chef!

630
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,122
<i>If I worked harder than anyone else,</i>

631
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,963
<i>I thought I could fill the gap.</i>

632
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:03,687
FATHER, IS EVERYTHING WELL WITH YOU?
I'M DOING WELL

633
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,725
<i>But…</i>

634
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,844
GONE EARLY TO THE MARKET. PLEASE EAT.
LOVE, YOUR SON GYEHOON

635
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,648
FATHER, IS EVERYTHING WELL WITH YOU?
I'M DOING WELL

636
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,661
AUNT

637
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,541
Hello, Aunt?

638
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,884
Mom!

639
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,461
Mom!

640
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,268
<i>But no matter how hard I tried…</i>

641
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,935
<i>the crack kept getting wider</i>

642
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,363
<i>with no signs of closing at all</i>

643
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,410
<i>and became a big void in the end.</i>

644
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,788
I guess I'm sick after all
to tell you all this.

645
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,093
I wish you had stayed here

646
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,299
and not have moved away.

647
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,849
Then my grandma would've told you,

648
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,312
not to turn around,

649
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,940
and regardless of what
you might've left behind,

650
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,936
just keep moving forward.

651
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,025
If so, you would've grown up

652
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,409
to be a carefree person like me.

653
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,118
You could've been a little happier.

654
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,338
I…

655
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,184
have no intention of being that way.

656
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,142
I don't have the courage to become happy.

657
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:54,081
REGISTRATION CARD
EUN CHULHO

658
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,299
TICKET BOOTH

659
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,725
How have you been?

660
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,571
How is your health?

661
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,989
You're not skipping meals, are you?

662
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,565
Of course not.

663
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,584
Is everything well with you?

664
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,624
You've become a bit pallid
while I've been away.

665
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,852
I can't get it out of my head
not even for a moment.

666
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,898
Day after day,

667
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,225
I think about that day
over and over again.

668
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,444
I regret it over and over again! I…

669
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,994
No…

670
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,910
I'm not blaming you. No.

671
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:14,995
It's not your fault.

672
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,915
But all the work
I've been doing did pay off a little.

673
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,301
If I try a little harder,
we'll be able to find her.

674
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,883
So don't you worry.

675
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,258
-So--
-Enough, Father.

676
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,965
Enough already. Please.

677
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,310
I came to ask you to come home.

678
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:48,448
You've done so much already, so please

679
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,584
come home now.

680
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,459
Father, Mom is very ill.

681
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,548
Her mind and body
are deteriorating rapidly each day.

682
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,918
Mom…

683
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,554
I mean, we

684
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,474
need you, Father.

685
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:15,894
I'm sorry.

686
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,147
If that's what you came here to say,
I'll get going.

687
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,685
Please, it's enough already!

688
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,946
How much longer…
How much longer must we wait?

689
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,997
After you left,

690
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:40,618
Mom and I have been waiting for so long.

691
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,417
For how long will you
just look for Gyeyoung? For how long?

692
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,925
Your little sister Gyeyoung
is left all alone.

693
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,020
I'm her father.

694
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,850
If I don't look for her, who will?

695
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:07,691
If I give up, who will look for her?

696
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,066
Dad.

697
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,580
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

698
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,841
It's all my fault.
It's all because of me. I apologize.

699
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,303
So please… Please stop now.

700
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,385
Let's let go of Gyeyoung now.

701
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,885
I know it might sound shameless
for me to ask this,

702
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,685
but can't we just live like other people?

703
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,573
Can't we just live an ordinary,
happy life like others? Please?

704
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,737
Like others?

705
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,496
Dad.

706
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,592
Dad…

707
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,759
If you leave like this, it's really over!

708
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,760
I swear, I'll never look for you again.

709
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,979
Until the day I die. Never!

710
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,394
I won't look for you
or see you ever again.

711
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,860
I can't

712
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,158
go back like this.

713
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,374
Be happy, Gyehoon.

714
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,457
Like others.

715
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,014
Dad…

716
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,774
How could I be happy, Father?

717
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,032
I learned that happiness ends

718
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,445
and anything precious vanishes in the end.

719
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,369
Father, I…

720
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,748
no longer have the courage
to become happy.

721
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,650
<i>So,</i>

722
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,074
<i>I, who was cowardly and foolish,
made a decision.</i>

723
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,570
<i>The only way to keep those you love safe</i>

724
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,907
<i>is by not letting them
come into your life.</i>

725
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,748
<i>But…</i>

726
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,538
I've never been concerned about you.

727
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,880
But I definitely felt your concern.
What was that then?

728
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,299
<i>Back then…</i>

729
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,797
Why did you look for me so hard?

730
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,175
<i>And then again…</i>

731
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,010
I like you.

732
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,596
<i>I kept acting like a coward.</i>

733
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,325
<i>Why do you keep</i>

734
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,788
<i>coming into my life?</i>

735
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,963
I came back because…

736
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,835
for some reason…

737
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,603
I had this strange feeling.

LINK

739
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,097
<i>As you know, I had no intention
of becoming close to anyone.</i>

740
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,765
<i>However, something unpredictable happened.</i>

741
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,565
<i>You came into my life.</i>

742
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,228
<i>You and Eun Gyehoon can never be together.</i>

743
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,607
<i>There's a reason for that.</i>

744
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,864
<i>The nightmare. I'm going to dig into it.</i>

745
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,993
<i>Letting my imagination run wild</i>

746
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:31,783
<i>makes me want to run away
in fear even more.</i>

747
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,998
<i>Do you finally remember? The red gate.</i>

748
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,539
<i>In what may have been
the happiest moment of my life,</i>

749
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,753
<i>the scariest memory resurfaced.</i>
