00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,562
<i>Thinking back, it began a long time ago.</i>

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,944
<i>I, Noh Dahyun,
have always suffered because of men.</i>

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,439
-I told you to get out of my way.
<i>-Some people</i>

5
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,943
<i>grew up in the same neighborhood</i>

6
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,315
<i>-as those who became celebrities.</i>
-Jeez. Stop it.

7
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,952
<i>But as you can see…</i>

8
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,280
<i>Despite all the decent men in the world,</i>

9
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>the ones I ended up with were…</i>

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,200
Let's mix them together.

11
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,825
<i>…filthy.</i>

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,875
My mom told me to break up. Sorry!

13
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,384
-Mom…
<i>-A mama's boy.</i>

14
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,801
I'm here.

15
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,474
<i>-A cheater.</i>
-Hey, Dahyun.

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,051
You crazy…

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,887
<i>And I was continuously
surrounded by perverts.</i>

18
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,938
<i>And plenty of them at that.</i>

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,781
<i>I thought I had a decent superior.</i>

20
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,858
<i>But he turned out to be
a habitual molester.</i>

21
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,815
Mom!

22
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,164
<i>And that crazy stalker
turned me into a murderer.</i>

23
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,541
<i>So I promised myself…</i>

24
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,591
<i>that I would never get involved
with another man ever again.</i>

25
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,589
<i>But then…</i>

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,229
<i>You came into my life.</i>

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,479
Who did this to you? Answer me.

28
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,193
Would you like some food?

29
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,586
<i>What should I do?</i>

30
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,148
I think…

31
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,947
I've developed feelings for you.

32
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,410
<i>Perhaps, this was the confession
that I wanted to make.</i>

33
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,252
<i>But instead, I said…</i>

34
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,039
I killed someone.

35
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,683
<i>It's safe to say</i>

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,222
<i>that I've gone insane.</i>

37
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,389
CHEESY, BUT DESTINY

38
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,026
Can you kill someone for me?

39
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,682
Hey, what will you do
about your belly fat?

40
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,968
Dance to the beat. Come on!

41
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,347
One, two.

42
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,903
Am I dreaming?

43
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,731
How can we have the same dream?

44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,818
Damn it.

45
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,073
-Watch your language.
-Don't hit me.

46
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,776
So we're not dreaming.

47
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,199
No, we're not.

48
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,677
Did I go too far with my joke?
Was that too terrifying?

49
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,430
Don't take it so seriously.

50
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,441
I'm terrible at reading the room.

51
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,729
I talk nonsense at times.

52
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,232
And I'm a bit drunk too.

53
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,484
-And you killed someone too.
-That's right.

54
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,187
No, I didn't.

55
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,275
How did it happen?

56
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,865
I said it was a joke.

57
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,494
Who else knows about this?

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,496
I tend to make
a slip of the tongue at times.

59
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,039
We all make mistakes.

60
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,882
Of course. I know that very well.

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,998
You lied about having feelings for me.

62
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,545
You trespassed into my restaurant.

63
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,378
I see you and your family
peeking in here all the time.

64
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,335
You hide or run
whenever you see the police.

65
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm sure they're all honest mistakes.

66
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,757
That's just--

67
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,675
Sure, I can understand everything
up to that.

68
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,314
But how could you… kill someone?

69
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,937
How will you take care of this?

70
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,154
What if people get wind of this?

71
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,153
They won't.
You're the only one who knows about this.

72
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,280
So you acknowledged it.

73
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,540
I didn't.

74
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,914
In any case, I'd appreciate it
if you could keep this a secret--

75
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,287
Secrets spread like wildfire
the moment you talk about it.

76
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,796
It's not a secret anymore
once you open up to someone.

77
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,588
I only did it because I trusted you.

78
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,383
Why would you trust me?
Don't trust anyone.

79
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,135
If you continue telling others about this,

80
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,272
it's only a matter of time
the police get you.

81
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,639
Do you understand me?

82
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,185
Yes, I do.

83
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,516
Great.

84
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,403
You're threatening me
and saying you'd expose it.

85
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,030
-This isn't a threat--
-You know what?

86
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,833
The first time is always the hardest.

87
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,618
Then it gets easier from then on.

88
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,802
Did you see it?

89
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,719
I did.

90
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,929
When a married woman has wounds
on her body, it's pretty obvious.

91
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,187
Eight out of ten times, the culprit is…

92
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,856
Shut up! Will you just shut up?

93
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,653
<i>Honey, please!</i>

94
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,659
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I got the hang of it.

95
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,674
I feel bad but still…

96
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,666
This isn't right.

97
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,251
How dare she threaten us? I'm speechless.

98
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,706
If we say no…

99
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,506
She'll report us to the police.

100
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,434
Darn it.

101
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,598
I won't sympathize.

102
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,555
Anyone that knows about the incident

103
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,849
and gets in the way of Dahyun…

104
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,728
<i>I'll get rid of them.</i>

105
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,355
Are you threatening to kill me right now?

106
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,527
Of course not. I'm just saying. But…

107
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,447
But?

108
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,294
Sometimes what we say becomes true.

109
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,499
So you are threatening me.

110
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,329
I'm just saying we should both
be careful of what we say.

111
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,813
Gyehoon.

112
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,982
I…

113
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,017
-killed…
-Someone.

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,932
Gyehoon, I…

115
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,639
-killed…
-Someone.

116
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,346
Gyehoon.

117
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,099
-I killed…
-I killed someone.

118
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,817
-I killed someone.
-I killed someone.

119
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,392
<i>To a guy who makes my heart flutter
for the first time in years,</i>

120
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,435
<i>I confessed today</i>

121
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,856
<i>that I killed someone,</i>

122
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,356
<i>and I threatened
to kill him too if need be.</i>

123
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,983
Should we bury that scumbag?

124
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,936
We can't bury them
every time we become annoyed.

125
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,607
This country isn't that big to begin with.

126
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,729
You're right. It's a pity
that we live in a small country.

127
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,362
If push comes to shove, we must do it.

128
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,123
Dahyun…

129
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,408
should never find out.

130
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,245
Of course not. She should be in the dark.

131
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,603
EPISODE 4

132
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,556
Tell that thing to come and eat, Mom.

133
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,824
Jeez. That's no way
to talk about your daughter.

134
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,028
Dahyun, get ready for breakfast.

135
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,949
Please tell her
that this thing isn't hungry, Grandma.

136
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,068
Tell that thing to watch what she says

137
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,326
and to just eat while I'm being nice, Mom.

138
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,249
Tell her that this thing
is too terrified to eat, Grandma.

139
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,538
Ask that thing
to just zip it and eat, Mom.

140
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,213
Ask her how I'm supposed to eat
if I can't open my mouth, Grandma.

141
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,633
She can't eat with her mouth shut.

142
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,091
-That little--
-What? Are you going to bury me too?

143
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,635
I said I didn't want to eat.

144
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,349
Just leave me alone.

145
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,686
And if I do? Tell me.

146
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,612
-Will you manage on your own?
-Go away.

147
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,612
You weren't born to make your mom proud?

148
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,406
-You want to make your own decisions?
-That hurts!

149
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,701
Then you go
and part-time at his restaurant?

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,285
A passing dog would laugh.
Just keel over from laughing so hard.

151
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,010
Look here! Look at me!

152
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,759
We need a new fridge too.

153
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,054
I wonder if I can get one secondhand.

154
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,308
Did you find what you were looking for?

155
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,240
<i>I remember it now.</i>

156
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,202
<i>That day,</i>

157
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,664
<i>I felt her fear.</i>

158
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,256
What? What is it?

159
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,472
You startled me.

160
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,226
What did I do?

161
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,774
Why are you here already?

162
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,233
Should I be scolded for coming early?

163
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,284
I'm certain it was in here.
Where did it go?

164
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,951
What? What are you talking about?

165
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,620
Was it you?

166
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,910
Me? What do you mean?

167
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,328
Are you hiding anything from me?

168
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,213
Jeez. What could I possibly
be hiding from…

169
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,755
I'd like to know
if these two are brother and sister.

170
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,138
It's a matter of utmost importance.
The fate of someone is on the line.

171
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,651
-What is this?
-What?

172
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,782
What do you mean?

173
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,027
Come clean already.

174
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,531
I'm not hiding anything.

175
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,581
Tell me.

176
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,339
What have you done?

177
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,588
I'll come clean later.

178
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,644
Do it now.

179
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,556
Gyehoon, don't you trust me?

180
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,848
I'll tell you when it's time.

181
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,183
I don't trust you. I don't trust anyone.

182
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,770
Who is the most suspicious neighbor?

183
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,277
All of them. Every single one of them.

184
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,369
That's a good one.

185
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,038
-Bye.
-See you.

186
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,495
But the most suspicious ones are…

187
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,260
-Bye.
-Don't go. Hey.

188
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,930
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

189
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,437
-Bye.
-Just quit.

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,860
Take that hood off.

191
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,980
-Hello, ladies.
-Hey.

192
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,027
Hello.

193
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,994
<i>You got a job?</i>

194
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,374
Yes, I need to go back soon.

195
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,544
At a nearby restaurant?

196
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,372
Yes. Why?

197
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,457
Why would you get a job there
with your skills and academic background?

198
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,918
Life doesn't always go your way.

199
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,255
Forget about that. What's with your face?

200
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,011
What's going on?

201
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,763
Look at those dark circles.

202
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,894
It's unbearable to see.

203
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,724
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

204
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,109
-You see…
-Yes?

205
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,185
Never mind.

206
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,441
You see, there's this guy.

207
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,698
He treats me well.

208
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,449
But he says he doesn't like me
and tells me not to like him either.

209
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,372
-But he's still nice to me.
-That's sympathy.

210
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,160
But he's not the type
to sympathize with anyone.

211
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,115
He feels a bit dangerous, cold,

212
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,671
and terrifying.

213
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,879
He threatens me too.

214
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,762
-Just like you?
-Me?

215
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,129
Yes. What did you do to Mr. Lee Jingeun?

216
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,717
What?

217
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,678
Don't you have something to do with it?

218
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,977
What do you mean?

219
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,400
<i>He said you guys were dating.</i>

220
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>But you said he was stalking you.</i>

221
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,522
<i>After making different claims,</i>

222
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,687
he disappeared.

223
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,945
He pretty much vanished into thin air.

224
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,834
Well… I'm pretty sure he's doing well.

225
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,028
Someone came by.

226
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,948
They said they couldn't reach him
and didn't even know if he was alive.

227
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,076
Who? Who was it?

228
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,338
I think they said they were family.

229
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,835
<i>Why didn't it cross my mind</i>

230
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,144
<i>that Lee Jingeun had family?</i>

231
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,014
I don't know the details.

232
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,351
But be careful.

233
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,636
That person looked a bit strange.

234
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,654
I sensed craziness in their eyes.

235
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,791
Hey, honey.

236
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,286
Honey!

237
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,298
Hello.

238
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,670
Are you guilty of something?

239
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,051
-Sorry?
-You just seemed pretty startled.

240
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,473
Jeez. You look a bit rough today,
but you're still beautiful.

241
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,270
Thank you.

242
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,190
Let's go. I passed the interview.

243
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,019
We'll be working together.
How great is that?

244
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,314
I see.

245
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,904
What do I do? I'm on cloud nine.

246
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,200
Let's see how this pans out
for the next three months.

247
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,914
Then we'll talk further.

248
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,285
Sure. That'll be more than enough time.

249
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,793
In many ways.

250
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,839
By the way,
what's the name of our restaurant?

251
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,007
I haven't come up with one yet.

252
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,876
When will we open?

253
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,429
I have no set date yet,
but it'll happen soon.

254
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:06,854
Your target customers?

255
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,349
My target customers?

256
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,847
I haven't decided on that yet.

257
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,897
But I'll probably target the epicures
who enjoy culture and art.

258
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,822
-There are none in this neighborhood.
-Exactly.

259
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,571
With these luxury ingredients?

260
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,783
-Can you even make a profit?
-Exactly.

261
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,330
I haven't calculated it yet,
but I'll try to fit the budget.

262
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,040
That's strange.

263
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,710
Most chefs move as a team

264
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,458
even when they find a new job
or open up their own restaurant.

265
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,578
But why is it just you two?

266
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,167
How could I bring

267
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:40,474
my beloved subordinates here
when I can't even guarantee our success?

268
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,471
Then what does that make me?

269
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,756
You're… You're here
because I just adored you too much

270
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,468
to let you be on your own.

271
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,808
You'll pay us, right?

272
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,194
Do you make enough profit?

273
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,811
He must be well-off.

274
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,607
From what I know, he's pretty comfortable.

275
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,477
Your parents must be wealthy.

276
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,898
This world is just so darn unfair.

277
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,197
You can say that again.

278
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,530
That was a nice one.

279
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,285
But why here of all places?

280
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,211
Why would you open a restaurant here
when you're well-off and famous?

281
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,462
Well…

282
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,173
I want to improve the neighborhood economy

283
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,470
and help the unemployed youth.

284
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,380
Are you a politician?

285
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,928
Are you running for office?

286
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,601
Ms. Noh, make sure
you thoroughly read the manuals.

287
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,220
Especially the cleaning manual.

288
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,230
Chef Lee, you have your own knife, right?

289
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,651
I need a new one.

290
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,359
If it's okay with you, you can use ours.

291
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,730
Sure. I'll take a look at it.

292
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,276
Right. The knife.

293
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,645
Excuse me. The knife.

294
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,948
Right.

295
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,372
This.

296
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,578
You bought these limited edition knives
made from olive trees from Sicily.

297
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,209
-Right.
-One of the knives is missing.

298
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,671
I can't find it anywhere. Where did it go?

299
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,751
What?

300
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,604
No, I didn't use a knife.

301
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,342
-Where are you?
-I'm here. Why?

302
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,296
What were you doing?

303
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,594
I was looking for this.
You're going to have some coffee?

304
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,798
Yeah, I will.

305
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,354
-I'll boil the water.
-I got it.

306
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,695
Have you gone crazy?

307
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,121
Sorry?

308
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,622
You threatened to kill me
if I didn't watch what I said.

309
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,663
But you're the one spilling everything.

310
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,293
-Right.
-And you didn't use a knife?

311
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,634
Then what did you use?

312
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,088
Right.

313
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,670
What's wrong?
Why don't you just tell everyone about it?

314
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,591
-Right.
-What's with this reaction?

315
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,761
Don't tell me something else happened.

316
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,694
<i>"That dead guy's family
is looking for me."</i>

317
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,518
<i>"My mom and grandma
are scheming to kill someone else."</i>

318
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,315
<i>"Right. And you're not an exception."</i>

319
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,859
<i>I can't tell you that, can I?</i>

320
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,408
Nothing happened. I'm completely fine.

321
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,951
Don't lie to me.
I know you're nervous and anxious.

322
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,707
-I'm not.
-You can't fool me.

323
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,580
Your thoughts and emotions can be--

324
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,423
What about my thoughts and emotions?

325
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,546
I can tell them
just by looking at your face.

326
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,505
-Really?
-Really.

327
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,393
You're very easy to read.

328
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,564
Anyway,

329
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,687
let's both be careful.

330
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,018
Okay?

331
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,993
I have a question.

332
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,573
What is it?

333
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,374
Why are you so…

334
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,119
concerned about me?

335
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,420
<i>You're giving me the wrong idea.</i>

336
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,236
What are you looking at?

337
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,025
Is there something going on between them?

338
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,907
Not at all. Never.

339
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,544
I see.

340
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,538
<i>It should be that way.</i>

341
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,303
<i>You're Lee Jingeun's girlfriend after all.</i>

342
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,432
<i>Where in the world did you hide him?</i>

343
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,474
Eunjung.

344
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,222
Do you have feelings for Gyehoon?

345
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,144
-No.
-Then do you have feelings for Dahyun?

346
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,386
You're funny.

347
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,556
Don't act so friendly toward me
all of a sudden.

348
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,979
You're making me flustered and happy.

349
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,110
What is it?

350
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,570
It's nothing.

351
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,959
"Hello, here is the result
of the DNA test you requested."

352
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,795
I'm so nervous.

353
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,031
You're a grown man. Why do you want me
to walk with you in this cold weather?

354
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,449
I told you.
This neighborhood creeps me out.

355
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,908
Just say it.
I know you have something to tell me.

356
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,117
Why did you move here?

357
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,924
What's the real reason?

358
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,335
Why are you so curious?

359
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,222
Was it really to find your sister?

360
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,759
No.

361
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,965
Then?

362
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,721
I am looking for someone.

363
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,020
But it's not her.

364
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,482
Then who is it?

365
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,819
Tell me.

366
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,241
You must be tired. Go rest up.

367
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,452
Okay. We'll talk again tomorrow.

368
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,493
Okay.

369
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,636
I know…

370
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,558
who you are.

371
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,054
You also

372
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,338
recognize me, don't you?

373
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,521
Yes.

374
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,185
I do.

375
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,149
Are you…

376
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,686
also back to kill me?

377
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,435
What if I did?

378
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,413
Do you know why…

379
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,212
I haven't acted on it yet?

380
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,625
If it really was you…

381
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,591
If I find proof that you did it…

382
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,919
Once I know for sure…

383
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,378
Then…

384
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,430
I'll kill you myself.

385
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,112
What's going on?

386
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
What are you doing?

387
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,083
He greeted me, so I said hello back.
Is that a problem?

388
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,415
Mr. Han, come with me.

389
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,417
And you, chef.

390
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,546
Go home.

391
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,274
I'm watching you.

392
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,809
With my eyes wide open.

393
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,161
Here you go, ma'am.

394
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,736
Thanks.

395
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,949
Has the Geumdo Villa killer
been caught yet?

396
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,826
I'm not sure. Beats me.

397
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,920
…Ma'am. And I'm not curious either, ma'am.

398
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,167
You have no sense of duty.

399
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,337
I would if they raised my salary.

400
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,926
I'm barely getting paid any right now.

401
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,980
Can you believe the guy
who urinates publicly did it?

402
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,652
A suspect of a cold case?

403
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,771
-Still--
<i>-Jihwamadang-ro 31.</i>

404
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,606
<i>A drunk man got in an argument,</i>

405
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,901
<i>-vomited, and fainted.</i>
-Again?

406
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,444
This is patrol 11. We're on it.

407
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,359
Let's go.

408
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,704
This is the third time
a drunk has vomited tonight.

409
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,080
Gosh, I'm already getting nauseous.

410
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,004
I won't be having an appetite
for some time.

411
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,826
Hey, damn it!

412
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,787
Do you know who I am?

413
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,797
Are you okay, sir? Wake up.

414
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,510
Open the door!

415
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,550
Who are you guys?

416
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,097
Don't do anything foolish.

417
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,180
Officer Ji.

418
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,730
Get up, sir.

419
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,114
Who are you?

420
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:29,106
Hey, it's you.

421
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,196
The police lady.

422
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,445
Wake up and go home.

423
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,502
Let's go. I should get home.

424
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,707
Officer Ji.

425
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,974
I'm sorry.

426
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,386
Sorry.

427
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,482
Gosh. I'm sorry.

428
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,608
MOTHER'S TASTE
CHOONOK STEW

429
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,500
We had no idea all these years.

430
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,626
In the past, I was able to hide my wounds.

431
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,090
But something
must've gotten to him lately.

432
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,723
He became even worse.

433
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,428
Hiding your wounds
doesn't change the fact that he beat you.

434
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,264
Why would you hide them
when he's the one to blame?

435
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,767
Have you reported him to the police?

436
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,521
And if they let him go?

437
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,362
"Let's die together.
I'll kill you then kill myself as well."

438
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,694
He always says that.

439
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,653
Then you could've just run away.

440
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,744
Do you think that didn't cross my mind?

441
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,366
You see, I have many family members.

442
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,159
My mom is still alive and well.

443
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,543
I have sisters,

444
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,870
a brother, and their kids.

445
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,876
It's obvious
that he'll harass them if I run away.

446
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,209
So how can I be selfish
and run away just to save myself?

447
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,916
How can I?

448
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,351
It'll break my mom's heart
if she ever finds out that he beats me.

449
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,638
She's the one person
who shouldn't know about this.

450
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,552
You gained weight.

451
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,636
You too, Grandma.

452
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,100
Have you been eating
tasty food without me?

453
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,265
I'm bloated from crying all night.

454
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,520
Why did you cry?

455
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,731
Because of you.
Because you're eating away at me.

456
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,439
Did someone come to our restaurant?

457
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,895
Who? What for? Did you do something?

458
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,158
Never mind.

459
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,371
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

460
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,869
What about you?

461
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,960
Did you hear anything?

462
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,709
About someone being hired
or threatened by anyone?

463
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,506
Hired or threatened to do what?

464
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,761
Is something going on?

465
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,597
-No.
-Something's going on.

466
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,809
-It's nothing.
-It's something.

467
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,968
I'm telling you it's not!

468
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,139
Just be quiet and eat.

469
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,112
What is it?

470
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,612
Hey, just leave that there.

471
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,867
I'm stronger than I look.

472
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,659
No, I don't need it.
I already have enough fertilizer.

473
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,035
Darn it. You could've told me sooner.

474
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,415
You do know that the market
is full of vegetables, right?

475
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,785
What's the point of all this?

476
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,798
All chefs dream of using good ingredients
that they grow themselves.

477
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,342
You might as well go fish too.

478
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,506
How did you know?
I fish from time to time.

479
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,095
Of course, you do.

480
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,611
I sense your dissatisfaction
by the way you're shoveling.

481
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,518
That's not true.

482
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,606
Let's make this clear.

483
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,441
No one told you to help me out.

484
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,356
The other two are busy downstairs
developing new recipes.

485
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,116
But as a waitress, I have nothing to do

486
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,829
since we're not even open yet.

487
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,249
It's like placing a desk
in the office hallway

488
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,749
and not giving me any work to do.
You're pushing me to quit.

489
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,381
So I should give this my all.

490
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,758
Speaking from experience?

491
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,470
I have lots of experience
with various things.

492
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,185
What a brat. How dare she?

493
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,454
<i>I'm sorry to say this.</i>

494
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,042
But you're the only hope I have.

495
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:32,115
I have no choice
but to threaten you with Dahyun.

496
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,923
<i>She continued to threaten us
even while crying.</i>

497
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,592
How infuriating.

498
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,631
Be the bigger person.

499
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,423
Just pity her, and that's that.

500
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,299
I do feel bad for her.

501
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,099
Of course, I do.
I know since I've been beaten before.

502
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,434
Of course. You were a victim as well.

503
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,142
Even still,

504
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,524
this is unacceptable.

505
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,981
What if Dahyun gets hurt?

506
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,146
Be the bigger person.
Nothing good comes out of anger.

507
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,025
You always say that.

508
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,912
You have to be the bigger person.
You must.

509
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,279
But I can't!

510
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,325
Be the bigger person.

511
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,489
You can do it.

512
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,662
Forget it. I can't.

513
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,997
Wait. Mom.

514
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,375
Mom, wait.

515
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,300
Let's not be reckless.
How about we think this over?

516
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,631
Wait. Mom. Hold on. Mom!

517
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,298
Darn it!

518
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,521
Jeez!

519
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,436
Come on!

520
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,822
Mom, where are you going? Hold on!

521
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,798
Damn it…

522
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,297
Hey!

523
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,179
Who the hell are you?

524
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,142
You little… Do you want to die?

525
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,167
Mom!

526
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,590
-Mom!
-Mom, where are you going?

527
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,998
-Why are you following us?
-Just go, both of you!

528
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,375
-Let's talk!
-Just go!

529
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,094
-Just stop!
-Grandma!

530
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,184
Tell me where you're going!

531
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,096
Mom, wait!

532
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,598
Mom!

533
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,978
Why am I looking for her?

534
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,111
Darn it.

535
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,696
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

536
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,288
We meet again.

537
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,009
Unfortunately, yes.

538
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,356
Mom!

539
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,781
Why…

540
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,752
I'm glad you came. There's--

541
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,133
Stay there! Put that down!

542
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,303
No, you got the wrong idea.

543
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,382
We need back up here.

544
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,548
-This is a misunderstanding.
-We need backup.

545
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,806
-Put that down!
-Come on.

546
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,719
I mean, I will put it down.

547
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,767
He's dying here. How frustrating.

548
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,578
-They're back again?
-Again?

549
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:42,332
Jeez, do you miss us that much? Do you?

550
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,996
You're regulars here.

551
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,504
What is it this time? Tell me!

552
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,304
Special assault.

553
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,295
Look at all those weapons.

554
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,351
Why did you do it?

555
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:56,853
It wasn't us.

556
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,681
I'm telling you.
He was already down when we arrived.

557
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,937
The whole time.

558
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,845
Then what's all this?

559
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:08,613
Well… You see… It just happened that…

560
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,030
You just found us
with these tools in our hands.

561
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,742
I know it's hard to believe,
but we're telling the truth.

562
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,533
So you do know. Yes, it's hard to believe.

563
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,500
All right. Did you resent the victim?

564
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,871
Perhaps, money issues?

565
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,116
No, I don't know that man.

566
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,543
What about you two?

567
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,552
So you do know him.

568
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,220
What? Do you?

569
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,640
We just barely know his face.

570
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,136
That's all.

571
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,945
Do you really not remember anything?

572
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,319
Anything will be helpful.

573
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,365
Yes, sir.

574
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,834
Okay.

575
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,075
Call us anytime.

576
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,042
What's going on?

577
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,803
I see. The regulars are here.

578
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,091
Hello.

579
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,552
-Be quiet.
-Yes, sir.

580
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,892
The victim is refusing to testify.

581
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,020
I just spoke with the one
who reported it. The witness.

582
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:21,928
Just cut to the chase.

583
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,061
The culprit…

584
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,692
was male.

585
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,157
He was tall.

586
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,618
He was wearing a black jacket
and a black hat.

587
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,751
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

588
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,343
Get up.

589
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:57,045
How could you bring us here
and threaten us when we were innocent?

590
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,934
Is this the true face
of the Korean police?

591
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,139
How dare you? Who do you think we are?

592
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,685
Minor Offenses Act,
article three, section two.

593
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,732
"The hiding and carrying of a weapon."

594
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,777
"Those who hide and carry tools
without a valid reason

595
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,316
can be fined a maximum of 100,000 won,
detained, or penalized."

596
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,489
That's right. We could fine each of you.

597
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,575
-Should I fine them?
-Hey!

598
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:28,166
Sir, we're so sorry. We truly are.

599
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,958
This won't ever happen again.

600
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,210
We'll be more careful.

601
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,255
-A hundred thousand won?
-Let's bow.

602
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,889
-Hello.
-Hello.

603
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,349
Why are they still following us?

604
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,815
And why is she there?

605
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,565
Just go. Don't be spotted. I'm humiliated.

606
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,702
She's a bit suspicious.

607
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,317
Here.

608
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,429
You were hired?

609
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,467
Then you should've told me so.

610
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,265
Nothing good
would've come out of telling you.

611
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,176
It's all my fault.

612
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:35,226
You were asked to be
a contract killer all because of me.

613
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,355
It's not your fault.

614
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,821
Those scumbags are to blame.

615
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,488
Let's stop arguing.

616
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,954
Here.

617
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,869
No more arguing, okay?

618
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,616
I'm really sorry.

619
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,540
I'm truly sorry
for what I'm putting you guys through.

620
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,547
Why are you sorry?

621
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:00,721
I'm too short-tempered for a mom.

622
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,587
I haven't matured one bit.

623
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,387
No, I'm sorry.

624
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,181
-No, I'm sorry.
-Mom…

625
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,640
Goodness.

626
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,194
You fools.

627
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,862
I'm sorry, Mom.

628
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,934
Don't be sorry.

629
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,694
What was that?

630
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,939
Why would you ruin the mood like that?

631
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,901
Jeez.

632
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,410
Gosh, you're ugly.

633
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,419
Wipe your nose.

634
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,709
Take a look in the mirror.

635
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,087
What's wrong with him?

636
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,768
What's going on?

637
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,978
Why is everyone here so weird?

638
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,118
DNA TEST

639
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,909
SAMPLE A: MALE, SAMPLE B: FEMALE

640
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,460
SIBLING PROBABILITY: N

641
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,213
I'm sorry I did it behind your back.

642
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,644
Do you want some coffee? Or tea?

643
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,393
Let me.

644
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,927
-It's okay.
-No, I'll--

645
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,136
I said I'd do it!

646
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,038
Are you okay?

647
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,585
I already knew.

648
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,674
I knew

649
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,506
she couldn't have been Gyeyoung.

650
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,306
They had nothing in common.

651
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,431
I knew long ago

652
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,940
that it wasn't her.

653
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,388
Gyehoon.

654
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,517
I was fooling myself.

655
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,936
I was thinking, "What if?"

656
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,987
Perhaps, I wanted to dream.

657
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,075
<i>My parents were devastated.</i>

658
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,206
<i>My family was destroyed.</i>

659
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,629
Honey, will we be able to eat today?

660
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,545
-Yes. I'm almost done.
-We're hungry.

661
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,295
Thank you for waiting.

662
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,886
-Let's eat.
-This looks good.

663
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,555
-No!
-Why not?

664
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,571
That looks pretty.

665
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,617
<i>I had hope that maybe
we could all smile again.</i>

666
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,628
<i>I didn't want to wake up
from that dream, so I delayed it.</i>

667
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,437
<i>But it's time to wake up now.</i>

668
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,287
Then who in the world is that Wi-Fi girl?

669
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,759
Why are you able

670
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,165
to feel her emotions?

671
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,639
Beats me.

672
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,102
But I'm no longer curious.

673
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,566
<i>However, one thing bothers me.</i>

674
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,278
I have a question.

675
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,737
What is it?

676
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,960
Why are you so…

677
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,376
concerned about me?

678
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,879
<i>You're giving me the wrong idea.</i>

679
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,220
<i>That's when I felt</i>

680
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,258
<i>your feelings toward me.</i>

681
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,599
Over here, honey.

682
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,063
Hey. Have you been waiting long?

683
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,935
No, I just came.

684
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,648
We'll pretty much be family from now on.

685
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,493
I asked you to come today
so we could get to know each other better.

686
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,069
You know it was love at first sight.

687
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,244
You have some refined taste in women.

688
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,373
You're funny.

689
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,541
-Sir.
-Yes?

690
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,206
Seriously?
You never had any luck with men.

691
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,291
"Unlucky" is my middle name.

692
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,378
And I have the worst luck with men.

693
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,303
A decent man means
one of these two things.

694
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,342
He's either taken or putting up a facade.

695
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,967
-You can say that again. Cheers.
-That's right.

696
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,902
So tell me.
Did you meet any guys recently?

697
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,532
No.

698
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,146
-Really?
-Yes.

699
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,790
You so did.

700
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,171
Who is it?

701
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:57,468
Why? I'm curious.
I wonder who your boyfriend is.

702
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,968
<i>I really want to meet him.</i>

703
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,640
Introduce him to me.

704
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,683
It's not what you think.

705
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,887
You can't meet him.

706
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,234
Why not?

707
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,731
What's the reason? Where did you hide him?

708
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,071
I'm so jealous.
On the other hand, I'm so lonely.

709
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,161
I talked way too much about myself.
What about you?

710
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,538
Is there anyone you like or miss?

711
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,630
Of course, I do.

712
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,799
<i>My little brother.</i>

713
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,062
<i>I cry every night.</i>

714
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,815
<i>Because I miss him so much.</i>

715
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,527
I truly do.

716
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,142
I'm glad you're here.
I bought this for you.

717
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,683
The eel was delicious.

718
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,389
Having creamy food all the time
makes you crave something spicy.

719
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,598
You should have
Korean food too if you're Korean.

720
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,818
-No, thanks.
-It's really scrumptious.

721
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,398
Didn't you hear me?

722
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,414
Aren't you leaving? I am.

723
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,662
I just wanted to give you something
as a thank you

724
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,869
for always treating me to good food.

725
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,590
Did I do something wrong?

726
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,169
No.

727
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,506
Then why are you being like this?

728
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,601
I'm trying to make things right.

729
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,353
Make what right?

730
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,144
The misunderstanding you have.

731
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,692
I've never been concerned about you.

732
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,855
But I definitely felt your concern.

733
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,910
What was that then?

734
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,989
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

735
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:30,831
But that's it.

736
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,288
I'm going to…

737
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,462
put an end to that as well.

738
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,757
I won't be concerned about you…

739
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,513
ever again.

740
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,619
It's so mind-boggling.

741
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:16,081
If she's not your twin sister,
why do you feel her emotions?

742
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,917
Or maybe it's this. Destiny.

743
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,625
Destiny?

744
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,512
Isn't that word outdated?

745
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:37,057
Sure, it's a bit tacky.
But it's not outdated.

746
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,064
Destiny is eternal.

747
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,441
What a load of nonsense.

748
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,991
<i>Right. I remember it now.</i>

749
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,579
There was one decent guy in my life.

750
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,325
I hurt my head when I was little,
so I don't remember much of my past.

751
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,754
I rarely remember anything now.

752
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,588
But there's one thing I still recall.

753
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,672
This one boy shines brightly
among all the nasty guys I've met.

754
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,385
Just go home!

755
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,892
We were here first.

756
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,765
I told you to back off!

757
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,402
Jeez.

758
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,728
Hey!

759
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,690
<i>There's this amazing boy,
but I don't remember anything about him.</i>

760
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,699
Let me go! I said let go!

761
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,069
<i>He always came to my rescue.</i>

762
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,907
NOH DAHYUN

763
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,910
I think…

764
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,997
he must've liked me.

765
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,464
Hey! Come at me!

766
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,755
-Move!
-No, you move!

767
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,854
<i>I think of him occasionally.</i>

768
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,772
<i>I wonder…</i>

769
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,645
<i>what that kid is doing now.</i>

770
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,170
One of the knives is missing.
I can't find it anywhere.

771
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,514
<i>Where did it go?</i>

772
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,589
A missing knife.

773
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,932
A missing body.

774
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,268
It's none of your business.

775
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,983
Butt out.

776
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,223
JINHOO

777
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,563
Hey, when did you say
the knife went missing?

778
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,347
I never said I liked him.

779
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,940
I just had some butterflies. That's all.

780
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,614
How dare he dump me
when I didn't even confess my feelings?

781
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,493
How dare he pity me?

782
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,105
I have something to say.

783
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,485
Me too.

784
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,372
What is it?

785
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,412
You go first.

786
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,044
No.

787
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,410
Let me go first.

788
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,462
<i>Maybe what I wanted to hear</i>

789
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,212
<i>was his apology.</i>

790
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,379
<i>But maybe what I wanted
to hear more than that</i>

791
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,554
<i>was that I was allowed to like him.
His permission.</i>

792
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,298
<i>But…</i>

793
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,473
I think…

794
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,976
he's still alive.

795
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:48,984
What?

796
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,112
I know this is a strange neighborhood.

797
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,019
But why would someone take a body?

798
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,977
And why did my knife go missing?

799
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,452
That only leads to one answer.

800
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,413
I think that man…

801
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,119
is still alive.

802
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,891
<i>So? And then?</i>

803
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,349
I mean, why hasn't he shown up yet?

804
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,145
Had he been alive,
he would've wanted to retaliate.

805
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,773
I haven't thought that far yet.

806
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,744
We should look for an answer.

807
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,370
<i>We later found out
the answer to this question.</i>

808
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,578
You should've carried it
on your back and run away!

809
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,334
<i>The night of the incident…</i>

810
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,004
-Why not?
-You're ridiculous.

811
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:36,422
<i>That moment when they panicked
after I had taken the fridge…</i>

812
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:43,925
What was that?

813
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,074
Sir… Sir.

814
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,403
Sir.

815
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,278
Blood.

816
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,156
<i>Something happened…</i>

817
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,249
<i>to Lee Jingeun.</i>

818
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,801
What did I expect?

819
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,054
Are you okay?

820
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,684
That wasn't what I was expecting to hear.

821
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,190
But in any case, thank you for telling me.

822
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,613
<i>My name is Noh Dahyun.</i>

823
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,622
<i>"Unlucky" is my middle name.</i>

824
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,488
<i>And I have the worst luck with men.</i>

825
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,004
<i>I am not destined</i>

826
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,079
<i>to be with a man.</i>

827
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,883
LINK

828
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,628
<i>If that man is still alive,</i>

829
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,887
<i>you have no reason
to hide from the police.</i>

830
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:50,889
<i>You're not a murderer.</i>

831
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,274
You're right.

832
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,018
<i>So he knows everything?</i>

833
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,560
Our lives depend on him.

834
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:59,603
<i>Then we need to get on his good side.</i>

835
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,518
<i>What's your name, Mr. Chef?</i>

836
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,938
<i>My name is Eun Gyehoon.</i>

837
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,936
<i>That kid is him.</i>

838
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,198
<i>Didn't I tell you
that you'll be in trouble?</i>

839
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,160
<i>I truly thought you liked me.</i>

840
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,329
<i>But that wasn't it.</i>

841
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,870
<i>You just thought
I could've been your sister, didn't you?</i>

842
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,084
<i>Can you please tell me
what happened this once?</i>

843
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,536
What in the world happened that day?
