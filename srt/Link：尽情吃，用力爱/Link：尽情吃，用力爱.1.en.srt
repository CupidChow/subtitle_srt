00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,481
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,484
Enjoy.

EPISODE 1

19
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,918
Great. Please serve it
to table number two.

20
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,046
For tables number three and four.
Go ahead.

21
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,514
Make the beef tartare more voluminous.

22
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,564
Chop vegetables the same width.

23
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,888
-Two centimeters.
-Yes, Chef.

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,313
Great. Looking good.

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
-Please check the taste.
-Yes, Chef.

26
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,442
He got dumped.

27
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,834
Put down the knife.

28
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,252
Stay out of the dinner shift today.

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,249
Yes, Chef.

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,080
Your depressed mood affects the food.

31
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,536
No personal feelings are permitted
in this kitchen. Keep that in mind.

32
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,667
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,572
The dish we have prepared is bonito…

34
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,329
Gyehoon.

35
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,132
Gyehoon!

36
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,382
-Oh, gosh!
-Eun Gyehoon!

37
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,883
What's wrong?

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,600
Are you really all right?

39
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,765
You're not ill?

40
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,229
"I'm not ill. I'm fine."

41
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,692
How many more times do I have to answer
for you to stop asking?

42
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,914
Good. It's great.

43
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,446
Then have you gone mad?

44
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,580
-No.
-Then what's the problem?

45
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,076
You've been acting totally strange
ever since you collapsed that day.

46
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,840
<i>Fresh ingredients and high-quality meat.</i>

47
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,051
<i>On top of it, you have the skilled chef
who has one Michelin star.</i>

48
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,263
<i>Now you can enjoy the food
from the comfort of your own home.</i>

49
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:08,139
<i>It's so delicious that it makes you cry
from overwhelming happiness.</i>

50
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,354
<i>You cried marketing the meat on TV.</i>

51
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,056
Tender snapper prepared via sous vide…

52
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,778
using butter sauce
with the highest quality beluga caviar…

53
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,781
It's a dish that we put in
a lot of time and effort.

54
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,704
I really hope
that you enjoy the food. Everyone…

55
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,662
-It'll taste great.
-<i>You cried while describing the dish.</i>

56
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,365
No.

57
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,366
<i>You sob for no reason.</i>

58
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,036
It's okay. You'll find someone better.

59
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,880
No, no.

60
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,887
I'm not laughing at him.

61
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,852
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.

62
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,730
I'm so sorry.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,690
<i>But then you laugh
when you're supposed to cry.</i>

64
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,188
How is that normal? You tell me.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,192
You're usually not like this.

66
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,823
You don't care about anything.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,940
You're like a robot
that is indifferent about everything.

68
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,408
How is it normal for someone like that
to get so emotional at everything?

69
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,408
Seriously, what is the matter?

70
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,790
Let me explain.

71
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,959
As the psychiatrist
and analytical psychologist Carl Jung says

72
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:26,677
meaningful coincidence through a concept
called synchronicity, or synchronization,

73
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,514
two or more meaningful emotions or events…

74
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,819
A mobile phone connects to Wi-Fi, right?

75
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,228
A mobile phone and a computer
can be synchronized too.

76
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,437
In the same way,
my brain waves or feelings

77
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,858
connect to another person's--

78
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,373
More simply put,

79
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,333
it's like telepathy between twins.

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,495
Like telepathy? And?

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,083
So, what I mean is…

82
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,180
Forget it.

83
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,055
Forget what?

84
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,969
Why?

85
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,604
You won't understand anyway.
What's the point of explaining?

86
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,475
What do you mean, I won't understand?

87
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,185
I know what twins are, you punk!

88
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,953
<i>They say some twins have</i>

89
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,782
<i>a psychological connection at times
that's difficult to explain.</i>

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,374
-Stop. I said stop.
-No.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,035
You little shrimp.
What are you making that for?

92
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
-You're an idiot, you little shrimp.
-Stop it.

93
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,878
<i>Eun Gyeyoung, my younger sister…</i>

94
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,625
<i>and me. Like us.</i>

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
<i>Stop it.</i>

96
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,693
Gyeyoung!

97
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,149
Go faster. Let's ride it now!

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,741
<i>From time to time,
I can feel her joy, sadness,</i>

99
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,568
<i>or fear.</i>

100
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,661
<i>Stop it.</i>

101
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,832
Gyeyoung.

102
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,539
<i>Even if we're far apart, it feels so real.</i>

103
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,582
-I told you to get out of my way.
-We were here first.

104
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,955
Jeez.

105
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,292
Hey!

106
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,804
Hey!

107
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,546
Why did you bully my sister?

108
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
I didn't bully her!

109
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,469
Get off me!

110
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,765
Hey!

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,138
<i>That was a very long time ago.</i>

112
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,189
<i>But it started again…</i>

113
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,935
<i>after 18 years.</i>

114
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,782
-You're going to buy it for me, right?
-Yes.

115
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,776
-Me too, Mom.
-Okay.

116
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,157
<i>Could it be that Gyeyoung…</i>

117
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,163
<i>is alive?</i>

118
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,417
<i>No way.</i>

119
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,848
<i>If not, then who on earth can it be?</i>

RESET YOUR LIFE
FAILURE IS THE 5G TO SUCCESS!

Aren't you supposed to be at work?
Why are you opening the door?

128
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,085
A lot of people
work from home these days, Mom.

129
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,169
-Really?
-Yes.

130
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,797
<i>No, I'm lying.</i>

131
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,723
A good company is certainly different.

132
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,347
<i>It's not a good company.</i>

133
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,061
You should work there forever.

134
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,596
<i>I already quit long ago.</i>

135
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,019
I said you don't need to
bring me anything.

136
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,568
I can cook my own food. Why do you
keep barging in unannounced?

137
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,822
Am I not welcome here?
What am I, a debt collector?

138
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,365
-What? Barging in?
-Gosh. Seriously.

139
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,923
Put that in the refrigerator.
It might spill.

140
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,039
-I said I'll take care of it.
-Gosh.

141
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,005
Don't waste your salary
and move to a nicer and bigger place.

142
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,630
I'm going to move.

143
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,717
<i>I lost all of my deposit
since I couldn't pay rent.</i>

144
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,180
Don't act so conceited
and always be humble, okay?

145
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,889
I am humble.

146
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,229
<i>No, actually I'm cowardly.</i>

147
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,866
There is… an odd smell.

148
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,615
Did you wash up?

149
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,581
I didn't get to because I was so busy.

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,170
<i>I ran three kilometers
to come home because of you.</i>

151
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,264
You can't be too good at what you do.

152
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,509
Don't overdo it,
so that they can relate to you.

153
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,222
Don't try to be the best even at work.

154
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,385
You're so ridiculous.

155
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,603
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

156
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,189
This is comfy.

157
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,520
Mom.

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,320
Yes?

159
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,822
<i>I'm not all that.</i>

160
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,243
What? Say it.

161
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,448
Never mind.

162
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,064
Take a taxi. Don't take the bus.

163
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,652
It's okay.

164
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,017
Just take it.

165
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,774
Gosh, it's fine.

166
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,856
Just take it when I'm giving it to you.

167
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,653
-Be miserly. What's wrong with you?
-You're embarrassing me.

168
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,487
But 20,000 won is too much. Hey.

169
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,782
It's two stations away by bus.

170
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,575
-Just take a taxi. I'll hail one.
-No, it's okay.

171
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,539
Make sure you eat and wash up, okay?

172
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,291
Okay, Mom. Go now.

173
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,785
Sir, we can leave now.

174
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,088
-Bye.
-Get home safely.

175
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,982
<i>Thank you for coming to Seoul Gourmet Fair

00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,833
<i>and live cooking shows
by famous chefs from top restaurants.</i>

180
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,371
Ta-da.

181
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,122
Everyone, look at this long line.

182
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,455
I'm in front of the booth

183
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,918
of the famous Chef Eun Gyehoon.

184
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,093
-It's also the reason why I came.
-Chef Cha, it's too thick. Make it watery.

185
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,092
<i>Kadaif </i>needs to look
more golden brown overall.

186
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,384
Yes, Chef.

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,890
Please enjoy.

188
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,330
<i>I know you've all waited long for this.</i>

189
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:19,173
<i>Today's main event,
Chef Eun Gyehoon's food show starts now!</i>

190
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,304
Hello.

191
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,219
-This is nice.
-Even Europe isn't that great these days.

192
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,142
Too many Koreans.

193
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,470
But Northern Europe is a bit different.

194
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,135
Really? What part of Northern Europe?

195
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,563
Either Sweden or Denmark.

196
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,233
-I just came back from Sweden.
-I'm so envious.

197
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,276
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

198
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,451
The food is so tasty here.

199
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,043
-Not bad.
-It's good.

200
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,622
The chef here is from San Sebastián.

201
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,504
-Oh, I see.
-No wonder. It melts in your mouth.

202
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,583
-Shall we toast?
-Sounds good.

203
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,342
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

204
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,171
Dahyun.

205
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,585
Hey, Ms. Yoon.

206
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,304
You disappeared
during the event last time.

207
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,354
Oh, it's because my mom
showed up at my place unannounced.

208
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,218
Do I really have to put up
with such nonsense excuses?

209
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,310
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

210
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,442
I feel uncomfortable
hiring someone like you

211
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,689
who is highly educated, has no experience
in this field, and old. You know, right?

212
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,022
Of course, I know
and I'm very grateful to you.

213
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,112
My goodness, Ms. Yoon.
You have such beautiful skin.

214
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,744
Like a computer graphic image. No pores.

215
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,321
Don't flatter me. I feel sorry for you.

216
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,989
No, I mean it.

217
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,544
I'll believe you, so please work hard.

218
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,328
Your salary that covers your expenses

219
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,662
is all coming out of my pocket.
Please don't forget that.

220
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,543
Of course, I know it.

221
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,294
You have to be determined too, okay?

222
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,376
You got fired
because you weren't determined.

223
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:57,216
<i>Chef Eun Gyehoon has prepared
squid ink rosé pasta today.</i>

224
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,437
<i>I wonder what it'll be like.
What an exciting moment.</i>

225
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,551
You're sensing something? Wi-Fi?

226
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,472
Gosh, I feel irritated and stuffy.

227
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,141
It's suffocating.

228
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,443
-Where is he going?
-What's going on?

229
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,937
Oh…

230
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,819
I'm sorry. I thought no one would be here.

231
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,197
Then I'll go now not to bother you.

232
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,543
I didn't rent this out.

233
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,330
-Pardon?
-I mean…

234
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,634
I don't own this place.
Please go ahead and rest.

235
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,629
You came up here
to get away from people like me.

236
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,338
Well…

237
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,183
Then,

238
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,388
I'll stay quiet not to bother you.

239
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,813
I'll stay quiet too.

240
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,849
Sounds good.

241
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,403
Great.

242
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,433
Would you like some?

243
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,642
Thank you. I'll just take one.

244
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,475
It's so pretty.

245
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,406
It's so delicious.

246
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,792
Now I know what it tastes like.

247
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,424
I only served food.
It's my first time eating it.

248
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,125
What you just ate was

249
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,835
crispy seaweed cracker
topped with tapioca,

250
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,215
abalone sauce, and salmon roe.

251
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,431
And this is fermented halibut apple wrap.

252
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,807
And this one is carpaccio
with seasonal seafood.

253
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,062
Oh, then…

254
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:10,983
CHEF EUN GYEHOON

255
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,111
Based on your fancy words,
I suppose you're a famous chef.

256
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,231
I can't deny it.

257
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,242
Just one more then?

258
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,485
If you insist, I won't decline your offer.

259
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,873
I didn't really insist…

260
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,789
Drink this.

261
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,549
Thank you. I'm not usually this shameless.

262
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,643
I see. Good food can make people happy.

263
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,044
I felt so sorry for myself today.

264
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,618
I don't particularly
hate my life, you know?

265
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,205
Because I myself shouldn't hate it,
at the very least.

266
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,627
But today, I wanted to be

267
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,722
among those fabulous people
just for a day.

268
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,600
Thinking that,

269
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,428
it made me feel
so pathetic and discouraged.

270
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,981
But thanks to you, I feel better.

271
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,901
I'm so ridiculous.

272
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,401
Why am I telling you all this?
We just met.

273
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,239
Sometimes you feel
more comfortable with a stranger.

274
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,504
You're right.

275
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,297
<i>By any chance… is she the one?</i>

276
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,979
Wait.

277
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,061
I have a question for you.

278
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,272
Go ahead.

279
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,994
By any chance…

280
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,829
The thing is…

281
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,207
I usually don't give it out so easily.
I swear, this is my first time.

282
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,636
Give me your phone.

283
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,679
Pardon? Why do you need my phone?

284
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,932
I'll input my number.

285
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,558
Why would you do that?

286
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,353
Weren't you trying
to ask for my phone number?

287
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:40,941
No, I wasn't.

288
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,152
Then what?

289
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,822
The thing is…

290
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,742
Would it be rude to ask
where you used to live as a kid?

291
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,696
Pardon?

292
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,082
I know this is also rude to ask,
but how old are you?

293
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,169
Why do you need to know that?

294
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,589
I know it sounds weird, but can we play
rock-paper-scissors just once?

295
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,340
My goodness.

296
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,595
Thank you… for the food.

297
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,349
Gosh, is he a lunatic?

298
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,815
He doesn't want my number,
but he asks about my neighborhood and age?

299
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,157
Let's smile.
They say, smiling brings blessings.

300
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,251
Do you know him?

301
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,757
-No.
-Oh, I see. You don't.

302
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,183
Why is he talking down suddenly?

303
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,766
Thank you for your hard work today.

304
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,100
Eunji, I look forward to
working with you again tomorrow.

305
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,187
Minyoung, you're off tomorrow?
See you at next week's event.

306
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,903
Great work today.

307
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,910
What?

308
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,617
It looks like it's used.

309
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,714
Ms. Yoon, what's all this?

310
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,424
Chef Eun Gyehoon wanted
to give it to you, so I put it there.

311
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,796
Why would he give this…

312
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,262
But he's quite a famous chef.

313
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,433
I guess you were
hitting on him while working.

314
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,392
It's not like that.
Besides, I don't hit on men.

315
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,773
You didn't even hit on him,
but that chef just fell for you.

316
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,101
I'm not interested in men.

317
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,645
It was proven again today,

318
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,404
but I'm not very lucky with men.

319
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,164
It was hard work, wasn't it?

320
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,777
Great work today.

321
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,407
-Go home safely!
-See you later!

322
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,583
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

323
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,588
We meet again.

324
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm glad I ran into you.

325
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,972
Pardon?

326
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,345
This… What's this for?

327
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,524
Oh, that.

328
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,225
It looked like you enjoyed the food.

329
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,729
I didn't mean much by it,
so you don't need to refuse.

330
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,319
Since you didn't mean much, I'll refuse.

331
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,204
But it's no big deal.

332
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,570
Maybe I gave you room to misunderstand me

333
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,158
by opening up to you and laughing.

334
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,872
No, I didn't misunderstand you.

335
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,122
Why would you give me something like this
if you didn't misunderstand?

336
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,459
But I didn't give you anything fancy.

337
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,286
Look.

338
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,545
It's just the food you ate earlier
and a slice of cake.

339
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,971
And…

340
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,221
a scarf…

341
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,101
Scarf? Why is the scarf in here…

342
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,678
That's my point. Why did you give me that?

343
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,891
I think there is a misunderstanding.

344
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,266
Who gives a used scarf as a gift?

345
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,904
Are you a pervert?

346
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,360
Pervert?

347
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,990
Wait. I'm not like that. Wait!

348
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,032
Gyehoon, what's that?

349
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,163
I'm the one who wants to ask.
What is this?

350
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,077
Where is the trash can?

351
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,330
-Boo!
-Oh, gosh!

352
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,370
Dahyun, it's me.

353
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,794
You startled me.

354
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,086
Did I startle you?
Sorry, I thought you'd know it was me.

355
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,303
How would I know that?

356
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,965
You're so weird.

357
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,839
Why wouldn't you know? We've been
living in the same neighborhood.

358
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,803
Is that right?

359
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,018
Gosh, you said the same thing last time.

360
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,218
I'm about to feel very sad.

361
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
Please don't do that again, okay?

362
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,515
It's a terrible hobby.

363
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay. I won't do it again. Sorry.

364
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,200
Don't walk around alone at night.
It's very dangerous.

365
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,748
The night air feels refreshing.

366
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,218
RECIPIENT: NOH DAHYUN

367
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,870
Seriously, is someone stalking me?

00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,999
<i>Chef Eun Gyehoon wanted
to give it to you, so I put it there.</i>

371
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,343
I didn't mean much by it,
so you don't need to refuse.

372
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,762
What's wrong with him? Seriously.

373
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,931
Would it be rude to ask
where you used to live as a kid?

374
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:29,932
How old are you?

375
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,103
Can we play rock-paper-scissors just once?

376
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,846
He did seem kind of strange.

377
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,435

379
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,453
<i>There is a rumor that Chef Eun Gyehoon
lost his mind. Is that true?</i>

380
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,911
<i>He keeps laughing and crying.</i>

381
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,081
<i>-I'm disappointed in him.
-He kept asking where I live.</i>

382
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,370
<i>-He's not sane.</i>
<i>-I saw him laughing like a crazy person.</i>

383
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,214
<i>He asked me to play
rock-paper-scissors today.</i>

384
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,869
<i>I'm not sure, but he doesn't seem normal.</i>

385
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,957
So he is actually crazy.

386
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,798
Gosh.

387
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,257
ELECTRONICS, COMPUTERS WHOLESALE

388
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,553
If she had become a grown-up,
she would look like this, right?

389
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,592
Yes. She'd look 70 to 80% similar to that.

390
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,738
Gyeongnidan-gil, Mangridan-gil,
Songridan-gil, Bamridan-gil,

Yeontral Park, Gongtral Park,
Ikseon-dong, Seongsu-dong,

392
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,868
Seorae Village, Bukchon,
Seochon, and Hongdae.

393
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,337
You're at the crossroad.
You can be fired anytime.

394
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,959
You keep laughing and crying
like a crazy person. I'd fire you too.

395
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,511
So what I mean is that we should
just open our own restaurant.

396
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,430
JIHWA-DONG

397
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,635
Jihwa-dong? I've never heard of it.

398
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:41,984
That's the place.

399
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,364
Is it the latest trendy spot?

400
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,069
Sure. I suppose it's better to do it
in an up-and-coming neighborhood.

401
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,704
Jihwa-dong. Jiridan-gil.

402
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,662
I'm excited about it.

403
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,832
Jihwa-dong. Jiridan-gil.

404
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,996
JIHWA-DONG

405
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,462
<i>Please go to Jihwa-dong.</i>

406
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,417
Is this your first time here?

407
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,256
Or it's the opposite.

408
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,222
Why, sir?

409
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,972
Who looks out the window these days?

410
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,557
Everyone's always staring at their phones.

411
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,429
You look familiar.

412
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,064
What brings you to Jihwa-dong?

413
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,306
I'm going to live here.

414
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,823
I just came empty-handed today,

415
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,491
but my belongings will arrive soon too.

416
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,034
But you look like you came here to die.

417
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:34,985
Pardon?

418
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,164
Nothing.

419
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,963
Welcome to our town, Jihwa-dong.

420
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,796
I'm policeman Ji Wontak. I was
just transferred to the Jihwa Patrol Unit.

421
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
I'm very happy to join
the Jihwa Patrol Unit.

422
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,465
I'll work hard.

423
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,100
All right!

424
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,008
A SAFE COUNTRY FOR CITIZENS,
THE POLICE WILL MAKE IT SO!

425
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,098
Assistant Inspector Hwang.
His name is Ji Wontak, a new probationer.

426
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,305
And she is…

427
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,359
She'll be your mentor
for the next six months.

428
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,611
-She's Jihwa Patrol Unit's--
-I'm not the centerpiece.

429
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,065
Right, she's not the centerpiece.
She's just an assistant inspector.

430
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,783
You just met, right?

431
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,036
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,622
Perhaps it's love at first sight.

433
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,287
After looking at your aged faces daily,

434
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,796
it's refreshing to look at his face.

435
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,048
Does that explain things?

436
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,512
Follow me.

437
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,974
You're already talking down to him?

438
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,135
It'll happen eventually anyway.

439
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,969
-Do you have a problem with that?
-Not at all, ma'am.

440
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,306
Great. Follow me. I'll show you around.

441
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,018
She's good at disciplining.

442
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,321
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

443
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,952
Here is police car number 11.
We'll take this to patrol today.

444
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,058
Get in. We'll be patrolling
for the next two hours.

445
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,477
I never thought we'd meet again like this.

446
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,531
Has it been three years since we broke up?

447
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,656
You look different like this.

448
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,615
Nothing changed.

449
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,915
You're used to seeing me naked.
I'm wearing clothes now.

450
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,632
Put on your seatbelt.

451
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,588
That's right. We were quite passionate--

452
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,764
If you bring up the past
and talk down to me one more time,

453
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,184
I'll kill you.

454
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,854
But this is the only place
we can talk privately--

455
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,143
Answer me.

456
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,943
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,541

00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,462

00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,502
Let me explain.

460
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,957
These are…

461
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,336
PAYMENT OVERDUE NOTICE
UNPAID RENT!

462
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,805

ROSE RESTAURANT

464
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,087
Hey, outta the way.

465
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,258
Gosh, seriously.

466
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,359
What? What's going on?

467
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,229
Mom, people can see us.
It's so embarrassing.

468
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,276
-Be quiet, you brat!
-Mom!

469
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,904
-Where are you going? Get back here.
-I can't hear them.

470
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,067
-Look at them.
-What a mess.

471
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,156
-Be quiet.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

472
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,411
I said be quiet. I can't hear.

473
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,412
You'll open a restaurant
for European contemporary cuisine

474
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,368
bistronomy, right?

475
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,287
-What are they saying?
-At a place like this?

476
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,884
-Shouldn't we go in and stop them?
-Enough already.

477
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,211
-What are they still doing?
-My goodness.

478
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,837
ROSE RESTAURANT

479
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,564
It looks like a haunted attraction.

480
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,323
Even in broad daylight.

481
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,775
This place is awesome.

482
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,949
It's the best, Gyehoon.

483
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,349
Gosh, I repeatedly told you
that public urination is prohibited here.

484
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,808
DEATH SENTENCE IF CAUGHT URINATING

485
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,568
This is the public urination prime zone.

486
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,235
Both people and dogs like urinating here.

487
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,199
A hot spot… for public urination?

488
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,409
Over here, police lady!

489
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,332
Why haven't you fixed the streetlamp yet?

490
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,674
Don't you know that the streetlamp
with the surveillance camera is broken?

491
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,379
Right, but that's not
our patrol unit's responsibility.

492
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,170
We submitted complaints everywhere.
You're all ignoring us.

493
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,506
I guess it'll take another dead body

494
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,931
for them to take action at once.

495
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,430
Don't say something so horrible.

496
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,062
As I've told you before,
the district office handles that.

497
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,023
But if I can, I'll check it for you.

498
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,562
-Do it now.
-We already told you.

499
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,725
-How come you don't listen?
-What's going on?

500
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,194
-Are you ignoring us?
-Are we not important to you?

501
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,105
-What's the issue?
-We asked already.

502
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,743
This is so ridiculous.

503
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:56,288
-How long do we have to wait?
-It's so terrible.

504
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,960
They didn't change at all.

505
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,828
-Fix it right away.
-I have to bring it up again.

506
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,626
<i>Gyehoon, wait for me!</i>

507
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,802
-Gyehoon, you have to wait for me!
-Jeez!

508
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,628
-I said, wait for me.
-Hurry up.

509
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,135
Gyehoon, you have to wait for me.

510
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,220
-I said, wait for me!
-What do you want?

511
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,636
-Gyehoon, hurry up!
-Seriously.

512
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,934
Mom and Dad told you to look after me.

513
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,808
You can just watch me play then.

514
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,606
You have to keep your promise.

515
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,229
<i>My sister Gyeyoung was timid.</i>

516
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,687
Stop crying.

517
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,284
I told you so many times that if you cry,
it makes me cry too since we're twins.

518
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,663
Because you're such a chicken,
it makes me look like one too.

519
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,582
<i>I was annoyed
by my sister who was like that.</i>

520
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,870
You can eat this while you wait for me.

521
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,287
Just stay right here, okay?

522
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,045
<i>As a ten-year-old,
I cared more about my friends</i>

523
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,205
<i>than a promise I made
to my parents and my sister.</i>

524
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,631
<i>It was bound to happen.</i>

525
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,588
I have to score!

526
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,057
Gyehoon.

527
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,455
Gyeyoung.

528
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,770
Don't fool around.

529
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,102
Gyeyoung.

530
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,064
Gyeyoung! Where are you?

531
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,860
<i>I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.</i>

532
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,572
Gyeyoung!

533
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,242
<i>That's how… Gyeyoung disappeared.</i>

534
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,076
-Gyeyoung!
-Eun Gyeyoung!

535
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,658
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

536
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,004
-Gyeyoung! Where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

537
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,170
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

538
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,789
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

539
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,416
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung! Where are you?

540
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,554
-Where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

541
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:15,471
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

542
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,045
What's going to happen to Gyeyoung, honey?

543
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,968
Don't worry too much.
Gyeyoung is going to be fine.

544
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,767
-Gyeyoung!
-Eun Gyeyoung!

545
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,350
-Eun Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

546
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,977
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

547
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,614
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

548
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,401
-Gyeyoung, can you hear me?
-Gyeyoung!

549
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,525
-Can you hear me?
-Gyeyoung!

550
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,621
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

551
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,199
-Gyeyoung, where are you?
-Gyeyoung!

552
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,445
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

553
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,997
-Gyeyoung!
-Gyeyoung!

554
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,668
Are you all right?

555
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,858
What do you think, Gyehoon?

556
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,065
Can you sense

557
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,530
Gyeyoung's feelings?

558
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,242
Gyeyoung is…

559
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,919
very scared right now, Dad.

560
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,919
It's okay.

561
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,878
That's evidence that Gyeyoung is

562
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,594
still alive and safe.

563
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,175
Don't cry.

564
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,138
Gyehoon,

565
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,563
I know it's hard for you right now,
but you have to keep telling me

566
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,233
how Gyeyoung is doing

567
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,280
and what she is feeling.
You have to keep telling me, okay?

568
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,959
<i>I was just ten years old,</i>

569
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,431
<i>but I could tell…</i>

570
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,103
<i>that Gyeyoung died.</i>

571
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,151
What? What's wrong? Is she scared again?

572
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,188
It's okay.

573
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,526
That means Gyeyoung is…

574
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,027
Gyeyoung is still alive.

575
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,615
It's okay.

576
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,667
<i>Since then, I could
no longer sense Gyeyoung's feelings,</i>

577
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,551
<i>and the police couldn't find
Gyeyoung's body or the culprit.</i>

578
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,138
<i>It became one of many unsolved cases.</i>

579
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,520
<i>But what does this phenomenon mean,
which is starting again</i>

580
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,941
<i>after 18 years?</i>

581
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,280
Come here. You think you can run away?

582
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,236
-Either you die or I die, you brat!
-Gosh, Mom!

583
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,072
Don't you dare come back in!

584
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,617
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

585
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,804
Oh, my goodness. Lunatic.

586
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,339
Pardon? "Lunatic"?

587
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,262
Did you follow me all the way here?

588
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,513
What do you mean, I followed you here?

589
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,678
You live in this neighborhood?
What a coincidence.

590
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,020
"You live in this neighborhood?"

591
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,351
Coincidence, my foot.

592
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,767
Listen. You're caught red-handed.

593
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,355
What do you mean,
caught red-handed? I don't get it.

594
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,111
He kept asking about my neighborhood,
and ends up following me home.

595
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,574
Gosh, please don't exaggerate.

596
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,574
-Jeez.
-What's wrong with him?

597
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,616
I only asked once--

598
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,619
Forget it.

599
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,500
Don't you dare send me weird packages
and prowl around me again.

600
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,868
I guess you don't know.
Stalking is no longer a misdemeanor.

601
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,076
You may face up to three years in prison
or a maximum of 30 million won in fines.

602
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,877
I'll put you away,
you pervert stalker. Got that?

603
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,666
Mom!

604
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,683
Why is she calling me a pervert stalker?
I really don't get it.

605
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,635
That explains why we came here.

606
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,983
No, it's not like that.

607
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,522
-Gosh, he's putting all men to shame.
-No, it's not like that.

608
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,154
-How pathetic.
-No, it's really not like that.

609
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,481
-My goodness.
-Don't deny it.

610
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,283
Never!

611
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,529
-Yeah, right.
-Hey, come back here.

612
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,611
-My goodness.
-Hey.

613
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,488
-Take care.
-See you later.

614
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,907
You need to be careful.

615
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,905
He seemed normal.

616
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,290
Oh, gosh.

617
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,705
How is it that I run into her here?

618
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,109
Gyehoon,

619
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,610
are you really stalking that woman?

620
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,863
No, I'm not.

621
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,330
I'll start…

622
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,119
my restaurant here.

623
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,997
Gyehoon.

624
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Let's do it together, Chef Cha.

625
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,247
Do you really need me?

626
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,419
You'll be fine alone.

627
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,505
I…

628
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,715
really need you, Jinhoo.

629
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,774
Gyehoon, why would you need
someone like me?

630
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,810
<i>Clear out of the studio
and come back home.</i>

631
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,569
We're going to eat dinner together.
Join us if you're free, Dahyun.

632
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,867
She's busy. Why are you so oblivious?

633
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,236
You're right. She's totally busy.

634
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,868
Who? Me?

635
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,720
<i>Bus number 46 will be arriving shortly.</i>

636
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,684
Are you looking for me?

637
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,693
<i>Everyone knows that you're
secretly dating Mr. Lee Jingeun.</i>

638
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,055
<i>What?</i>

639
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,649
He asked so earnestly not to spread rumors
and pretend as if I didn't know about it.

640
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,494
He said dating
among coworkers may look bad.

641
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,818
What is all this?

642
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,327
DATE ON OUR WAY HOME

643
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,039
You're really not dating?

644
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,909
Are you pretending as if you aren't dating
so that you can break up?

645
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,457
That's really wrong.

646
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,214
I said no.

647
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,594
We're really not dating.

648
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,966
There is a weird rumor going around.
Do you know about it by any chance?

649
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,470
The rumor that we're dating?

650
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:19,017
Aren't you dumbfounded?
What a ridiculous rumor.

651
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:19,979
Don't you think?

652
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,654
By any chance…

653
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,605
I'm asking just in case.

654
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,866
-The items--
-The gifts.

655
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,946
Are you the one who sent them?

656
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,124
You didn't like them?

657
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,495
I was really curious

658
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,879
why you didn't wear them

659
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,295
and why you kept throwing them away.

660
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,849
Are you also the one who spread

661
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,059
such a nonsense rumor that we're dating?

662
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,933
But we are dating.

663
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,404
No, we're not.
There's nothing between us. You know that.

664
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,191
You know it clearly. Why do you
keep saying such nonsense?

665
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,319
Then why did you smile at me?

666
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,360
Pardon?

667
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,946
You're the one
who always smiled at me first.

668
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:19,874
Have some coffee.

669
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,911
Let's smile.
They say, smiling brings blessings.

670
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,867
Here comes coffee.

671
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,746
<i>I never smiled at you.</i>

672
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,253
Here is your coffee, Ms. Yoon.

673
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,047
We had a meal together too.

674
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,510
No, everyone ate together.

675
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,300
I never knew that you could eat so well.

676
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,966
<i>We also had a date on our way home.</i>

677
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,425
<i>We just ran into each other a few times
heading the same way.</i>

678
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,274
Dahyun, you aren't generally like this.
I'm about to feel disappointed.

679
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,517
You're giving me goosebumps.
Have you lost your mind, Mr. Lee?

680
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,726
You seem upset. What's wrong?
What are you upset about?

681
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,068
It's okay. I'm very understanding.

682
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,703
-Just tell me, please.
-Mr. Lee Jingeun.

683
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,371
Please listen carefully
while I'm being nice.

684
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,410
I'm not interested in you at all,
and it'll remain that way going forward.

685
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,865
So please don't say crazy things
like we're dating ever again. Okay?

686
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,549
-Is there someone else now?
-So what if there's someone else?

687
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,340
-It's none of your business.
-See? I'm right.

688
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,263
Let go of me!

689
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,053
You lunatic.
I don't ever want to see your face again.

690
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,767
What? What's wrong with her?

691
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,228
Why is she doing this…

692
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,900
I never should've moved back in.

693
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,155
How am I going to live with my mom?

694
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,506
I think there is a misunderstanding.

695
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,095
Are you a pervert?

696
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,680
Don't you dare send me weird packages
and prowl around me again.

697
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,225
I'll put you away,
you pervert stalker. Got that?

698
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,897
Why is she calling me a pervert stalker?

699
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,926
She said he's a pervert.
It's okay to watch him then, right?

700
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,933
Is it? I'm not so sure.

701
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,885
Perverts have their rights too.
Don't you think?

702
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,145
-Rights, my foot.
-What kind of food will it be?

703
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,609
-Chinese food? Snacks?
-I doubt it'll be Korean food.

704
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,819
I hope it's a bakery.

705
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,940
-A bakery sounds good.
-Yes, a bakery.

706
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,357
-I like <i>soboro</i> bread.
-Bakery?

707
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,490
It's not going to be a bakery.
I'm opening a bistronomy.

708
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,494
-A what "nom"?
-Oh…

709
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,995
A "bistronomy" is
an intermediate form between bistro,

710
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,922
which means casual dining, and gastronomy,
which means authentic gourmet.

711
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,551
It means a restaurant where you can enjoy
high-quality food in a casual atmosphere.

712
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,970
Originally, I was going to do
French contemporary fine dining…

713
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,180
What? I couldn't even understand.
It's just a restaurant after all.

714
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,811
Who told you to do that?

715
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,561
I asked her to do it.

716
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,812
Why can't you just leave her alone?

717
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,067
Gosh, what an eyesore.

718
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,479
Hey, don't hang around at the restaurant.

719
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,397
Don't do anything here. Put that down.

720
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,912
Get out now.

721
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,119
Go to the library and study.
You'll take the civil service exam, right?

722
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,874
Yes.

723
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,594
-Go get me some radish before you go.
-But you told me to go to the library.

724
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,669
Go after getting the radish.

725
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,264
You just told me not to do anything here.
Make up your mind.

726
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,720
Stop grumbling, okay? That brat.

727
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,096
Get soybean sprouts and water celery too.

728
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:09,847
And an energy drink too!

729
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,104
I need money.

730
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,777
Wait!

731
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,030
I wasn't prowling around you.
It's a coincidence.

732
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,657
I'm really not a pervert stalker.

733
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,464
Of course, I know that you're not.

734
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,788
You do? What a relief--

735
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,002
Wait. You do know?

736
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,247
That was my misunderstanding, sir.
You weren't the stalker.

737
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,338
I'm very sorry.

738
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,215
-No thanks.
-Pardon?

739
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,144
Apology not accepted.

740
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,635
Can you just accept it? I had a situation
that caused the misunderstanding.

741
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,767
Not accepted.

742
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,313
We'll keep running into each other.
It'll be very uncomfortable.

743
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,857
It's already, very, terribly,
and indescribably uncomfortable.

744
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,652
Why? Everyone in the entire neighborhood
thinks that I am…

745
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,703
a pervert stalker.

746
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,493
Gosh, you must be feeling so upset.

747
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,416
I'll repair the damages as best as I can.

748
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,210
I'll go around and tell everyone
that you're not a pervert.

749
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:25,011
Sir, can you let it slide just this once
like your generous-looking face?

750
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,470
Please don't try to flatter me.

751
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,089
And don't call me "sir."

752
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,096
I'm not trying to flatter you.
I mean it, Chef.

753
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,468
So stop being upset and forgive--

754
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,153
Gosh.

755
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,816
You didn't have to kneel down.

756
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,324
It's not what you think.

757
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,662
I see. It wasn't.

758
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,121
Gosh, he's so heartless.

759
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,788
-You must be in pain.
-You got your revenge.

760
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,376
Not really.

761
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,836
What goes around comes around.
Good triumphs over evil. That's all.

762
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,470
Can you help me?

763
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,309
It's not broken.

764
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,020
You seem saddened by that.

765
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,017
Just a little.

766
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,545
Are you able to walk?

767
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,639
Yes, of course.

768
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,731
You're accepting my apology then, right?

769
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,187
-No.
-Come on, please accept it.

770
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,074
-I don't want to.
-You hold grudges, don't you?

771
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,611
-Yes.
-But I even hurt my leg.

772
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,406
I think you're faking it.

773
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,468
Why is this town so small?

774
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,690
Not that leg.

775
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,447
The other leg.

776
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,873
-Pardon?
-The other day,

777
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,410
you were limping on the other leg.

778
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,328
You have to have a good memory
to deceive people, you know?

779
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,856
Sir, we want to…

780
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,735
throw away everything here.
So please put them outside.

781
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,820
The plywood and all the little items.

782
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,276
Please throw them all out.

783
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,567
Dahyun.

784
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,117
Dahyun!

-Gosh. Mom, you laugh at everything.
<i>-I am.</i>

790
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,141
Just watch it.

791
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,063
Dahyun, let's talk. Please?

792
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,845
Dahyun, let's talk.

793
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,935
Seriously!

794

Grandma!

795
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,741
I said, let's talk. Okay?

796
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,952
-Get off of me.
-Come on!

797
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,698
Mom!

798
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,141
<i>After that, my memory is hazy.</i>

01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,202
<i>he was…</i>

<i>dead.</i>

JIHWA PATROL UNIT

803
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,310
-One moment, please.
-Let go of me.

804
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,479
-May I help you?
-Sir,

805
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,192
-please lie down here.
-You said, 24 years old?

806
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,983
-Yes, 24 years old.
-Okay.

807
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,857
Sir, drink this and wake up, okay?

808
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,409
You have to drink this, okay?

809
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,739
You've been waiting, right?

810
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,366
We usually handle things on-site nowadays,
so the station doesn't get so busy.

811
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,294
But it's so hectic today.

812
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,583
It's a wild Friday night.

813
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,326
It's okay.

814
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,375
So how may I help you?

815
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:05,797
The thing is…

816
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,509
Well… I…

817
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:13,466
-Let go! I said, let go!
-What are you gonna do about it?

818
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,095
-Ouch, that hurts.
-I said, let go!

819
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:19,185
-I said, let go of me.
-What's wrong with you, punk?

820
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,822
-Let go of me!
-Did you just hit me?

821
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,319
Why don't you sell cigarettes?

822
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:25,151
He was collapsed on the street.

823
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,566
Uncuff me. Uncuff me, you punk!

824
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,815
You're all dead meat. Uncuff me!

825
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,447
Hey, uncuff me now!
Why aren't you taking it off?

826
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,575
-Darn it.
-Gosh, seriously.

827
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:36,872
-Let go of me.
-You're here.

828
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,915
-Gosh. Hey!
-Let go.

829
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,343
-Gosh. Hey!
-Both of you, put your hands down.

830
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:48,126
-Please stay still.
-Darn it!

831
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,257
-Sir.
-Hey, let go.

832
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,184
I'll come back another time. Bye.

833
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,274
-Put your hands down.
-We'll do it right away.

834
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,559
-Let go of me.
-That's enough. Come over here.

CHOONOK STEW

836
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,055

Grandma.

838
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,275
What happened?

839
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,373
The thing is…

840
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,371
it was self-defense.

841
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,292
That scum was trying to kill me.

842
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,460
Oh, my goodness.

843
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,131
So where did you go just now?

844
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,380
-I went to turn myself in, but--
-What?

845
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,640
Did you do it?

846
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,635
No, I couldn't.

847
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,556
What am I going to do now?

848
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,822
It's okay.

849
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,815
<i>I don't remember this moment
very clearly either.</i>

850
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,041
Stop crying and listen to me carefully.

851
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:48,457
I'll take care of everything,

852
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,053
so just do as I say.

853
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,014
Pull yourself together!

854
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,890
Got it?

855
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,511
Okay.

856
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,396
<i>Only later, did it come to mind.</i>

857
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,712
<i>That day, my mom and grandma…</i>

858
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,554
<i>seemed quite adept at it.</i>

859
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,933
I'll go get the truck.

860
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,474
Don't worry and go.

861
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:55,859
<i>They seemed as if they've done
something like this before.</i>

862
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,103
-Jinhoo.
-Yes?

863
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,730
-Go sleep comfortably now.
-Okay.

864
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,121
Why did they throw this out?

865
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,792
Wait a second. Why is it out here?

866
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,000
No, I only asked them to throw away
cupboards and things like that.

867
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,209
We can just put it back inside.

868
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,596
-Are you pulling it?
-Yes. Are you pushing it?

869
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,509
Why is it so heavy?

870
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:06,846
Oh, it's moving now.

871
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,605
You aren't pushing, are you?

872
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,993
Turn here.

873
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,655
We have to bring it inside the store.

874
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,493
Pull it.

875
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,135
Slowly.

877
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,118
Hello.

878
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,996
-Can I help you?
-Pardon?

879
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,213
-Go!
<i>-What will you do now?</i>

880
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,835
<i>We'll get it back at all costs.</i>

881
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,802
<i>I'll try to find out the passcode
or whatever to get the refrigerator back.</i>

882
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,354
And victims aren't the only ones
who come to the police.

883
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,638
<i>Perpetrators come too.</i>

884
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,351
<i>What happened last night?</i>

885
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:12,063
<i>Who did this to you?</i>

886
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:13,232
<i>Why do you care?</i>

887
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,900
Because I do! So who did this?

888
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,572
<i>If this happened to my younger sister,</i>

889
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,896
<i>that attacker would've died by my hands.</i>

890
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,985
<i>I'm going to turn myself in.</i>

891
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,780
<i>If push comes to shove, we'll have to</i>

892
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,414
<i>kill him.</i>
