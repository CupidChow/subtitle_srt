00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,930
Everything that is born dies

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,480
and all relationships come to an end.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,730
That's the way life goes.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,570
So you may grieve, but do not be sad.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,150
The Buddha once said,

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,360
"Do not grieve. Do not lament.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,320
All things must pass

9
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,330
-and everything vanishes. Therefore, you…"
<i>-Yes. Some are like that.</i>

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,960
<i>They overcome their grief and strive on.
They're admirable.</i>

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,620
"The mind is everything."

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,420
Bull… What a joke.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,340
But it is.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,180
Don't grieve? It's not like we'll all live
till we're 80 like Buddha did.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,430
Am I wrong?

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,600
<i>Some are the opposite.</i>

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,440
<i>They struggle in pain
and can't get over it.</i>

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>They're weak losers.</i>

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,190
<i>Just like me.</i>

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,820
Are you busy this weekend?

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,160
Yes.

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,750
<i>That's why I wasn't going to let anyone</i>

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>or anything…</i>

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,130
<i>get close to me ever again.</i>

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,680
<i>I didn't want to feel</i>

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>so terrified like this…</i>

27
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,060
<i>ever again.</i>

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,940
Dahyun. Noh Dahyun!

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,850
Where are you going?

30
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,140
It's me.

31
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,770
Didn't you miss me?

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,480
I missed you so much.

33
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,900
Don't be scared. I'm not here to hurt you.

34
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,530
The things you did…

35
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,660
to me, I'm partly responsible for them.

36
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,700
They're all in the past.

37
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,500
You lunatic.

38
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,870
Don't be like that again.

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,250
All couples get into little fights,

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,630
so I completely understand. Okay?

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,170
Stop that nonsense.

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,420
We never dated.

43
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,470
Gosh, seriously.

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,140
I'm… trying to be understanding. Right?

45
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm letting you win, got that?

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,030
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,610
I'm trying to reconcile things.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,410
You just need to say one thing.

49
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,120
"I was too mean last time, right?
I'm sorry."

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,130
I guess that's two things. Whatever.

51
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,840
In any case, easy enough, isn't it?

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,220
You stubborn little…

53
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,140
Apologize now.

54
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,510
I can't.

55
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,310
What?

56
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,020
I mean, I won't.

57
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,060
Actually, I've been regretting it so much.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,820
-About what?
-I should've made sure to end it then.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I should've gotten rid of you
once and for all.

60
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,450
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

61
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
So listen carefully.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,330
There is nothing between us.

63
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,670
You scumbag. From the moment
you came into my life until now,

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,540
you never meant anything to me,
not even for a moment. You're nothing!

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,090
When was it?

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,380
What?

67
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,390
When did I first come into your life?

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,140
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,770
Do you remember it?

70
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,810
Are you sure you remember it correctly?

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,570
Dahyun.

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,280
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

73
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,120
We met right in this alley
a very long time ago.

74
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,830
Right here in this neighborhood.
Don't you remember?

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,120
Noh Dahyun!

76
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,550
Noh Dahyun!

77
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,980
That's good.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Stay here for a second.

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
It's okay.

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,300
Lee Jingeun.

83
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,210
It's you again.

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,670
Lee Jingeun…

85
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,340
What do you want?

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,270
I asked what you wanted. Answer me!

87
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,200
What's up? You're being all scary.

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,950
What?

89
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,870
I'll get going.

90
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm pretty much done
with my business for the day.

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,910
Bye, Dahyun. See you again soon.

92
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,170
You're going to regret it.

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,350
If you ever come back,
I'll make sure you regret it.

94
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,560
How sad.

95
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,230
This isn't how
I imagined us meeting again.

96
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,610
<i>Back then</i>

97
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,200
and even now…

98
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,250
you're the problem.

99
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Are you okay?

100
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,810
-Chef.
-Why did you have to go by yourself?

101
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,280
-Sorry?
-You shouldn't have gone with Chef Lee.

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,820
Something could've happened.
Why are you so fearless?

103
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,660
Also, why did you hang up on me?

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,530
I looked everywhere for you.

105
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,330
I wandered from alley to alley
like a headless chicken feeling terrified.

106
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,580
I seriously…

107
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,540
What if I didn't find you?

108
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,090
What if something happened to you?

109
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,090
Why does this darn neighborhood
have so many little alleys?

110
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,050
There hasn't been any progress at all.

111
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,300
Gosh, seriously.

112
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,220
Why?

113
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,940
-Why what?
-Why did you look for me so hard?

114
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,940
Is this also

115
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,950
because of humanism?

116
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,920
She isn't home or out here.
Where on earth did she go?

117
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,590
Something must've come up.

118
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,970
-Hey.
-What?

119
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,350
Over there.

120
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,350
Darn, that little…

121
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,690
Are you crazy?

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,400
Why do you keep luring
my precious daughter to hang out with you?

123
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,030
This isn't the time for this.

124
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,620
-That crazy scumbag might show up--
-He already did.

125
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,080
See? He showed up already--

126
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,620
-What did you say?
-Lee Jingeun showed up,

127
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,960
and Chef Eun found out somehow and came.

128
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,090
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be here right now.

129
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,920
In other words, he saved my life.

130
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,890
Thank you always.

131
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,370
I think I should go now.

132
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,910
Please drink this before you go.

133
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,620
Here you go. It's <i>sikhye.</i>

134
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,890
If that scumbag dares
to show his face again,

135
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,730
I'll strike him with a shovel
or crush him with a claw hammer.

136
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,350
I'm not joking. I won't let him off.

137
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,770
How about I just report him to the police?
It was self-defense.

138
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,190
But we tried to store his body
in the refrigerator.

139
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,950
There is no evidence.

140
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,950
Do you think they'll believe us
if we insist we never did such a thing?

141
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,790
What do you think, Chef?

142
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,260
She went to turn herself in alone,
then you all went to do so as a group.

143
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,470
You avoid and hide
every time you see the police.

144
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,600
You keep carrying around tools
and get arrested by the patrol unit.

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,680
No matter how you look at it,
you look suspicious.

146
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,730
But you still want them to believe you?

147
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,060
Let's do this.

148
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,570
Until we come up with a good plan,
let's all be careful

149
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,280
and protect each other
as much as possible.

150
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Good idea.
Let's stay together day and night.

151
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,910
-Exactly.
-Fantastic.

152
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,490
Wow. Great.

153
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,040
Now that you have a fantastic plan,
I'll excuse myself.

154
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,250
Wait.

155
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,960
The three of us have each other,
but you're all alone.

156
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,590
You've also become his target
because of me.

157
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,470
My goodness.
Why don't you stay over at our place?

158
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,220
-No.
-Then should we stay over at yours?

159
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,430
No thank you.

160
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,310
-Why not?
-You'll be alone.

161
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,860
I said, I'm not staying over.

162
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,400
What?

163
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,490
I no longer want to thank you.

164
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,160
Anyway, thank--

165
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,370
Go on in.

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,180
You're welcome.

167
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,610
Thank you.

168
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>Perhaps that day,</i>

169
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,450
<i>we all</i>

170
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,120
<i>had the same thought.</i>

171
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,630
<i>Exactly</i>

172
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,880
<i>this thought.</i>

173
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,880
Should I…

174
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
just kill him?

175
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,800
<i>Should I just kill him?</i>

176
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,940
POKE

177
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,460
-Don't look. Just look straight ahead.
-Okay.

178
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,590
Let's go, Grandma.

179
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,800
Just run over that chef with a car.

180
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,390
What did you say?

181
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,640
Just hit him with your taxi

182
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,890
and kill him.

183
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,730
Jeez…

184
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,440
I can't do that.

185
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,360
You've done it before.
Don't act all innocent.

186
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,240
Don't you remember?

187
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,090
Sir…

188
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,550
<i>You ran me over with your car.</i>

189
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,140
I'm sorry. It's my…

190
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,140
It's my… Please forgive me.

191
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,810
I really didn't mean to.

192
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,400
I swear. I'm sorry.

193
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,070
Please rest in peace.

194
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,450
Please rest in peace.

195
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,950
Sir,

196
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,620
why are you burying me?

197
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,370
<i>You tried to bury me.</i>

198
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,290
That's because I thought you were dead--

199
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,710
Exactly my point.

200
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,630
Why did you drive drunk?

201
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,760
Is that from my dash cam?

202
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,100
Run him over and just insist
you accidentally hit the gas pedal

203
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,480
because you're a clumsy driver.

204
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,610
You don't want to do that?

205
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,240
Then should I report you to the police?

206
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>Do you want to go to jail for
corpse abandonment and attempted murder?</i>

207
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,480
Bokhee, enough already.
You'll tear a muscle.

208
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,730
-What muscle?
-Hey, she can hear you.

209
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,520
Dahyun, come work out your arms.

210
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,900
Show me.

211
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,690
She'll keel over laughing.

212
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,360
Hello?

213
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,030
What accident?

214
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,290
Who did you hit?
Why are you spewing gibberish?

215
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,830
What about the chef?

216
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,410
You smashed what?

217
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,170
Okay, I'll be right there.

218
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,710
What's going on?
He hit the chef with his car?

219
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm not sure.
He hit the chef or something.

220
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,470
What did she say? Did something happen?

221
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm not sure. An accident.

222
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,720
Solyi's dad hit that chef with his taxi.

223
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,810
She said it got smashed.

224
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,640
What?

225
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,190
Hey. Where are you going? Darn it.

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,850
Don't go by yourself!

227
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,650
Where is the chef?

228
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,570
Inside.

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,170
Are you all right?

230
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,050
Come on. Stand up. Let me look.

231
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,630
Are you hurt? You're fine, right?

232
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,550
What a terrible prank.

233
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,350
Why did they say you're hurt when you're
totally fine? You didn't get hit at all.

234
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,060
I did almost get hit.

235
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,310
Seriously? You must've been startled.

236
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,110
Yes.

237
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,490
You must be in shock.

238
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
Wait a second.

239
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,290
Can you see this?

240
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,730
Don't shove your face in front of me.

241
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,030
That's good. You seem okay.

242
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,990
Wait, shouldn't you be downstairs?

243
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,950
It's totally smashed.

244
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,970
Mom.

245
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,850
Grandma, what happened here?

246
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,060
CHOONOK

247
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,600
I can't believe this.

248
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,780
-I guess this isn't a dream.
-Oh, no. Our restaurant.

249
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,650
Fortunately, it's not
completely destroyed.

250
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,490
Only about a quarter of it, you know?

251
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,170
What if it happened to your house?
Would you really say it was fortunate?

252
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,460
I see how it is.

253
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,880
Come on. Wait, man.

254
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,970
I'm sorry about this.

255
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,980
Are you okay?

256
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,860
Luckily, he came out unscathed.

257
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
That's good to hear.

258
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,950
Thank you, Bokhee.

259
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,530
I suppose he can
get scathed a little then.

260
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,870
-My goodness, Bokhee!
-Bokhee!

261
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,250
It's still morning. You're drunk already?

262
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,040
How dare you destroy our restaurant!

263
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,920
I ran a breath test on him.
It turns out he didn't drink.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,090
-I didn't drink.
-Let go of him. Come on.

265
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,010
-He didn't even drink? Then why?
-Pardon?

266
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,470
Do you hold a grudge against me?

267
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,850
-No.
-Bokhee.

268
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,390
I didn't mean to crash into it.

269
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,020
I was trying to avoid hitting a person.

270
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,680
What did you say? Say it clearly.

271
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,900
He made a drastic turn
right before he was about to hit someone.

272
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,400
I saw it from up there.

273
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,360
Or else, the owner of this restaurant
could've been crushed.

274
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,360
-My goodness.
-Oh, I see.

275
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,660
Sir, that's…

276
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,870
a good thing.

277
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,370
Darn, you little…

278
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,870
But he can't hit a person.
Don't hit me, Mom.

279
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,680
It should be covered by your insurance.
So don't worry too much.

280
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,930
Oh, no. Where will
all our neighbors eat now?

281
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,810
My goodness.

282
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,180
Tell me about it.

283
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,770
"You don't have to give us business."
"You can eat somewhere else."

284
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,730
I kept saying those things, but everyone
insisted on eating at our restaurant.

285
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
What are we going to do? Darn it.

286
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,740
My goodness.

287
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,750
This means we don't have to eat
at Choonok Stew for a while.

288
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,710
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

289
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,220
-My goodness.
-We're in trouble.

290
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,930
See? Look at them.

291
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,850
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

293
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,230
-Thank you for your understanding.
-Sure. See you later.

294
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,810
-No worries.
-We're going. Bye.

295
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,150
Where will they eat now?

296
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,580
You want me to stay by Gyehoon?

297
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,250
Can you stay by his side
for the time being?

298
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,170
-Why?
-There's a stalker.

299
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,010
-Someone's stalking him?
-No, me.

300
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Then why protect him?

301
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,800
The stalker might come after him.

302
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,930
Why would your stalker come after him?

303
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,310
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-About what?

304
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,400
He must think
we have a special relationship.

305
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,940
Like what?

306
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,440
Lovers.

307
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,860
Are you guys dating?

308
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,160
-That's why he's mistaken.
-What did you do to cause that?

309
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,780
Nothing in particular.

310
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,950
Think carefully.

311
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,950
Well…

312
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,960
<i>Noh Dahyun!</i>

313
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,340
What did you do?

314
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,550
Are you interrogating me?

315
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,720
Why are you being so nosy?

316
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,060
Something is going on between the two.

317
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,640
He almost had me.

318
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,900
It's a message from Chef Lee.

319
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,410
<i>I think my little sibling returned.</i>

320
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,080
<i>I need to take a few days off. I'm sorry.</i>

321
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,540
POWER OFF

322
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,990
CHOONOK STEW

323
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,300
Sorry, we're not open today.

324
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,470
What happened here?

325
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,600
-Who…
-Who did this?

326
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,970
And who are you?

327
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,270
Did someone die here?

328
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,520
Why would anyone die?

329
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,310
What? My goodness.

330
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,230
I thought they said someone died.

331
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,780
Who said that?

332
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,530
Maybe someone just got hurt.

333
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,870
What are you talking about?
No one got hurt.

334
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,120
I guess that didn't happen either.

335
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,060
<i>Pull yourself together!
I'll take care of everything,</i>

336
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,180
<i>so just do as I say.</i>

337
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,190
Why don't you just come in and eat?

338
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,030
Our restaurant's ironclad policy

339
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,240
is not to turn down any customers
who come to eat at our restaurant.

340
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,540
It looks like a mess,

341
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,080
but the refrigerator still works.

342
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,920
CHOONOK STEW

343
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,250
So you like the food.

344
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm not picky about food in general.
I eat everything.

345
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay. Eat as much as you'd like.

346
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,210
Even death-row convicts get fed a feast
before they're executed.

347
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Do you know who I am?

348
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
Yes, I do.

349
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,140
And you are?

350
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,310
I'm Dahyun's mom.

351
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,690
I see.

352
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,780
You're not surprised?

353
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,030
I guessed as much.

354
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,490
I see.

355
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,870
Let me get straight to the point.

356
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,580
Don't linger around

357
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,040
Dahyun anymore.

358
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,960
-Why not?
-You really don't know?

359
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,800
No, not really.

360
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,260
What a scumbag.

361
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,680
Don't you remember…

362
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,520
what you did to her that day?

363
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,520
That day?

364
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,240
I was so dumbstruck that day.

365
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:02,120
I collapsed right about here.

366
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,370
When I regained consciousness,
it was so cold and dark all around me.

367
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,040
So I thought I'd died.

368
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,410
But I was inside a refrigerator.

369
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,880
That was so absurd.

370
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,390
By the way,

371
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,310
who put me…

372
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,190
in there?

373
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,150
I did.

374
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,900
So, it was you.

375
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,030
You did such an awful thing
to my daughter.

376
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,120
You deserve to die a hundred times.

377
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,410
That's going a little too far, Mother.

378
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Don't call me that.

379
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,290
You're making me angry.

380
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,960
I was alive and well.

381
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,210
You shouldn't have put me
in the refrigerator, Mother.

382
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,390
That would be my fault.

383
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,020
I checked to see
if you were still breathing.

384
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,900
It really seemed like you were dead.

385
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,190
I see. That's why you put me in there.

386
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,570
Had I known you were still alive,

387
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,860
I would've made sure
you were dead for good.

388
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,660
I'm quite clumsy because of my age.

389
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,250
-That's quite funny.
-So,

390
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,960
you plan to keep lingering around here?

391
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,670
-Yes.
-You won't give up on Dahyun?

392
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,960
Mother, I love Dahyun with all my heart.

393
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,470
You've completely lost your mind.

394
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,140
Stop spewing nonsense!

395
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,850
I hear that quite often.
People tell me that I'm crazy,

396
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,430
and that if things go awry,
I might kill a few people.

397
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,190
So in general, to not irritate me,

398
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,980
people tiptoe around
and act carefully in front of me.

399
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,030
But you're not like that, Mother.

400
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,450
Damn you.

401
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,030
Stop calling me that.
I'm not your mother, punk.

402
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,340
Hello.

403
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,100
What are you doing at this hour?
A late-night snack?

404
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,900
What brings you here so late?

405
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,740
Well, I had some business with him.

406
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,450
What? Are you surprised
to see me unscathed?

407
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,700
-What do you mean?
-I know you orchestrated the accident.

408
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,710
What should I do?
Get you arrested for inciting murder?

409
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,290
Do as you wish.

410
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,590
We can all go together. Attempted murder
and corpse abandonment charges

411
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,050
for Dahyun, Grandmother, and Mother.

412
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,800
I told you not to call me that!

413
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,430
Take your hand out of your pocket.

414
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,310
You should…

415
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,940
get out of here alive while you still can.

416
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,110
And don't ever show your face again.

417
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,070
Next time, I'll really…

418
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,740
get rid of you by whatever means.

419
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,040
Thank you for the food.

420
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,690
What's your name, chef?

421
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,150
You know my name,

422
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,700
but I don't know yours.

423
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,490
What? Are you scared to tell me?

424
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,540
Eun Gyehoon.

425
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,750
Satisfied?

426
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,000
Eun Gyehoon.

427
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,220
If you have no other business, get lost.

428
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,350
Don't act like you're all that,

429
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,890
Eun Gyehoon.

430
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,410
<i>When did I first come into your life?</i>

431
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,990
We didn't meet for the first time at work.

432
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,080
Right here in this neighborhood.

433
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,290
What in the world was he talking about?

434
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,710
Forget it.

435
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,380
Let's not dwell over
something that scumbag said.

436
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,220
Mom!

437
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,350
It's so late. What were you doing
at this hour of the night?

438
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,940
Sorry, we lost track of time.

439
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,440
We said we'll all be careful and guard
and protect each other day and night.

440
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,690
Have you forgotten already?

441
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,030
What's going on?
Did something happen again?

442
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,910
What are you talking about?

443
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,490
Nothing happened.

444
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,830
Don't deny it. Something did happen.

445
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,290
-Look at me.
-No.

446
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,790
Why can't you look me in the eye?

447
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,130
If she were my mother,
she would've been the death of me.

448
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,380
No kidding.

449
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,840
What happened?

450
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,060
Eun Gyehoon.

451
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,890
Eun… Gye…

452
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,540
I see, he's that Eun Gyehoon.

453
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,510
What now?

454
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,550
Dahyun's nightmares

455
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,720
are back.

456
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,160
<i>What are you doing still up?</i>

457
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,500
<i>I just woke up.</i>

458
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,960
<i>You can't sleep well?</i>

459
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,630
<i>No.</i>

460
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
Because of you.

461
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,220
<i>Why not?</i>

462
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,470
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

463
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,720
Because of you.

464
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,100
<i>Am I the only one hungry?</i>

465
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,390
STEW PLACE
AM I THE ONLY ONE HUNGRY?

466
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,610
She wants me to cook for her.

467
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,910
Jeez, that scared me.

468
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,000
Darn it.

469
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,970
Let me.

470
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,310
It's okay. Step aside.

471
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,180
What's all this?

472
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,060
I snuck it out of our restaurant.

473
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,150
Since we can't open,
they'll just go to waste.

474
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,730
You're cooking,
so I should provide ingredients at least.

475
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,190
You were going to ask me to cook?

476
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,740
Weren't you going to cook for me?

477
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,870
We have so much to do
before the soft opening,

478
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,290
yet you just want to relax?
What kind of an employee are you?

479
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,630
Dahyun, straighten your back
and pull your right foot back a little.

480
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,600
That's it. You have to cut like this
not to strain yourself.

481
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,230
All done.

482
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,900
I'll show you how to make a bouquet garni.
Watch carefully and try it yourself.

483
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,190
All done.

484
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,240
-Again.
-Ta-da.

485
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,030
-Again.
-How about this one?

486
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,950
Again. Again.

487
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,490
All done.

488
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,380
You have to stir it as hard as you can
as if you're scooping it up.

489
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,170
Try it.

490
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,350
Again. As hard as you can.

491
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,280
Darn it.

492
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,250
What do you think?
There is no time to get distracted, right?

493
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Thanks to you, my mind has gone blank.

494
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,890
I hope you won't have
any nightmares tonight.

495
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,100
How did you know that
I've been having nightmares?

496
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,230
Well…

497
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,860
I'm on friendly terms with nightmares.

498
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,190
There is a nightmare
that I repeatedly have every night…

499
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,910
Never mind. Let's drop this boring topic.

500
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,870
Why did you decide to become a chef?

501
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,870
Because my mother became too gaunt.

502
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,980
<i>I started cooking to make my mother eat
even if it was just a bite.</i>

503
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,650
DOENJANG STEW

504
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,770
DOENJANG STEW, INGREDIENTS

505
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,530
<i>Then I started to like it.</i>

506
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,950
<i>My mind used to be cluttered
no matter what,</i>

507
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,200
<i>but it got cleared.</i>

508
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,460
<i>Because you can cut your finger</i>

509
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,790
or burn yourself so easily,

510
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,670
my mind stopped wandering.

511
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,180
Okay.

512
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,100
Shall we cook then?

513
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,020
I've been waiting for you to say that.

514
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,130
It's a given.

515
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,880
That's awesome.

516
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,380
-You're overreacting.
-Do it again.

517
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,720
I guess I dozed off.

518
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,510
Wait just a little longer.
It's almost done.

519
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,400
It's so delicious.

520
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,910
Thank you.

521
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,500
What are you doing here?

522
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,540
You don't remember him?

523
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,170
He's the one that kept peeing out front.

524
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,090
I think he's been abandoned.

525
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,800
He started coming here
a few days for food.

526
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,090
We should take care of him.

527
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,390
Why should we? He peed everywhere.

528
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,770
By the way, what's going on
between you and Dahyun?

529
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,980
You looked chummy
with each other this morning.

530
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,900
Are you two a thing?

531
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,440
You're not denying it.

532
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,700
I'm so dumbfounded that I'm speechless.

533
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,570
Ms. Noh Dahyun is
like that dog to me, that's all.

534
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,160
She barges in
whenever she wants and asks for food.

535
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,370
I'm tired and annoyed by her.

536
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,040
Don't come near me. I don't want
any of them, dogs, humans, or cats.

537
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,380
Go away.

538
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,510
Hey, clean up these bowls now.

539
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
Come here.

540
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,150
You're so cold-hearted.

541
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,800
Here you go.

542
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,560
I was so out of it.

543
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,690
I'm sorry.

544
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,320
Someone came by last night.

545
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,200
It seemed like he came to check
if anyone had died

546
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,200
after getting hit by a taxi.

547
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,660
You know Lee Jingeun, don't you?

548
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,760
It's my fault.

549
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,050
It's all my fault.

550
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,010
So please forgive me just this once.

551
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:31,260
If you forgive me just this once,
I'll… I'll do anything.

552
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,850
Sir… Mr. Chef.

553
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,520
Please don't report me. Please?

554
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,150
I was going to pay. Thank you.

555
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,860
Hey.

556
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:51,700
I'll be good from now on.

557
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,120
I'm actually a nice, typical,

558
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,870
ordinary person.

559
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,590
A typical ordinary person
wouldn't bury someone so easily.

560
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
CCTV IN OPERATION

561
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:48,341
Why does he keep
hurting Eun Gyehoon instead of me?

562
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,181
What's that?

563
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,571
What's with this thing?

564
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:11,741
What's wrong?

565
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,541
JIHWA PATROL UNIT

566
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,671
Should I turn myself in

567
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,591
and ask for help?

568
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,011
Or not?

569
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,351
VACANT

570
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:44,271
What?

571
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:47,361
That little…

572
00:50:03,871 --> 00:50:06,371
Hey. Why did you go to the patrol unit?

573
00:50:07,041 --> 00:50:08,921
-Pardon?
-What did you report?

574
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:11,881
Me? Did you report me?

575
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:15,011
What if I did?

576
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:16,971
You said you wouldn't.

577
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:19,891
That chef promised me he wouldn't.

578
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,061
What are you talking about?

579
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:23,981
What?

580
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:27,191
You don't know about it?

581
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:29,361
What are you talking about?

582
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:53,381
Where is Ms. Noh? Is she on the terrace?

583
00:50:54,091 --> 00:50:54,961
No, she isn't.

584
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,011
I told you not to leave her alone.

585
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:02,101
Why are they taking it out on me?

586
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:19,821
Ms. Noh.

587
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:23,331
You can't go around by yourself like this.

588
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,581
Until you come up with a good plan,

589
00:51:25,661 --> 00:51:27,911
I thought you were staying together
to protect each other.

590
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,671
Did you forget
that fantastic idea of yours?

591
00:51:31,961 --> 00:51:33,001
Why aren't you reacting--

592
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,671
You didn't see that scumbag, did you?

593
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,261
You're nagging.

594
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,851
I'm not nagging. That's the rule.

595
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:51,151
If I let you go alone, your scary mother
and grandmother will scold me.

596
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:55,361
Do you not hear me?

597
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:58,691
<i>Lee Jingeun made me do it.</i>

598
00:51:59,201 --> 00:52:01,411
I did it because
Lee Jingeun threatened me to kill him.

599
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:04,201
But still, how could you try to hit him?
That's nonsense.

600
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:06,831
But I…

601
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,001
Where is he?

602
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,291
<i>I have no idea.</i>

603
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:16,211
<i>But he'll turn up.</i>

604
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:17,881
<i>He'll turn up for sure.</i>

605
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:21,261
-And we don't need celebrities…
<i>-Lee Jingeun won't stop</i>

606
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:22,841
<i>until he gets what he wants.</i>

607
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:25,101
<i>He's insane.</i>

608
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,821
I finished my tasks for the day.

609
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,371
The soil condition is good
and I removed the weeds too.

610
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:47,701
What's going on?

611
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:52,581
Something happened, didn't it?

612
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:02,971
Let's end it.

613
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:08,351
I want to end things between us.

614
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,061
There is nothing between us.
What's even there to end?

615
00:53:15,601 --> 00:53:16,441
Humanism.

616
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,441
Let's put an end to that.

617
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,361
Why did you look for me so hard?

618
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,571
Is this also

619
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:27,581
because of humanism?

620
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:29,451
<i>Perhaps.</i>

621
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:34,171
Stop saying, it's humanism perhaps.

622
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:38,131
Don't go around looking for me,
don't help me,

623
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:40,051
don't cook for me,
and don't butt in my life.

624
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,881
Let's go back to the time

625
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:45,051
before we knew each other

626
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,931
and not meddle in
each other's lives, okay?

627
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,561
-Why do we have to do that?
-Because I want to.

628
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,731
-Why do you want to do that?
-Does it matter?

629
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:55,731
Yes, it does.

630
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:01,941
There is nothing between us
to put an end to it.

631
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:04,031
So I'm dumbfounded,
but let's set that aside for now.

632
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:06,991
I don't recall
doing something to offend you.

633
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,371
Why are you so upset and annoyed?

634
00:54:10,451 --> 00:54:14,331
Why are you saying all this to me?
You owe me an explanation at least, right?

635
00:54:14,411 --> 00:54:16,541
Because you keep lying to me.

636
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:19,751
-Sorry?
-I like you.

637
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:22,841
I mean, I liked you.

638
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,091
See? You aren't even surprised.

639
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,971
You knew it all along.

640
00:54:35,061 --> 00:54:36,311
How about this then?

641
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:40,771
The guy that I used to like
almost got killed because of me.

642
00:54:42,231 --> 00:54:44,401
But I had no idea like a fool.

643
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:46,861
Thanks to you, I was so carefree.

644
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,071
-Dahyun, that's because--
-You told me I lied about everything.

645
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:54,411
You pretended not to know
and tried to hide what happened.

646
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,541
That's a lie in a way.

647
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:01,421
And I can't stand such lies anymore.

648
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:05,841
I'll work here
until you find my replacement.

649
00:55:06,131 --> 00:55:06,971
Bye.

650
00:55:40,331 --> 00:55:42,921
<i>Eunjung, it's me again.</i>

651
00:55:43,001 --> 00:55:46,511
CHEF LEE EUNJUNG

652
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:48,761
RÉSUMÉ
LEE JINGEUN

653
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:50,891
Why do you want to see
Mr. Lee Jingeun's résumé?

654
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:52,931
Nothing unusual. Here you go.

655
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:54,851
In case it has any clues.

656
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:58,021
This isn't the time for you
to go around looking for a man.

657
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:00,021
Tell me about it.

658
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:02,811
I'll get going.

659
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:05,071
Already? You haven't even had any tea.

660
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:07,481
I'm not in any mood
to put up with your snobbery today.

661
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:09,861
FANTASTIC EVENT

662
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,041
<i>Who did this to you?</i>

663
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:22,001
Answer me.

664
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,751
What's wrong? Are you okay?

665
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:25,711
You're afraid of him. You're scaring her!

666
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,711
Noh Dahyun!

667
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:31,431
Ms. Noh.
You can't go around by yourself like this.

668
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,011
<i>I looked everywhere for you.</i>

669
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:36,181
What if something happened to you?

670
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:38,851
<i>But it's amazing.</i>

671
00:56:38,931 --> 00:56:41,771
<i>You always manage to find me
when I'm feeling this way.</i>

672
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:43,231
<i>Would you like some food?</i>

673
00:56:44,361 --> 00:56:47,231
<i>Why are you so concerned about me?</i>

674
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:49,531
I've never been concerned about you.

675
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:51,201
I do admit
that I sympathized with you at times.

676
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:52,741
<i>But that's it.</i>

677
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:56,531
<i>You know what?
I thought we bonded a bit last night.</i>

678
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,541
<i>Was I mistaken?</i>

679
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:02,001
Are you all right?

680
00:57:02,581 --> 00:57:05,001
<i>Even if going forward, I treat you well,</i>

681
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:06,791
don't like me. Ever.

682
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,631
I like you.

683
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:14,511
I just had a crush on him for two months.
Get over yourself.

684
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:53,721
Go over there, okay?

685
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,691
-Hello?
<i>-Are you looking for me?</i>

686
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,201
Yeah.

687
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,461
I'm looking for you.

688
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,621
Why?

689
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,091
Come with me.

690
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:31,051
Where?

691
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:33,921
To turn ourselves in.

692
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:38,971
I'll get my punishment,
so you get yours too.

693
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:40,681
Why are you saying that?

694
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:43,271
I said I'll forgive you.

695
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,021
But I can't forgive you.

696
00:58:46,561 --> 00:58:48,101
I still don't understand.

697
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:52,271
You were never even in my sights.

698
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:55,031
How did you become so delusional
that things have come to this?

699
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,491
Bring it on.

700
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:01,741
I'll give it to you real good.

701
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:10,541
<i>I told you already.</i>

702
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,921
Our relationship isn't

703
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:14,131
that short-lived and casual.

704
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:15,961
Even if that's true, so what?

705
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:17,721
<i>Let's say we were a couple</i>

706
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:20,801
in a past life and you were my love
of a thousand years. So what?

707
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,301
I don't like you now.

708
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,891
You need to get lost if I say so.
That's just common sense.

709
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:27,641
Because of Eun Gyehoon?

710
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:31,021
Hey. Don't be a coward and threaten me
by using others around me.

711
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:32,481
Only deal with me.

712
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:37,491
If you dare mess with
anyone else around me,

713
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:40,571
I'll shove you back
into a refrigerator if I have to.

714
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:46,331
I swear on my life that I'll kill you.

NOH DAHYUN

716
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,001
This is all

717
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:21,631
because of that scumbag, Eun Gyehoon.

718
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:38,901
Hello?

719
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:40,861
It's me.

720
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:55,561
Eunjung!

721
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:59,231
I missed you so much.

722
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:02,571
Come on in. We're having
a soft opening in a few days.

723
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:04,781
We can't do it without you.
Don't you agree, Gyehoon?

724
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:08,241
I'm glad you're here.

725
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:40,351
Eunjung…

<i>-I'm going to kill you.

729
01:04:53,301 --> 01:04:54,551
Don't stop me, Mom.

730
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:55,641
Don't stop me either.

<i>Why did Eunjung
try to stab Dahyun's stalker?</i>

732
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,021
<i>She must've had her reasons.</i>

733
01:05:00,101 --> 01:05:02,521
<i>Lee Jingeun may have lived
in Jihwa-dong when he was little.</i>

734
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:04,561
<i>Do you finally remember who I am?</i>

735
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,271
<i>I asked you not to meddle in my affairs</i>

736
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,151
<i>especially if it was about Lee Jingeun.</i>

737
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:12,951
<i>If something happens to you
while I'm away, I'd feel bad.</i>

738
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,701
<i>You act friendly one minute
then ice-cold another.</i>

739
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:18,161
<i>You can't keep making me feel confused.</i>

740
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:19,581
<i>Do you like me?</i>

741
01:05:20,161 --> 01:05:21,001
<i>What if I am?</i>

742
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:22,751
It's too late.

743
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:24,501
<i>It's over between us.</i>
