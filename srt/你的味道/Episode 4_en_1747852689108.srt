1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,060
Subbed by Owl Subs

2
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,060
I like Han Heesol.

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,060
You like me?

4
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Did you get hurt while coming down?

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,060
Can't you come down?

6
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
You're already off work?

7
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,060
At this early hour?

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,060
Why are you talking like a thief?

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,060
Whose?

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,060
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,060
Go away.

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Oh, you're the one who's trying to get your back on the line again.

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,060
Whose?

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
My ex-girlfriend.

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,060
Ex-girlfriend?

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,060
Yeah.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,060
Yeah.

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
Should we keep talking about what we used to do?

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,060
I hate it when you're so obsessed with me.

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
How did you know I was here?

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,060
If you do this, I'll lose everything I had or didn't have.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,060
What the hell are you talking about?

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,060
I ran away from my brother.

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,060
That's not it.

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Who? Brother?

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,060
Can I tell you why I hate you again?

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,060
I hate to see you so obsessed with me.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,060
I hate to see you eat and breathe.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
Get the hell out of here!

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,060
Excuse me.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Do you know what this person is doing?

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,060
I'll figure it out on my own.

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Don't worry about it.

34
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,060
I'm not your ex-girlfriend.

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,060
This guy's a famous person who's always got his back on the line.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Hey, hey, hey!

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Hey, hey, hey!

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060
Hey, hey, hey!

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
This is what I'm talking about.

40
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,060
We'll talk about private things separately.

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,060
Follow me where there's no one.

42
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,060
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Come with me.

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,060
Go inside.

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
You did a good job today.

46
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,060
Go over there and talk.

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,060
Are you done?

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
There's no one.

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
So who's that guy?

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
What is he doing?

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
You don't have to know.

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Why are you doing this?

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,060
Just go.

54
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Come to think of it, he wouldn't have come all the way here to do that.

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Tell me quickly.

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
If you don't tell me, I'll go and ask.

57
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,060
Oh, my God.

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,060
I'm a chef.

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
You're a chef?

60
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Yeah, chef.

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,060
A chef who's much better at cooking than you.

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,060
You're done, right?

63
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Go.

64
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,060
How did you know this place?

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,060
I'll figure that out on my own.

66
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
Don't worry about it.

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
That girl.

68
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,060
I'm worried.

69
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,060
I'm worried.

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,060
It's raining.

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,060
If your shoulders are wet and you're worried,

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Your shoulders are wet and you're worried.

73
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
I'm going to talk about the subject.

74
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
That way I can understand.

75
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Why are you making my heart flutter?

76
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Flutter?

77
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
Am I fluttering?

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
I finally go crazy.

80
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,060
What? What is it?

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
What? What is it?

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
What is it? Is this real?

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
What is it?

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
What? Why are you a human?

85
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
So why are you...

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Why are you in my house?

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
Is this your house?

88
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,060
I don't know what to do with the investment in the restaurant.

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
The big company's reputation is all fake.

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
What?

91
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Have you ever seen the big company's reputation?

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Have you ever seen it?

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm the kind of person in Seoul.

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
I'm preparing for the festival.

95
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
What is this?

96
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,060
You're all wet, right?

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Why are you surprised?

98
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
My skin is more surprised.

99
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
It's almost done.

100
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Look at this.

101
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,060
You like this.

102
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
It's all cut.

103
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Yesterday, I was so surprised.

104
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
I was surprised.

105
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Yesterday, I was so surprised.

106
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,060
Right?

107
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,060
No matter how much I like her,

108
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,060
How can you think of following me here?

109
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
There's no such thing.

110
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Did you have a good time with her?

111
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
Why? Why? Why?

112
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,060
Do you care about her?

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Care?

114
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Huh?

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
I wonder what happened to your head.

116
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Not me.

117
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,060
There's a saying that a handsome man is a man.

118
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,060
So...

119
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
It's a word that was made with me.

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Your eyes are rotten.

121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Your eyes are very rotten.

122
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,060
Are you listening to me?

123
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,060
It's a festival, so it's less different from like to like.

124
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Something easy to eat.

125
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
Steak?

126
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Do you want to come to the festival and cut it?

127
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Soup.

128
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
Yeri's ribs.

129
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Bulgogi.

130
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,060
There's a cube steak.

131
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,060
It's the best lunch box in our company.

132
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
You said you thought of it as a hub.

133
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Oh, meat.

134
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
Or chicken?

135
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Chicken is religious, national, and uncivilized.

136
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
You don't like it?

137
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
How about pork?

138
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
Jambon is fine.

139
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
No.

140
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,060
This is not good. That's not good.

141
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
I don't like this. I don't like that.

142
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Then sell kimbap.

143
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
I don't like it.

144
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
Then sell kimbap.

145
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Yes.

146
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,060
Gimbap.

147
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Gimbap.

148
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Gimbap is good.

149
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Gimbap?

150
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
Do you like gimbap?

151
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,060
Do you like that competitive, common gimbap?

152
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Okay, okay. Gimbap. Okay.

153
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
But what's the basics of the festival?

154
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Photography and memory correction.

155
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Gimbap with sweet shrimp, uni, tuna.

156
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
You need something unique.

157
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,060
People take pictures, buy food, and post it on social media.

158
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Oh, hey.

159
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
35,000 won for 10 sheets?

160
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Put it down.

161
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,060
This is too expensive. No, no, no.

162
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Expensive.

163
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Welcome.

164
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
What would you like?

165
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Give me 100 sheets of gimbap seaweed.

166
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,060
35,000 won for gimbap seaweed.

167
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,060
Huh? No, this is 35,000 won?

168
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
You don't buy it.

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Only your face is fine.

170
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,060
I'm just asking just in case.

172
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,060
You're not going to do something weird like putting carrots in, are you?

173
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
I'll put rice and eggs in.

174
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,060
Who buys gimbap made with basic ingredients at a festival?

175
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,060
Well, a few people can buy it.

176
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,060
But if you sell it for 100, 200?

177
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,060
You need something special to make it delicious.

178
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,060
Tuna, uni, and everything else is delicious.

179
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,060
I mean, you don't like it when it's just a mess.

180
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
So let's make it a mess.

181
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,060
It's not twice as much as buying it once.

182
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
You don't know.

183
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,060
The re-visiting rate of festivals is not that important.

184
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
You have to be faithful to the basics.

185
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Gimbap is like that.

186
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
You know what?

187
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Mic test. One, two, three. One, two, three.

188
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
The chair is this way.

189
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Mic test. One, two, three. One, two, three.

190
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Oh, my God. Is this it?

191
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
The truck we're going to use?

192
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
Well, we're temporary trucks.

193
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
Wow, it's a mess.

194
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Well, it's not like we're going to take it out and ride it.

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Of course.

196
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,060
These days, vintage is in fashion.

197
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Look at this.

198
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
Look at this. Look at the rust.

199
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Look how rusty it is.

200
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
It's not wiping.

201
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
Hey, sister.

202
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Come on out.

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
I'm going to do this.

204
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
Let go of me.

205
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Come on out.

206
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
What's this?

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
What's wrong? Did you get me?

208
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Sister, but why did you move here?

209
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
Come to think of it,

210
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
I've never changed in my life.

211
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,060
I just live as it is when something is decided.

212
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,060
I've been doing that for over 15 years.

213
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,060
But now you're over 40 and you've lived over half your life?

214
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I wanted to change something before I died.

215
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
What?

216
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Why did you drink?

217
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,060
I wanted to be that chef, too.

218
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
Chef?

219
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Hey, what's wrong with you three?

220
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
Why are you doing this?

221
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Why are you doing this?

222
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Chef, why? Chef, you're here.

223
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
I'm coming.

224
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm here.

225
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
Did you get this?

226
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,060
Is this a car that can be cooked?

227
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
This is just vintage.

228
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
You just need to clean up the cooking space.

229
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
That's right.

230
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,060
These days, cafes are all exposed concrete.

231
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,060
You're very trendy in that way.

232
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Jun-seung, I need to clean up the sides of this.

233
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
Okay.

234
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Really.

235
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
Okay.

236
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
The back too.

237
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
There are a lot of people.

238
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,060
The atmosphere is good.

239
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
The air is good.

240
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Perfect.

241
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Okay.

242
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
This...

243
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
Han Sang.

244
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
You're the manager, right?

245
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,060
Yes.

246
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,060
Is that Han Sang's food field?

247
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,060
There's no festival where the sponsor changes on the day.

248
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
I know.

249
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,060
We've done that difficult thing.

250
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
We've done it.

251
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I mean, we've done it well.

252
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
But why did Han Sang...

253
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
What's the reason?

254
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,060
It's a good thing to cooperate with the local small and medium-sized cities.

255
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Besides, the head of the company...

256
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,060
It's a natural contribution to Han Sang.

257
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
Right?

258
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
The head of the company?

259
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Why is he like this when he's out of Seoul?

260
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Me?

261
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Be honest.

262
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm here to help.

263
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,060
You need to be treated for that self-sufficiency certificate.

264
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,060
So how are you going to sponsor Han Sang?

265
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Well, give me the winning prize for the food truck.

266
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Money, money.

267
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
I'm afraid I'm crazy about money.

268
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
How much is it?

269
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Wow.

270
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,060
That comment just now was really bad.

271
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Mo Hyun-joo must have felt like this.

272
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
What are you talking about?

273
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
Did you hear that?

274
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,060
The big company is going crazy because they want to spend money.

275
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
First place.

276
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
A little 10 million won?

277
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
10 million won?

278
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
What?

279
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Well, if you put up the prize, it's just a competition.

280
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
We're going to participate, too.

281
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,060
If you want to win the prize, try hard.

282
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Wait a minute.

283
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,060
You guys are participating in the L'Arsèle?

284
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
10 million won.

285
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Don't worry.

286
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
Let's see.

287
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Open it.

288
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,060
It's worth the price.

289
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Vintage, exposed concrete money asset.

290
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,060
Cool. Cool. Cool.

291
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Our truck is the coolest thing here.

292
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
I know.

293
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Let's cheer up.

294
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Let's do it.

295
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
One, two, three.

296
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
Let's go.

297
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Let's go.

298
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Let's go.

299
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Let's do it.

300
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
One, two, three.

301
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
Let's go.

302
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Let's hurry up.

303
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
What's all that?

304
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
There's one more.

305
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,060
Korean ambassador Jang Yeong-ae?

306
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
He was a cook.

307
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
Do you know him?

308
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
I don't know.

309
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
I know him well.

310
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
I know him.

311
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Sorry.

312
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
You're here.

313
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I thought you were dying to see me.

314
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
I'll tell you later.

315
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
My chef Jang...

316
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Chef Jang Yeong-ae.

317
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Why are you doing this?

318
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
Why are you doing this?

319
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
To check.

320
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
What?

321
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
What Mr. Han said that day.

322
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
What did I say?

323
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Yes, chef.

324
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
A chef who is much better at cooking than you.

325
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Are you ready?

326
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,060
How dare you touch my pride?

327
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
You said you were better at cooking than me.

328
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
I...

329
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
What are you talking about?

330
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
What are you talking about?

331
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
So...

332
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Just to check that out...

333
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,060
These people...

334
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
These equipment...

335
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
They all came from Seoul.

336
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
What's this?

337
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Is this a defense machine?

338
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Do you think this suits you?

339
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Too much.

340
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Too much.

341
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Why are you so good at it?

342
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
What?

343
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Good?

344
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,060
Where should I put this?

345
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Oh!

346
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Hey!

347
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
What are you?

348
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
How have you been, Mr. Lee?

349
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
How have you been? What are you?

350
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
What can a salaryman do?

351
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
You should listen to the person who pays you.

352
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I'm paying you.

353
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
No...

354
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,060
To be honest, Mr. Han pays me.

355
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,060
Mr. Han...

356
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,060
What's wrong with you?

357
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
This is a nuisance to my work.

358
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
You're bothering my life right now.

359
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
You're bothering me.

360
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
You're not loyal.

361
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Go back.

362
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
You like loyalty.

363
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Forget it.

364
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
Are you scared?

365
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
If you're scared, you can die now.

366
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Scared?

367
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Do I look scared?

368
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,060
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,060
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,060
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
I'm sorry.

377
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,060
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,060
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,060
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
I'm sorry.

396
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
I'm sorry.

397
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Is the fire up?

398
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Yes, sir.

399
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,060
Try this.

400
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
What? What?

401
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
Is it good?

402
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,060
Yes.

403
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Is it good?

404
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Yes.

405
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
It's good.

406
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
We won.

407
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
It's a real problem.

408
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,060
From now on, the youth food festival will begin.

409
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Here we are.

410
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Here's a delicious carrot gimbap.

411
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
Just stay with me.

412
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,060
Now people are starting to gather.

413
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Except for our truck.

414
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Where did Beom-woo go?

415
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
He went to help his ex-girlfriend.

416
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Ex-girlfriend?

417
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
What?

418
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,060
So that truck is Beom-woo's ex-girlfriend?

419
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
What?

420
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
This is a gimbap tree.

421
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
Welcome.

422
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Welcome.

423
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
I'll give you gimbap.

424
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
You want to eat gimbap?

425
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
There are so many delicious places.

426
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
Gimbap is a steady.

427
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Just buy a couple of pieces and eat them.

428
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
There's no one who hates it.

429
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
I hate it.

430
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Really?

431
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Do you want to go eat meat with me?

432
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Yes.

433
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Let's go.

434
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,060
If you hate it,

436
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
I won't eat it forever.

437
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,060
There's no one in our restaurant.

438
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,060
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
Take it.

440
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Take it.

441
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Take it.

442
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Take it.

443
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Take it.

444
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
What's all this?

445
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Gimbap?

446
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Gimbap?

447
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Beef?

448
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,060
What did you buy with this money?

449
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
A can.

450
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
I'll recoup the prize money.

451
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Minus money?

452
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
You bastard!

453
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,060
They'll select the winner by the tasting evaluation.

454
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,060
I thought I had to be faithful to the basics.

455
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,060
The prize money doubled as the donation changed to one prize.

456
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Double?

457
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Here.

458
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Shouldn't we be careful when we choose the menu to win?

459
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Jambong Gap Taegimbap?

460
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
You think you can win that?

461
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
You think you can win that?

462
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
10 million won.

463
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,060
If you win, the prize money is 10 million won.

464
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
10 million won?

465
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,060
I think I can get a little bigger than that.

466
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
It's not a little, it's just really big.

467
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Honey.

468
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Honey.

469
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,060
You see that big truck over there?

470
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Can you see people lined up over there?

471
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
I can see it.

472
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,060
It's the ex-girlfriend of the general manager.

473
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,060
You're spreading rumors about that?

474
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
It's not an ex-girlfriend.

475
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
It's not an ex-girlfriend.

476
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
What are you talking about?

477
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
I don't need anything else.

478
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,060
There are five snacks in the duck bean paste lunch box.

479
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Duck bean paste? Where are you going?

480
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Do you think bean paste goes well with this place?

481
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Right?

482
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Will it go well with this place?

483
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
But why would they sell it?

484
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,060
People line up because they're curious about it.

485
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
I think this is right.

486
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,060
I think we should change the menu.

487
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Should I set up the beef first?

488
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Set it up.

489
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Set it up.

490
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
One by one.

491
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,060
Two.

492
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,060
Let's do it.

493
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
This time, kimbap.

494
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,060
I'm here to eat kimbap.

495
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
You must be influencers.

496
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
Give me a beef kimbap.

497
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Yes, yes.

498
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
Hello, boss.

499
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Say hello to the honeycombs.

500
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
Hello, honeycombs.

501
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Wait a minute.

502
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
Do you see the empty seat?

503
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Please wait a little longer.

504
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
I'm looking forward to it.

505
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,060
Did you see?

506
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,060
This is what people want.

507
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
People want this.

508
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,060
If it's 10 million won, we can pay off the interior repair costs, the lights, everything.

509
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
We can pay off everything.

510
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
10 million won.

511
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Where are you going?

512
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm going to Taean.

513
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Ham is Jirisan, beef is Maon Farm.

514
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
It's Han Beom-woo.

515
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,060
I don't want to mix the ingredients, so I'm just letting him go once.

516
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Wait a minute.

517
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Yes.

518
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Come on.

519
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Why are you so clueless?

520
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
I'm going to have to do something.

521
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,060
I don't believe this.

522
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
So you have to cut this diagonally.

523
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
In a diagonal way?

524
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
You're only using two.

525
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,060
I'm not putting beef in it, I'm wrapping it on the outside.

526
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,060
You're pouring it.

527
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
This is Mara.

528
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,060
This is peri sauce.

529
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Here we go.

530
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Oh, can I try it?

531
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Yeah.

532
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Here we go.

533
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Is it okay?

534
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
How is it?

535
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
This.

536
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
This is working.

537
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
This is working.

538
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Let's go.

539
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Now, open the store.

540
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Open.

541
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,060
Open.

542
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
It's open.

543
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
It's open.

544
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Beef, come on.

545
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Is this all done?

546
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
It's done.

547
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
It's done.

548
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
It's beef gimbap.

549
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
Come on.

550
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Now, our taste buds.

551
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Can you see this?

552
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
Can you see this?

553
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,060
The beef is soft and crispy.

554
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
It's so attractive.

555
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Now, three to three.

556
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Two to three.

557
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
Two to three.

558
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
How is it?

559
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Is it good?

560
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,060
The main menu of our Diamant Toastar Younghae Food Truck is

561
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
Duck coffee set.

562
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:18,060
It's really soft because it's cooked with extra virgin olive oil and duck oil at a good temperature for six hours.

563
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Turn on the light, sir.

564
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
Yes, we're getting orders.

565
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
You have to go forward.

566
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,060
You can go over there.

567
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Over there.

568
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
Turn on the light.

569
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Turn on the light.

570
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Turn on the light.

571
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Turn on the light.

572
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Turn on the light.

573
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Turn on the light.

574
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,060
Turn on the light.

575
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
Please wait a little bit.

576
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
It'll be out soon.

577
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,060
It's more crispy.

578
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Yes, sir.

579
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
How is it? Is it good?

580
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
It's good.

581
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,060
It's really good.

582
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
It's really good.

583
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,060
It's really good.

584
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,060
As expected, this Diamant Toastar can't be anyone.

585
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,060
Hurry up.

586
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Before all this coffee falls.

587
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Hurry up and come.

588
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
It's so good.

589
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Enjoy your meal.

590
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Let's eat.

591
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Let's eat.

592
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Please say hello to the female priests.

593
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Who ordered a lot of beef?

594
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
Two beef, one Diamant Toastar.

595
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Yes, sir.

596
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Two beef, one Diamant Toastar.

597
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
No.

598
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
No.

599
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
What?

600
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,160
I only have two lines of the

601
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,060
Why? Why? Why? Why can't you do it all of a sudden?

602
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
Why did you go?

603
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
I don't have the ingredients.

604
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm sorry.

605
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Ingredients?

606
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Really?

607
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I'm sorry.

608
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
I'll be back tomorrow.

609
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Thank you.

610
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
No. No.

611
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
I don't have the ingredients.

612
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I don't have the ingredients.

613
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
All I'm doing now is.

614
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
Sell it all?

615
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Sell it all.

616
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
We?

617
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
I sold it all.

618
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
We?

619
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
You did a great job.

620
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
You did a great job.

621
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
I sold it all.

622
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Yes!

623
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
Yes!

624
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Yes!

625
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
Hey!

626
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Hey!

627
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
Hey!

628
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
I sold it all.

629
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,060
I sold it all.

630
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Chef, the order was too long.

631
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
When is our food coming out?

632
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm sorry.

633
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
I'm sorry.

634
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
Please wait a minute.

635
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
I'm sorry.

636
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
See you in a minute.

637
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Hey, let's go.

638
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Let's go eat something else.

639
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
How much time do we have left?

640
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
About 10 minutes.

641
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
10 minutes?

642
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
I'm sorry.

643
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
I'm sorry.

644
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
I'm sorry.

645
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm sorry.

648
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm sorry.

649
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,060
I'm sorry.

650
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
I'm sorry.

651
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
Let's speed up.

652
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Yes, sir.

653
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
What are they doing?

654
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
I don't know.

655
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Is it already ruined?

656
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,060
They did it?

657
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Well, gimbap has a good rotation rate.

658
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
It doesn't go too far.

659
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,060
It's a bit too much to have duck and bean paste at a festival.

660
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
But it's still luxurious.

661
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
That guy is crazy.

662
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
Watch your head.

663
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
One, two, three.

664
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Oh, my.

665
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
It's a bit too much.

666
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,060
I think this food truck is harder than the kitchen.

667
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,060
The kitchen is nice and it's a new environment, so I need time to get used to it.

668
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,060
But we're the only ones who can do it.

669
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,060
So who's to blame for all this?

670
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
It's all my fault.

671
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,060
I'm just going to clean up the ingredients in this small place.

672
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,060
I hope someone who's faster than me comes out of this room.

673
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
What are you talking about?

674
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
No, I saw it.

675
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
I ran around here and ran around.

676
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Who came up with the idea of gimbap?

677
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
I did.

678
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,060
Even so, I'm going to take the ingredients.

679
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:05,060
Even so, if gimbap wasn't good, would you sell it?

680
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,060
It's a little sweeter than I thought.

681
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
What I'm saying is...

682
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
No, it's not that.

683
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,060
If we make 10 million won by tomorrow, please raise my salary first.

684
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Is the salary big?

685
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,060
We're just going to have a meeting.

686
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Fix the kitchen first.

687
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Fix the interior and get the floor first.

689
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Right? I'm good, right?

690
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Yeah.

691
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Raise your hands.

692
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
One, two, three, and then stop.

693
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
One, two, three.

694
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
Stop!

695
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,060
Let's go.

696
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,060
Go home!

697
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Yes, yes!

698
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,060
Jun-seung, clean up this place.

699
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
Put it in the back and put one together.

700
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,060
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

701
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Yes, yes!

702
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
You did a great job.

703
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,060
The competition ends tomorrow, so tomorrow...

704
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,060
You're more shameless than I thought, Chef Jang.

705
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
Shameless?

706
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
I didn't ask you to participate.

707
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,060
You said you'd do it.

708
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,060
But it's hard to make this result.

709
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
So I'm going to win tomorrow.

710
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
The guest will help you tomorrow.

711
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,060
Guest?

712
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
It's still too much for a Korean ambassador.

713
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
My chef.

714
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
It's so annoying.

715
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
What should I do tomorrow?

716
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,060
What should I do?

717
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,060
What?

718
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,060
Lighter?

719
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
Kitchen equipment?

720
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
You've been quite active since morning.

721
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Active?

722
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
No, no.

723
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
Why in the morning?

724
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Why?

725
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
Do you want to go to work together?

726
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
What's this?

727
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Did I say I smoke when I smoke near the restaurant?

728
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Me?

729
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
I've never smoked near the restaurant.

730
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Then why did this come out of the kitchen?

731
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
It's yours.

732
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,060
It's not mine.

733
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
This came out of the restaurant?

734
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Really?

735
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
No.

736
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I don't know.

737
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
Isn't this Jun-seung's?

738
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
So what if you smoke?

739
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
Excuse me.

740
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
It's not mine.

741
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Come out quickly.

742
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
What does it say?

743
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
02?

744
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,060
We have invited a guest singer from Han Sang, the sponsor of the Food Truck Festival in the whole town.

745
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
Here he is.

746
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,060
The special trot singer, Park Gun.

747
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Nice to meet you.

748
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,060
The special trot singer, Park Gun, a man like a police officer.

749
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Nice to meet you.

750
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
Applause.

751
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Nice to meet you.

752
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
It's Park Gun.

753
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:10,060
The special trot singer, Park Gun, a man like a police officer.

754
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
The special trot singer, Park Gun?

755
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
What is this?

756
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Oh, you really saw it?

757
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
The trot singer?

758
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
I want to get an autograph, too.

759
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Sign, photo card.

760
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
I won't hit you.

761
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
Excuse me.

762
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,060
But he's a good singer.

763
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
His voice tone is different.

764
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
He's a different celebrity.

765
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,060
What kind of autograph is this?

766
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
Jam-bong boat?

767
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,060
The special trot singer, Park Gun.

768
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
A guest singer?

769
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
Hey, hey.

770
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
What?

771
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
What is it?

772
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Park Gun.

773
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
You're calling Park Gun?

774
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Are you kidding me?

775
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Did I call Park Gun?

776
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Did I call Park Gun?

777
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Han Sunwoo, really.

778
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,060
The menu.

779
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Are you kidding me?

780
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
You copy the menu?

781
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
Don't you have any respect?

782
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
I'm copying you.

783
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Don't you know that Jambong boat is a trend these days?

784
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,060
It's different from your simple kimbap.

785
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
Simple?

786
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,060
And this is the menu that I sold at the motorbike last spring.

787
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
I bought that recipe.

788
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
I made it and sold it.

789
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,060
I was selling the menu first, but you're selling the same menu on the other side.

790
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,060
Is this Sangdo?

791
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
It's not Sangdo.

792
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Sangdo is not Sangdo.

793
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,060
The person who thinks of Sangdo buys the menu?

794
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,060
Hey, Jang Young-ae.

795
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
Why?

796
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
Food is food.

797
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,060
You have to be able to give it to the fun of seeing.

798
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Food is food.

799
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,060
It's good to be ruined while giving it to the fun of seeing.

800
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Why did you come all the way here?

801
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
You keep making fun of me.

802
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,060
I was going to go.

803
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
I heard.

804
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,060
You're a chef, too?

805
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
I didn't know because I'm so pale.

806
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,060
What about a pale cook?

807
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Did you learn cooking somewhere?

808
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,060
There are so many things called a dog or a cow or a chef these days.

809
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Hey, Jang Young-ae.

810
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
Let's talk about who the dog or the cow is in terms of food.

811
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Food came out.

812
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Live your life properly.

813
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Me?

814
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
Suddenly?

815
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Chef Jang.

816
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,060
You live your life properly, too.

817
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,060
You live your life properly, too.

818
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Thank you.

819
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:13,060
We'll go to the restaurant to sign with the food truck of Chef Jang Young-ae.

820
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
Let's go together.

821
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,060
I think it's going to be a little difficult today.

822
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
It's a little difficult.

823
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
I was just sucked in.

824
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
No, it's a little hard.

825
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,060
You can change the menu a little bit.

826
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
What's the point of changing the menu?

827
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
We're the original.

828
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
And our Mo Chef Gimbap is much better.

829
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
Isn't it?

830
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
I said we.

831
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,060
When did you become us?

832
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
It's time to work.

833
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Hurry up and work.

834
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

835
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Then I think it would be nice to sell it with a little bit of something.

836
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Wait a minute.

837
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
No alcohol.

838
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Moju.

839
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,060
I made this myself when I was at the restaurant.

840
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
It's a Chinese medicine.

841
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,060
If you just hit it with Chinese medicine, it's just boiled.

842
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
Chun Seung-hee's table.

843
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Moju.

844
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
That guy again.

845
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
Alcohol.

846
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Just put it in.

847
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
What the hell is wrong with you?

848
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
This isn't alcohol.

849
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
This isn't alcohol.

850
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,060
What are you doing?

851
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
It's just a drink.

852
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
You're talking like a drink.

853
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
You're so annoying.

854
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Here, here, just one drink.

855
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Just one drink.

856
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
I'm really confident.

857
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
Don't ask for more after you eat.

858
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Here.

859
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
I'm not eating.

860
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
Oh, really.

861
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
How is it?

862
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,060
It's a military service.

863
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
You're good at calling.

864
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
What?

865
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,060
What are you talking about?

866
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
So why is this delicious?

867
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
It's attractive.

868
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Is it attractive?

869
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
It's not bad, is it?

870
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Wait a minute.

871
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Move, move.

872
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
You want me to give this as a service?

873
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I'm going to give you a free gift.

874
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
But with this,

875
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
can you beat Park Gun?

876
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
You're so annoying.

877
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
You're going to get hurt.

878
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Look.

879
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
Wait a minute.

880
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Yeah, this is good.

881
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
This service is good.

882
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
Everything is good.

883
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,060
But I think one title is missing.

884
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Do you sell just gimbap?

885
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
I bought beef gimbap here yesterday and it was delicious.

886
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Anyway, I'm a little bit tired.

887
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
They sell all kinds of gimbap.

888
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Then I'll give you the money.

889
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Can you give me some free gimbap?

890
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Yes, I can.

891
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,060
Why not?

892
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Wait a minute.

893
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
Then I'll turn on the broadcast and come back.

894
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
Broadcast?

895
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I'll turn on the broadcast.

896
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Go.

897
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
This is what I made myself.

898
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,060
Listen carefully.

899
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Just gimbap.

900
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
Just gimbap.

901
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Just gimbap.

902
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
I think gimbap is good.

903
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
Do you not like carrots gimbap?

904
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,060
You try it.

905
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Just try it.

906
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,060
What is this?

907
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
What is this?

908
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
What did you put in the carrot?

909
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Everyone is not confident, so I put this in the gimbap and that in the gimbap.

910
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Oh, it's delicious.

911
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Simple is the best.

912
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
This is the carrot I made myself.

913
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,060
What is it?

914
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
It's really delicious.

915
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
It's non-alcoholic.

916
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
Do you want some?

917
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Please eat and make a lot of noise.

918
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Number 221.

919
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
Number 221.

920
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
Junseung.

921
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
Junseung.

922
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Enjoy your meal.

923
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
It tastes exactly like the old gimbap.

924
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,060
It tastes like the one we ate in the elementary school sports competition with seasoned chicken.

925
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,060
If you don't run a gimbap restaurant,

926
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I don't think it's a normal gimbap, including potatoes and this.

927
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,060
It's not a gimbap restaurant.

928
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Just make a lot of things.

929
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
Nearby?

930
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
Yes.

931
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Here, here.

932
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
This is a business card.

933
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,060
Please make a lot of noise.

934
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
There's a place to put stickers on the other side.

935
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
Please put stickers on it.

936
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Look at this poster.

937
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,060
I made it.

938
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Oh, it's a good thing.

939
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
Thank you.

940
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,060
Make a lot of noise.

941
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
Okay.

942
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Congratulations, you two.

943
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Congratulations.

944
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
In that sense, two gimbap.

945
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
What are you celebrating?

946
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
You two have a baby.

947
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Oh, my.

948
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,060
I participated to pay the distribution fee.

949
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Oh, my.

950
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Baby?

951
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,060
Us?

952
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Yes, baby.

953
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Who said that?

954
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
I heard that.

955
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Let's help the newlyweds who are working hard.

956
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Newlyweds, newlyweds, let's make love.

957
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
But what about the distribution fee?

958
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Oh, I can't do that.

959
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Baby's name is gimbap.

960
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Are they really worth it?

961
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,060
No.

962
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,060
No?

963
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,060
That's right.

964
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
That's right.

965
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
That's right.

966
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
100 gimbap.

967
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,060
Just two lines?

968
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
Yes, please wait here.

969
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
One gimbap and two cups of moju.

970
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,060
What gimbap?

971
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,060
Congratulations.

972
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,060
Give me three lines of gimbap.

973
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,060
Three lines.

974
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,060
You said your baby's name is gimbap.

975
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,060
Congratulations.

976
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,060
Here you go.

977
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,060
Gimbap and mom.

978
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,060
Three lines of gimbap.

979
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
Gimbap and mom.

980
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,060
Two lines of gimbap.

981
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,060
One, two, three, four.

982
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
One, two, three, four.

983
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
One, two, three, four.

984
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
One, two, three, four.

985
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
One, two, three, four.

986
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
One, two, three, four.

987
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
One, two, three, four.

988
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
One, two, three, four.

989
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
One, two, three, four.

990
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
One, two, three, four.

991
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
One, two, three, four.

992
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
One, two, three, four.

993
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,060
One, two, three, four.

994
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,060
One, two, three, four.

995
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
Thank you.

996
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Thank you.

997
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,060
It's still frozen.

998
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,060
I borrowed too much.

999
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
Be quiet and take this out.

1000
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,060
Yes, chef.

1001
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,060
I'll be right out.

1002
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
One, two, three, four.

1003
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
One, two, three, four.

1004
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
One, two, three, four.

1005
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,060
I'm looking forward to it.

1006
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,060
Gimbap, gimbap, gimbap.

1007
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,060
We'll close the vote today.

1008
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,060
On.

1009
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,060
On.

1010
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Food.

1011
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Food.

1012
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
Food.

1013
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Food.

1014
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:20,060
Hello, today's MC, comedian, a man who will feel the taste of a second-year student, Choi Filio.

1015
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:40,060
The 43rd On Goal Food Truck Competition, hosted by the On Goal Food Truck Festival Committee, is only the final winner team for your tasting evaluation vote in two days.

1016
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:53,060
The winner team will receive a prize and prize money, and as you know, the first place is 10 million won.

1017
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,060
The second place is 4 million won.

1018
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:07,060
The award goes to Han Sun-woo, the director of the Han Sang Strategy Planning Department.

1019
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:19,060
The winner team is.

1020
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,060
It's in my hand.

1021
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Wow, that was a very small difference.

1022
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,060
The first place winner is.

1023
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Who is it?

1024
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,060
Oh, my.

1025
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,060
Don't be so sure.

1026
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,060
The first place winner is.

1027
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:56,060
The first day, a total of 530 votes, the second day, 890 votes, and a total of 1420 votes.

1028
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:03,060
The food truck of Chef Jang Young-ae, who presented Jambon Bae-roba and duck bean paste.

1029
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,060
Congratulations, everyone.

1030
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,060
Wait a minute.

1031
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,060
It's not us.

1032
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,060
Wait a minute, we're not the first place?

1033
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,060
We won.

1034
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,060
We won.

1035
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,060
How did you beat us with a japtang without a basis?

1036
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,060
He said it was Larcel.

1037
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,060
Everyone, please give him a big hand.

1038
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,060
The prize money has been received.

1039
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,060
Let's take a photo time.

1040
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,060
One, two, three.

1041
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Congratulations.

1042
00:47:52,060 --> 00:48:00,060
It's a special 5-star special food truck for the second team's special rice and alcohol.

1043
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,060
Congratulations.

1044
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,060
Congratulations.

1045
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,060
I can see that our Mo Chef Gimbap is very delicious.

1046
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,060
It's not comparable to other customers.

1047
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,060
This doesn't make sense.

1048
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,060
Should I go and really put it all together?

1049
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,060
Leave it.

1050
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,060
What did you do? The results are like that.

1051
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,060
But thanks to the three of us, we saved up all the money to fix the kitchen.

1052
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,060
Everyone worked hard.

1053
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,060
Thank you so much.

1054
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,060
Thank you.

1055
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,060
Next time, when I meet you again, let's get together again.

1056
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,060
Why are you crying again? Why are you crying?

1057
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,060
I'm crying and falling asleep.

1058
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Again, again.

1059
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,060
This is definitely a conspiracy.

1060
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,060
What is the conspiracy?

1061
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,060
I went to the front door and counted it all.

1062
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,060
There were more stickers than those.

1063
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,060
What kind of victim are you?

1064
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,060
You should drink too.

1065
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,060
I'm going to die today.

1066
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,060
What are you doing?

1067
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,060
I did see the guy who could manipulate.

1068
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Hey, Han Seon-ho.

1069
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,060
Han Seon-ho.

1070
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,060
You're playing a joke because of the 10 million won?

1071
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,060
If you're doing this because you can't win the results...

1072
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,060
Oh, people can be so desperate.

1073
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
I only evaluated it as a vote score.

1074
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,060
We just won.

1075
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,060
It's cheating to change.

1076
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:33,060
Isn't it the basics of marketing to do more than just doing something?

1077
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,060
How can a guy I know do it?

1078
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,060
I'm the guy I know.

1079
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,060
This smells like a bad smell.

1080
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,060
If you don't want to believe it, say it.

1081
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,060
I thought there was something, but there's nothing to see this time.

1082
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,060
You're the one who set the fire, right?

1083
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,060
Fire?

1084
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,060
What fire?

1085
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,060
You've improved a lot.

1086
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,060
You're the one who set the fire in our restaurant.

1087
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,060
Our restaurant?

1088
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,060
You're saying we're all in your mouth.

1089
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

1090
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,060
I'll say it again.

1091
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,060
The competition is just you losing.

1092
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,060
And you lost.

1093
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,060
Han Beom-wook.

1094
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,060
You did a great job today. Get off work.

1095
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
Yes, sir.

1096
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,060
How is it?

1097
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,060
You want to come back to me, right?

1098
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,060
What day is it today?

1099
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,060
If you're done, take 10 million won and go.

1100
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,060
You can fly with that cape.

1101
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,060
Here we go.

1102
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060
I'm better than that little guy.

1103
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,060
Are you listening to me?

1104
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,060
Are you listening?

1105
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,060
Yes, yes, yes, I'm listening.

1106
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,060
What's better? What's better?

1107
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,060
Do I have to say that with my own mouth?

1108
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,060
That little guy.

1109
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
Don't say little guy.

1110
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,060
When you say it in a good way.

1111
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,060
I guess I'm finally crazy about that little guy.

1112
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
Are you doing something you like?

1113
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,060
Me? Me?

1114
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,060
Or who?

1115
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,060
I think you like him.

1116
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
Am I crazy?

1117
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,060
Do what you're doing.

1118
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,060
Hurry up and go to Seoul.

1119
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Where did Mo and Gong go?

1120
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,060
They're going to start playing firework.

1121
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
Where are they fighting again?

1122
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,060
I don't believe it.

1123
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,060
Where are you going?

1124
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,060
They were once a couple in their previous lives.

1125
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,060
But if they were once a couple in their previous lives,

1126
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
shouldn't they be married now?

1127
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,060
What does this taste like?

1128
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,060
Teriyaki.

1129
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,060
Teriyaki?

1130
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,060
Teriyaki.

1131
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,060
Teriyaki.

1132
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,060
What does this taste like?

1133
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,060
Teriyaki.

1134
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,060
Yes!

1135
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,060
Gimbap is all over there.

1136
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,060
It's delicious.

1137
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
It's delicious.

1138
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,060
Yes!

1139
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,060
It's pretty far.

1140
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
Wait for me.

1141
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,060
Hey!

1142
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
What are you doing here?

1143
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,060
I was waiting for you.

1144
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,060
Me?

1145
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,060
Why?

1146
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,060
Let's do it again.

1147
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,060
You guys.

1148
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,060
Run.

1149
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,060
What? What? What?

1150
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,060
Where are you going?

1151
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1152
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1153
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1154
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1155
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1156
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1157
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1158
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1159
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1160
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1161
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1162
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1163
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1164
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1165
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1166
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1167
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1168
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1169
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1170
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1171
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1172
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1173
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1174
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

1175
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,060
When are you going to catch her first?

1176
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,060
She's not catching you yet.

1177
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,060
At that moment?

1178
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,060
Now?

1179
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,060
You're so...

1180
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,060
No, I'm not.

1181
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,060
Are you mad?

1182
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,060
You don't look good in that.

1183
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,060
Don't be mad.

1184
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,060
Why am I so happy today?

1185
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,060
I didn't get the first place.

1186
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,060
I went to see her.

1187
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,060
What? What did you go to see?

1188
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,060
I'm the king of this area from now on.

1189
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,060
You're ridiculous.

1190
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,060
You're annoying.

1191
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,060
Are you jealous?

1192
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,060
Pick one.

1193
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,060
I'll give you one.

1194
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,060
No, thanks.

1195
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,060
Why are you so annoyed?

1196
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,060
I don't look annoyed.

1197
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,060
Just admit it.

1198
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,060
I lost.

1199
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,060
Is it because of that?

1200
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,060
Then what?

1201
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,060
Forget it.

1202
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,060
Just say it.

1203
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,060
I said, say it.

1204
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,060
I think you like me.

1205
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,060
I can see that.

1206
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,060
What do you like?

1207
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,060
You.

1208
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,060
I said I like you.

1209
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,060
Then...

1210
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,060
You can have all of this.

1211
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,060
I'm sorry.

1212
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,060
You.

1213
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,060
Do I die?

1214
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,060
I love you, Oh Ja-kyu.

1215
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,060
Listen carefully.

1216
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,060
That was a mistake yesterday.

1217
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,060
I want to be with you.

1218
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,060
I want to be with you.

1219
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,060
Even if you want to be with me,

1220
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,060
You can't.

1221
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,060
What kind of life did you live?

1222
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
Let's go on a date.

1223
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,060
I'll be there by nine.

1224
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,060
See you there.

1225
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,060
Did you have a good time?
