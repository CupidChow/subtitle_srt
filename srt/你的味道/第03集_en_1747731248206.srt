1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
the most beautiful

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,080
You're incapable of being race colored.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,080
Daebak The Worldako

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,500
Are you human?

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,840
You're running behind me like this.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Yes.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,940
Jang Youngae.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,600
Youngae!

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
This is no.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
It was just true.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
Yes.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,400
But it is not.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,940
You're crazy.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,540
You're dating.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,340
How could you abandon me?

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
Okay, I admit it.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,540
I can do that.

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,640
But how could you do that to my brother?

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,340
This is not right.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,740
Park Chang-hee?

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,940
Darn it.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,440
I'm going to destroy you.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
Huh?

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm going to take all the recipes out of here

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,140
and destroy them both.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,740
What are you saying?

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,340
I'm going to destroy them all.

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,140
Hey!

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,840
Where are you?

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,640
What's with you?

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,240
It's me.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
What?

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,440
The owner said he wouldn't give you the rice soup.

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,940
Because you took my employee away.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm the owner!

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
And my father is the chairman.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,040
You guys are so mean.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm the owner!

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,240
Are you going to break your arm again?

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,940
Huh?

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,440
Are you going to pull your hair again?

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,940
Let go of me!

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Let go!

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,640
What did you say?

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,840
What? What?

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Be honest.

47
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,040
Why are you here?

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
You...

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,340
You're here to heal.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,440
Aren't you?

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,540
Oh...

52
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,840
Huh?

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
Oh!

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,240
The reason you're here!

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Yes, I'm here to heal.

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
Right, right.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,540
You're here to find a place to rest after you took my woman away?

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,240
What did I take away?

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh!

60
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,340
Oh, God!

61
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,740
Hey, what are you doing?

62
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,340
Didn't I tell you?

63
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,740
This is my new boss.

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,740
You took my woman away from me.

65
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,840
What?

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,640
What did I take away from you?

67
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,340
Do you know who I am?

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
I know!

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,740
You live in a house.

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,640
You're just a old man who's lying around in his house.

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Oh, I see.

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,740
You're my girlfriend's lover?

73
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,440
No, I'm not.

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,740
I'm not that kind of person.

75
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, poor thing.

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,440
What?

77
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,640
What? I said no!

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm not.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
Hey, hey!

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
I want to hear it!

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,040
Oh, shut up!

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
What did you say?

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
You're a jerk!

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,940
You're a jerk!

85
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,840
Hey, hey!

86
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Let go!

87
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Let go!

88
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,740
Let go of me first!

89
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,040
One, two, three, and let go!

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,540
One, two, three!

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,940
Ah!

92
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,040
Hurry up!

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Your head's broken!

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Director, wake up.

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
Han Beom-woo.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,140
Director Han Beom-woo.

97
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,940
Director, if you copy the main menu recipe first,

98
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
I'll set up the restaurant.

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,640
Yo, yo, good morning.

100
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,040
You've been working hard since morning.

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
Your head's broken!

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,140
You've got a hole in your body.

103
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,840
I know. It's okay.

104
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,740
It's an honor to protect our restaurant.

105
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,640
An honor is a dog's horn.

106
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,840
You know the pork chop you made me last time?

107
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Can you make it again?

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,640
It's so good that I keep thinking about it.

109
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
If you make it again naturally...

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,940
How can I do that crazy thing again?

111
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Do you have a recipe?

113
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,440
It's so good that I keep thinking about it.

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,040
So if you know the recipe,

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,640
can you make it yourself?

116
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,640
If I know, I can make it.

117
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,040
Okay.

118
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,240
Then make me just one.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,340
I'll just watch from the side.

120
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,240
I really want to eat it.

121
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,640
Even if it's a mess, it's quite clean inside.

122
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,940
How is it?

123
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,740
It's not messy, right?

124
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,440
Look at this kitchen. It's clean.

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,140
I don't need a kitchen.

126
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm going to use the warehouse.

127
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,740
Really?

128
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,240
That's great.

129
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,540
Even though it's being used as a restaurant,

130
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,540
this building was built to be a warehouse.

131
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,940
Is that a Mario Park?

132
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,140
You have to see the things like this with your own eyes.

133
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,740
Sang-sik, follow me.

134
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,040
Look outside.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,640
The Provence is all over the place.

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,740
See? It's very French.

137
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,140
It's very modern.

138
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,840
It's modern.

139
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,440
It's a new owner.

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,140
So why are you giving a new owner advice

141
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,440
at a restaurant that's doing well?

142
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,940
It's not doing well.

143
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,440
There are rumors that this restaurant is ruined.

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,740
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,340
The people at the market said that this restaurant is ruined.

146
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,140
The rumors are all over the place.

147
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,440
Who is spreading such nonsense rumors?

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,140
Could it be...

150
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,440
It's a dirty morning.

151
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
What just passed by?

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
You're so ominous.

153
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
I can tell who it is.

154
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
It's that bastard.

155
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,840
But are you sure about what you just said?

156
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm not sure, but I'm sure.

157
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,340
What's different?

158
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,940
I'm telling you it's him.

159
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,840
Even if it's him, what's different?

160
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,240
It's him.

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,340
Even if it's him, there's nothing we can do.

162
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,640
You should return it as much as you received it.

163
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,240
Twice, three times, four times.

164
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,540
Maybe I'm just being more cautious.

165
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,040
Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,140
Is this really you, Yeonju?

167
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,740
Why are you being like this?

168
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,340
You're not supposed to talk to those people.

169
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
And...

170
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,840
My restaurant is ruined.

171
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,940
I'm so ashamed of myself.

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,640
Is this really happening?

173
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,040
The weather is so bad.

174
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
Wow, what is this?

175
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
It's so pretty.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
You want to meet the drone?

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,340
They met as soon as they talked.

178
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,840
The drama is getting popular.

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,740
Hey!

180
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,240
Don't you think you're more serious than the other people?

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,940
Get out of the way.

182
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,740
This person is a very bad person.

183
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
What?

184
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,440
You have time to drink tea.

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,140
Is the bean sprout soup restaurant doing well?

186
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,640
Of course.

187
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,940
It's the same restaurant as the one across the border.

188
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
They said it was already ruined.

189
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,940
This is a real news.

190
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,640
Oh, right.

191
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,340
This is the rumor he made.

192
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
Rumor?

193
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,140
You're a real man. What rumor?

194
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,640
Do you have any rumors that I made?

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Do you have any proof?

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll hold it in.

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
This is not My Air Lane.

198
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
My Air Lane.

199
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh, come on.

200
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Come on up.

201
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,240
Talk to me later.

202
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Oh, my.

203
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm sure you're not going to be like this.

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,940
What?

205
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,240
What?

206
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,340
What?

207
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,740
What do you mean what?

208
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,140
The fire brigade's report has been received.

209
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,240
Fire brigade's report?

210
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,640
What are you talking about?

211
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,840
That's right, sir.

212
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
What fire brigade's report?

213
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
We have all the fire extinguishers.

214
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,040
There's one in the kitchen.

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,640
There's one right there.

216
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
There's one at the door.

217
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,140
We have all the fire extinguishers.

218
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Nothing's weird.

219
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,480
It's a black belt.

220
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,900
Did you check the emergency room?

221
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,980
I'll go look around.

222
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Excuse me, sir.

223
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,740
We have to open a business.

224
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,940
Hello?

225
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,280
Welcome.

226
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
How many people are there?

227
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,780
We're from the ambulance.

228
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,200
There's a report that you didn't get your health insurance.

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Wait and see.

230
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,680
If you have eyes, look here.

231
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,780
Is it a health insurance or not?

232
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Yes.

233
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,040
I found it.

234
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,040
You marked it to write the red pepper powder noodles.

235
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Oh, no, no, no.

236
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,440
I just bought it.

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
I didn't use it. I didn't use it.

238
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,740
I just tasted it.

239
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,340
I just picked it up a little bit and tasted it.

240
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,040
It was in the kitchen when it was opened.

241
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,340
It was open yesterday.

242
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,640
But I didn't use it even once.

243
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,340
I drank, but I didn't drive.

244
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Oh.

245
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,140
I don't think that's a good comparison.

246
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,640
That's what I'm saying.

247
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll lend you my car.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
In the meantime.

249
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Let's go.

250
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,940
Wait, wait a minute.

251
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm going to the ambulance.

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Ambulance?

253
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,940
Don't get into an accident and stay in the car.

254
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm going to the ambulance.

255
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm going to the ambulance.

256
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Sister.

257
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,140
Don't you think we can do something for the store?

258
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Hey, it's clean.

259
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,440
Oh, brother.

260
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I know.

261
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,940
I'm a very neat person.

262
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
Here, here.

263
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

264
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

265
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
This candy.

266
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
You too.

267
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
My store has no problems.

268
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,440
There's nothing wrong with it.

269
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Don't worry.

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
We'll go.

271
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Let's go in.

273
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Let's go in.

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Let's go in.

275
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Here, here.

276
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Here you are.

277
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Go in, go in.

278
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Two people.

279
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Three people.

280
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Hey.

281
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Who am I?

282
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
It's not a hyena in our neighborhood.

283
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Once you go to the door, you never miss it.

284
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I mean, just.

285
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Just.

286
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I think I missed one of the food.

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
I think it's the car.

288
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
It's the car.

289
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
The car.

290
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I was wondering where it was going, and it was the car.

291
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
It's the car.

292
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
It was the car.

293
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
It's the car.

294
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
It's the car.

295
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Let go of my feet.

296
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
No, no.

297
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
What is it?

298
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
It's okay.

299
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Brother, what's wrong with you?

300
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Hey, brother.

301
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Put it in.

302
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
What's wrong with you?

303
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
What's wrong with you?

304
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
We can't help it because Min-won came in.

305
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
He's my friend.

306
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
I'll go.

307
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
How can I not?

308
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm going to report you if you're going to hit me.

309
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Can you do this to me?

310
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
That's a nice shot.

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Nice shot.

312
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Is he really crazy?

313
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Run.

314
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
What?

315
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Why?

316
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Why?

317
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
What's wrong?

318
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Why?

319
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
What is it?

320
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
That crazy bastard.

321
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
He's in front of my store.

322
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
You're here?

323
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Someone reported my parking lot.

324
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm in a bad mood when I park.

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Take out the car.

326
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Take it out.

327
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
If you don't take out the car now, I'll report you.

328
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Report?

329
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
You have to report it.

330
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,440
But this isn't a parking area, so I can't let you go.

331
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
I can't.

332
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Don't do anything you'll regret.

333
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,440
I'm regretting it.

334
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
The day we argued.

335
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Give me the car key if you don't want to die.

336
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Okay.

337
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I'll give you the car key.

338
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Come here.

339
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Are you okay?

340
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh, my God.

341
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Come on.

342
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Come on.

343
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Come on.

344
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Come on.

345
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
There's a chin here.

346
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Come on.

347
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Come on.

348
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Come on.

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Come on.

350
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Come on.

351
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
What's all this?

352
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Why are you dragging me?

353
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,440
You're going to be a family.

354
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Take out the car.

355
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Don't get off.

356
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Take it out.

357
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,440
You fool.

358
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,440
You still don't know me.

359
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Shut up!

360
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
If you get hit by this, you'll be in trouble.

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Give me the key.

362
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Oh, my God.

363
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm not going to do it.

364
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Give me a new car.

365
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Please don't leave me.

366
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm dead.

367
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Isn't this a karaoke?

368
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Let's enjoy it.

369
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,440
How can I go in, the one who has you?

370
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Oh, my God.

371
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Oh, my God.

372
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
I told you not to get in trouble.

373
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
What kind of trouble?

374
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
I did it for the honor of this restaurant.

375
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
What?

376
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
For the honor?

377
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Oh, well, I have a lot of time.

378
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I'll take it out.

379
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Do you think someone is doing this because they don't have a personality?

380
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
I mean, I'm doing it for this restaurant.

381
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,440
If you run a restaurant, you're supposed to have everything.

382
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I can't even get a guest because of what you've done.

383
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Throw away all the ingredients you've prepared.

384
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
How are you going to do all this?

385
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Did I say anything?

386
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,440
I tried to protect this restaurant.

387
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Think about it if you have a head.

388
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Is it really because of this restaurant or your pride?

389
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Mo Hyun-joo.

390
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Help me.

391
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I think I'm stuck.

392
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Really.

393
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
I'm not going to fall out.

394
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Oh, I'm tired.

395
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Oh, I'm tired.

396
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Why are you wearing it like that?

397
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Yes, I don't like the phone call after work.

398
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Did you hear?

399
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm going to Mo Chef's house at dawn.

400
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm going to take a break from lunch tomorrow.

401
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
What are you talking about?

402
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
If you want to pay the debt, you're short of money.

403
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I can't reach the head of the company.

404
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I think Chun-sook gave it to him.

405
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
We did something wrong again.

406
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
It's really childish.

407
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
If the market changes, the restaurant will be ruined.

408
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Mo Chef's food is also good for the market.

409
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't know.

410
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
I don't know.

411
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
I don't know.

412
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Isn't this the place to ride?

413
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
I think it is.

414
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Why aren't you coming?

415
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm going for a walk.

416
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm going for a morning walk.

417
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Who would like it?

418
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,440
From morning, Han Ga-eun takes care of her health and goes for a walk.

419
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Think about it.

420
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I'm really going for a walk in Han River.

421
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Yeah, and she takes care of her health by herself.

422
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Shall we go together?

423
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
I'm going to get a brain tumour.

424
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Is it a man?

425
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
I'm talking about the brain tumour.

426
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Oh, my God.

427
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
What's in my nose?

428
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
What are you doing?

429
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Let's go quietly.

430
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Quietly?

431
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Yes, yes.

432
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Wow, it's a complete countryside.

433
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Are you going up again?

434
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
You've been up so far.

435
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
You've been up so far by bus.

436
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Do I have to walk more?

437
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
How much more do I have to walk?

438
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Just come quickly.

439
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
It's cooler than I thought.

440
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
It's cool and you sleep.

441
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Walk faster.

442
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Wow, really.

443
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
There's no romance.

444
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Look here.

445
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Oh, it's done.

446
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Uncle Chang-soo.

447
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Uncle Chang-soo.

448
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Are you here?

449
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Uncle Chang-soo.

450
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Uncle Chang-soo.

451
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
What brings you here?

452
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
What's going on?

453
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,440
No, this is the only relationship between us.

454
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I don't know what it was about.

455
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
You shouldn't touch the intestines.

456
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Chun-seung?

457
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
What's Chun-seung?

458
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Chun-seung.

459
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
You look so unfair.

460
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Is it a person?

461
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
I don't know.

462
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
You don't know?

463
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Then why didn't you contact me?

464
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I was going to get married and get married earlier.

465
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I was walking all the way to the phone.

466
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
It's been half a day.

467
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh, my God.

468
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
It must be a real one.

469
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm sorry I haven't been able to go to the market yet.

470
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Then I'll have to do it myself.

471
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
What?

472
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
You're going to do it yourself?

473
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Today?

474
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Yes, I'm going to do it.

475
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I'll make it all dirty.

476
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Just let it go.

478
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Where are you looking?

479
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
No, no, no.

480
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Look at that size.

481
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Get out.

482
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
I'll split the market.

483
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Don't worry and wait.

484
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Oh, yeah, then.

485
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Thank you for the O.C.F.

486
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Let's just come next time.

487
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
What are you going to do alone?

488
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Why alone?

489
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
What about me?

490
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Why are you looking at me?

491
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm not doing it.

492
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
I said I'm not doing it.

493
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
I'll do everything you ask me to do.

494
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm not doing it.

495
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm not doing it.

496
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm really going to do everything you want.

497
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
That's for you.

498
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Give it to me.

499
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Right?

500
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
What kind of beans do you use?

501
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
How much do you boil?

502
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
How much do you steam?

503
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,440
The taste changes gradually.

504
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
If there's a lot of moisture every week,

505
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
it's easy to get bad bacteria.

506
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I have to check how well it's been dried.

507
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
I'll take it out.

508
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Come and scoop this up with a ladle.

509
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,440
One, two, three.

510
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
It feels weird.

511
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Do it right.

512
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm doing it.

513
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Sprinkle evenly.

514
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Stop.

515
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm going to put it in the water.

516
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
It's pretty.

517
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
This is Jang Seok.

518
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,440
It's the years and the sincerity of this Jang-tteok.

519
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
It's pretty.

520
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Look at Jang-tteok.

521
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
How pretty.

522
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
It's so pretty here.

523
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
It's not Jang-tteok, it's Jang-suk.

524
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
You're going to do this?

525
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
You idiot.

526
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
You're so stupid.

527
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Isn't an idiot a little too much?

528
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
It's like the Joseon Dynasty.

529
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Do I look old?

530
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,440
You've given me a lot of precious things.

531
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
I know.

532
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
You know that beer is good for your body, right?

533
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Oh, yeah?

534
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
I'm not tired of it.

535
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm not tired of it.

536
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
You're not tired of it.

537
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Why are you tired?

538
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I got Jang Seok and I got it every week.

539
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,440
I got Jang Seok and I got it every week.

540
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah, there's no reason to be tired.

541
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Right?

542
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
What?

543
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
It's raining.

544
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Run.

545
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
It's raining.

546
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
It's heavy.

547
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Oh, this is...

548
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
This is...

549
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I think it's a shower.

550
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Sorry.

551
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Sorry?

552
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
You know how to say that.

553
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Did you follow me here because you're sorry?

554
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
You're the one.

555
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh, yeah.

556
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
You said you cut the delivery every week because of me.

557
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Yeah.

558
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,440
It's okay if you know what you did wrong.

559
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm not the kind of person who feels sorry for someone.

560
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,440
No, I don't make you feel sorry from the beginning.

561
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,440
You keep saying that, so your girlfriend ran away from you.

562
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
You're right. You said it right.

563
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
She didn't go to you.

564
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Then who is it?

565
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Oh, there is.

566
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Wait a minute.

567
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,440
I've never been dumped by anyone.

568
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,440
The guys I met were all obsessed with me,

569
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,440
hanging on to me, crying, and crying.

570
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Han Beom-woo was really popular.

571
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
It's raining.

572
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I was worried about you.

573
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
It's raining.

574
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
What?

575
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Fire?

576
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Don't come in.

577
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
No, no.

578
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
This is our store.

579
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
This is our store.

580
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
This is our store.

581
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Are you okay?

582
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Who's hurt?

583
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,440
The door was broken.

584
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,440
The door was broken.

585
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,440
The police said it looked like a fire.

586
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Fire?

587
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,440
But our store is so out of service that it's going to take a while to get a CCTV.

588
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
It's okay.

589
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
But where is the one who's not hurt?

590
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
What do you mean I'm not hurt?

591
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm hurt.

592
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
I shouldn't have done this to my dorm.

593
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
What does he mean?

594
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
That's...

595
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Chun-seung?

596
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
The guy who burned the store?

597
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Mo Hyun-joo, calm down.

598
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
You're too excited.

599
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
It could be wrong.

600
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
I think it's right.

601
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Wait, wait, wait.

602
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Come out.

603
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
What are you going to do in there alone?

604
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
You're going to set fire to someone else's business?

605
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
This is a serious crime.

606
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
So let's not do this alone.

607
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
Let's trust the authorities this time.

608
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Come out.

609
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
You're not coming out?

610
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
Mo Hyun-joo.

611
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Hey, hey, hey.

612
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
What is it?

613
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
Do you know what you did?

614
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,440
What are you talking about?

615
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Now you're fighting.

616
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
This is an assault.

617
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Did you see it?

618
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Special assault.

619
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
Crime.

620
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Crime?

621
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Crime.

622
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Let's see.

623
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Hey, what are you thinking about?

624
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
You're committing such a crime.

625
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
What kind of bullshit is this?

626
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,440
What crime did I commit?

627
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Do you have evidence?

628
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
You have to bring evidence.

629
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
Do you have evidence?

630
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
You have to bring evidence.

631
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I don't know the evidence.

632
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,440
I have evidence.

633
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,440
But is pineapple better than rice soup?

634
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Oh, my God.

635
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm not a pineapple.

636
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm going crazy about pineapple dining.

637
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440
How can you come at this hour?

638
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
I've seen it all.

639
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,440
You're drunk and you walked from our store.

640
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
I?

641
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Excuse me, sister.

642
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
It's a crime to be a heavy.

643
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm really going to go to the dark room.

644
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Dark room?

645
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,440
It hurts my ears.

646
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Heavy?

647
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,440
If you're heavy, tell me.

648
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Why did you drink at that time and walk around our restaurant?

649
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,440
Hey, can't I drink with my mouth?

650
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,440
I was so angry because of you guys.

651
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,440
I drank all night from last night to this morning.

652
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Why?

653
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Oh, you added a hot steam to the alcohol.

654
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
You set the restaurant on fire.

655
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Did you set the restaurant on fire?

656
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,440
What the hell are you talking about?

657
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,440
What fire am I?

658
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Fire?

659
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Boss!

660
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Boss, boss.

661
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
The boss is coming.

662
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,440
My father is a boss with a child.

663
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Now even the first-time people are ignoring me.

664
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Did I really set the restaurant on fire?

665
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
There's nothing to say. Let's go to the police station.

666
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Wait, wait, wait.

667
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Wait, wait.

668
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
No, no, no.

669
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,440
I was there and I saw the window.

670
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I really don't remember setting the fire.

671
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
That's because you drank, but you didn't drive.

672
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Hey, I'm sorry.

673
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I'm sorry.

675
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I'll get the reward and live quietly forever.

676
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
So please.

677
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
No, no, no.

678
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
There's nothing to say.

679
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
You can go to the police station and talk about it.

680
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
No, no, no.

681
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I forgot.

682
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Not yet.

683
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Don't look.

684
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
I can't go to the store until I fix it.

685
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
I can't just go to the store.

686
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
If you want to fix the kitchen and sell it,

687
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
it's better to get the money I give you.

688
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I'll get a rent.

689
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
I'll get the material cost.

690
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I have to pay the employee's salary.

691
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I have to pay the employee's salary.

692
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Brother.

693
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,440
How much can you pay?

694
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,440
I'll give you all the money I have in my hand.

695
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:23,440
1 million won?

696
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Are you teasing me now?

697
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
That's my whole fortune.

698
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,440
My car is also my father's watch.

699
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
This necklace is all my father's.

700
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Please.

701
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Stop it.

702
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Give me three days.

703
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,780
Get the kitchen

704
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,440
and get the money back in three days.

705
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Three days?

706
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
It's your last chance.

707
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Hey.

708
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Call.

709
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I'll call you no matter what.

710
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
You know, I close my eyes and do that.

711
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,440
There's no place in this country house that this new student didn't fix his hand.

712
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,440
We're done.

713
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
See you tomorrow.

714
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:10,440
I'm going to the restaurant.

715
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Don't report it.

716
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Did you promise?

717
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,440
You're giving him another chance?

718
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,440
People don't change.

719
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,440
You should give him another chance.

720
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:40,440
He's a human.

721
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Truffle Neuvian, which maximized the flavor with truffle paste,

722
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,440
and truffle Neuvian, which added three more flavors by adding lemon juice and chili as the base of the opening tea.

723
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I moved the menu that I was going to launch on the motorbike to La Roussel and developed it.

724
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,440
It's a dish that stands out like Chef Jang.

725
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Yes, I think trendy visuals are important.

726
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes, that's good.

727
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Can you please move out of the way for a second?

728
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Are you going to give this trash as a signature now?

729
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,440
I thought you were going to give me a hand when you were on the motorbike.

730
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Now I only taste money.

731
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Get rid of it.

733
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
You said you were in the prison.

734
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,440
I said it was a business trip, but it's no different from a business trip.

735
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I stabbed my sister's back.

736
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Why didn't I do anything?

737
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
I know you gave me a chance.

738
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I'll get it out as soon as possible.

739
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I don't think Beom-woo is the type to stab your back.

740
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I'll look you in the eye and hit you in the neck.

741
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Are you Han Yeo-won's cooking researcher?

742
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Yes.

743
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,440
I knew it.

744
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
I love it.

745
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Can I have a picture?

746
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Is it just one? Let's take two or three.

747
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Come here.

748
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Wait a minute.

749
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:07,440
I think this side will be better.

750
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
It's me.

751
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Go down there and find out what you're doing.

752
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I love you.

753
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Thank you.

754
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I told you not to believe it.

755
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I can tell by looking at your face.

756
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
The master is here.

757
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,440
The master of the kitchen.

758
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,440
I'm a little late.

759
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,440
I didn't report it because I slept a little late.

760
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
You see?

761
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
I was just about to call you.

762
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
This is a very bad habit.

763
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Did you hear everything I said yesterday?

764
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm the one who promised you.

765
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
I'm going to finish it.

766
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm going to finish the warehouse.

767
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
The warehouse?

768
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Then the story will be different.

769
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Can you do it or not?

770
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
I can do it.

771
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,440
But is there another saying?

772
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,440
It's better to taste it.

773
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
That's a great saying.

774
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,440
So you mean we should get together and help each other?

775
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Are you kidding me?

776
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
How many times is 112?

777
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Hello, police officer.

778
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Hello.

779
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:49,440 --> 00:41:07,440
I'm sorry.

781
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Good job.

782
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Good job.

783
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Do you have any leftover dry fix?

784
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
That's a real gold.

785
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,440
I don't know if I have any work to do.

786
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,440
What is it?

787
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Wow, mom.

788
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Is it all English?

789
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,440
What's this?

790
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:18,440
That's cool.

791
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
What the hell are you doing?

792
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,440
What is it again?

793
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
What is it again?

794
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,440
What's going on?

795
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
What are you doing there?

796
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
I can't do it.

797
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,440
You know I grew up preciously.

798
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,440
What's wrong with you?

799
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Do you know why your father didn't let you eat?

800
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
He just knows how to do it.

801
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
He just drinks and plays.

802
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
He just wants to hear the boss's voice.

803
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,440
He just walks around the neighborhood and makes trouble.

804
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,440
What are you going to give to a guy like that?

805
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
You're not going to give it to me, are you?

806
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Did you just say everything?

807
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Yeah, I'm done.

808
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Really?

809
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,440
You're going to hit me.

810
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Hit me.

811
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Hit me.

812
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:28,440
Mom, mom.

813
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
What are you doing?

814
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,440
What are you doing?

815
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
What's wrong with you?

816
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

817
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
What are you doing?

818
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
Are you crazy?

819
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm just a useless guy.

820
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I know.

821
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Do you think I've always wanted to live like this?

822
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,440
I had a dream when I was young.

823
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,440
I wanted to go to a lot of places.

824
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,440
But my father always told me not to do useless things.

825
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I've been working and doing this and that all my life.

826
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I'm sick of it.

827
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm not born with a national law.

828
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm going crazy because I'm frustrated with my life.

829
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I don't know anything.

830
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Oh, my God.

831
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:48,440
What are you going to do?

832
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
It's too watery.

833
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,440
I picked it up somewhere.

834
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:04,440
I'll just put it there.

835
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
What are you doing? Come here.

836
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Are you going to sit down and cry?

837
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Go.

838
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,440
Look at it.

839
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Thinly spread it out and apply it.

840
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Gently, gently, gently.

841
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
It's stuck, right?

842
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Try it.

843
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,440
I was an architecture major in revenge.

844
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:43,440
What's that?

845
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
What do you want?

846
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
You have to weigh something to cheer up.

847
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,440
I think I need a new one.

848
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,440
I'm hungry.

849
00:45:52,440 --> 00:46:02,440
Let's see.

850
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:32,440
I'm hungry.

851
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:42,440
I'm hungry.

852
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
It's a snap.

853
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Gently, gently, gently.

854
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,440
I'm hungry.

855
00:46:51,440 --> 00:47:02,440
Gently, gently, gently.

856
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,440
It looks delicious.

857
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Thank you for the meal.

858
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Eat it.

859
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,440
What's this?

860
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
What?

861
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Haven't you tried jajangmyeon before?

862
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Jajangmyeon?

863
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,440
But since when did I become your master?

864
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Well, we're family now.

865
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
Jajangmyeon.

866
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
It's been this way since the past.

867
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
It's been this way since the past.

868
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
I know.

869
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
But it's not the old days.

870
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
Put it in.

871
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,440
No, no, no.

872
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
I mean, you made it in the old style.

873
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,440
It looks very appetizing.

874
00:47:50,440 --> 00:48:05,440
That's what it means.

875
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,440
It's so delicious.

876
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
I didn't expect this.

877
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,440
Our chef's skills are really light.

878
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Right?

879
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
Are you two here?

880
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Where did everyone go?

881
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
Oh, brother.

882
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
You're here.

883
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,440
You're here.

884
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,440
The restaurant is...

885
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Oh, my.

886
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Are you here to make fun of me?

887
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,440
I'm here because I'm worried about the restaurant.

888
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,440
Our newbie in early football is having a hard time.

889
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Brother, I'm touched.

890
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,440
What's the trouble?

891
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I told you not to get involved with Chun-sik.

892
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
Oh, brother.

893
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,440
Not Chun-sik, Chun-seung.

894
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,440
I don't think he's the kind of guy who hasn't been able to eat since the beginning.

895
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,440
I don't think he's bad, even if he's a little short.

896
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,440
I've been friends with him.

897
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Why?

898
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Look.

899
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
It looks bad. It looks bad.

900
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,440
Anyway,

901
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,440
At first glance, at least 500 won is in the account.

902
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,440
500 won?

903
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
How did you get 500 won?

904
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Call me when you get the money.

905
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,440
I'll go out and sign up for a professional.

906
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,440
Yes, thank you.

907
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
Why are you moving?

908
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,440
What are you trying to say?

909
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Brother, stop.

910
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,440
What's that 5 million won?

911
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Is that your back pocket?

912
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,440
Pockets?

913
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
What is this?

914
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
What is this?

915
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
What is this?

916
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
Who put this garbage in your pocket?

917
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,440
Give me that.

918
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,440
500,000 won food truck competition.

919
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Two days?

920
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,440
If it's two days, I'll fold it roughly, but the total price is 40%.

921
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,440
300 won, 500 won for the first prize.

922
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
I can renew all the interiors and tables.

923
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,440
I think it's good to do something.

924
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,440
But this application is until 6 p.m.

925
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,440
What time is it now?

926
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
It's 5 minutes and 45 minutes now.

927
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
I can't go for 15 minutes.

928
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Go.

929
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,440
I can go.

930
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Can you really do it?

931
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Can I trust you?

932
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,440
I'm Shin Chun-seung, the navigator in this neighborhood.

933
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,440
I'll use the motorcycle.

934
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,440
Can I trust that?

935
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
You can't trust that, can you?

936
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Then trust me.

937
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Can I trust that?

938
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Hey, you saw the sun behind you, right?

939
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,440
Trust me.

940
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
I'm going.

941
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
I can go.

942
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,440
Hurry up.

943
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Hey, I think there's an accident.

944
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,440
No, I can't go.

945
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:24,440
It's in front of me.

946
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Sorry.

947
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,440
It's too fast.

948
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
It's going.

949
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,440
What is it?

950
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,440
I killed it.

951
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Hey.

952
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,440
It's working.

953
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,440
Why is there so much difference?

954
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
Hey, is this the right way?

955
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Are you going right?

956
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:09,440
I'm going right.

957
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

958
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:24,440
I almost got caught.

959
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Here it is. Here it is.

960
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,440
It's here. It's here.

961
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
The one in front of me.

962
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Wait a minute.

963
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
Go, go, go.

964
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
My legs.

965
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,440
Why are you pushing me?

966
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,440
Why are your legs?

967
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,440
No, no.

968
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Where are you? Where are you?

969
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,440
Wait a minute.

970
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
The registration is over.

971
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Stop it.

972
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,440
It's over.

973
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,440
I've been watching you for a long time.

974
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Young-eun. Young-eun.

975
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
No.

976
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,440
Oh, it's VTS.

977
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,440
VTS?

978
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,440
Where, where, where, where?

979
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Where, where, where?

980
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Here, here, here.

981
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,440
Hey, you surprised me.

982
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,440
It's TBS.

983
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,440
Korean broadcast.

984
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
I was surprised.

985
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
What's BTS doing here?

986
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
What the hell.

987
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,440
I don't like the mood.

988
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,440
If it's BTS, I'll get an autograph and do it.

989
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
It's a Korean broadcast.

990
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,440
I'm sorry.

991
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
Have a good day.

992
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
Look, look, TBS.

993
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Oh, my.

994
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,440
I did a good job, right?

995
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,440
It's like a beret.

996
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Where are you?

997
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,440
It's done.

998
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,440
Oh, my.

999
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,440
There's a time to use dog poop.

1000
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
Go home.

1001
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,440
My chef told me to go home right there.

1002
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,440
Yes.

1003
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,440
You did a good job.

1004
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,440
What about the soup?

1005
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
It's done now.

1006
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
It's done.

1007
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,440
Oh, my.

1008
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Go.

1009
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,440
You can go.

1010
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,440
You can go.

1011
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:22,440
I was surprised.

1012
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,440
It's starting.

1013
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,440
It's hot.

1014
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
I should go to the hospital.

1015
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:51,440
It's hot. It's too hot.

1016
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Yeah, let's quit smoking.

1017
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,440
It seems like a long day.

1018
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
It seems short.

1019
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,440
He was a neighborhood style.

1020
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:37,440
What?

1021
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Jang Shim.

1022
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Are you crazy?

1023
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,440
How did you know I was here?

1024
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Why are you so surprised?

1025
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:57,440
Oh, you were playing a joke at a normal restaurant here, too.

1026
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Joke?

1027
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,440
Let's be careful with each other.

1028
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,440
Why are you so cold to each other?

1029
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Did you come to put your legs in between me and Han Su-won?

1030
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,440
This is why I like Han Hee-sol.

1031
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Do you like me?

1032
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
Did you hurt your head coming down?

1033
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:29,440
Why can't you come down there?

1034
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,440
You're already off work?

1035
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
At this early hour?

1036
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,440
Why are you talking like a thief?

1037
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Who?

1038
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
What are you going to do?

1039
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,440
Go.

1040
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,440
Oh, you're trying to get back at me again.

1041
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Whose generation are you?

1042
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,440
My ex-girlfriend.

1043
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Ex-girlfriend?

1044
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Yeah.

1045
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Should we keep talking about what we used to do?

1046
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,440
I hate you following me around like this.

1047
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,440
How did you know I was here?

1048
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,440
If you do this, I'll lose everything I've ever had.

1049
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
What are you talking about?

1050
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,440
I ran away from my brother.

1051
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
That's not it.

1052
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,440
Who?

1053
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,440
Brother?

1054
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
Can I tell you why I hate you again?

1055
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,440
I hate to see you so much.

1056
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:44,440
No, I just hate to see you eat and breathe.

1057
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Get out!

1058
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Excuse me.

1059
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,440
Do you know what this person is doing?

1060
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,440
I'll find out on my own.

1061
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,440
Don't mind her.

1062
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:50,440
The atmosphere is good.

1063
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,440
There are so many things called dogs and cows or chefs these days.

1064
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,440
Let's talk about food.

1065
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,440
How dare you touch my pride?

1066
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Now people are starting to gather.

1067
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,440
Except for our captain.

1068
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Shouldn't we be careful about the menu selection if we want to win?

1069
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
The winner of the first place is...

1070
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,440
Are you doing it because you like it?

1071
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
I'm waiting for her?

1072
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:17,440
I've been waiting for you.
