Premium ge bao laoh

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,940
It's a race!

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,940
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
This is too much.

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,940
Hold on for a second.

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,940
He waited for me.

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,940
What?

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
Me?

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
Why?

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,940
Hey, come on!

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,940
Hey, let's go!

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,940
You little bastards!

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,940
Run!

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
What?

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,940
Where are you going?

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,940
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,940
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,940
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,940
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,940
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,940
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
It's okay.

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
It's okay.

55
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
I'm not going to chase you.

56
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,940
You were the one who caught him first.

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
I was.

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,940
I'm the one who caught him first.

59
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,940
You're such a whore.

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,940
No, I'm not.

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Are you mad?

62
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
I'm not going to look good.

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
I'm mad.

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Don't be mad.

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,940
Why are you so happy today?

66
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,940
You didn't even get to be the first place.

67
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
I'm done.

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
What?

69
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
What are you talking about?

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm the king of this area from now on.

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
I'm so dumb.

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
I'm so mad.

73
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Are you jealous?

74
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
Well, I'm going to get it.

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Choose one.

76
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
I'll give you one.

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Which one?

78
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
It's okay.

79
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
Why are you so mad?

80
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,940
I'm not mad.

81
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,940
Just admit it.

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
It's okay.

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,940
I'm doing it because of that.

84
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
What do you mean?

85
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
It's okay.

86
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Say it.

87
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
What do you mean?

88
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
It's okay.

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Say it.

90
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
I think you like it.

91
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
I think you like it.

92
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,940
I think you like it.

93
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
What do you like?

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
You.

95
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I like you.

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Then...

97
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
You take this.

98
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
What?

99
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,940
You two!

100
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
It's bleeding.

101
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,940
It's bleeding.

102
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
I think it's broken.

103
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
It's bleeding.

104
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey, Hyunjoo.

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Are you still awake?

107
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Good night.

108
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Good night.

109
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
Oh, my.

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Hold on.

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,940
I can't.

112
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Hurry up.

113
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Hurry up.

114
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
Be careful.

115
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
Be careful.

116
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
It's much better.

117
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
This.

118
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
This.

119
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,940
This is the time-dining part.

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
The interior is so good.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
I made this for you.

122
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Chef?

123
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
Then, is it over?

124
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Already?

125
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Yes.

126
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,940
What?

127
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
It's a ninja?

128
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
It's a ninja.

129
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,940
You did a great job.

130
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
That room's sound will take a while.

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Really?

132
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
The floor is old.

133
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
If you want to dry it up,

134
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
it will take a while.

135
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
It's okay.

136
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Anyway, call me if you have any questions.

137
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Yes.

138
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
Hey, good job.

139
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
Yes, good job.

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Yes.

141
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Go.

142
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Go.

143
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,940
Yes.

144
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,940
Go.

145
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
What?

146
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,940
You're laughing like a bad guy.

147
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Hurry up and move.

148
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
I won't do it.

149
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
But, Chef,

150
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,940
what do you mean?

151
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
What do you mean?

152
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I was so busy yesterday that I asked you something.

153
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,940
I have four chairs.

154
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Do you like to put them in a cool and straight way?

155
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Or do you like to put two in a row?

156
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Or do you like to put them in a nice way?

157
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
I don't know what to do with the couple.

158
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Why are you putting them in a chair?

159
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
I'll take them out.

160
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Take them out.

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
When I come here,

162
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,940
I think it would be better to put them in a couple.

163
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,940
You two are not together, right?

165
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
You're so fast.

166
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,940
We were just fighting because we were going to kill each other.

167
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,940
We were going to take out the bride and get married.

168
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
Then,

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
I'll kill you.

170
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Stop it.

171
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
You're talking like a pervert.

172
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Listen carefully.

173
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Don't talk twice.

174
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,940
That was a mistake.

175
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
It wasn't.

176
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
It was a mistake.

177
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Yes, it was a mistake.

178
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Don't misunderstand or do anything stupid.

179
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
It's forbidden.

180
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
It's forbidden.

181
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
Excuse me.

182
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Excuse me.

183
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
What?

184
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Bong-seo?

185
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Welcome.

186
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
Do you know how to say it?

187
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
Yes, I do.

188
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Bong-ju.

189
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Do you know how to say it?

190
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Yes, I do.

191
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,940
How did you get here?

192
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
We ate kimbap at a food truck festival.

193
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
It was delicious.

194
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I took your card to visit.

195
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Thank you.

196
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Thank you.

197
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
You're so good at Korean.

198
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
I was so surprised.

200
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
What did you say?

201
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
I didn't understand.

202
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Thank you.

203
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Thank you.

204
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Yes.

205
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Come here.

206
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Yes, yes.

207
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Yes, yes.

208
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Bye.

209
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Say goodbye.

210
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
What did you say?

211
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
What did you say?

212
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Just now?

213
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
So,

214
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,940
they said they ate our food at a food truck.

215
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,940
But it was so delicious.

216
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
That's right.

217
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
But why didn't you eat?

218
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
No, no.

219
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I can't make a reservation tomorrow.

220
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
I think I have to.

221
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
You can refuse.

222
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,940
Just listen to what's going on.

223
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,940
We're getting married.

224
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
I want to get married here.

225
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
What?

226
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
How did you get here?

227
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
I can't even get married here.

228
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
My parents are in Korea.

229
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,940
My mom doesn't like Korean food.

230
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't like the fact that they don't like Korean food.

231
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Mom.

232
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Mom.

233
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Did you know that you're jealous?

234
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I'm still in the kitchen.

235
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Listen.

237
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
If you get that reservation,

238
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,940
you can ask us for a week's rent.

239
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
Do you have a reason to refuse?

240
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Okay.

241
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
It's not because of money.

242
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,940
My parents said that our food will suit you.

243
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
But you can't do that.

244
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
You have to take care of your head.

245
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
That's right.

246
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
It's good.

247
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
What's wrong with you?

248
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,940
I feel like I'm in love with you.

249
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
I feel like I'm in love with you.

250
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
I feel like I'm in love with you.

251
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,940
I feel like I'm in love with you.

252
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
I feel like I'm in love with you.

253
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
I'm not going to do that.

254
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
It's your turn.

255
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,940
I thought it was easy.

256
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Yes.

257
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
I'm looking at you.

258
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
Yes.

259
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
What's wrong with you?

260
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Is there a mistake?

261
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Of course there is a mistake.

262
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
It's a mistake.

263
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,940
You make mistakes once in your life.

264
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
Don't you?

265
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
No.

266
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
What should I do?

267
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
It's a mistake to get married.

268
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
It's a mistake.

269
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
I'm not going to do that.

270
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
You're a grown-up.

271
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,940
You're a man and a woman.

272
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,940
You're a woman who hits on the lips.

273
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,940
What's wrong with you?

274
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Are you serious?

275
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't you do that?

276
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
What's wrong with you?

277
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,940
What's wrong with me?

278
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,940
When I was in Paris, I used to play the ball every day.

279
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
I used to play the ball every day.

280
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
You used to play the ball every day.

281
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,940
That's why you're playing the ball.

282
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm not good at that.

283
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm not good at that.

284
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,940
I think it's not a mistake.

285
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,940
I think it's not a mistake.

286
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,940
What do you think Chun-seung is?

288
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
It's not a mistake.

289
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
What do you think?

290
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,940
I think it's a mistake.

291
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
I think it's a big sin.

292
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
I can hear it.

293
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
I think it's a big sin.

294
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
You hit on the lips.

295
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Why do you hit me?

296
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
You're not good at that.

297
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
My future husband has only one parent, his father.

298
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,940
He only wants to eat Korean food.

299
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,940
But my mother can't eat Korean food.

300
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,940
She can't eat Korean food.

301
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,940
She can't eat spicy food.

302
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,940
So it's not easy to find a restaurant to meet.

303
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Korean food is Korean food.

304
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,940
I don't know how to say it.

305
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
I don't know how to say it.

306
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
It's a mistake.

307
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
It's a mistake.

308
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I can't say it.

309
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
It's a mistake?

310
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
What are you doing?

311
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:30,060
I think you're in trouble.

312
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,060
You know, I'm not a perfect person.

313
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm just a little bit of a pushover.

314
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,060
How can you say that I made a mistake?

315
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,060
I can't say that.

316
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
I can't say that.

317
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,060
I can't say that.

318
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,060
I can't say that.

319
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
So what?

320
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
I can feel the pressure.

321
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
I'm handsome.

322
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
I'm good at physics.

323
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm good at studying.

324
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,060
I can't say that if I'm in the same class.

325
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
What about Inseong?

326
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,060
Inseong is a good student.

327
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
Then what about you?

328
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
You're a good student too.

329
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
That's a mistake.

330
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,060
I can't do it because I'm in the same class.

331
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I want to be in the same class with you!

332
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,060
I want to be in the same class but I can't do it.

333
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Why?

334
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Why can't you do it?

335
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
The kitchen is not a place for dating.

336
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,060
It's a place for cooking.

337
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Let's do it outside the kitchen.

338
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
It's a gold digger.

339
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Outside the kitchen?

340
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
What? Are you filming a pasta?

341
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,060
I won't go to the kitchen.

342
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I'll just be a quiet person.

343
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
I'll be quiet.

344
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
I'm not in the kitchen.

345
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
I'm quiet.

346
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
But I'm coming out.

347
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
I'm here.

348
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Let's just do a date.

349
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Let's just do a date.

350
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,060
We can decide whether we'll meet or not.

351
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I'm sure we'll meet.

352
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
I'm leaving.

353
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
Okay.

354
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
So, tomorrow is Thursday, right?

355
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,060
Yes.

356
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,060
We'll have a date on the night after the contract is over.

357
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,060
So, are you listening to me?

358
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
Yes, I am.

359
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Hey!

360
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Why?

361
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Then, we'll have a date on that day.

362
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:54,060
I'll tell you what date I'm on.

363
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,060
Date!

364
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
What's that?

365
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
A.O.

366
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
Why are you filming?

367
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,060
What's wrong with me?

368
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,060
What's wrong with me?

369
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Jeong Jae.

370
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Jeong Jae.

371
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
You're a good guy.

372
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
You should do this.

373
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,060
And there's more here.

374
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,060
Thank you so much.

375
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
How is it?

376
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
It's pretty, right?

377
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
It's pretty.

378
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Why don't you give it to me?

379
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
You're still here?

380
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
Is the contract over?

381
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,060
Is your son still here?

382
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
What's that?

383
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Are you eating?

384
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,060
I was so sad just now.

385
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
The food truck shop in front of us.

386
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
I forgot it right away.

387
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,060
I packed my comeback.

388
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
Oh, it's him.

389
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
When will you be back?

390
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
What are you talking about?

391
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
If you say it, it's Jeong Jae.

392
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Jeong Jae!

393
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Jeong Jae!

394
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Do whatever you want.

395
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Are you really going to do this in Seoul?

396
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
You have mine.

397
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
Huh?

398
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broad Han Air.

399
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
We're at H.A. 511 to Incheon Airport.

400
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,060
We've reached our closing altitude.

401
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
We will prepare your meals.

402
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
Yes.

403
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
We have a special business order for you.

404
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,060
We have a Korean restaurant in front of us.

405
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
We have a Korean restaurant in front of us.

406
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,060
We have a Korean restaurant in front of us.

407
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,060
Can we have a Korean restaurant in front of us?

408
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Yes, we will prepare it.

409
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Thank you.

410
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Thank you.

411
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Wait a minute.

412
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Yes, sir?

413
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Would you like to try it?

414
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
It's okay.

415
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,060
We'll try it.

416
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
You like salty food, right?

417
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Yes.

418
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
In the case of the opening ceremony,

419
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
the altitude was high and the contract was low,

420
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
so we put a difference in the salt.

421
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
You can't cook like this.

422
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,060
Sir, this is a Korean restaurant, so the quality of the food...

423
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,060
It's a three-star restaurant in the Diamond.

424
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Oh, that's...

425
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,060
You have to keep the menu until the beginning.

426
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,060
You've got the sauce and the cooking time wrong.

427
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,060
What's going on?

428
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
It's a remodeling.

429
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I'll stop the collaboration.

430
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,060
Please don't serve this menu from now on.

431
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,060
I think our restaurant's reputation will be bad.

432
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Please wake me up when we arrive.

433
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
Good job.

434
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Come in.

435
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,060
I should watch a movie on this day.

436
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Is there a scene you like?

437
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,060
What's wrong with you two?

438
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,060
How many times have you been in a relationship?

439
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
Go back. I'll change my mind.

440
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,060
You're a fool.

441
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Give me the broth, the lamb and the ribs.

442
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,060
Can I give you everything here?

443
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Sir, congratulations.

444
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Just give me the necessary amount.

445
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
I'll give it to you.

446
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,060
I have a new order.

447
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
It's a good one.

448
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,060
You're a different person from the beginning.

449
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
It's cheap.

450
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
It's cheap.

451
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,060
You didn't have a iron-cut.

452
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,060
You're doing everything you can to make money.

453
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
You're so mean.

454
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
You didn't have a talent.

455
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
You're a good person.

456
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Give it to me.

457
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
I heard it well.

458
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,060
You're a cheap person.

459
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,060
But now...

460
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,060
You smell like a person.

461
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
That's all.

462
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
You're a fool.

463
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,060
You're a fool.

464
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Go ahead.

465
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
You smell like a person.

466
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,060
You're a fool.

467
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Really?

468
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,060
What?

469
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Do you smell like me?

470
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,060
I don't know.

471
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
You should wash your face.

472
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
I don't know.

473
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,060
You said that.

474
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
Do you smell like a person?

475
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,060
What do you say?

476
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,060
You're a fool.

477
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,060
I think I'm serious.

478
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
You're a fool.

479
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,060
I like it.

480
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
I like it.

481
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
I just...

482
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,060
I was going to give you a scholarship.

483
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,060
Can you bring me a piece of paper?

484
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Thank you.

485
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
What do you want?

486
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
What do you want?

487
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,060
I was so tired.

488
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
Yeon-ju.

489
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,060
Yeon-ju.

490
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Did you...

491
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
get drunk?

492
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I came alone.

493
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
Hye-yo!

494
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
What, Yeon-ju?

495
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Get out.

496
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
You should talk about it.

497
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
I have a right to talk.

498
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,060
Talk about what?

499
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
What do you and I talk about?

500
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
How have you been?

501
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Yes.

502
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
I've been doing well.

503
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
It's okay, right?

504
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Now go.

505
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm sorry.

507
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,060
I was going to get a car, but I couldn't find a place to park.

509
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,060
Hey, hey, hey!

510
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,060
This is the area of ​​the bank.

511
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,060
The owner of this restaurant is very gentle.

512
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,060
What were you about to cut?

513
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,060
The owner of this restaurant is very gentle.

514
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
If you go that way, there's a bank.

515
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
I'm sorry.

516
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
You're here.

517
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I thought I'd be late.

518
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
I thought I'd be late for work.

519
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
You're the one who said it.

520
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Someone came to the store a while ago.

521
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,060
Who?

522
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Who came to find me?

523
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Are you crazy?

524
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
You're not going to work?

525
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
What I'm saying is...

526
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
You have to be careful.

527
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,060
What?

528
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Hello.

529
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Can you eat?

530
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Welcome.

531
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
How many?

532
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Two.

533
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Two?

534
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
That way.

535
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
What?

536
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Was that the car's transfer?

537
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
What are you doing there?

538
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,060
Wow.

539
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,060
The customer increased the number of times before the renewal.

540
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
This will be enough to get the bill soon.

541
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
What?

542
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Let's go home.

543
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Let's go home.

544
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Don't be late for work early in the morning.

545
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Got it?

546
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,060
Yes.

547
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,060
Yeonju.

548
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Yeonju?

549
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Yeonju.

550
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,060
I'm sorry.

551
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
Talk to me for a minute.

552
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Aren't you going home?

553
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
I have to go.

554
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Oh, my.

555
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Oh, my.

556
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,060
What?

557
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Are you going?

558
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,060
I have to go.

559
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,060
That's right.

560
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
What's wrong with you?

561
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
Look at the number of times he's been hit.

562
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
That's right.

563
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
What?

564
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
I was just taking pictures and talking to you.

565
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
What were you two doing?

566
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
What's wrong with you?

567
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
What's this?

568
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Remüryu.

569
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
Look at this.

570
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
I've been curious about this.

571
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
This is a movie.

572
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
What's this?

573
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Remüryu.

574
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
This is a movie.

575
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
What's this?

576
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
C.I.A.

577
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
What?

578
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
The police?

579
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,060
I should have said this first.

580
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,060
I was wrong.

581
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
All of it.

582
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
But give me time to talk about it.

583
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,060
Talk.

584
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,060
I've been wanting to come.

585
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I've been wanting to come, but I couldn't come.

586
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
If I were to come in front of you...

587
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
I'd rather be with you.

588
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,060
But somehow, I got the position in Remüryu and you said I couldn't.

589
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
What do you mean?

590
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,060
That was my choice.

591
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,060
I chose to quit Remüryu.

592
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
I told you everything.

593
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Yeonju.

594
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Can you stop?

595
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Yeonju, I...

596
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
You have to go home, Chef.

597
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Sir.

598
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
This is the exit.

599
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
You said you'd kill me if I'm late.

600
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
You have to go home, Chef.

601
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Goodbye.

602
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I missed you.

603
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
No.

604
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
It's me.

605
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Who's the one who wants to kill you?

606
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
Well...

607
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I...

608
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
I did it.

609
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Do you know what you did?

610
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
I'm going to tell you...

611
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,060
I've been trying to get you out of this.

612
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
I'm going to kill you.

613
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
I'm going to kill you.

614
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
I'm going to kill you.

615
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
I'm going to kill you.

616
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
I'm going to kill you.

617
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Please let me take the responsibility.

618
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,060
I'll take the responsibility and quit the job.

619
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,060
It's okay.

620
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
It's okay.

621
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,060

You two are a perfect match.

721
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,520
It was the first time that my parents liked my food.

725
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,520
It's the first time that my parents like my food.

726
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,520
It's a great food.

727

00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,520
I'm not going to the movies today.

747
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I'm going to have dinner.

748
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,520
There are many good restaurants here.

749
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Go and eat.

750
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520

751
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520

I'll clean up and go home.

754
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
You go first.

755
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,520
I told you to work.

756
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I'm not going to work alone.

757
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
I'm going to work alone.

758
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
I told you to work alone.

759
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
I need your help.

760
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,520
It's okay.

761
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
No, I'll help you.

762
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
It's okay.

763
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
I'll be there by 9.

764
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Go ahead.

765
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
It's good.

766
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
There's no pepperoni.

767
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,520
It's good.

768
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,520
It's a coincidence.

769
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Why do I think I cooked for you?

770
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Here...

771
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Here, too.

772
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,520
I'm cooking for you.

773
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,520
I'm cooking for you.

774
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
I'm cooking for you.

775
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,520
What does that mean?

776
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,520
You might not remember,

777
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,520
but we always cooked this with leftover cheese.

778
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,520
We ate more than 100 times.

779
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
You and my food, too.

780
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
It changed a lot.

781
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,520
So, let's not meet anymore.

782
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,520
I just want you to be fine.

783
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,520
No, I remember everything.

784
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,520
We ate a lot without any food.

785
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,520
That's when we ate the stem.

786
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,520
I came out of the front of my choice.

787
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
I'm your mother.

788
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,520
Yes.

789
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
I was wrong.

790
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,520
I was wrong.

791
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,520
You never even contacted me.

792
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
I told you. I have a reason to do that.

793
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
I don't want to know anymore.

794
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
Yeonju.

795
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,520
I don't want to know about you anymore.

796
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,520
I don't want to be your mother.

797
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Do you know how much I loved Muri?

798
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,520
I respected and loved her so much.

799
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
I did it all for you.

800
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,520
Yes.

801
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,520
I'm missing you and the teacher you respected.

802
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,520
We don't have anything different because we're talking like this.

803
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
Let's stop talking.

804
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,520
You can go back to the past.

805
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
You can change.

806
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
I'm sorry.

807
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
I should have come with you.

808
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Are you okay?

809
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Yes.

810
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,520
I'm sorry to bother you.

811
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,520
I'm sorry.

812
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
What are you going to do?

813
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Do you know what this is?

814
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Be quiet and follow me.

815
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Where are you going?

816
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
I'm tired.

817
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,520
I'm here.

818
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
I can't go on a date.

819
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,520
You can't go on a rooftop date.

820
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Ta-da.

821
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Why are you crying?

822
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,520
You're a small kid.

823
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
Small kid?

824
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,520
This is not a rooftop movie.

825
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,520
I'm going to spend some money.

826
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Don't worry about money.

827
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,520
I'm a big deal.

828
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
I'm going to make a living.

829
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,520
You want me to borrow my rooftop?

830
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Yes, yes.

831
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
My god.

832
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,520
It's not easy to love.

833
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,520
I made my wife's house.

834
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,520
Love is a good thing.

835
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
What?

836
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
What?

837
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,520
I have a personal account.

838
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
How did you do this?

839
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,520
I like to write a good book.

840
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,520
What?

841
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,520
What?

842
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,520
What?

843
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
What kind of life did you have?

844
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,520
I'm going to go on a trip to Hanuk Village.

845
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,520
What's the theme of the date?

846
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,520
I thought you'd ride a helicopter or a helicopter.

847
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,520
You can ride it.

848
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,520
But do you remember the movie?

849
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,520
I don't know.

850
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,520
I don't know.

851
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,520
I don't know.

852
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,520
I don't know.

853
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
I don't know.

854
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,520
I don't know.

855
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Why don't you ask?

856
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,520
What?

857
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,520
Who is he?

858
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,520
What kind of relationship is he?

859
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,520
I don't care about that.

860
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,520
Well, I'll tell you later.

861
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Maybe later.

862
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Right?

863
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,520
I don't have a parents.

864
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
What?

865
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,520
What?

866
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:06,520
I heard that you went to a man's house when you were young.

867
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,520
So you remember when you were young.

868
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,960
Mountains, trees,

869
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,520
me, the monks, all of them.

870
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,520
I was old and I liked cooking.

871
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,520
I ate with that.

872
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,520
And I studied in the CIA and went to Japan.

873
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,520
The glass you know.

874
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
The glass you don't know.

875
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,520
I met you there, Jung Min.

876
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,520
I liked you a lot.

877
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,520
I've never been so kind to you.

878
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
I see.

879
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,520
But I didn't want to know that.

880
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,520
Anyway, we're separated now.

881
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,520
So why did you come?

882
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,520
I came back to Mury.

883
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,520
Are you going?

884
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
Where are you going?

885
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,520
It's going well with our restaurant.

886
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,520
I'm going to the restaurant.

887
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,520
The restaurant looks like we're all going to eat.

888
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,520
I'm going to the restaurant.

889
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,520
Where are you going?

890
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
What are you talking about?

891
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
You went to Sapporo?

892
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,520
Yes.

893
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,520
You left the restaurant with us.

894
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,520
You didn't even brush your nose in the morning.

895
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,520
I was just preparing for business.

896
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,520
There's this in the kitchen.

897
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,520
I'm going to Sapporo because I have something urgent to do.

898
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,520
I'm going to leave the new kitchen to you for a while.

899
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,520
I'm sorry for leaving a short letter because there's no change.

900
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,520
It's a four o'clock flight.

901
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,520
I'll wait.

902
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,520
I'm going to the restaurant.

903
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,520
We can't believe this.

904
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
I'll show you my ability.

905
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
I can do it!

906
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
What are you talking about?

907
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,520
He brought all the gas here.

908
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
We can all be in trouble.

909
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,520
What is this?

910
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
Do you want to do it with me?

911
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
Let's find it.

912
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,520
Let's do whatever it takes.

913
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Stop!

914
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,520
I missed you!

915
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
You're trying to cross the line.

916
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,520
We crossed the line.

917
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
I'm sorry.
