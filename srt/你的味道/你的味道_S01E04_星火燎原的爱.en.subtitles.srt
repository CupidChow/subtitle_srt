1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,188
BAEKSU INN

3
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,523
This is why I like you, Director Han.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,069
You like me?

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,529
Did you hurt your head on the way here?

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,822
What are you doing there?

7
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,414
You clocked off already?

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,125
It's so early though.

9
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,753
Why are you stuttering
like I caught you stealing?

10
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,671
Who is she?

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,178
Why do you care? Keep quiet.

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,059
Oh, is she the one
you're trying to prey on this time?

13
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,270
Who is she?

14
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,480
My ex-girlfriend.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,985
-"Ex-girlfriend"?
-"Ex-girlfriend"?

16
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,366
Yeah.

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,913
Shall we continue
what we were talking about?

18
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,377
I hate that you're obsessing over me
and following me around.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,753
How did you find me here?

20
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,673
Keep this up, and my feelings for you
will be gone completely!

21
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,758
What the hell are you saying?

22
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,345
Is this the person who left you
for your older brother?

23
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,471
That's not what happened.

24
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,056
What? His brother?

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,975
You need me to remind you
why I don't like you?

26
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,103
You act like you're something
when you have zero talent.

27
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,771
I can't stand that at all.

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,691
Actually, no. It's just the fact
that you eat and breathe.

29
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,110
That alone makes me sick!

30
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,779
Get lost!

31
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,041
Excuse me.

32
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,462
Do you even know

33
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,965
who this guy is and what he does?

34
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,259
I'll figure that out for myself.

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,263
The ex-girlfriend can stay out of it.

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,188
I'm not his ex-girlfriend!

37
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,609
-He preys on and betrays innocent people!
-Stop! That's enough!

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,028
-He's known for it!
-Enough! No!

39
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,405
-Damn you.
-"Damn you"?

40
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,950
This is exactly it. Your temper.

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,871
Let's hash out
our personal issues in private.

42
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,331
Without other people around.

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,665
Follow me.

44
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,668
-What are you doing?
-Just come with me.

45
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,211
Go home and rest.

46
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,547
Good work today, as always.

47
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,009
Hurry up.

48
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,844
We'll talk over there.

49
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,390
Happy now?

50
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,516
She's not here.

51
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,396
So who's that country bumpkin?

52
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,440
What does she do?

53
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,733
It's none of your business.

54
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,528
What do you want? Go away already.

55
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,866
There's no way you came all the way here
to con someone like that.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,410
Out with it.

57
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,247
If you don't tell me, I'll ask her myself.

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,331
Oh, come on.

59
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,335
She's a chef, okay?

60
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,545
A chef?

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,965
Yeah, a chef.

62
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,551
She's much better at cooking
and much more skilled than you.

63
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,095
Okay? Are you done now?

64
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,848
Now leave.

65
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,018
How the heck did she know I was here?

66
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,611
TASTEFULLY YOURS

67
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,494
I'll figure that out for myself.

68
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,707
The ex-girlfriend can stay out of it.

69
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,262
I was just worried.

70
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,977
You were getting rained on.

71
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,701
If it bothered her
that my shoulders were getting wet,

72
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,620
she should've said she was worried about
my shoulder getting wet.

73
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,914
"Shoulders." She should've
added a subject to her sentence.

74
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,125
That way I'd get it right away.

75
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,960
I got butterflies over nothing.

76
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,004
Wait, what? Butterflies?

77
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,589
Me? Get butterflies? Please.

78
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,180
My bad.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,486
BAEKSU INN

80
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,616
I heard you scream like crazy last night.
Did you lose your mind at last?

81
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,286
Oh jeez! What the heck?

82
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,662
Is this real? What's happening?

83
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,790
What do you think I am? I'm a person.

84
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,666
I mean, what are you…

85
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,878
What are you doing in my house?

86
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,213
This is your house?

87
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,049
You talked about
investing in my restaurant and whatnot.

88
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,510
Your Hansang business card
was a fake, wasn't it?

89
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,305
What? Have you ever even seen
a business card from a large corporation?

90
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,099
You know, back in Seoul,
I'm the kind of person--

91
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,226
-Just get ready for the festival.
-Darn you.

92
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,062
Damn it.

93
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,064
What's happening?

94
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,944
Oh right.

95
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,196
Her room burned down too.

96
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,744
Why did he get so freaked out?

97
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,705
My skin got it worse than him.

98
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,342
I look much better now.

99
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,977
Man, look at these two.

100
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,104
This female crab likes this male crab.

101
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,106
They're all female crabs.

102
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:31,617
Things were a bit hectic yesterday,
weren't they?

103
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,539
Even if she likes me that--

104
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,418
Even if she likes me that much,
how could she come all the way here?

105
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,502
How inappropriate.

106
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,795
Did you see her off?

107
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,508
Why? Why do you ask?

108
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,386
Are you bothered and worried?

109
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,513
Worried?

110
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,141
Are you?

111
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,768
Something must be wrong with your head.

112
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,106
Not me.

113
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,029
There's a saying that goes,
"Pretty face, poor fate."

114
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739
So…

115
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,075
That saying was basically made for me.

116
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,620
The eyes are rotten.

117
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,997
The eyes are completely rotten.

118
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,415
Are you listening to me?

119
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,217
Since it's a festival,

120
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,845
we should make something everyone likes
and something easy to eat.

121
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,598
Steak?

122
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,226
You think they'd want to
use a knife at a festival?

123
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,271
Meat for soup.

124
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,066
LA galbi.

125
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,275
Bulgogi.

126
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,697
There's something called cube steak.

127
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,200
Our company's best-selling lunchbox
is the one with cube steak.

128
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,369
You said we should make something
everyone likes.

129
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,287
Yeah, meat.

130
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,164
Or chicken?

131
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,167
Everyone likes chicken,
regardless of religion or nationality.

132
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,252
No?

133
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,340
How about pork?
Jambon-beurre sounds good.

134
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,758
It doesn't.

135
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,638
You don't like this, you don't like that.

136
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,848
Not this, not that.

137
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,684
Let's sell gimbap then.

138
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,941
Yeah, gimbap.

139
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,569
Gimbap!

140
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,905
Gimbap sounds great!

141
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,158
Gim… Gimbap? Gim…

142
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,786
You like that idea?

143
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,040
You like the painfully common gimbap
that has zero competitiveness?

144
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,377
Okay, fine. Gimbap. Okay.

145
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,505
But what's at the heart of a festival?

146
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,882
Taking photos and romanticizing memories.

147
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,387
Gimbap with sweet shrimp,
sea urchin, tuna…

148
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,056
We need to use unique ingredients
to make people say,

149
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,602
"Hey, this is so unique," and take photos,
buy the food, and post it for PR--

150
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,687
Wait, 35,000 won for ten sheets?

151
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,105
Put that down.

152
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,982
It's too expensive. We can't get this.

153
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,817
TAEAN GAMTAE

154
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,444
It's expensive.

155
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,446
Welcome. What would you like?

156
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,367
I'd like about 100 sheets
of Neopdo Island dried laver for gimbap.

157
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,661
Neopdo Island dried laver is 35,000 won.

158
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,414
What? This is 35,000 won too?

159
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,667
We're not buying gamtae.

160
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,961
Right.

161
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,887
You're just a pretty face.

162
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,646
You know,
I'm asking you this just in case.

163
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,897
You're not

164
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,733
going to do something ridiculous
like only put carrots in it, are you?

165
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,026
I'll put in rice and egg too.

166
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,657
It's a festival. Who would buy gimbap
made with just the basic ingredients?

167
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,992
I guess a few people might.

168
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,204
Let's say we sell 100 rolls.
We'll only make two million won, if that.

169
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,540
We need to add something special
to up the unit price

170
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,334
for a better profit margin.

171
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,213
Do you think fancy ingredients like tuna
and sea urchin make everything tasty?

172
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,343
What I'm saying is,
you don't like what just looks fancy.

173
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,969
So let's make the stuffing fancy.

174
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,764
People might buy that once but not twice.

175
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,934
You don't know anything.

176
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,396
The percentage of returning customers
isn't important at a festival.

177
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,648
Whatever the job,
you must do the basics well.

178
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,691
That goes for gimbap too.

179
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,527
Got that?

180
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,286
Mic test.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

181
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,956
-Put the chairs over here.
-Mic test. One, two, three.

182
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,332
-Yes, that's right.
-One, two, three.

183
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,502
My goodness. Is this it?
Is this the truck we'll be using?

184
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,006
Yeah. We're just renting it temporarily.

185
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,844
Goodness me.

186
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,807
-Go slow.
-It's so hectic.

187
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,686
Well, it's okay.

188
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,563
It's not like we'll drive around in it.

189
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,856
That's right.

190
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,900
Myung-sook,
vintage is all the rage these days.

191
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,277
Look carefully, okay?

192
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
Do you see the rust here?

193
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,448
See how sturdy this…

194
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,919
Damn it! It just can't scrub it off!

195
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,254
-Myung-sook.
-Jeez.

196
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,799
Step aside. I'll take care of this.

197
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,092
-Go take a break.
-Don't touch me.

198
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,760
Come on. Let me do it.

199
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,262
You mean this?

200
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,681
What's gotten into you?
Are you about to die or something?

201
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,518
By the way, Myung-sook,

202
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,855
why did you switch to this restaurant?

203
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,732
I did some thinking

204
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,568
and realized my life
had been without change.

205
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,112
Once something was decided,
I just went with the flow.

206
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,240
That's why I worked at your
gukbap restaurant for over 15 years.

207
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,039
But now that I'm in my forties
and it feels like half my life's gone,

208
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,000
I wanted to change something
before I died.

209
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
Change what?

210
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,922
Are you drunk?

211
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,257
Are you?

212
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,386
I want to be that thing called a chef.

213
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,804
-A chef?
-Be quiet!

214
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,765
-It's a secret!
-Myung-sook! You want to be a chef?

215
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,975
-Why didn't you say so sooner?
-What about a chef? She's here.

216
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,602
-Hello, Chef!
-She says…

217
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,895
She's here.

218
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,355
Wait.

219
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,940
Is this what you rented?

220
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,903
Is this truck even allowed
to be on the road?

221
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,656
It is. Do you see the vintage look?

222
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,783
It's fine as long as it's clean
and there's a cooking station.

223
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,995
Exactly. Even cafes these days
have an exposed concrete finish.

224
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,414
You're extremely trendy
when it comes to that.

225
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,542
Choon-seung,
the sides need some scrubbing.

226
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,043
-Okay.
-Focus on that.

227
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,545
-Okay!
-And back here too.

228
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,173
ONGOEUL YOUTH FOOD FESTA

229
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,884
DAY ONE

230
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,848
Lots of people.

231
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,519
-Good vibes.
-Hold the other end.

232
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,895
Yeah, that's it.

233
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,647
Fresh morning air.

234
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,565
HANSANG FOOD FIELD

235
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,816
Oh, Hansang.

236
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,948
HANSANG FOOD FIELD

237
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,074
Wait, is this…

238
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,702
Hansang…

239
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,749
-Are you in charge?
-Yes.

240
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,127
Hansang Food Field. Is that for real?

241
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,589
What kind of festival gets a new sponsor
the day it starts?

242
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,840
I know, right?

243
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,259
But we accomplished the impossible.

244
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,635
We did it!

245
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,388
Yes, okay.

246
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,682
You did great.

247
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,059
-But why, of all places, is Hansang--
-Why else?

248
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,272
Collaborating with smaller regional cities

249
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,025
aligns perfectly
with our company's vision.

250
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,943
Plus, this is the town of flavor.

251
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,779
Collaborating with Jeonju came naturally.

252
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,864
Right.

253
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,657
"The town of flavor"?

254
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,202
Why is the guy
who hates leaving Seoul doing all this?

255
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,164
-Who? Me?
-Just be honest.

256
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,082
Say you're here to screw me over.

257
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,168
You need to get your egomania treated.

258
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,463
So what?
How will Hansang sponsor this festival?

259
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,174
Why not increase the prize money
for the food truck contest?

260
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,345
All you talk about is money.
Then again, you're a money-hungry bastard.

261
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,848
How much do you want?

262
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,019
I just realized
how pathetic that line sounds.

263
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,480
So this is how Mo Yeon-joo must've felt.

264
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,607
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,986
Did you hear that? The rich company
is dying to spend its money.

266
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,282
First place can have a measly
ten million won.

267
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,576
-Ten…
-What? Ten million won?

268
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,915
If you increase the prize money,
the competition would be worth the watch.

269
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,292
We have a team participating as well.

270
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,337
If you want to win the prize money,
you'd better try hard.

271
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
Wait.

272
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,841
You? La Lecel is participating?

273
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,679
Ten million won.

274
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,597
Don't you worry.

275
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,397
JUNGJAE

276
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
HEALTHY JUNGJAE CARROT GIMBAP
FULL OF ORGANIC CARROTS

277
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,359
That should do.

278
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,408
Finally, it looks pretty decent.

279
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,202
I thought you were into vintage
and exposed concrete.

280
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,621
Man, it looks so cool.

281
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,500
Our truck is the coolest one here!

282
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,626
-It is.
-Hooray!

283
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,920
Come on.
Let's do a group cheer or something.

284
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,755
-Yeah, let's do that.
-One, two, three!

285
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,215
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

286
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,509
Let's move faster.

287
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,389
NEXT KOREAN CUISINE AMBASSADOR
CHEF JANG YOUNG-HYE'S SPECIAL

288
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,391
What's all that?

289
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,809
-There's one more of mine.
-Right.

290
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,020
"Korean cuisine ambassador
Jang Young-hye"?

291
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,398
So she cooks.

292
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,736
Do you know her?

293
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,696
I don't know her well.

294
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,865
But he does.

295
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,215
NEXT KOREAN CUISINE AMBASSADOR
CHEF JANG YOUNG-HYE

296
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,341
Sorry.

297
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,635
Hey.

298
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,012
I missed you like crazy.

299
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
I get what Han Sun-woo's doing.

300
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,893
But what are you--

301
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,645
Chef Jang Young-hye.
Why are you doing this?

302
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
What do you want?

303
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,900
-I want to confirm.
-Confirm what?

304
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,610
What you said the other day.

305
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,236
What I said?

306
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,988
Yeah, a chef.

307
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,533
She's much better at cooking
and much more skilled than you.

308
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,910
Okay?

309
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,038
You dare hurt my pride?

310
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,416
You said she was a better cook

311
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,085
than me.

312
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,338
-We'll put the seaweed roll right here.
-Why won't this come off?

313
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:16,637
Wait, so you brought these people
and equipment all the way from Seoul

314
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:22,518
just to confirm something
as silly as that?

315
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,977
What's this? A sous vide machine?

316
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,481
Do you really think that suits this place?

317
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,111
It's all way too much.

318
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,113
Why have you become so pathetic?

319
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,864
What? Pathetic?

320
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,741
Where do you want this?

321
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,704
Hey. What are you doing here?

322
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,750
Are you doing well, sir?

323
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,961
Forget how I'm doing. Why are you here?

324
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,256
A salaried worker has no say.
I must obey the one who pays me.

325
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,507
I'm the one who pays…

326
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,592
I pay you.

327
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,389
To be precise, Chairman Han pays me.

328
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,308
-Chairman Han? Why you…
-Why are you doing this to me?

329
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,685
This is workplace harassment.

330
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,938
You're harassing my whole life right now,
you disloyal little…

331
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,608
guy.

332
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,152
You care a lot about loyalty, huh?

333
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,196
Whatever.

334
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,447
What, you scared?

335
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,535
If you are, give up and drop out.

336
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,120
"Scared"?

337
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,583
Do I look scared to you?

338
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,498
-Is it hot enough?
-Yes, Chef.

339
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,420
It's ready.

340
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,979
Try this.

341
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,066
Hey, what about me?

342
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,487
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

343
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,948
-Is it good?
-Yeah!

344
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,991
It's good.

345
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,618
It's a matter of time before we win.

346
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:50,123
We will now begin
the Ongoeul Youth Food Festa Contest.

347
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,003
Delicious carrot gimbap is in town.

348
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,881
Hello, welcome. Go on your way.

349
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,050
Come this way.

350
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,427
-People are starting to flock in.
-We have carrot gimbap.

351
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,721
-Come on!
-Everywhere but our truck.

352
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,724
Where the heck did Beom-woo go?

353
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,227
He must be helping his ex-girlfriend.

354
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,020
Ex-girlfriend?

355
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,022
What?

356
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,942
That fancy truck belongs to
Beom-woo's ex-girlfriend?

357
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,194
-What?
-Two duck confit.

358
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,362
Two duck confit.

359
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,571
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

360
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,244
-They have gimbap here.
-Welcome!

361
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,496
-Welcome!
-Would you like gimbap?

362
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,206
We came all the way here
and you want gimbap?

363
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,794
-There are lots of other good food.
-Gimbap is a steady seller.

364
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,087
Buy a couple to taste it.

365
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,339
-Everyone who's tried it loved it.
-That's right.

366
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,049
I don't like carrots.

367
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,176
-You don't?
-You don't? Want to go eat meat?

368
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,303
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

369
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,430
I'm sorry. My kid doesn't like carrots.

370
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,890
So what, you're just never
going to feed it to him?

371
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,935
-All right, all right. Calm down.
-My goodness.

372
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,146
Why do we have no customers at all?

373
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,981
Excuse me! Coming through.

374
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,524
Hey, take these.

375
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:01,445
Catch them. Don't let them fall.

376
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,571
What's all that?

377
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,948
GAMTAE, NEOPDO ISLAND DRIED LAVER

378
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,033
Gamtae?

379
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
Beef?

380
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,579
How did you pay for all this?

381
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,664
Overdraft.

382
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,750
I'll recoup it
when we get the prize money.

383
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,126
You overdrafted your bank account?

384
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,669
You doofus!

385
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,173
They'll hold a taste vote
to decide the winner.

386
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,134
Didn't I tell you
we should stick to the basics?

387
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,137
Hansang became the sponsor
and doubled the prize money.

388
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,847
-What? It doubled?
-Doubled?

389
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,975
All right.

390
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,270
Shouldn't we put more thought
into our menu selection if we want to win?

391
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,606
What? "Jambon gamtae gimbap"?

392
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,109
You went to more trouble than necessary
just to win the contest?

393
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,319
Ten million won.

394
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,739
The prize money
is a whopping ten million won.

395
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,991
I think it was worth the trouble

396
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,993
if it was for the ten million won.

397
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,829
-It was completely, absolutely worth it!
-Exactly.

398
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,123
Now look over there.

399
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,126
Do you see that fancy truck
that's over the top?

400
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,338
Do you see the people lined up or not?

401
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,839
I see them.

402
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,674
It's your ex-girlfriend's truck.

403
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,556
You told them about that already?

404
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,059
She's not my ex.
She's not my ex-girlfriend, okay?

405
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,353
-Sure, sure.
-Enough. Forget about all that.

406
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,481
They're selling duck confit lunchboxes
with five garnishes.

407
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,817
Duck con… Garn… What did you say?

408
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,277
Do you think confit suits this place?

409
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,362
No, right?

410
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,115
It doesn't suit this place.

411
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,616
So why are they selling it?

412
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,328
They need to sell something like that
so people will line up out of curiosity.

413
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,788
I think he's got a point.

414
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:39,126
I think we should go ahead
and switch our menu.

415
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,336
-What do I do? Set out the beef?
-That's right, Myung-sook.

416
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,880
-Go ahead. Set it out.
-Right on it!

417
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,049
-So they're easy to open.
-Got it.

418
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,468
-Get to it.
-Here, take this.

419
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,929
-Take this too.
-Now I'm here for some gimbap.

420
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,142
You must be influencers.

421
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,227
-One beef gimbap, please.
-Yes, of course.

422
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,562
-He's the owner.
-That's me.

423
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,729
Say hi to my subscribers.

424
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,148
Hi, guys.

425
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,399
Just a moment.

426
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,235
Do you see the empty table over there?
You can sit there and wait.

427
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,654
-Wait just a little bit.
-I'm getting excited.

428
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,948
Did you see that?

429
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,367
This is what people want.

430
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,411
You get what I'm saying now?

431
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,873
Ten million won is enough
to cover our interior cost and debt.

432
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,834
Forget it all. Ten million will cover it.

433
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,421
-Where's the gamtae from?
-It's from Taean, of course.

434
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,549
The ham is from Mount Jiri
and the beef is from Mawon Farm.

435
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,468
Come on, I'm Han Beom-woo.

436
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,138
I'll let you off because I don't want to
waste the ingredients.

437
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,725
Please wait.

438
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,809
Okay.

439
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,895
Thanks.

440
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,448
Why are you so clueless?

441
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,992
I need to at least
work as a double agent, don't I?

442
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,160
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

443
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,246
Do I believe this punk or not?

444
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,980
Cut it diagonally.

445
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,732
-Diagonally? I'll cut two.
-Yeah.

446
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,820
You wrapped it with the beef
instead of putting it inside?

447
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,197
-I'll put the sauce on top.
-Go ahead.

448
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,573
This is mala sauce.

449
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,702
And this is peri sauce.

450
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,997
Here.

451
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,374
Can we taste it?

452
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,708
Here I go.

453
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,174
Is it okay?

454
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,677
How is it?

455
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,600
This will sell. I'm sure of it.

456
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,726
It will!

457
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,312
Okay, everyone. Jungjae's open!

458
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,647
-Open!
-Open!

459
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,275
-We're open!
-Come on over!

460
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,651
Come and have some beef!

461
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,152
Is it done?

462
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,862
-It's done!
-Come on!

463
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,490
We have beef-rolled gimbap!
Come and have some!

464
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,242
All right, my Tasties.

465
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,410
Do you see this?

466
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,786
Do you?

467
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,496
POOR GOURMET

468
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,292
The beef is wrapped gently
around the gimbap.

469
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,835
It's such a charming dish.

470
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,336
-Jambon gamtae.
-Free samples.

471
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,880
-Two jambon gamtae!
-Two gamtae.

472
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,300
So what do you think? Isn't it good?

473
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,525
The main menu of our two Diamant-star
Chef Young-hye's food truck

474
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,069
is the duck confit set.

475
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,449
The duck was aged in extra virgin oil
and duck fat at a low temperature

476
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,284
for around six hours,
making it very tender.

477
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,957
Please form a line and move slowly.
We're taking orders.

478
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,584
You can move forward.

479
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,669
Please go
to the back of that line, please.

480
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,254
Please step forward.

481
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,673
Please wait. The food will be ready soon.

482
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,343
-Make it crispier.
-Yes, Chef.

483
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,471
-How is it? Is it good?
-Yeah, it's good.

484
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,640
-It's so tender. Try it.
-Is it?

485
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,309
It's so good.

486
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,483
It takes someone special
to get two Diamant stars.

487
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,736
Get over here before the confit sells out.

488
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,906
It's delicious. Isn't this great?

489
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,074
Enjoy the food.

490
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,452
One beef, one jambon!

491
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,041
Chef Jang, say hi to my subscribers!

492
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:57,050
ONGOEUL YOUTH FOOD FESTA
TASTE VOTING

493
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,807
Who ordered the beef rolls?

494
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,683
Two beef rolls, one jambon gamtae.

495
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,477
Two beef rolls, one jambon gamtae!

496
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,396
-We can't.
-What?

497
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,398
We can only serve two more gamtae gimbap.

498
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,233
What? Why can't you serve more?

499
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,485
Why do you think?
We're out of ingredients.

500
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,237
I'm so sorry.

501
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,031
-We're out of ingredients? For real?
-We're out of ingredients.

502
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,658
I'm sorry. Come back tomorrow.

503
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,618
-Thanks. Come back tomorrow.
-They're gone!

504
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,412
We're out of ingredients.
What she's making is it.

505
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,539
-We sold out? We did?
-We sold out!

506
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,290
-Myung-sook!
-We sold out!

507
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,586
Good job! Well done!

508
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,714
We sold out!

509
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,850
-Yes!
-Come over here!

510
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,481
-Well done.
-We sold out.

511
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,943
Chef, we're so behind on orders.

512
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,236
When will ours be ready?

513
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,613
I'm really sorry. Please wait a bit.

514
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,574
I'm sorry. Please wait.

515
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,784
-Let's just go.
-Let's eat something else.

516
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,994
How much longer will it take?

517
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,954
About ten minutes.

518
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,205
Let's speed things up.

519
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,248
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

520
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,962
What are they doing?

521
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,592
I don't know. Did they drop out already?

522
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,519
CLOSING EARLY

523
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,442
-Are you serious?
-Well, gimbap is made and eaten quickly.

524
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,818
It's much less work too.

525
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:44,240
Duck confit is a bit much for a festival,
but it is high-class.

526
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,335
Has he really lost his mind?

527
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,544
Watch your head.

528
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,923
One, two, three.

529
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,259
Goodness, I'm aching all over.

530
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,845
Running a food truck is tougher
than working in a kitchen.

531
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,390
It's a smaller kitchen, and it takes time
to get used to the new setting.

532
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,852
But we're the only truck out here
that closed early.

533
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,145
Yeah!

534
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:17,106
That's right.
And who should you thank for that?

535
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,150
Me, of course.

536
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,655
I prepped and organized
all the ingredients in that tiny space.

537
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,115
I bet I'm the fastest worker
in the neighborhood.

538
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,283
No, that's nonsense.

539
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,245
You saw me, right?
I was running all over the place.

540
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,747
Excuse me.
Who came up with the gimbap idea?

541
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,665
I did.

542
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,959
-Even so, the person prepping…
-I brought all the ingredients…

543
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,919
Hey, at the end of the day,

544
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,464
would the gimbap have sold
if it didn't taste good?

545
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,970
She's harder to put up with
than I thought.

546
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,513
-I know, right?
-What?

547
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,723
No, I'm just kidding.

548
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,017
If we do well tomorrow
and win the ten million won,

549
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,145
will you give me a raise?

550
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,230
Forget your pay.

551
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,232
Let's get together for a staff dinner!

552
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,276
-How's that?
-Goodness gracious.

553
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,610
We have to repair the kitchen first.

554
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,279
Yeah, that's right.

555
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,489
We'll redo the interior
and pay off the debt first.

556
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,740
Right? Did I say the right thing?

557
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,741
Yeah.

558
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,243
Put your hands here.

559
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,204
Hands downward on three and say "Jungjae."
One, two, three.

560
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,289
-Jungjae!
-Jungjae!

561
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,290
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

562
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,499
-Let's go home!
-Yes, yes!

563
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,334
Choon-seung, put these away.

564
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,295
-Take them around back and stack them up.
-Enjoy your food.

565
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,131
-Stack them up nicely.
-Have gimbap tomorrow. They're good.

566
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,215
Yes, yes!

567
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,261
Good work.

568
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,977
The contest ends tomorrow, so I promise--

569
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,981
You're more shameless than I thought,
Chef Jang.

570
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,652
"Shameless"?

571
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,906
I didn't ask you to take part.

572
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,075
You insisted. It was your idea.

573
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,539
You can't come back
with this kind of result.

574
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,668
That's why I said I'll win tomorrow.

575
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,011
You'll have a guest to help you tomorrow.

576
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,596
A guest?

577
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,683
You're not yet capable of being
a Korean cuisine ambassador.

578
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,199
You're a jerk.

579
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,339
What should we sell tomorrow?

580
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,391
What's this?

581
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,976
A lighter?

582
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,853
Why is this in the kitchen?

583
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,570
You came here first thing in the morning?
How forward of you.

584
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,738
"Forward"?

585
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,990
Never mind.

586
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,784
What's up?
You want to head to work together?

587
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,788
What's this?

588
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:22,291
Did I or did I not say I'd behead you
if you smoked near the restaurant?

589
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,420
Me? I never smoked near the restaurant.

590
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,213
Then what was this doing in the kitchen?

591
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,298
It's yours.

592
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,135
It's not mine. It was in the kitchen?

593
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,887
-It's really not yours?
-It's not.

594
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,640
I don't recognize this.
Isn't it Choon-seung's?

595
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,642
You'll lose your head
if I catch you smoking.

596
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,145
Excuse me. It wasn't me, okay?

597
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,897
Hurry up already.

598
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,276
What does this say? Para…

599
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,863
A 02 regional code?

600
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,034
ONGOEUL YOUTH FOOD FESTA

601
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,539
DAY TWO

602
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:15,011
Ongoeul Youth Food Festa's sponsor Hansang
has invited a singer to perform for us.

603
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,763
He's here.

604
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,307
It's the trot special forces, Park Koon!

605
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,433
Hello, everyone.

606
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,772
I'm trot singer Park Koon,
ex-special forces, made of steel.

607
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,524
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-A round of applause!

608
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,362
Hello, everyone.

609
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,822
It's Park Koon!

610
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,289
Welcome to Food Festa
sponsored by Hansang.

611
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,291
March ahead, march ahead.

612
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,711
-"Do Not U Turn." Music, please.
-Park Koon the singer?

613
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,858
Is that the real trot singer Park Koon?

614
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,529
I want his autograph on a photo card.

615
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,614
Pull yourselves together.

616
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,282
He's an enemy.

617
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,120
Because I love you

618
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,665
Come to me, don't look back

619
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,502
He sings pretty well.
His voice is on a whole new level.

620
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,629
Celebrities are surely different.

621
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,051
TRY CHEF JANG'S JAMBON-BEURRE BAO BUN
AND GET PARK KOON'S AUTOGRAPH!

622
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,429
What's with the random fan signing event?
"Jambon-beurre"?

623
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,394
Because I love you

624
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,191
Love marches ahead

625
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,192
A guest, huh?

626
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,945
Hey, hey.

627
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,991
What's all that?

628
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,161
Park Koon? You hired him?

629
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
Are you kidding me?

630
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,914
Do you think I hired him?

631
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,208
Do you really think I hired him?

632
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,672
Han Sun-woo, that punk.

633
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,384
What about your menu? Are you serious?

634
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,553
You copied us? Where's your pride?

635
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,054
I didn't copy you.

636
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,723
Don't you know jambon-beurre
is popular these days?

637
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:28,311
It's nothing like your simple,
ugly gimbap.

638
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,437
Simple and ugly?

639
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,358
Just so you know,
I sold this at Motto last spring.

640
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,194
I'm the one who bought you that recipe.

641
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,070
I'm the one who made it and sold it.

642
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,780
Is it ethical for you to start selling

643
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,116
the exact same thing we did
right across from us?

644
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,075
No, it isn't!

645
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,453
So did you buy those recipes
because you're so ethical?

646
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,246
-Jang Young-hye!
-What?

647
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,542
Food has to be visually pleasing to--

648
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,962
Your food is bound to be ruined
if you care too much about how it looks.

649
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,923
-Why did you come over?
-Quit slacking off.

650
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,091
-I was about to head back.
-I heard.

651
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,430
So you're a chef too?

652
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,266
I didn't know
because you didn't look the part.

653
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,018
Do you cook with looks?

654
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,938
Did you even learn how to cook?

655
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:15,233
All sorts of nobodies
call themselves chefs these days.

656
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,442
Jang Young-hye.

657
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,695
We'll let our cooking do the talking
and determine who the real nobody is.

658
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,367
The food's ready.

659
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,705
Live your life properly.

660
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,500
Me? That came out of nowhere.

661
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,377
Chef Jang.

662
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,630
You should live properly too.

663
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,590
You get yourself straightened out!

664
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,010
Thank you, everyone.

665
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,722
I'll now head over
to Chef Jang Young-hye's food truck

666
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,683
for the meet-and-greet.

667
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,394
Let's all go together!

668
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,444
Hi. What's your name?

669
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,866
It looks like

670
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,078
it'll be a little tough for us today.

671
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,791
Just a little? We got stomped on.

672
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,794
Shut your mouth.

673
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,508
How about we switch up the menu
or something?

674
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,469
Why should we switch? We're the original.

675
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,055
Our Chef Mo's gimbap tastes way better.

676
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,390
Right?

677
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,684
He said "our."

678
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,979
When did you two become an item?

679
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,273
-Get to work if you have time for this.
-All right.

680
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,858
Wait, hang on.

681
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:43,529
How about we sell gimbap
with something on the side?

682
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,697
Wait here.

683
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,701
Non-alcoholic moju.

684
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,204
I made this
traditional fermented liquor myself

685
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,289
at the gukbap restaurant.

686
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,709
I threw in all kinds of
traditional medicinal herbs

687
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,712
and boiled it for hours
to make Choon-seung's moju.

688
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,340
You and your damn alcohol.

689
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,924
Put that away right now.

690
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,926
What's wrong with you? This isn't alcohol.

691
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,803
It's a non-alcoholic drink.

692
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,181
-Non-alcoholic, my ass. Put it away.
-Oh, come on.

693
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,517
Give it a taste. Just one sip.

694
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,603
Just try a glass.

695
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,063
I'm telling you, it's good.

696
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,024
Just don't ask for more.

697
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,192
Here.

698
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,027
-I don't want it!
-Come on!

699
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,868
So? How is it?

700
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,286
I thought you were a bum.

701
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,747
-What?
-I did too, but I guess not.

702
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,624
What? What does that mean?

703
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,044
Why on earth does this taste good?

704
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,088
It has a charm.

705
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,673
It does?

706
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,051
It's not bad, is it?

707
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,177
Wait here.

708
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,474
Move!

709
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,815
Let's hand this out for free.

710
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,944
Do you think
this is enough to beat Park Koon?

711
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,572
They're all going to that food truck
after getting an autograph.

712
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
Look over there.

713
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,370
Wait. I like the idea.
We can give this out for free.

714
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,874
But what it lacks is a name.

715
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,377
Do you sell regular gimbap?

716
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,213
I really enjoyed
your beef gimbap yesterday,

717
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,673
but I'm a little sick of it.

718
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,092
Everyone here sells weird gimbap.

719
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,469
I'll pay you the same price.

720
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,763
Can you make me some regular gimbap?

721
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,517
Yes, of course. Why not?

722
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,643
Wait right here.

723
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,478
I'll turn on my livestream
and come right back.

724
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
You're going to livestream it?

725
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,148
Let's go.

726
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,483
-Listen. I made this moju myself.
-What is it?

727
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,569
-The carrots.
-This is moju with tradition.

728
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,446
-You see,
-Regular gimbap.

729
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,782
I'm probably one of the first
among those my age to have made this.

730
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,033
Regular gimbap.

731
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,174
JUNGJAE SET
OG CARROT GIMBAP WITH SWEET MOJU

732
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,011
HOMEMADE NON-ALCOHOLIC MOJU
MADE WITH ALL KINDS OF MEDICINAL HERBS

733
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,141
This is what I'm talking about.
Gimbap should be simple.

734
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,935
I thought you said
you don't like carrot gimbap.

735
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,688
Taste it for yourself.
Try it before you say anything.

736
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,114
What the heck?

737
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,159
What did they do to the carrots?

738
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,203
The others keep adding stuff
to their gimbap

739
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,454
because they lack confidence.

740
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,914
Hey, it's good.

741
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,832
Simple is the best.

742
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,085
This is moju I made myself.

743
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
-It's moju?
-It's insanely good.

744
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,464
It's non-alcoholic.

745
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,508
Would you like some? Here you go.

746
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,343
Please help spread the word.

747
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,345
Number 221.

748
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,387
Number 221!

749
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,223
Choon-seung!

750
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,310
That's us.

751
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,812
-Enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

752
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,235
This tastes just like old-school gimbap.

753
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,821
It's like the one I had on sports day
in elementary school

754
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,365
with sweet and spicy fried chicken.

755
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,243
They must sell gimbap for a living.

756
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,538
The gamtae one was good and so is this.
It's no ordinary gimbap.

757
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,873
Oh, we're not a gimbap restaurant.

758
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,583
We have a variety of dishes.

759
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,710
-Nearby?
-Yes.

760
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:30,047
-Here's our business card.
-A business card?

761
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,340
Please help spread the word about us.

762
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,968
There's a sticker board over there.
Please put one under our name.

763
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,636
Here's the poster. I made it.

764
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,763
Oh, of course.

765
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,640
-Thank you.
-Let's go to the sticker board.

766
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,351
-Spread the word.
-Come again!

767
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,478
Congratulations, you two.

768
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,355
Congratulations.

769
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,691
We'll take two rolls of gimbap
to celebrate.

770
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,526
What are we celebrating?

771
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,737
You two are expecting a baby.

772
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,823
-Right?
-How nice.

773
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,784
We heard you took part
to earn money for baby formula.

774
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,035
That's admirable.

775
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,079
What? A baby?

776
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,540
The two of us?

777
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,749
-Yes.
-Yes, your baby.

778
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,750
Said who?

779
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,294
-Someone over there.
-From over there.

780
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,879
Let's help the hardworking newlyweds!

781
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,090
For the newlyweds.

782
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,883
Love is in the air.

783
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,343
But they can't buy formula.

784
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,054
Oh dear! They can't do
without money for formula.

785
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,098
Even their nickname
for the baby is "Gimbap."

786
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,100
Have those two
completely lost their minds?

787
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,226
Is it not true?

788
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:25,811
No?

789
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,022
-It's true.
-Right?

790
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,609
-It is. We need money for formula.
-Hey, you…

791
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,194
-Two rolls of gimbap.
-Okay. Please wait here.

792
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,571
All right.

793
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,077
Come on over. Where to?

794
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,454
To the gimbap truck.

795
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,623
-One gimbap and two cups of moju.
-Sure.

796
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,041
-One gimbap, two moju.
-Thank you.

797
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,208
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

798
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,420
-Three rolls of gimbap, please.
-Sure thing.

799
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,797
I heard the baby's nickname is "Gimbap."

800
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,923
Congratulations.

801
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,971
Gimbap's mommy,
three more rolls of gimbap.

802
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,890
"Mommy Gimbap."

803
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,016
Two rolls of gimbap?

804
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,018
Here you go.

809

-One, two, three, four, five…
-You can do it!

810
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,724
It's tasty.

811
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,892
It's good.

812
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,562
Bravo.

-What the heck?
-Congratulations to both teams.

876
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,943
Anyone would know
your gimbap tasted much better.

877
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,446
That's what all the customers said

878
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,906
that they couldn't compare.

879
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,574
-Damn it!
-What?

880
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,992
This makes no sense!

881
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,995
Should I go
and turn everything upside down?

882
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,080
Leave it.

883
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,500
What can we do if that's the result?

884
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,460
Hey.

885
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:29,091
Still, thanks to you three, we earned
enough money to repair the kitchen.

886
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,387
Good job, everyone.

887
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,764
Thanks a lot.

888
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:41,019
Next time,
I'll try and make something even tastier.

889
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,690
Let's work together again, okay?

890
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,358
Screw this!

891
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,486
Goodness me.

892
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,488
Why are you crying again?

893
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,700
Oh, come on. You cry over everything.

894
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,826
Stop crying.

895
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,247
There's definitely something fishy
going on behind the scenes.

896
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,457
You're taking things a bit too far.

897
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,877
I counted the votes
a minute before they closed.

898
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,630
We had way more stickers than they did.

899
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:12,300
You really think they would rig the votes
in this day and age?

900
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,386
You should have a drink.

901
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,721
I'll drink until I drop tonight.

902
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,847
This is non-alcoholic.

903
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,228
Someone capable of rigging the votes
did present the award.

904
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,816
Hey, Han Sun-woo!

905
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,420
You pulled this crap
over a measly ten million won?

906
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,716
If you're doing this
because you can't accept the result--

907
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,052
So this is how petty
someone can become, huh?

908
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,097
The results were based
purely on the number of votes,

909
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,475
and we just happened to win.

910
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,477
Hiring Park Koon was cheating.

911
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,397
Festivals are about drawing attention,
not gaining repeat customers.

912
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,024
Isn't that Marketing 101?

913
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,359
You should know that.

914
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,403
I do know that.

915
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,032
But something smells fishy.

916
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,825
Don't believe it if you don't want to.

917
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,329
I thought you had something more
going on here, but again, you don't.

918
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,377
You set the fire, didn't you?

919
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,504
Fire?

920
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:32,839
What fire?

921
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,634
You've gotten better at acting.

922
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,220
You set the fire

923
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,973
at our restaurant, didn't you?

924
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,017
"Our restaurant"?

925
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,229
I can't believe I heard you say "our."

926
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,898
I don't know what you're on about.

927
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,651
I'll say this again.

928
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,071
You lost the contest.

929
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,824
Once again,

930
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,951
you lost,

931
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,786
Han Beom-woo.

932
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,676
Good work today. You can head home.

933
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,677
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

934
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:23,932
How about now?

935
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,937
Don't you want to come back to me?

936
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,941
What is with today?
Both of you are getting on my nerves.

937
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,905
If you're packed up,
take your ten million won and go.

938
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,324
Or swing that cape and fly away.

939
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,868
Here I go.

940
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,250
I'm better than that country bumpkin.

941
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,543
You got this!

942
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,836
Are you listening to me?

943
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,547
Hello?

944
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,674
Yeah, I'm listening.

945
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,427
How exactly are you better than her?
In what way?

946
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,512
Do I have to spell that out myself?

947
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,473
That country bumpkin--

948
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,642
Stop calling her that.

949
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,312
Mind your words.

950
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,148
That country bumpkin
has finally made you lose your mind.

951
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,818
Do you like her or something?

952
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:20,989
Me?

953
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,115
Like her?

954
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,950
Who else would I be talking about?

955
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,661
It's obvious that you like her.

956
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,288
Do you think I'm crazy?

957
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,053
Go back to what you were doing.

958
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:48,558
Go back to Seoul already.

959
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,861
Where did Chef Mo and Beom-woo go?

960
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,280
The fireworks will begin soon.

961
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,242
I bet they're somewhere fighting again.
I don't need to see to know.

962
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,370
I don't need to hear to know.

963
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,497
I bet they were sworn enemies
in their past lives.

964
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,752
Don't enemies from a past life
end up getting married in the present?

965
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,550
-What sauce is this?
-Teriyaki.

966
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,552
Yes, yes!

967
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,847
You're in fourth place.

968
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,436
All gimbap tastes the same.

969
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,329
It's good.

970
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,127
Yes!

971
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,461
I can't believe it went over.

972
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,505
Wait right here.

973
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,424
Hey!

974
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,219
-I lost all my ddakji.
-What are you doing here?

975
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,430
-She won them all.
-I was waiting for you.

976
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,768
For me? Why?

977
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,063
Hey! Let's play again!

978
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,940
-Come on, guys.
-You little punks.

979
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,026
-Run.
-What for?

980
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,737
-Wait! Let's play another round!
-Where are you going?

981
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,453
We came far enough.

982
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,371
We're good. They stopped chasing us.

983
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,211
You grabbed my hand first.

984
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,172
That was then. This is now.

985
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,966
I really don't get you.

986
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,386
No, there's no way.

987
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,263
Are you sulking?

988
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,058
It's not like you to sulk.

989
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,855
Come on. Don't be like that.

990
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,358
Why are you in such a good mood?

991
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,652
-We didn't even win first place.
-I won them all.

992
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,280
What did you win?

993
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,581
From now on,
I'm the ddakji queen of this area.

994
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,172
I don't believe this.

995
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,590
This is so annoying!

996
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,843
Are you jealous?

997
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,095
Fine, all right.

998
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,264
Pick one and I'll give it to you.
Which one do you want?

999
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,849
Forget it.

1000
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,268
Why are you so irritated?

1001
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,769
Why wouldn't I be?

1002
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,438
Just accept it.

1003
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,481
We lost.

1004
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,277
-Do you think that's what this is about?
-Then what is it about?

1005
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,695
Forget it.

1006
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,823
-Tell me. What is it about?
-I said forget it!

1007
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,116
Tell me!

1008
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,451
Apparently, it looks like I have a crush.

1009
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,162
Apparently, that's what it looks like!

1010
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,498
Have a crush on what?

1011
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,424
On you.

1012
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,642
I like you.

1013
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,440
Then…

1014
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,817
you can have all of them.

1015
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,841
TASTEFULLY YOURS

1016
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,718
Jungjae, the bridge of love.

1017
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,136
Listen up, everyone.

1018
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,222
What happened yesterday was a mistake.

1019
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,765
I want to get involved!

1020
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,268
I want to get madly involved with you!

1021
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,563
Even if you want to get madly involved,
some things just can't happen.

1022
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,564
What's this?

1023
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,149
What kind of life did you live?

1024
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:31,985
Let me take you out on a date.

1025
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,654
I'll be there by 9 p.m. See you there.

1026
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,323
How have you been?

1027
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:42,412
