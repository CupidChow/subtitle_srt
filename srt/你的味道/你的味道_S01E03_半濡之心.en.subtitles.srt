1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,647
Do you call yourself human?

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,192
How could you stab me in the back?

4
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,777
How could you?

5
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,112
Jang Young-hye.

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,240
Young-hye! This isn't right.

7
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah, I was a bit rude to you.

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,161
I give you that.

9
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,371
But still, how could you do this to me?

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,375
Someone like him
even has a girlfriend, huh?

11
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,878
How could you abandon me?

12
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,006
Okay, fine. I get that too. I get it.

13
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,385
But how could you leave me
for my older brother?

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,179
That's just wrong!

15
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,263
Is this a third-rate drama?

16
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,855
I'm going to crush you both. You hear me?

17
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,943
I'll steal all the recipes from this place

18
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,737
and crush you both.

19
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,449
What's he saying?

20
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,870
All of you. I'll crush you all.

21
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:07,836
Hey.

22
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,549
Where's Myung-sook? Tell me.

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,342
What do you want now?

24
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,094
What do you think?

25
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,303
What is it?

26
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,266
Your dad won't give you the restaurant
because you lost an employee?

27
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,313
I'm the owner!

28
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,315
My father…

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,734
is the chairman.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,654
You'll never become the owner.

31
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm the owner!

32
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,454
Let go.

33
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,415
Want me to twist your arm again?

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,209
Want me to pull out your hair?

35
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,504
Let go. Damn it.

36
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,216
-Let go.
-You let go.

37
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,315
My chest…

38
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,362
What did you say earlier?

39
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,951
Me? What? Why?

40
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,870
Be honest.

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,749
Why did you come all the way here?

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,253
You…

43
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,757
came to recharge, right?

44
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,801
No?

45
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,102
The reason I came here?

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,189
Yeah, I came to recharge.

47
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,525
I knew it. You lost your girlfriend,

48
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,737
so you came to find peace of mind, right?

49
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,822
I lost… I lost what?

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,700
Oh, my ribs!

51
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,327
Hey, what the heck are you?

52
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,412
Didn't I tell you already?

53
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,375
This is my new boss.

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,378
You lost your girlfriend
to your older brother of all people?

55
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,339
What? I lost what to my brother?

56
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,051
-Do you guys even know who I am?
-Yeah, I know!

57
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,512
You're just a loser

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,599
who farts about town bullying others
because your family's well-off.

59
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,354
That call where I mentioned my brother?

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,357
You thought it was about my girlfriend?

61
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,652
It wasn't. It wasn't about that at all.

62
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,904
You poor thing.

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,531
-Hey.
-Poor thing.

64
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,242
Hey, it's not what you think.

65
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,703
-It's not.
-Hey, you.

66
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,663
I'll see to it that your restaurant flops.

67
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,624
You're so loud!
What are you still on about, you moron?

68
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,875
"Moron"?

69
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,337
-Damn you. You have a death wish?
-Hey, damn you too.

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,630
-Let go.
-Let go.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,090
-I said let go.
-Let go!

72
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,800
-You let go first.
-Let go on three.

73
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,593
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

74
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,762
My hair!

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,223
You got my hair!

76
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,228
TASTEFULLY YOURS

77
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,731
Director Han, wake up.

78
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,817
Han Beom-woo.

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,986
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

80
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,029
Han Beom-woo.

81
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,697
Director Han.

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,907
Sir.

83
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,785
If you at least get the recipe
for seopsanjeok, the main dish,

84
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,078
I'll get a restaurant set up.

85
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,388
Yo, good morning to you.

86
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,015
Why are you working so hard so early?

87
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,568
My gosh, look at your head.

88
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,070
You have a bald spot.

89
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,363
I know. It's fine.

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,365
It's an honorable wound that shows
I fought for our restaurant.

91
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,409
Honorable wound, my ass.

92
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,623
You know the seopsanjeok
you made last time?

93
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,916
Can you make it again?

94
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,459
It was so good that I kept thinking of it.

95
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,252
Then find more wild pine mushrooms.

96
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,796
I'm not going through that madness again.

97
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,631
Hey, wait a second.

98
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,759
Do you have the recipe?

99
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,429
It was so good
that I couldn't stop thinking about it.

100
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,390
Maybe I could make it myself
if I knew the recipe…

101
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,433
What if you know it?

102
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,227
You think you can you make it?

103
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,360
Okay.

104
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,946
Make me just one then.

105
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,447
I'll watch from the side.

106
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,741
I really want some.

107
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,621
It's messy on the outside,
but it's pretty nice inside.

108
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,665
What do you think?

109
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,542
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

110
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,586
My word. Look at how clean the kitchen is.

111
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,382
I don't need a kitchen.
I'll be using it as a warehouse.

112
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,383
-You are?
-Yes.

113
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,510
That's just great.

114
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,305
It might be a restaurant right now,

115
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,015
but this building

116
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,227
was put up to be a warehouse.

117
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,396
-What kind of nonsense is that?
-Look at the room inside.

118
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,357
You should see every corner for yourself.

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
Come with me.

120
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,901
Look outside.

121
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,237
It spreads out like Provence.

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,574
It looks like a field in France.
Go take a look.

123
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,950
What do you think you're doing?

124
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,368
I'm working, of course.

125
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,579
I'm showing the place around
to a new tenant.

126
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,247
Yes, exactly.

127
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,500
Why would you show a tenant
around a perfectly fine restaurant?

128
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,752
What are you calling "perfectly fine"?

129
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,088
Everyone's saying this place went under.

130
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,423
What do you mean?

131
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,177
The whole marketplace is saying
this restaurant's ruined.

132
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,846
The rumor is all over town.
Don't pretend it's not true.

133
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,723
Who spread such a ridiculous rumor?

134
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,225
-What on earth?
-Ma'am?

135
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,393
Yes, I'm coming.

136
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,605
Could you get rid of this garden?

137
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,023
Could it be…

138
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,524
Could it be…

139
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,406
Jeez, I don't feel like working
this morning.

140
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,911
What just passed me by?

141
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,332
This feels so ominous.

142
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,126
I have a feeling who it was.

143
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,461
It's that bastard.

144
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,006
Now that I'm thinking about it,
I'm not sure anymore.

145
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,217
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty certain.

146
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,385
What's the difference?

147
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
I swear it was that punk.

148
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,972
Even if it was him,
there's nothing we can do.

149
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,349
We'll give as good as we got.

150
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,725
Two, three, four times over.

151
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,978
What if we go after him
only to make things worse?

152
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,481
Hey, wake up.

153
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,108
Are you Mo Yeon-joo?
You're not your usual self.

154
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,903
You can't use words
to get to a hooligan like him.

155
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,321
It's not just that.

156
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,615
They're saying
the restaurant I work at failed.

157
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,576
That's a serious blow to my pride!

158
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,330
Global warming must actually be serious.

159
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,457
It's getting so hot out.

160
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,377
What's this? It's beautiful.

161
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,254
Ever heard of a Rolax watch?

162
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,130
-Speak of the devil.
-Blinding, isn't it?

163
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,590
K-dramas don't drag it out these days.

164
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,551
Hey!

165
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,596
Don't you think your face
is more of a problem than global warming?

166
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,809
Stay away. He's good-for-nothing trash.

167
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,269
What did you say?

168
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,274
So you have time for a cup of tea?

169
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,987
Is your restaurant doing all right?

170
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,155
It's doing so well.

171
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,701
It's not like the restaurant
on the other side of the stream.

172
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,786
I heard they flopped already.

173
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,582
Word spreads fast
in a local community, you know?

174
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,375
I see.

175
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,046
See? He spread the rumor.

176
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,089
Rumor?

177
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,882
You got the wrong person.

178
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,009
What rumor?

179
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,802
There's a rumor that I spread?

180
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,930
Do you have proof?

181
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,433
No, wait.

182
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,602
I'll hold back just this once.

183
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,063
-Since this isn't my home ground.
-"It's not my home ground."

184
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,316
-Why that little…
-"Not my home ground."

185
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,233
Get up here.

186
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,069
What? What do you think you can do?

187
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:18,951
Let's talk about it later.

188
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,415
I don't think you have the time for this.

189
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,672
Hey.

190
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,966
What? What did you say?

191
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,927
We got a report that you were
in violation of the Fire Services Act.

192
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,389
What do you mean by
violation of the Fire Services Act?

193
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,683
What is this all about?

194
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,478
Exactly, sir.
We didn't violate anything of the sort.

195
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,021
We have fire extinguishers.

196
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,939
Look. There's one here in the kitchen,

197
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,525
one under there, and one by the entrance.

198
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,110
Our fire extinguishers are all there.

199
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,322
-Everything's fine.
-Yes. I told you.

200
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,699
-Did you check the emergency exit?
-I'll take a look.

201
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,535
Sir, we have to open for business.

202
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,912
Is anyone in?

203
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,954
Yes, hello. Welcome.

204
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,164
How many people?

205
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,582
We're from the district office.

206
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,002
Someone reported
that you don't have a health certificate.

207
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,170
Wait here.

208
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,508
If you have eyes, take a look at this.

209
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,593
This is my health certificate.

210
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,261
-Yes.
-Oh, what?

211
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,722
I found something.

212
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,266
SUNDEOK CHILI POWDER
50% CHINESE, 50% KOREAN

213
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,645
You posted that you use
Korean chili powder only.

214
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,984
You've got it wrong.
I just bought it out of curiosity.

215
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,403
-We didn't use it.
-Right.

216
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,738
We only tasted it.
Just a little pinch for a taste.

217
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,491
It was found open in the kitchen.

218
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,911
It was, but we never used it.

219
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,454
That's like saying you had a drink

220
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,623
but didn't drive under the influence.

221
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,878
I don't think that analogy is appropriate.

222
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,214
I know, right?

223
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,091
Right.

224
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,801
Submit this.

225
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,594
Before the deadline.

226
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,721
Let's go.

227
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,140
PRODUCT ORIGIN LABELING VIOLATION

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,100
Hey, wait. Sir.

229
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,518
I'll go to the district office.

230
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,686
The district office?

231
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,938
Stay put and don't cause trouble.

232
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,112
Myung-sook.

233
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,572
Yeah?

234
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm sure there's something
we can do for the restaurant.

235
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,162
Man, it's spotless.

236
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,830
Come on, bro.

237
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,999
You know me. You know how clean I am.

238
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,877
-Here, take this. Come on!
-No, don't.

239
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,379
It's candy. Take them.

240
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,507
My restaurant has absolutely no issues.

241
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,093
-There wasn't a single issue. Don't worry.
-Okay.

242
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,178
-We're off.
-All right.

243
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,888
-Take care.
-See you.

244
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,223
All right, we're now open for business.

245
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,184
Go on in.

246
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,769
Two people.

247
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,730
A group of three.

248
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,568
Hey.

249
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,154
Who am I?

250
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm the hyena of this neighborhood.

251
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,701
I never let go of prey once I catch it.

252
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,537
I just catch them all!

253
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,499
Goodness gracious.

254
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
I think you missed a prey.

255
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,925
Right. I think it was by the garage.

256
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,384
-It's by the garage.
-Right?

257
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,719
I wondered where they went.

258
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,637
-The garage?
-That's right.

259
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,891
-It was the garage.
-Garage, it is!

260
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,811
Stick that on properly.

261
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,522
No, no.

262
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,940
-What's that?
-Is it done?

263
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,943
NOTICE OF VIOLATION
FOR ILLEGAL BUILDING EXTENSION

264
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,444
What's the matter, guys?

265
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,488
-Here, take these.
-What?

266
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,031
-What are you doing?
-They're yours.

267
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,575
Someone filed a complaint,
and we had no choice.

268
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,952
Report it before the deadline.

269
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,245
-Let's go.
-Okay.

270
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,454
Isn't there something you can do?

271
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,791
You should've reported the expansion
you made to the garage.

272
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,044
PARKING RESERVED FOR SHIN CHOON-SEUNG
HE HAS A FIERY TEMPER

273
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,886
How can you do this to me, Myung-sook?

274
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,681
Fine.

275
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,518
That was a fantastic blow!

276
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,103
A fantastic blow indeed.

277
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
Neener.

278
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,074
That little… Is he actually crazy?

279
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:27,992
Run!

280
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,328
What? Why?

281
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,247
Why? What is it? What's wrong?

282
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,459
What's that?

283
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,091
You lunatic.

284
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,594
You parked right outside my restaurant?

285
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,511
Hey.

286
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,223
You see, someone reported my garage,

287
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,392
so I don't have a decent place to park.

288
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,604
-Move your car.
-Move it.

289
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,315
If you don't, I'll report you.

290
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,441
Report?

291
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,735
You should if you want to.

292
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,362
But this isn't a no-parking zone,

293
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,655
so they can't

294
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,240
tow my car.

295
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,285
Don't do anything you'll regret.

296
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:17,374
I have regrets

297
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,211
The day we argued

298
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,713
Give me the car key
if you want to stay alive.

299
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,923
The car key. Okay.

300
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,258
I'll give you the car key.

301
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,678
You damn punk. Get back here!

302
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,558
I'm exhausted.

303
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,935
Are you okay?

304
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,395
That little punk.

305
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,563
Damn it.

306
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,273
Goddammit!

307
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,274
That scumbag.

308
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,693
-All right. Keep coming.
-He's no match for me.

309
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,363
Come on. Keep reversing.

310
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,114
There's a curb here. Drive into it.

311
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,741
Keep coming.

312
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,409
-Good.
-Excuse me!

313
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,244
-Stay back!
-What's going on?

314
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,287
Hey, you.

315
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,330
Why you…

316
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,500
Why are you joining in too?

317
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,252
When will you stop causing trouble?

318
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,212
Jeez.

319
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,505
Hey, move the truck.

320
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,090
Don't get out. Get in and drive away.

321
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:12,930
You silly, it's really not what you think

322
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,685
Do you still

323
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,271
-Not know me?
-Not know me?

324
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,564
Be quiet!

325
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,901
A knock with this will really hurt.

326
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,194
Give me the key!

327
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,864
Why you…

328
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,284
Clean the inside for me.

329
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:43,419
-Please don't leave
-Please don't leave

330
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,172
-Me
-Me

331
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,092
That was awesome.

332
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,052
-Do you karaoke often?
-Yeah, I guess.

333
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,556
The one who's got you

334
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,226
How do I get inside?

335
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,326
Seriously, this punk…

336
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,501
I told you not to cause trouble.

337
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,629
What trouble?

338
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,132
What I did
was for the restaurant's honor--

339
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,425
What?

340
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,843
For honor?

341
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,390
Are you worried about this yellow eyesore?

342
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,892
I'll have him move his car.

343
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,144
Do you think I'm not doing anything
because I don't have a temper?

344
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,981
I did what I did for our restaurant.

345
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,691
Running a restaurant

346
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,194
comes with all sorts of problems.

347
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,987
Because of what you did,

348
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,406
we can't take customers
and our ingredients will go bad.

349
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,325
What are you going to do now?

350
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,828
-Answer me!
-It's not like I was fooling around!

351
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,247
I was trying to protect this restaurant!

352
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,917
If you have a brain, use it to think.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,086
Was it really about this restaurant

354
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,962
or that stupid pride of yours?

355
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,220
Mo Yeon-joo!

356
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,060
Help me!

357
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,145
I think I'm really stuck!

358
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,022
I can't move.

359
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,192
BAEKSU INN

360
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,322
Jeez, I'm so exhausted.

361
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,407
I'm so tired.

362
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,995
How did I get stuck there of all places?

363
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,913
Jeez.

364
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,803
Hello. I don't welcome calls
outside of work hours.

365
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,096
Have you heard?

366
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,182
Chef Mo will close for lunch tomorrow
to visit the jang house in the morning.

367
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,101
What are you talking about?

368
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,937
She has to save every penny
to pay off her debt.

369
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,439
She can't reach the meju maker.

370
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,734
It must be Choon-seung's doing.
We shouldn't have done what we did.

371
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,029
That childish punk.

372
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,117
Restaurants go out of business
when their jang changes.

373
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,578
-Chef Mo's food is all about the jang--
-I don't know.

374
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,333
I don't care. I just don't care.

375
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,754
EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

376
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,137
Is this not the right platform?

377
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,808
I think it is.

378
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,476
What are you doing here?

379
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,523
I'm taking a walk.

380
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,483
I'm on my morning walk.

381
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,860
What a nice life you've got,

382
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,738
taking a leisurely walk in the morning
for your health.

383
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,449
Think about it. Do you really think
I'm out for a leisurely--

384
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,909
Sure, sure.

385
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,162
Take good care of yourself
and live a long, disease-ridden life.

386
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
Should I just not go?

387
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,502
My goodness.

388
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,587
She'll end up with a concussion.

389
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,548
Why do I care? That's none of my business.

390
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,807
Jeez, what's in her nose?

391
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,103
Could you keep it down?

392
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,397
It's not me. It's her.

393
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,871
We're in the middle of nowhere.

394
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,832
We're going up even further?

395
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,960
We came uphill all this while.

396
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,630
We came so far up on the bus.

397
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,632
Do we have to walk further up?

398
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,552
How much further?

399
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,804
Just keep walking.

400
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,691
It's cooler than I thought.

401
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,943
Forget how cool it is and hurry up.

402
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:48,075
She really doesn't know
how to appreciate beauty.

403
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,160
Look at all these…

404
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,203
Oh, forget it.

405
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,288
Mr. Chang-su!

406
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,414
Sir.

407
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,168
Are you here? Mr. Chang-su.

408
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,544
Sir?

409
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,465
Hey.

410
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,550
Hey, Chef Mo.

411
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,969
What brought you all the way here?

412
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,140
Come on.
Our friendship is better than this.

413
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,268
I don't know what Choon-sang
or Choon-seung did,

414
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,312
but you can't mess with my jang.

415
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,438
Choon-seung?

416
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,565
What's that?

417
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,484
You know, Choon-seung!

418
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,363
He has eyes like this
and looks all forlorn.

419
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,280
It's a person?

420
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,699
I don't know him.

421
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,617
-You don't?
-What?

422
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,286
Why couldn't I reach you then?

423
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,122
I hurt my back

424
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,916
while separating the ganjang
and doenjang a while ago.

425
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,795
It takes me half a day
just to get to the phone over there.

426
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,589
Oh dear. I guess you really are hurt.

427
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,301
That's why
I haven't been able to do anything.

428
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,262
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,849
Then I guess I'll have to do it myself.

430
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,475
What? You'll do what?

431
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,353
You'll do it yourself? Today?

432
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,941
Yeah, just leave it alone.

433
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,071
It'll go bad,
and I'll just throw it all out.

434
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,992
Yeah. Just leave as is.

435
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,369
What are you looking at? No, don't do it.

436
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,539
-Look at the size of the pots.
-I'll do the work for you.

437
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,957
Just stay here and don't worry.

438
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,627
-What?
-Okay.

439
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,379
Thanks a lot, Chef Mo.

440
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,965
Let's come back another time.
You can't do it alone!

441
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,092
I'm not alone.

442
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,929
Me? What about me?

443
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:33,930
Why are you looking at me?

444
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,558
I'm not doing it. I said I'm not doing it.

445
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,935
You think I'll do it
just because I always do what you ask?

446
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm not doing it!

447
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,565
I can't believe
the things I'm getting myself into.

448
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,075
Get the bowl.

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,959
Bring it closer.

450
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,589
What soy beans you use

451
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,383
and how long you boil or steam them for

452
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,761
changes the flavor drastically.

453
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,358
If the meju retains too much moisture,
it's easy for bad bacteria to grow in it,

454
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,070
so you have to check
how well the blocks dried.

455
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,745
Come and scoop this with a ladle.

456
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:40,830
One.

457
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Two.

458
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:45,961
Three.

459
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,589
This feels weird.

460
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,218
Put some more strength into your fingers.

461
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,469
I am.

462
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,513
Spread it everywhere evenly.

463
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:57,847
Okay, that's enough.

464
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,333
My goodness, these are pretty.

465
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,676
This is a jangseok, salt crystal.

466
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,179
It shows the time and effort
that went into this sauce.

467
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,933
It's so pretty.

468
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,061
How pretty.

469
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,777
Look at the earthenware pots.
They're so pretty.

470
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,487
It's beautiful here.

471
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,531
I meant the jangseok, not the pots.

472
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,033
"You doofus."

473
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,534
Is that what you'll say?

474
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,785
You idiot.

475
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,704
Oh jeez.

476
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,168
Isn't "idiot" a bit harsh?

477
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,514
It feels like we're in the Joseon era.
Why do I feel like a slave?

478
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,477
He gave us so much
of something so precious.

479
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,644
He did.

480
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,272
You know meju is good for you, right?

481
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,273
Is it?

482
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,985
The fermenting process
creates lactic acid bacteria and enzymes--

483
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,070
Aren't you tired?

484
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,613
Why would I be tired?

485
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,615
I got jangseok and meju.

486
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,909
Right. You got jangseok and meju.

487
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,661
Of course you have no reason to be tired.

488
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,375
Oh no.

489
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,835
It's raining.

490
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:52,879
Run.

491
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,411
This is so heavy.

492
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,333
It might…

493
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,212
It might just be a passing shower.

494
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,881
Sorry.

495
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,092
"Sorry"?

496
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,761
You know that word?

497
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,849
Did you follow me all the way here
because you were sorry?

498
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,851
I'm talking about you.

499
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,813
Well, you could say that.

500
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,566
You said it was my fault
that our meju deliveries were cut off.

501
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,984
Good.

502
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,862
As long as you know what you did wrong.

503
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,870
I usually don't feel bad or sorry
for someone else.

504
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,455
I'm not that type of person.

505
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,706
No.

506
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,667
I don't do anything
I'd feel sorry about in the first place.

507
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,087
That exact attitude is why your girlfriend
left you for your brother.

508
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,047
Good. I'm glad you mentioned that.

509
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,550
It wasn't my girlfriend
who left me for my brother.

510
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,302
Then who is it?

511
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,595
Just someone.

512
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,056
Hang on.

513
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,311
I've never been dumped
or rejected by anyone.

514
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,812
All the girls I dated

515
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,441
clung to me saying they loved me

516
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,067
and cried their eyes out.

517
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,779
I was really popular--

518
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,219
I was just worried.

519
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,680
You were getting rained on.

520
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,741
Hello?

521
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,540
What? A fire?

522
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,045
You can't come in here.

523
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,922
You can't get through.

524
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,923
You can't go in.

525
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,550
-It's our restaurant.
-I'm the owner.

526
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,801
-It's our restaurant.
-You can't go in.

527
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,344
It's our restaurant!

528
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,347
Yes, okay.

529
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,685
Are you all right? Did anyone get hurt?

530
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,646
Given that the glass on the front door
was shattered,

531
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,232
the police say they think it was arson.

532
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,483
What? Arson?

533
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,610
But because our restaurant
is in a secluded corner,

534
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,070
there are no CCTVs around,

535
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,407
so it's going to take some time
to find out who's responsible.

536
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,911
It's okay.

537
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,872
At least no one was hurt.

538
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,041
That's not true.

539
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,545
Chef Mo's heart is broken.

540
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,925
I shouldn't have made a fuss
about working here.

541
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,385
What are you talking about?

542
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,970
Well…

543
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:30,972
Choon-seung?

544
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,267
The gukbap kid started the fire?

545
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,439
Damn it.

546
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,611
Mo Yeon-joo, calm down.
You're too worked up.

547
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,987
It might not be him!

548
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,073
I mean, I think it was him, but wait.
Hang on.

549
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,158
Move.

550
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,451
Wait.

551
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
What do you think you can do on your own?

552
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,622
Setting fire to a business?
That's a serious crime.

553
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,832
Don't try to deal with this yourself.
Let's trust the police this time.

554
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,958
I said move!

555
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,085
You're not going to?

556
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,299
Mo Yeon-joo! Darn it.

557
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,553
How many people--

558
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:11,596
Hey, hey.

559
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,014
What are you--

560
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,227
Do you know what you've done?

561
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,694
What the hell are you talking about?

562
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,905
You're ganging up on me now?

563
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,573
This is assault.

564
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,159
You saw that, right? Aggravated assault.

565
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,577
It's a crime.

566
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,913
What? A crime?

567
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,290
I've had enough of you.

568
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,335
Then why the hell
did you commit such a crime?

569
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,295
What kind of nonsense is this?

570
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,548
What crime are you saying I committed?

571
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,508
Do you have proof?

572
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,343
Bring me proof
before you start accusing me!

573
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,970
I don't know about proof,

574
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,180
but there's a witness.

575
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,517
Are you saying you like pineapple
more than gukbap?

576
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,102
Oh, come on.

577
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,479
It's "fine dining," not "pineapple."

578
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,897
You're hilarious.

579
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,775
You dare look down on me?

580
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,443
Oh my.

581
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,118
Why is that leech
coming from that direction at this hour?

582
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,620
I saw it all.

583
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,541
You were stumbling drunk,
walking back from our restaurant!

584
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,918
Me?

585
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,171
Listen, Myung-sook.
False accusation is also a crime.

586
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,215
Do you really want to end up in prison?

587
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,925
-Prison?
-For goodness' sake.

588
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,385
You're hurting my ears!

589
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,470
False accusation?

590
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,389
Speak up if you're innocent.

591
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,226
What were you doing walking around
all drunk near our restaurant?

592
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,310
Hey.

593
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,564
Am I not even allowed to drink?

594
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,775
You'd been stressing me out so bad

595
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,987
that I stayed out drinking all night
until this morning, okay?

596
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,074
Oh, so you were drunk and angry

597
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,368
and set fire to our restaurant?

598
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,329
He set fire to our restaurant.

599
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,041
What the hell are you yapping about?

600
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,044
Why would I set a fire?

601
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,009
A fire?

602
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,635
Bastard.

603
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,096
Bastard.

604
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,474
Here comes the bastard.

605
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:26,064
My own father calls me a bastard.

606
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,485
That's why complete strangers
look down on me now.

607
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,001
Did I really set a fire?

608
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,922
Let's go talk at the police station.

609
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,340
No, wait. Hang on.

610
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,883
-Wait.
-Wait for what?

611
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,136
No, wait.
I was there and I broke the window,

612
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,682
but I really don't remember
starting a fire.

613
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,561
That's like saying you had a drink
but didn't drive under the influence.

614
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,022
I'm sorry!

615
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,440
-Oh my.
-It must be true.

616
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm sorry. I apologize!

617
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,568
I'll compensate you for everything.

618
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,446
I'll keep my mouth shut
and live quietly for the rest of my life.

619
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,031
So please…

620
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,158
No. There's no need to drag this out.

621
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,411
-You can do your talking at the station.
-No, please! What would you gain

622
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,497
-from sending me to prison?
-My pants! Don't look!

623
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,958
You can't open your restaurant
until it's fixed,

624
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,043
but you can't just sit and wait either.

625
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,379
Wouldn't it be better
that you take my money

626
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,090
so that you can fix up your place
and be back in business?

627
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,176
You have to pay rent and buy ingredients.

628
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,594
You have to pay your employee too.

629
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,138
Myung-sook.

630
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,514
Come on, bro.

631
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,974
How much can you give us?

632
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,935
I'll give you all the cash I have.

633
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,940
A million won?

634
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,451
-Are you kidding me?
-I swear that's all I have.

635
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,582
The car, my watch, my chain,
everything belongs to my father.

636
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,708
-Please.
-That's enough!

637
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,505
I'll give you three days.

638
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,133
Get the kitchen up and running
in three days.

639
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,759
Three days?

640
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,052
It's your last chance.

641
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,846
-Hey!
-Deal!

642
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,265
It's a deal.

643
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,936
You know,
I can do that with my eyes closed.

644
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,441
My hands touched every corner
of this gukbap restaurant.

645
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,235
We got things sorted out.

646
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,653
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

647
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,488
I'll go to your restaurant.

648
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,331
Don't call the police. We have a deal.

649
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,004
Really?

650
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,797
You want to give someone like him
another chance?

651
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,383
People don't change.

652
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,721
We should at least
give him a chance to change.

653
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,891
Who knows?

654
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,733
This is truffle neobiani,

655
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,569
grilled neobiani served with truffle paste
to accentuate the flavor,

656
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,446
with osmanthus tea-based jelly

657
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:25,201
made with lemon juice
and flowers to add acidity.

658
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,995
This was meant to launch at Motto,

659
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,707
but I personally brought it to La Lecel
and developed it further.

660
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,919
It's as fancy and colorful as yourself,
Chef Jang.

661
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,881
Yes. I believe a trendy look
is just as important.

662
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,675
Okay, very nice.

663
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,731
Can you excuse us?

664
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,626
You're going to serve this kind of trash
as your signature dish?

665
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,923
Chef Jang's food was at least decent
back when she worked at Motto.

666
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,633
Now it only tastes of money.

667
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,302
I apologize.

668
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,137
Take it away.

669
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,603
I heard Beom-woo's in Jeonju.

670
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,816
Officially, he's on a business trip,

671
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,359
but he's more or less in exile.

672
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,865
You stabbed your brother in the back.

673
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,909
Why do you think I let it happen?

674
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,204
I know you gave me a chance.

675
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,332
I'll show results as soon as possible--

676
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,334
Beom-woo…

677
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,213
doesn't seem like the type
to stab you in the back.

678
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,218
He's more the type to look you in the eyes
and behead you.

679
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,391
Are you Han Yeo-ul, the culinary expert?

680
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,434
Oh, yes.

681
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,435
Oh my!

682
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,396
-Right?
-I knew it was you.

683
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,522
I'm such a huge fan.

684
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,567
I knew it.

685
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,694
Could we take a photo with you?

686
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,490
Of course.
Why stop at one? Let's take multiple.

687
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,741
-Come over here.
-Thank you.

688
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,660
Let's see. This would be a nice backdrop.

689
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,787
Come this way.

690
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,539
Are you here for a special occasion?

691
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:39,210
It's lovely to see you all here.
Do you come here often?

692
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,673
It's me.

693
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,552
Find out in detail

694
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,138
what Han Beom-woo is doing there.

695
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,516
-How about "I love you"?
-Okay.

696
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,602
-Let's all say "I love you."
-Yes, we'd love that.

697
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,693
INTERNAL REPAIRS IN PROGRESS

698
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,375
I told you not to trust him.

699
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,335
You can tell by his looks!

700
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,838
All right.

701
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,632
My gosh. The craftsman's here.

702
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,592
The kitchen repair craftsman…

703
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,639
I'm a bit late.

704
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,307
I slept in a little.

705
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,144
-You didn't call the police, did you?
-Do you see this?

706
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,020
I was just about to call.

707
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:40,938
Don't!

708
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,606
You have a bad habit.

709
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,067
You all heard
what I said yesterday, right?

710
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,028
I'll repair everything
in the three days I promised.

711
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,156
Yeah, you have to fix that window

712
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,867
and put up new wallpaper
in the storage room.

713
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,827
Wallpaper too?

714
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,872
That's not what we agreed on.

715
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,957
Jeez, so can you do it or not?

716
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,834
I can do it.

717
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,171
But you see, there's a well-known saying.

718
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,631
"A piece of paper is lighter
when held together."

719
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,383
It's a great saying.

720
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,385
So what you're saying is,

721
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:16,098
you want us to help out
and work with you to make your job easier?

722
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,141
-That's it.
-Right.

723
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,225
Are you kidding me?

724
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,853
What's the emergency police number again?

725
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,855
-Hello, Mr. Policeman?
-Hello?

726
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,983
-Mr. Policeman. We're--
-I'm sorry!

727
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,667
There we go.

728
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,552
Looking good.

729
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,140
That's done.

730
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,308
One tile.

731
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,145
One, two, three.

732
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,193
Do we have any more of this dry fix?

733
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,205
That kid's a total troublemaker.

734
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,541
I wonder if he can do anything.

735
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:28,837
What is this?

736
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,464
CI… What?

737
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,720
My gosh. It's all English.

738
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
What's this?

739
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,063
This is cool.

740
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,611
Oh gosh!

741
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,529
Jeez.

742
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,406
Darn it! I can't do this anymore!

743
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,699
What is it now?

744
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,243
-Damn it.
-Goodness.

745
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,204
What is it now?

746
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,956
What happened?

747
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,250
Look at him.

748
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,295
What are you doing there?

749
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,921
I can't do it.

750
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,258
You know I grew up coddled and spoiled.

751
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,303
My goodness.

752
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,180
What are you doing?

753
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
Do you know why

754
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,313
your father doesn't want to
give you the restaurant?

755
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,900
All you know how to do is drink and party.

756
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,861
But you want to be treated like a boss,

757
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:38,490
so you go around picking on others
and getting into trouble.

758
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:43,329
How could he leave anything
to a bum like you?

759
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,247
Even I wouldn't if I were him.

760
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,374
Are you done talking?

761
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,626
Yeah, I'm done.

762
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,377
-You…
-Oh my.

763
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,712
Are you going to hit me?

764
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,631
Go ahead. Hit me.

765
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
What the heck?

766
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,559
Are you crying?

767
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,519
What did you do now?

768
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,230
-What's wrong with him?
-He burst into tears.

769
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,483
Why is he crying and not working?
Has he lost his mind?

770
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,443
You're right.

771
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,071
I'm a good-for-nothing.

772
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,698
I know that.

773
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,701
Do you think

774
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,162
I wanted to be like this from the start?

775
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,458
Just so you know, Myung-sook,
I also had dreams

776
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,710
when I was young.

777
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,339
There were so many things I wanted to do.

778
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,300
But my father said

779
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,844
I should stop doing pointless stuff.

780
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,138
He's been going back and forth
with giving me the restaurant all my life.

781
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,015
I'm sick of it too!

782
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,437
I wasn't born just to inherit
the gukbap restaurant.

783
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,526
I'm just as frustrated

784
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,195
about myself and my life!

785
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,448
You don't know anything.

786
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,375
For goodness' sake.

787
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:13,752
What are you doing?

788
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,347
The mix is too watery.

789
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,809
I guess you picked up a thing or two.

790
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,938
But only enough to do a sloppy job.

791
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,948
Get over here!
Are you going to sit and cry all day?

792
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,491
I'm coming.

793
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,832
-Watch carefully.
-Okay.

794
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,587
Spread it out nice and thin like this.

795
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,381
-Tap gently.
-Tap gently.

796
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,049
-See? It stuck.
-Yeah.

797
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,426
-Now you try.
-Okay.

798
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,473
I double majored in architecture.

799
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,682
What's that?

800
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,068
What are you doing?

801
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,446
We need to eat to work.

802
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,989
I thought they could use a snack.

803
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,824
Crying makes you hungry.

804
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,828
Let me see.

805
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,170
It's all in the wrist. Tap gently.

806
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,964
Tap gently.

807
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,551
Take a break and have a snack!

808
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,136
-The gukbap kid can come too.
-A snack?

809
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,471
Tap gently.

810
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,556
We're almost done.

811
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,106
It looks so good.

812
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,317
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit!

813
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,157
Eat up.

814
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:50,951
Okay.

815
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,835
What is this?

816
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,963
Wait. Bro, you've never had
Jeonju-style jjajang?

817
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,631
Jeonju-style jjajang?

818
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,134
Wait, since when did I become your "bro"?

819
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,596
Since we got close enough
to eat together, I guess?

820
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,973
Jeonju-style jjajang.

821
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,268
This is the way we've eaten jjajangmyeon
around here since the old days.

822
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,644
Okay, I get that.

823
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,688
But we live in the present,
so do we have to eat this--

824
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,773
-Don't eat if you don't want to.
-No, wait.

825
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,360
You had to make this the old way

826
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,572
and it looks really appetizing
is what I meant.

827
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,753
So good you could die, huh?

828
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,966
I really didn't expect this.

829
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,843
Our chef's skills

830
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,262
sure do leave you speechless, doesn't it?

831
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,809
Are you all in there?

832
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,855
Where is everyone?

833
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,316
Oh, hello there.

834
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,818
-Hello.
-Hi.

835
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,197
This place is a complete mess.

836
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,659
Did you come by to tease us?

837
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,119
Don't be so sensitive. I was just worried.

838
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,871
I heard our soccer team newbie

839
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,665
was having a hard time.

840
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,376
I'm really touched.

841
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,087
It's nothing, really.

842
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,467
I told you to stay away from Choon-shik.

843
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,677
Choon…

844
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,095
Oh, sir.

845
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,430
It's Choon-seung, not Choon-shik.

846
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,600
And I don't think

847
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,645
he's a hopeless good-for-nothing jerk
or a bad kid.

848
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,605
He may look like a simpleton,

849
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,732
but I got to know him
and I don't think he's bad.

850
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,362
What?

851
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,531
Look.

852
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,825
It's his face. That's what offends me.

853
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,035
Anyway,

854
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,746
from what I see,

855
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,083
it'll cost at least five million won
to repair everything.

856
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,128
-Five million…
-Five million?

857
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,714
Where would we get five million?

858
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,257
Call when you have the money.

859
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,218
I'll get in touch with my network
and get you an expert.

860
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,845
Okay. Thank you.

861
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,683
Did he come here to tell us that?

862
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,310
Sir, stop right there.

863
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,358
What's that thing that says
five million won in your back pocket?

864
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,110
PRIZE MONEY: 5 MILLION WON

865
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,612
My pocket?

866
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,406
What is this?

867
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,533
What on earth is this?

868
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,617
What's this?

869
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,911
Who put trash in my pocket?

870
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:40,954
Let me see that.

871
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,000
"Five million won."

872
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,294
A food truck contest over two days?

873
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,921
Let's say the rate of cost to sales
will be about 40%.

874
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,507
Three million plus
the five million first-place prize money…

875
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,677
We could redo the entire interior
and get new tables.

876
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,179
-Anything will help.
-Right.

877
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,598
You have to register by 6 p.m. today.

878
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,224
-What time is it right now?
-It's 5:45 p.m.

879
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,644
No matter how fast you go,
you can never get there in 15 minutes.

880
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,604
You can.

881
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,193
You can get there.

882
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,071
Can you really do it?

883
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:16,740
Can we trust you?

884
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,494
I'm Shin Choon-seung,
the neighborhood's human navigator.

885
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,164
Let me borrow your motorcycle.

886
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,374
Can we really trust him?

887
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,127
You can't trust him, right?

888
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,504
Then trust me.

889
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,594
Can we trust him though?

890
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,517
You've ridden with someone
on the back before, right?

891
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,101
Trust me. Here we go.

892
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,186
Can you ride--

893
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,522
-Hold on tight!
-Hey, it's too fast.

894
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,357
There must've been an accident.

895
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,734
We can't get through. There's no way.

896
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,652
We can't go!

897
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,154
Watch out, there's a car ahead!

898
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,115
There's a car!

899
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,992
Sorry!

900
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,039
You're going too fast.
You're going way too fast.

901
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,502
-Hey!
-My bad.

902
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,505
-What's that?
-It's a forklift.

903
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,923
-Duck!
-Forklift!

904
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,594
STREAMSIDE NAMBU MARKET

905
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,430
The road's under construction.

906
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,643
Why are there so many cars?

907
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,943
Is this an actual road?
Are you going the right way?

908
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,987
I am the way.

909
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,906
Hey, you're going way too fast.

910
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,160
REGISTRATION FOR
ONGOEUL YOUTH FOOD FESTIVAL

911
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,708
Hey, hey.

912
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,335
We almost crashed for real just now.

913
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,012
This is it. We made it.

914
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,057
There's a person ahead.

915
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,183
Go to the side.

916
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,020
We're here!

917
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,522
Come on. Let's go.

918
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,399
My leg!

919
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,817
-What is it?
-My leg.

920
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,570
-What about your leg? We have to go.
-Damn it!

921
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,323
-Which way is it?
-It's over there.

922
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,783
No, wait! Wait! Stop.

923
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,869
-The registration is over.
-No, wait.

924
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,495
-Stop her!
-Fill that in!

925
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,997
APPLICANT: JUNGJAE

926
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,792
I've watched you for a long time.

927
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,252
Jeong-eun? Yeong-eun?

928
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,921
-No.
-Dong-eun?

929
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,505
Hey, it's VTS!

930
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,632
You mean, BTS?

931
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,926
-Oh my.
-Where?

932
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,553
-Where are they?
-Over there.

933
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,388
You startled us.

934
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,849
That says TVS,
the Korean broadcasting network.

935
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,100
You really got me.

936
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,936
What would BTS be doing here?
You're so silly.

937
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,354
I have poor eyesight.

938
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,649
If BTS were here,
I'd ask for an autograph!

939
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,359
It's the Korean broadcasting network.

940
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,152
-Sorry.
-Have a good day.

941
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,071
See? It's TVS.

942
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,448
-Silly me.
-You fool.

943
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:06,910
Did I do good?

944
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,790
I guess they missed it.

945
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,253
Hey, how did it go?

946
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,548
-What?
-They did it?

947
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,008
Oh my gosh!

948
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,011
Even a useless turd comes in handy, huh?

949
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,972
Tell him to go home.

950
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,516
Chef Mo says you can go straight home.

951
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,018
Okay. Good job.

952
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,730
What now?

953
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,401
-Everything's sorted now.
-We got in.

954
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,114
"You can. You can get there."

955
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,657
"You can get there."

956
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,661
I bet that shocked them.

957
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,848
I'm going to do it!

958
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,435
Oh, that's hot.

959
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,357
A doctor. I need to see a doctor.

960
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,317
It's so hot.

961
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,514
Yeah. I should quit smoking.

962
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
BAEKSU INN

963
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,896
A day feels so long

964
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,816
-and yet so short.
-I didn't know you were this countrified.

965
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,453
What the…

966
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,205
Chef Jang.

967
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,753
Are you crazy? How did you find me?

968
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,588
Why are you so surprised?

969
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,925
Oh, I see.

970
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,804
You're messing
with another restaurant here, aren't you?

971
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,141
"Messing with"?

972
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,560
Let's watch our words.

973
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,524
What's with the formality
when we know each other's secrets?

974
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,526
I see.

975
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,862
Are you here to play both sides again
between me and Han Sun-woo?

976
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,157
This is why I like you, Director Han.

977
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,953
You like me?

978
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,372
Did you hurt your head on the way here?

979
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,706
What are you doing there?

980
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,298
You clocked off already?

981
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,051
It's so early though.

982
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,637
Why are you stuttering
like I caught you stealing?

983
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,556
Who is she?

984
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,062
Why do you care? Keep quiet.

985
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:26,860
Oh, is she the one
you're trying to prey on this time?

986
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,155
Who is she?

987
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,281
My ex-girlfriend.

988
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,911
-"Ex-girlfriend"?
-"Ex-girlfriend"?

989
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,376
Yeah.

990
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,923
Shall we continue
what we were talking about?

991
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:54,387
I hate that you're obsessing over me
and following me around.

992
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,763
How did you find me here?

993
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,683
Keep this up, and my feelings for you
will be gone completely!

994
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,768
What the hell are you saying?

995
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,355
Is this the person who left you
for your older brother?

996
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,482
That's not what happened.

997
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,066
What? His brother?

998
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,985
You need me to remind you
why I don't like you?

999
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,946
You act like you're something
when you have zero talent.

1000
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,698
I can't stand that at all.

1001
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,701
Actually, no. It's just the fact
that you eat and breathe.

1002
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,120
That alone makes me sick!

1003
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,206
Get lost!

1004
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,468
Excuse me.

1005
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,473
Do you even know

1006
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,934
who this guy is and what he does?

1007
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,353
I'll figure that out for myself.

1008
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,649
The ex-girlfriend can stay out of it.

1009
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,895
TASTEFULLY YOURS

1010
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,522
Good vibes.

1011
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,358
All sorts of nobodies
call themselves chefs these days.

1012
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,068
We'll let our cooking do the talking.

1013
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,571
You dare hurt my pride?

1014
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,282
People are starting to flock in.

1015
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,575
Everywhere but our truck.

1016
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,576
Shouldn't we

1017
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,619
put more thought into our menu selection
if we want to win?

1018
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,454
The first place winner is…

1019
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,124
-Do you like her or something?
-Me? Like her?

1020
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,375
I was waiting for you.

1021
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:53,548
