TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,318
I'm serious. Don't come any closer.

3
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,028
Don't come… Don't…

4
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,163
Man, my head.

5
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,664
Oh jeez.

6
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,754
Where am I?

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,050
Hello? I'm locked up in here!

8
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,094
Help! I'm locked up!

9
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,014
Director Han!

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,600
Director Han!

11
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,768
Director…

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,270
Drink up!

13
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,148
This is for you.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,234
This is for me.

15
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,278
-Yu-jin.
-Huh?

16
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,906
Stay here for a while. I'll let you out
when I'm back from Sapporo.

17
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,825
Enjoy your vacation.

18
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,742
Okay.

19
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,453
That son of a gun.

20
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,706
Hello? Is anybody there?

21
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,921
JUNGJAE'S RECIPES

22
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,047
The recipe book.

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,347
JUNGJAE'S RECIPES

00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,896
KONGNAMUL GUKBAP CHRONICLES

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,356
"Kongnamul Chronicles"?

26
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,068
No.

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,903
No, it can't be.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,911
Hello?

29
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,291
Hello? I'm locked in here!

30
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,501
I'm in here!

31
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,964
Save me!

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,133
Goddammit, it's cold!

33
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,344
What? What do you want?

34
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,014
If the recipient can't come to the phone,
stop calling.

35
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,892
What are you,
my actual ex-girlfriend or something?

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,977
What the hell are you going on about?

37
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,104
Don't you know I'm returning to Motto?

38
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,399
You change sides as easily
as a chameleon changes colors, don't you?

39
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,776
Since when did that sneaky act
pass for a simple return?

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,237
Get a hold of yourself,
Director Han Beom-woo.

41
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,364
We might all go down together!

42
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,159
What did you say? "We"?

43
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,327
"We"?

44
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,747
Since when were you and I a "we"?

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,791
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,043
Stop talking.

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,338
Did you see what I sent you?
Look at it now!

48
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,215
You're talking way more
than I am right now.

49
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:42,305
Your brother screwed me over
and found my replacement himself.

50
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,141
We're seriously done for.

51
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,602
LE MURIR HEAD CHEF JEON MIN

52
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,812
What the heck?

53
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,194
Han Sun-woo's completely determined.

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,197
He's using a cheat code
to take over Hansang.

55
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,161
What does he have going with Han Sun-woo?

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,413
Hello? Han Beom-woo?

57
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,623
Hansang, Le Murir.

58
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,083
What are you saying?

59
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
Hey, Han Beom-woo!

60
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,585
Le Murir, Hansang.

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,053
This isn't
what I should be doing right now.

62
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,514
Exactly. This isn't the time for that.

63
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,183
Someone reserved a table at Motto,
and a group of Diamant--

64
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,694
-Seriously.
-How do you remember that?

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,071
How could I ever forget that?

66
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,620
-So many ridiculous things happened.
-I know.

67
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
-Even the cracker-like thing.
-Yeah.

68
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,882
All sorts of things happened.

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,217
You bet.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,429
Who taught the idiot
that couldn't even hold a knife?

71
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,936
So come back.

72
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,688
Hey.

73
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,903
Not just for your sake.

74
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,906
For Murir too.

75
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,034
It needs you.

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,790
Do you know…

77
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,919
what kept me going at Murir?

78
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,925
It was the determination…

79
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,931
to secure my place at there.

80
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,517
And yours too.

81
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,021
So that…

82
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,275
I could come back for you.

83
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,030
I just…

84
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,914
I only waited for you.

85
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,282
This is Han Sun-woo from Hansang Group.

86
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,660
Please call me. It's an urgent matter.

87
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,292
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,421
I have to excuse myself.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,174
Did something happen?

90
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,554
We still have to talk about
what to cook for Chef Tatsuo.

91
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,933
No, nothing happened.

92
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,477
I'll tell you later.

93
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,438
See you tomorrow.

94
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,284
You know, that guy…

95
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,618
I'll have a beer now.

96
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,582
Please, thank you.

97
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,417
Just drink.

98
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,961
Show me how you drained
all the soju in Koreatown.

99
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,562
TASTEFULLY YOURS

100
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,047
Well?

101
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,466
Didn't a few beers fill you with ideas

102
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,051
about what your chef liked?

103
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,386
-Yeah.
-Great. So what is it?

104
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,471
No.

105
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,765
The beer didn't help at all.

106
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,561
That's so odd. How can you not remember?

107
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,649
You chefs must've talked about
your food preferences.

108
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:51,572
He prioritized
the customers' preferences over ours.

109
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,992
That's why I respected him.

110
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,370
What?

111
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,289
How do you think…

112
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,502
I was able to attend

113
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,213
an expensive school like CIA
after I left the hermitage?

114
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,049
I got a full scholarship.

115
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,511
Think about it. I got a full ride.

116
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,640
How great of a cook must I have been?

117
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,600
You could say

118
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,728
I was born a genius.

119
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,150
This is new.

120
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,278
You're bragging so nonchalantly.

121
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,989
Anyway, I graduated,

122
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,992
and I turned down all the offers

123
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,328
from France and the US

124
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,081
and came here to Sapporo.

125
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,833
It was all because…

126
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,838
I wanted to work with Chef Tatsuo.

127
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,258
That was my only reason.
That's how much I respected him.

128
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,929
I thought he could

129
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,434
show me the direction
in which my cooking should take.

130
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,897
But that damn Diamant.

131
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,735
What's so great about it anyway?

132
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,070
Even Chef Tatsuo changed
after he got a star.

133
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,948
It was just one petty star.

134
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,166
Let's go outside.

135
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,209
For a change of pace.

136
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,434
The izakaya was just a starter, right?

137
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,853
What should we eat? What should we have?

138
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,979
Not sure.

139
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,859
Name whatever you want.
I'll buy you everything.

140
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,361
Can you handle it?

141
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,114
That means
you'll eat a crazy amount, right?

142
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,204
They have this.

143
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,789
"Uni ramen"?

144
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,335
Can they even make a profit
by adding sea urchins to noodles?

145
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,671
Are you going to eat here?

146
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,963
-Hello.
-There are many other places.

147
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,382
-Welcome.
-Why not check them out first?

148
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,759
Uni ramen, please.

149
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,310
Here's your uni ramen.

150
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,937
Thank you.

151
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,440
-Thank you.
-I hope you enjoy it.

152
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,916
Excuse me.

153
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,334
This ramen…

154
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,587
It's very unique.

155
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,383
It is, isn't it?

156
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,511
It's our original miso ramen recipe.

157
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,847
A longtime friend of mine

158
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,516
taught me how to make it.

159
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,976
A friend?

160
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,645
He was a chef.

161
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,522
Now…

162
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,150
he doesn't remember

163
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,777
this food

164
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,364
or even me.

165
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:39,884
Here.

166
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,760
Add this.

167
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,017
What's up with you?

168
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,894
Uni in ramen?

169
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,104
And this uni…

170
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,398
isn't even fresh.

171
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,153
What are you even thinking?

172
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,617
Here.

173
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,975
It doesn't taste like what the kid made.

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,568
Since then,

175
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,446
he'd sometimes bring me uni
that had almost expired

176
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,115
and ask me to make him ramen.

177
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,743
And each time,

178
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,997
he'd say it didn't taste like
what the kid had made

179
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,293
and never finished it.

180
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,260
So Chef Tatsuo

181
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,889
was a regular here.

182
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,935
Are you…

183
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,855
that kid Tatsuo talked about?

184
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,403
Is there a secret to the recipe?

185
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,240
Tatsuo wanted to eat it so badly,

186
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,369
but I just couldn't recreate it for him.

187
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,247
I felt so bad.

188
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,500
It's doenjang.

189
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,881
I mixed a bit of Korean doenjang
into Japanese miso.

190
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,553
That gets rid of the strong smell of uni.

191
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,905
It was the first staff meal I made
when I was a rookie.

192
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,324
That ramen, I mean.

193
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,160
You cooked ramen for the staff?

194
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,958
We cooked and sold
the most extravagant and expensive foods,

195
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,881
but we ate instant food to get by.

196
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,927
I was young and felt it wasn't fair.

197
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,805
So I added some uni
we were going to throw out

198
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,016
to ramen and made a staff meal.

199
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,392
Everyone loved it.

200
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,979
I think that was when I first realized

201
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,442
how joyful and meaningful it is

202
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,154
to cook for someone.

203
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
I did get an earful from Chef Tatsuo
that day though.

204
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,417
He was so upset with me for making it,
so why is he craving it?

205
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:02,920
I wonder why.

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,132
But there's a thing
about stubborn old men.

207
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,093
Hey.

208
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,388
You know what to make now!

209
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,473
What?

210
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,810
The dish your chef, that old man, likes.

211
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,729
If he went everywhere looking for it,
doesn't that mean he really wants it?

212
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,774
And you said you can make it.

213
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,531
How's that?

214
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,116
Isn't it much more useful

215
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,077
walking and talking with me
than sitting around with that guy?

216
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,121
I'd better get some uni first.

217
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,456
Let's meet early tomorrow morning, okay?

218
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,916
Okay.

219
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,335
Yeon-joo.

220
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,130
Yeah?

221
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,800
Never mind.

222
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,516
It's really hard to love a woman
who's crazy about cooking.

223
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,937
Hey.

224
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,126
I'll kill you if you're late tomorrow.

225
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,722
Oh, come on.

226
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,529
THE LE MURIR PUNK

227
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:57,534
THIS IS HAN BEOM-WOO, LET'S MEET

228
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,093
It was stupid of me to trust that moron.

229
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,976
I think it was somewhere here.

230
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,395
What is this place?

231
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:31,944
No way.

232
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,947
Even if it's a retro-themed restaurant…

233
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,366
JUNGJAE

234
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,743
Oh dear.

235
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,663
We cleaned the place

236
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,624
and prepared everything for tomorrow,
and it's still early.

237
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,669
It's really nice and chill
to open just for lunch.

238
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,423
Beom-woo's actually quite smart.

239
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,468
-We sold out again. Yes, yes.
-That's right.

240
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,264
Well, that's all good, but…

241
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,225
Oh, you want to know
when Beom-woo and Chef Mo will return?

242
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,810
I'm sure they'll be back this week.

243
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,603
They'll come back when they're ready.

244
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,021
That's not what I meant.

245
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,860
Do you think Yu-jin left for Seoul?

246
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,903
Are you kidding me?

247
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,198
I'm sure he did.
He probably left long ago.

248
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,868
Did you expect him
to live here forever then?

249
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,910
What's with you?

250
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,829
Get a grip, Myung-sook.

251
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,706
You're acting like
you're ready to give that Casano--

252
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,586
You're acting like you're ready
to give him everything you have.

253
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,463
Why would I give him everything I have?

254
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,385
It's just that he came
all the way from Seoul to help us out,

255
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,429
but then he disappeared without a word.

256
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm just showing concern
for a fellow human.

257
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,516
Concern?

258
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,768
Why would you worry about him at all?

259
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,980
How ridiculous. Are you afraid
he might be locked up somewhere?

260
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,691
What nonsense is that?

261
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,109
What are you even saying?

262
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,945
Can't I worry about someone if I want to?

263
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,572
Oh, whatever.

264
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,783
If you like him that much,
move to Seoul and live with him.

265
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,577
Congratulations.
You'll be a Seoul lady now.

266
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,370
Who gave you the right
to choose whom I live with?

267
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,872
Why would I do that?

268
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,916
-Forget it! Don't follow me.
-Why would I leave family and friends?

269
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,417
-I'm not talking to you.
-Stop right there.

270
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,127
-Talk to me.
-Don't follow me!

271
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,087
-I'm not following you.
-Ms. Seoul!

272
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,673
-Congratulations.
-I think she just mentioned Yu-jin.

273
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,425
Wait.

274
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,387
Both Beom-woo and Yu-jin
came here to steal the recipes,

275
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,474
but one won't tell where he is
and another is missing?

276
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,352
Oh, whatever.

277
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,188
I'll get the recipes,

278
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,356
no matter what.

279
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,783
Here's your food.

280
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,912
Director Han!

281
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,205
Director?

282
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,957
Oh, Choon-seung. Hello, sir.

283
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,874
What?

284
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,753
Don't call me sir.
I'm way younger than you.

285
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,422
Where's Beom-woo?

286
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,840
Where did that punk go?

287
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:04,096
Beom-woo said you can rest here
while he's away in Sapporo.

288
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,056
He said to consider it a vacation.

289
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,142
What kind of nonsense is that?

290
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,686
Open up. Let me out!

291
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,688
-Are we being chummy now?
-No, we're not.

292
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,314
See, the thing is…

293
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,526
I really need to use the bathroom.

294
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,194
There's a bucket in there.

295
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,907
I have a really bad headache right now.

296
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,201
I have a bad hangover and need to puke.

297
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:30,622
-Let me do just that.
-That's why I brought you my gukbap.

298
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:35,043
Our kongnamul gukbap
is the best cure for hangovers.

299
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,921
Enjoy the food and leave a nice review.

300
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,172
All right, rest up.

301
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,638
What was that?

302
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,309
I'll break
every single bottle of liquor in here!

303
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,226
Why you…

304
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,646
Don't you dare touch them.

305
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,983
I'll crush you into pieces, Casanova!

306
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,986
So let me step outside just for a moment.

307
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,529
-Please?
-Damn it.

308
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,365
I'll give you just one minute.

309
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,283
Okay.

310
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,373
-I knew you'd do this.
-Wait.

311
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,833
-Go back inside.
-Wait.

312
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,501
-Please.
-Come on.

313
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,670
What on earth are you doing here?

314
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,921
Chef Jang.

315
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,174
He kidnapped me and locked me up.

316
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,925
Hey. I've seen you before.

317
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,721
I remember.

318
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,264
You're Beom-woo's ex, aren't you?

319
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,975
No, wait.

320
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,272
I need the bathroom. I'm serious.

321
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,815
Use the bucket.

322
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
-Hey, are you leaving?
-Let's go.

323
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,570
Are you really leaving?

324
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,656
Two days.

325
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,117
I was locked up for two whole days.

326
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,911
So you're saying

327
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:54,664
that lunatic betrayed us…

328
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,582
Yes.

329
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,376
…and went to Sapporo to get a girl?

330
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,669
That's right.

331
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,879
Damn it.

332
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,882
Has he seriously gone mad for that woman?

333
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,134
That's what I'm saying.

334
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,053
What about the recipes then?

335
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,263
I need them by the weekend.

336
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,015
The weekend?

337
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,397
What's this?

338
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,821
"Hansang and Le Murir's
mergers and acquisitions proposal"?

339
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,700
"Le Murir head chef"?

340
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,288
SOUS-CHEF

341
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,041
Hello? I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later.

342
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,417
Wait, Chef.

343
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,795
I called because we have
a special reservation this weekend.

344
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,879
What?

345
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,924
Two foreigners, two Koreans,
one with shellfish allergy,

346
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,176
and one requested
the chef's tasting menu with pairings.

347
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,511
I have a feeling they're…

348
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,679
No way.

349
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,806
Could they be Diamant inspectors?

350
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,851
Diamant inspectors?

351
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,532
Thank you for taking care of my husband.

352
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,285
Not at all.

353
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,136
Excuse me.

354
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,649
What brings you here?

355
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,235
At this late hour and without Yeon-joo.

356
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,987
I'll get right to the point.

357
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,323
You're pretty close to Hansang Group…

358
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,367
No.

359
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,664
You're pretty close to
Managing Director Han Sun-woo.

360
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,585
Do you know him?

361
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,339
Oh.

362
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,925
Han Beom-woo, Han Sun-woo.

363
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,593
Are you…

364
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,597
I don't like it either,

365
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,225
but we are what you think we are.

366
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,102
It's a pleasure.

367
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,439
I guess it's either fate
or the industry is just really small.

368
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,024
It could be neither.

369
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,735
What does that mean?

370
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,612
I heard you're replacing
Chef Jang Young-hye

371
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,280
as head chef at La Lecel.

372
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,658
Well, not permanently.

373
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,701
I'll be helping out temporarily.

374
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,706
I think Hansang and Murir
can give each other what they want.

375
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,542
You start with the recipes,

376
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,753
then slowly steal the chefs one by one.

377
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,048
Meanwhile,
Le Murir gradually goes out of business.

378
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,467
That's how help is usually given,
isn't it?

379
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,597
You know very well.

380
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,100
I guess you've done it a lot.

381
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,394
I see you're not denying it.

382
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,606
Because I have no reason
to tell you anything.

383
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,696
I wondered why
you wanted to see me in private.

384
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,323
Did you ask to see me just for this?

385
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,285
Of course not.

386
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,457
Why are you trying to take
Yeon-joo back to Le Murir?

387
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,212
You shook hands with Hansang,

388
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,715
and you're La Lecel's new head chef.

389
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,218
You don't need Le Murir anymore.

390
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,428
Watch what you say.

391
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,684
What about you?

392
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,937
Why are you lurking around Yeon-joo?

393
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,231
You're an heir to a fortune,

394
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,109
yet you're working at a restaurant
in the countryside.

395
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,070
Isn't that more suspicious?

396
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,038
I'll head back inside if you're done.

397
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,010
CONTACTS

398
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,929
CHAIRMAN HAN

399
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,331
UNI IN SALTWATER FROM RUSSIA

400
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,717
Welcome.

401
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,677
-Hello.
-We have a lot of fresh goods today.

402
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,304
Oh, uni.

403
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,308
They're good and fresh.

404
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,603
-I'll take this.
-Great.

405
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,656
Your call cannot be connected
and will go to voicemail after the beep.

406
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,533
What the heck is this guy doing?

407
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,539
-Thank you.
-Sure. Thank you.

408
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,553
Let's cook for Chef Tatsuo.

409
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,434
Okay. Shall I get started?

410
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,578
Must you enter so chaotically?

411
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,163
Man, that really…

412
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,914
It really hurts.

413
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,751
My goodness, you're such a troublemaker.

414
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,836
Why couldn't I reach you all morning?

415
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,714
You show up now
when the sun's high in the sky?

416
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,177
I had a good reason, okay?

417
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,976
Look what I picked up on the way here.

418
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,480
What is this?

419
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,820
Korean doenjang.

420
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,450
Where on earth did you get this?

421
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,827
I'd been wondering where to get it.

422
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,622
You see,
I have pretty amazing connections.

423
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,373
They're scattered all over the world,

424
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,168
and I can get anything I need
with just one call.

425
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,544
It's a piece of cake.

426
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,254
Good job.

427
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,672
You adorable thing.

428
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,385
Don't ruin my hair.

429
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,972
Hey. Move out of the way.

430
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,390
Move.

431
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,019
I'll clean it up.

432
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,109
Why are there so many pills?

433
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,736
It's nothing.

434
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,279
They're mine.

435
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,574
I got a prescription
because I was stressed with work.

436
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,243
I'm trying to go without.

437
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,122
What's all this?

438
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,208
Have you decided on what to cook?

439
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,793
Yeah.

440
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,752
What is it?

441
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,421
Ramen.

442
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,673
Ramen?

443
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,634
It's the food Chef Tatsuo wants to eat.

444
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,302
Yeah.

445
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,847
It's definitely ramen.

446
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,182
Ramen, huh?

447
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:52,725
You'll help me, right?

448
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,690
Of course, I will.

449
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,608
What should I do first?

450
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,820
-We should make the broth first.
-Yeah, we should.

451
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,204
It's been so long since we did this.

452
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,586
Gosh, it's hot.

453
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,923
Man, it's hot
standing in front of the stove.

454
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,010
Take off your coat then.
Why complain when you're layered?

455
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,933
Jeez, that's hot!

456
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,645
You're still bad at this.

457
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,814
You need to remove all this.

458
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,255
Is this it?

459
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,507
-Uni ramen?
-Yeah.

460
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,676
Let's taste it.

461
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,114
It tastes just like it did back then.

462
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,616
-Try the noodles too.
-Okay.

463
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,214
Chef Tatsuo eats ramen?

464
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,632
Ramen?

465
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,218
Don't knock it until you try it.

466
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,014
I wanted to prepare something
you wanted to eat.

467
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,810
I made this for you and you alone, Chef.

468
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,146
I hope you enjoy it.

469
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,108
Sophie.

470
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,801
So… Sophie?

471
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes, Chef.

472
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,109
There was something…

473
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,490
I wanted to say to you if we met again.

474
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,121
I know it's late…

475
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,668
but about the pufferfish incident
back then…

476
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,763
I failed to stand up for you.

477
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,186
I'm sorry, Sophie.

478
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,241
No, Chef.

479
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,663
That was my own decision.

480
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,176
Sophie…

481
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,595
I'm so sorry.

482
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,475
Chef, there's something
I want to tell you.

483
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,233
What will happen to us now?

484
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,027
It won't be easy running Murir.

485
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,486
There's no point in worrying.

486
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,780
Will we manage without Chef Tatsuo?

487
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,908
I'm sure he'll get better.
Let's believe so and wait.

488
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,243
Let's do what we can.

489
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,579
Why did he want us
to leave the room anyway?

490
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,679
Everyone.

491
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,642
I have an important announcement to make.

492
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,436
-What? An announcement?
-An important announcement?

493
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,896
What is this?

494
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,272
Wait, this is…

495
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,732
CONFIRMATION OF OWNERSHIP TRANSFER
FOR FRENCH DINING RESTAURANT LE MURIR

496
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,026
A change in Le Murir's ownership?

497
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,319
Change in ownership?

498
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,949
I, the head chef of Le Murir,

499
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,161
will take over the restaurant

500
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,874
and move it a step further
as the new chef-owner.

501
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,087
I'm doing this for Chef Tatsuo--

502
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,338
"For Chef Tatsuo"?

503
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,134
Do you mean that?

504
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,189
You're doing it for Chef Tatsuo?

505
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,113
I'm sure you noticed it too.

506
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,074
I'm talking about Murir.

507
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,078
It might've looked great on the outside,

508
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,580
but it was festering on the inside.

509
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,625
Debts were piling up.

510
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,296
And with Chef Tatsuo in that condition…

511
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,049
You know just as well

512
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,968
that fine dining

513
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,387
is all show and no substance.

514
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,306
So what?

515
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,352
To save the restaurant,

516
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,481
I had to bring in an outside investor.

517
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,860
What's this then?

518
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,362
Explain this.

519
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,241
It's the medicine
Chef Tatsuo should have with each meal.

520
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,119
Why did you throw it out?

521
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,256
I'll explain everything later.

522
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,341
No, tell me now.

523
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,061
The medicine he was taking…

524
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,439
It's nothing. They're mine.

525
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,524
The truth is,

526
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,110
Chef Tatsuo threw them out.

527
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,451
He didn't like how the meds
numbed his taste buds.

528
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,619
CLASS 1 PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ALZHEIMER'S

529
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,871
He was also afraid
that rumors would spread in the field.

530
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,000
I turned a blind eye
because I wanted him to get through it.

531
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,128
That way,
Le Murir wouldn't shut down and--

532
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
No.

533
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,509
You had to earn time
so you could sell the restaurant.

534
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,551
Mo Yeon-joo.

535
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,014
No one has the right
to talk to me that way, not even you.

536
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,394
I thought this was
the best option for Murir--

537
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,978
The best for whom?

538
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,563
Sous-chef Hiroshi.

539
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,358
Assistants Yuichi and Lena.

540
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,070
Hiroshi and Yuichi can't repay their loans

541
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,571
if they miss just one month's salary.

542
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,408
And Lena lives with her parents.

543
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,910
She's the sole earner.

544
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,664
What would you have done?

545
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,212
If your restaurant
was about to close down,

546
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,005
if you couldn't pay your staff…

547
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,760
would you have watched and done nothing?

548
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
Even so,

549
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,519
what you did can never be justified.

550
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,562
I'm sorry, Yeon-joo.

551
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,858
I don't care what you say.

552
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,238
The M&A with Hansang…

553
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,324
is a done deal.

554
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,178
That was a moving speech.

555
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,184
It would be great

556
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,060
if life could go the way you wish,

557
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,647
but most of the time it doesn't, does it?

558
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,153
You haven't…

559
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,656
heard the news yet, have you?

560
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,035
We'll take a majority vote on this item.

561
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,037
The M&A of Le Murir…

562
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,334
Man, those early flights are exhausting.

563
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,003
Why are you here?

564
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,965
I'm here to get that agenda thrown out.

565
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,383
What?

566
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,469
How will you do that?

567
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,223
Oh, you haven't heard?

568
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,267
I've been reinstated to the board.

569
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,645
I've already talked it out
with Chairman Han.

570
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,897
What kind of nonsense is that?

571
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,650
Here are all the receipts from my travels.

572
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,026
Reimburse me.

573
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,405
I was in Sapporo on a business trip.

574
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,407
I don't have much time…

575
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,328
so I'll exercise my rights
as a shareholder.

576
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,415
This M&A

577
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,334
will not be happening.

578
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,421
NOTICE ON REJECTION OF HANSANG'S
M&A PROPOSAL FOR LE MURIR

579
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,839
Rejected.

580
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,138
So…

581
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,683
simply put,

582
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,937
Le Murir will not be sold off

583
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,565
to Hansang.

584
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,693
That's basically it.

585
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,913
How…

586
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,085
Keep that if you want.
I have more copies.

587
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,135
Because of you, we…

588
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,512
Our restaurant…

589
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,101
Do you have any idea what you just did?

590
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,270
I don't.

591
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,941
But I do know
that stealing a sick man's medication

592
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,027
and taking what's theirs
without their knowledge

593
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,821
are really nasty things to do.

594
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,870
Hey.

595
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,374
Did you just hit me?

596
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,126
I'll punch you right back.

597
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,629
-Don't.
-Stop.

598
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,671
Let go of me!

599
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,340
-What are you doing?
-Stop it!

600
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,258
Stop!

601
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,221
Stop!

602
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,265
Why are you only angry with me?

603
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,812
That's enough!

604
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,900
Come inside, all of you.

605
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,075
Sophie.

606
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,133
Did you find it?

607
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,304
What you want to cook.

608
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,476
No, not yet.

609
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,565
But I think I will soon.

610
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,450
Jeon Min.

611
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,716
I sincerely apologize.

612
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,761
I'll…

613
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,430
leave the restaurant.

614
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:30,602
And if you wish to take legal action…

615
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,385
I know how much Murir means to you.

616
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,430
I've never doubted that.

617
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,603
However,

618
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,188
Murir…

619
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,983
isn't a restaurant
that can just be sold off.

620
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,659
Let's find another solution together.

621
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,123
I'll try to change as well.

622
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,139
I'm sorry.

623
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,312
I'm sorry.

624
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,731
It's okay.

625
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,610
It's fine.

626
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:05,989
It's fine.

627
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,184
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,356
I'm sorry too.

629
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,029
I needed Murir.

630
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,535
I thought

631
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,290
that was the only way to get you back

632
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,751
after you'd given up…

633
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,007
your dream, your food, everything for me.

634
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,974
I said I regretted letting you go…

635
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,894
and I meant that.

636
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,356
That I wouldn't have managed without you.

637
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,277
I meant that too.

638
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,447
I know.

639
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,451
But I didn't give up.

640
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,704
I never gave up.

641
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,210
My dream, my cooking.

642
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,007
Just like I told Chef Tatsuo…

643
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,553
I feel like I'm finally
working toward it all.

644
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,867
Time has passed.

645
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,705
And you and I…

646
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,502
are both in different places now.

647
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,678
Just like how Jungjae
and Murir are different.

648
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:36,973
But I won't forget…

649
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,811
the Mo Yeon-joo

650
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,647
and the Jeon Min from back then.

651
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,983
I'll remember them both.

652
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,406
Take care.

653
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,293
Take care.

654
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for flying with Han Air.

655
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,818
This plane is bound for Incheon.

656
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,863
We will now demonstrate
the safety features…

657
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,157
Please put your seat
in an upright position.

658
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,325
So…

659
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,872
Please stow away your tray table.

660
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,253
Please put your seat
in an upright position.

661
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,380
-About…
-What now? What is it?

662
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,008
What do you want to know?

663
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,885
You're so restless like a constipated dog.

664
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,429
What?

665
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,389
A constipated dog?

666
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:08,190
I just wanted to ask

667
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,527
what you two talked about earlier.

668
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,489
I was just a little curious, that's all.

669
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,699
I'd expect nothing less from you.

670
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,493
I'm not telling you.

671
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,372
Hey, I'm not done talking to you.

672
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,166
What should I do about this habit of--

673
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,751
Can you please be quiet?

674
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,049
Sorry.

675
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,395
Hey.

676
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,899
Do you think I'll stop asking

677
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:56,404
if you lean on my shoulder like this and--

678
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:57,864
This is really comfy.

679
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,414
Have a pleasant sleep, ma'am.

680
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:22,222
You owe me
for getting you reinstated to the board.

681
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,916
JUNGJAE

682
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,796
Myung-sook.

683
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,006
We're back!

684
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,674
My gosh.

685
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:01,052
-Oh my gosh!
-No, wait.

686
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,473
How have you been?

687
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,725
I've been good.

688
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,768
Let's stop. I'm dizzy.

689
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,104
Why were you away for so long?

690
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,565
Where's Choon-seung? Is he inside?

691
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,775
Don't even mention that fool.

692
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,277
What's the matter now?

693
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,739
We had a little argument last night,

694
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,533
and he didn't show up for work today
just because of that.

695
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:27,412
-Goodness gracious.
-I had to do everything on my own today.

696
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,664
It was so much work.

697
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,375
What did you say that made him skip work?

698
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:37,631
Yu-jin suddenly disappeared
without a word.

699
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,717
So I asked Choon-seung
when Yu-jin would come back,

700
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,969
and he suddenly flew into a rage.

701
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,394
What's up with him?

702
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,229
What the heck? What's going on?

703
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,821
Hey, Yu-jin.

704
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,077
Hey, Yu-jin! Are you all right?

705
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,413
Beom-woo.

706
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,790
Beom-woo.

707
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,750
It's me.

708
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,795
What? Who's in there?

709
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,130
Choon-seung.

710
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:20,882
Choon-seung?

711
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,266
Let me out. Hurry.

712
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,106
You scared me.

713
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,401
What are you doing in there?

714
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,610
I got duped.

715
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,737
By whom?

716
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,322
That Casanova

717
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:48,118
and your ex-girlfriend.

718
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,121
My ex-girlfriend?

719
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,628
Hug me.

720
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,754
-I need warmth.
-Damn it.

721
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,262
I forget it all the time.

722
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,304
Oh my gosh!

723
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,223
Mo Yeon-joo! Where are you going?

724
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,350
What's the matter with you?

725
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,227
What is it? Is something wrong?

726
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,813
Why are you running
all over the place this morning?

727
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,234
No, nothing's wrong.

728
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,278
What are you stuttering for?

729
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,571
I didn't.

730
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,491
-When did I stutter…
-Whatever. Be quiet.

731
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,119
We're going grocery shopping,
so watch the restaurant.

732
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,412
Clean up as well.

733
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,997
-You're going out?
-Get a grip.

734
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,498
See you later!

735
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,918
Don't be gone for too long.
I'll be lonely.

736
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,218
The recipe book.

737
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,471
The recipes. Damn it.

738
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,349
The recipe book.

739
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,351
Goddammit.

740
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,275
What the…

741
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,324
No way.

742
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,367
JUNGJAE

743
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,619
For goodness' sake.

744
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,079
LAST NIGHT

745
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,831
The chef's recipe book is in there.

746
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,461
Do we really have to go this far?

747
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,089
Of course.
You said the inspectors are coming.

748
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,507
There's not much time.

749
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,092
That's true,

750
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,803
but this is illegal.

751
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,514
You like breaking the law. It's fine.

752
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,809
How dare you say that about me?

753
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,310
When did I do such a thing?

754
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,818
-Yu-jin.
-Let go.

755
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,487
This is what they get for locking me up.

756
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,451
Oh my.

757
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,930
Come on. Help me find it.

758
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,200
I found the recipes.

759
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,743
What?

760
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,120
I found them.

761
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,499
The recipes Director Han mentioned.

762
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,261
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP

763
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,848
HAN BEOM-WOO

764
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,225
-Let me have a taste test.
-Yes, Chef.

765
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,317
They're Diamant inspectors, so stay sharp.

766
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,568
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

767
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,991
HAN BEOM-WOO

768
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,245
Focus, everyone.

769
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,705
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

770
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,291
Come on, pick up.

771
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,127
Pick up the phone.

772
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,338
Answer the damn phone!

773
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,656
TASTEFULLY YOURS

774
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,991
The Diamant inspectors
visited Motto yesterday,

775
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,535
and the feedback
was apparently very positive.

776
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,786
Wrap things up there.

777
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,664
This is your workplace,
not that restaurant.

778
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,542
I have to tell her today, no matter what.

779
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,335
I want to hear your story too.

780
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,046
It's really hard to tell.

781
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,257
Han Beom-woo, you dare deceive me?

782
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,425
I realized that sincerity
means more than money

783
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,427
and that people are more important.

784
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,971
Han Sun-woo!

785
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:22,308
