TASTEFULLY YOURS

HANSANG

3
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,406
-Hello.
-Hello. Thank you.

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,866
Welcome.

5
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,161
Thank you for accepting our invitation.

6
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,246
The pleasure is mine.

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,915
Thank you for the invitation.

8
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,708
Thank you.

9
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,793
Shall we?

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,419
Sure.

11
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,010
THE ULTIMATE DIAMANT

12
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,346
THE SHOWDOWN OF THE CENTURY
TO DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE 3-STAR

13
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,263
MOTTO VS JUNGJAE

14
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,140
The showdown of the century

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,475
to find the ultimate
three-star restaurant.

16
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,102
Welcome to The Hansang Diamant Show.

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,521
-It's starting.
-All right.

18
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,605
-It's starting?
-It's starting.

19
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,941
This will determine
the ultimate three-star restaurant.

20
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,611
First, let me introduce
the judge of this cook-off,

21
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,489
Hansang Food Field's Chairman Han Yeo-ul.

22
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,406
Please step forward.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,533
Hello.

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,122
Hello, I'm Han Yeo-ul.

25
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,833
Next, we have a special judge

26
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:10,880
who will explain the theme
and evaluation guidelines.

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,841
Please step forward.

28
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,135
A special judge?

29
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,761
-Hello. Thanks for having me.
-This is Mathieu,

30
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,430
the editor-in-chief of the Diamant Guide.

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,724
He's… Hang on a second.

32
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,685
-What's the matter?
-Do you know the guy?

33
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,312
He looks awfully familiar.

34
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,897
It's him!

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,816
The couple that came with their parents!
The bride's father!

36
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,733
-Right!
-That's right!

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,610
-Santé.
-Santé.

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,737
-Santé.
-Santé, sweetie.

39
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,408
-It's him, right?
-It's him.

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,246
Hello, I'm Mathieu,
the editor-in-chief of the Diamant Guide.

41
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,916
-He's the editor-in-chief.
-Editor-in-chief.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,668
I'm very honored

43
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,547
to participate as a judge in this event
held in South Korea,

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,174
the country of gastronomy.

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:59,512
So it must be him who put our restaurant
in that guidebook.

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,140
That's it.

47
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,808
My gosh.

48
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,102
The competitors will be judged

49
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,938
by 30 food-related influencers

50
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,400
who will visit both Motto and Jungjae.

51
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,694
And of course, we can't be left out.

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,447
-Certainly not.
-We'll go to both restaurants in person

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,198
to taste and evaluate the food.

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,659
Now, let us begin the draw
to determine the theme

55
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,161
of the Ultimate Diamant cook-off.

56
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,253
I can't wait to see
what the theme will be.

57
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,306
It's chicken.

58
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,933
-Chicken?
-Chicken?

59
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,517
-Chicken…
-The theme for the…

60
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,021
-Korean, French, Italian.
-…Ultimate Diamant cook-off is chicken!

61
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,397
-That's right!
-Goodness gracious.

62
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,400
This. Our secret weapon.

63
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,569
Jungjae's recipe book.

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,738
Why didn't I think of this?

65
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,198
-Did I do well?
-Yeah, good job.

66
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,282
-Well done.
-What is this?

67
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,826
-Okay. Something familiar but unfamiliar.
-What is that?

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,036
Familiar but new.

69
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,704
-Chicken.
-Chicken.

70
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,707
This.

71
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,794
How about this dish?

72
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,213
This is a dish called Coq au Vin.

73
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,422
Cook a van?

74
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,008
-No, Coq au Vin.
-Coq au Vin.

75
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,844
It's a French-style chicken dish
with vegetables.

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,888
The Korean equivalent would be…

77
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,806
Jjimdak.

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,307
Yeah, jjimdak.

79
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,434
But cooked in wine.

80
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,396
The key point is braising it,
not steaming it.

81
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,189
So you braise it in wine, right?

82
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,526
If we were to balance it a bit

83
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,737
and tweak it to suit the Korean palate,
it would make a nice, hearty meal.

84
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,030
I think this is a good idea.

85
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,366
-My mouth is watering already.
-It's perfect.

86
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,867
-Wait.
-Sounds good.

87
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,245
Do you think you can make this?

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
Of course.

89
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,499
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

90
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,334
-Let's go with this!
-Okay! Let's go!

91
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,502
All right then.

92
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,045
Shall we get the ingredients?

93
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,547
-Let's go!
-Go!

94
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,881
-Let's go!
-Hurry.

95
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,675
-Let's go, sirs.
-We'll buy all the chicken in this town.

96
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,552
-I'll be back.
-See you later.

97
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,137
Let's crush them all.

98
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,680
-Crush them.
-With your skill.

99
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,604
Goddammit.

100
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,648
Goddammit indeed.

101
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,358
You sound just like Chef Mo.

102
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,818
Tell me. Where did we go?

103
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,611
-All the places we could.
-Right?

104
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,947
-Did all the chickens fly off?
-Damn it.

105
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,200
Why are you mimicking Chef Mo
out of the blue?

106
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,286
Just hand over the chicken.

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,288
There were none.

108
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,415
What do you mean there were none?

109
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,294
We went everywhere
and checked every store,

110
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,421
but the chicken we want isn't available.

111
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,631
We wanted Korean native chicken
or Silkies,

112
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
but they were all sold out.

113
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,927
I think

114
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,597
someone messed with our supply

115
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,057
to make sure we couldn't get any.

116
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,975
Who would do such a thing?

117
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,353
Wait. Could it be those Motto punks?

118
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,189
No way.

119
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,025
They'd go this far?

120
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,902
Yeah, they would.

121
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,361
My gosh.

122
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,614
The rich and powerful are the worst.

123
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,576
No.

124
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,578
Let's not waste energy on stuff like this.

125
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,332
We just have to do what we do best, right?

126
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

127
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,794
Let's find a way.

128
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,715
JUNGJAE

129
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,676
Okay, gather around again.

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,472
Choon-seung and you,
search the market from top to bottom.

131
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,724
-Great.
-You and I will go to all the stores

132
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,268
and get all the chicken we can find, okay?

133
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,812
Frozen or not,
we'll just get what we can find.

134
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,188
-You got that?
-Okay.

135
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,775
Beom-woo, but the other guys
are going to use good-quality chicken.

136
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,235
Can we beat them with frozen chicken?

137
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,323
Myung-sook says she has a secret sauce.

138
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,575
-Let's trust her!
-Okay!

139
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,786
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

140
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,496
-Sir, you're headed to the market.
-What?

141
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,872
Oh, right, the market.

142
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,415
-Sir, hold my hand and follow me.
-What?

143
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,750
-Why should we hold hands?
-Follow me.

144
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,418
-Hey, don't.
-It's that way.

145
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,797
-Wait. Don't run!
-Let's go!

146
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,299
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

147
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,344
We sing as we march.
We'll sing "Comrade's Star."

148
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,763
Hey! Call me if you find any chicken!

149
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,848
Nice and loud.

150
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,483
I feel embarrassed now that I'm back.

151
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,198
What?

152
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
Say that again?

153
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,576
Yes, sir.

154
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,703
As per Chairman Han's specific order,

155
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,122
we blocked the distribution
of all chicken breeds.

156
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
Okay.

157
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,298
By the way, sir,
why did you go all the way there?

158
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,382
Good work.

159
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,775
Jeez.

160
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,320
What the heck do they want a cook-off for?

161
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,905
I know, right?

162
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,952
We meet again.

163
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,749
You seem pretty attached
to the restaurant.

164
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,840
TASTEFULLY YOURS

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,094
Okay, put that down there.

166
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,930
It has to face the other way.

167
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,517
Move that slightly forward.

168
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,602
VOTE FOR YOUR TASTE
MOTTO VS JUNGJAE

169
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,271
It has to fit the angle of the camera.

170
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,857
Bring the table forward a bit.

171
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,901
Hurry up.

172
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,946
THE ULTIMATE DIAMANT
BALLOT BOX

173
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,490
We don't have all day.
Move faster, people.

174
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,212
Please turn on Camera 3.

175
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,923
Check this.

176
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,341
Thank you.

177
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,134
-Did you check it?
-Yes, I did.

178
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,928
This tiny thing is a camera?

179
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,931
Move the camera a bit to the left.

180
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,559
-Check the memory cards.
-Okay.

181
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,519
Check the sound, please.

182
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,396
Add two scoops then shake the bottle.

183
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,522
-Two scoops?
-Yes.

184
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Shake it, shake it.

185
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,548
You need to cut it as close
to the bone as possible.

186
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,465
Yes, Chef.

187
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,678
Make sure there's no residue.

188
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,596
Yes, Chef.

189
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,180
How long has it been sitting in the brine?

190
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,098
Four hours.

191
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,933
-Let me check.
-Yes, Chef.

192
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,353
-We're ready.
-Oh, okay.

193
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,939
Okay, everyone. Let's stand by.

194
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,857
All right.

195
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,775
Ready,

196
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,860
action!

197
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,030
Motto is open for business.

198
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,825
Go, go. Let's go.

199
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,952
-Thank you.
-Please come in.

200
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,715
Sir.

201
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,936
Wait, why…

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,655
Do it all again!

203
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,656
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

204
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,157
I said that wasn't it!

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,325
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,409
Chef.

207
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,746
I don't think you have to try so hard.

208
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,164
What?

209
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,669
I mean, this competition
has nothing to do with us.

210
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,004
We won't get fired
or paid less even if we lose.

211
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,174
No. I don't want to be complacent.

212
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,678
Whether the owner is Beom-woo or Sun-woo,
I'm the one who does the cooking.

213
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,056
This time,

214
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,642
I'm serving my recipe.

215
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,896
It looks good.

It smells amazing.

226
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,761
Can you greet my followers?

227
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,013
-Oh, sure. Hello.
-Hello.

228
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,098
That's good.

229
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,933
That's it.

230
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,560
There. It looks much better.

231
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,526
It's reduced nicely.

The more I eat…

236
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,912
I brought you some makgeolli.

I ground up some sweet potatoes…

241
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,469
Father.

242
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,554
You ground them up to make what?

243
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,349
Well…

244
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,394
I ground them up to make
this sweet potato makgeolli.

245
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,438
You made it yourself?

246
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,107
Yes.

247
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,874
It's good.

248
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,129
We should sell this at our restaurant too.

Thank you.

253

This Gwangyang-style grilled chicken

254
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,777
is a local dish
that's crispy on the outside

255
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,779
and moist on the inside.

256
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,656
We grilled Cheongri native chicken

257
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,576
over charcoal made from
wood from Baegunsan Mountain.

258
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,412
The wine we paired with this dish

259
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,123
is a Château de Montépice.

260
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:38,669
With its spicy aroma
and balanced structure,

261
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,006
the wine pairs beautifully
with the grilled chicken.

262
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:48,596
Is this the exact same dish
served to the other customers?

263
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,057
Did you do anything differently
for us judges?

264
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,101
It's exactly the same.

265
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,676
It's delicious.

266
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,893
Cut.

267
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,895
We'll now film the judges on the move.

268
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,653
Okay.

269
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,614
We'll shoot the last dinner
and announcement of the results in one go.

270
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,366

271
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,451
Oh, yes. Here, take this.

272
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,536
-You should go too.
-I'll share their ride.

273
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,044
Producer Kim.

274
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,837
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,215
The child that's most important to me…

276
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,677
is Hansang.

277
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,303
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,846
Of course.

279
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,599
I'll be separating
the in-house food division

280
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,893
and launching a new brand soon.

281
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,895
You mean you're expanding your business?

282
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,021
That's right.

283
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,857
I don't care about the result.

284
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,403
-Right.
-This is all just for show anyway.

285
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,907
A show to keep people interested
until the launch.

286
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
Understood?

287
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,829
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

288
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,419
Thank you for your efforts until now.

289
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,838
Right back at you.

290
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,424
"Until now"?

291
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,301
Yu-jin.

292
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,889
I was able to hang on because I at least
had one decent person around.

293
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,182
No, wait.

294
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,769
You're not quitting, are you?

295
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,480
I think I did what I could do.

296
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,983
The food was good, wasn't it?

297
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,902
Why are you doing this?

298
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,404
Well,

299
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,116
I liked being able to cook my food.

300
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,704
It's not cool
copying someone else's recipes.

301
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,417
If you see the country bumpkin chef again,

302
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,002
tell her I said sorry.

303
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,755
What are you planning to do?

304
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,048
Thanks.

305
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,174
Take care.

306
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,927
That's a bit much.

307
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,263
Take care.

308
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,807
Wait, Chef.

309
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,732
I'm everyone's favorite doormat.

310
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,317
They stomp all over me.

311
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,264
You seem pretty attached
to the restaurant.

312
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,772
You can't smoke in Hanok Village.

313
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,649
You're even worse than the doofus.

314
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,193
You brothers are unbelievable.

315
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,696
Neither of you is honest,

316
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,407
and all you know how to do is
beat around the bush and put up a front.

317
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,909
You're just the same, damn it.

318
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,454
Didn't Han Beom-woo

319
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,374
-tell you?
-Tell me what?

320
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,086
That food and the restaurants

321
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,714
are more important to our mother
than her sons.

322
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,259
That's the life we've lived.

323
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,475
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
Yeah.

325
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,448
For growth and self-improvement.

RESIGNATION LETTER
APPLICANT: LEE YU-JIN

327
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,791
I've done more than enough.

328
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,918
I can't take this job anymore, damn it.

329
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,844
Excuse me.

330
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,888
My goodness.

331
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,433
Darn it, I messed up.
I need another envelope.

332
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,767
Who…

333
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,855
What are you doing here?

334
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,613
To be honest, I feel bad for Director Han.

335
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,115
Growing up with Chairman Han, I mean…

336
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,077
Growing up with a mom like that…

337
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,999
Welcome to Han Yeo-ul's Secret Recipe.

338
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,543
I can't wait to find out
what you'll be cooking today.

339
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,836
I'm so excited.

340
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,758
Today, we'll be making a snack
that children love.

341
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,428
-It's something I often made for my sons.
-I see.

342
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,013
-Really? I'm curious.
-Yes.

343
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,890
-Are you?
-Okay, I will…

344
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,018
-That's right. I'll go over the recipe.
-Mom!

345
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,519
Yes. Just a moment, please.

346
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,774
Mom, can't you stay home
and play with me today?

347
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,401
Hello?

348
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,904
I want to switch distributors.

349
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,697
The ingredients aren't fresh.

350
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,702
Is my baby hungry?

351
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,330
Want to eat with Granny?

352
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,427
All right, Beom-woo. Let's eat.

353
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,851
Try this.

354
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,820
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

355
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,281
Let's have another spoonful.

356
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,741
Chew it properly.

357
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,714
Thank you for coming.

358
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,757
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

359
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,636
Apparently, her daughter is abroad
on a business trip right now.

360
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,471
Isn't she a famous chef or something?

361
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,223
She's a crazy workaholic.

362
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,476
She's skipping her own mom's funeral.

363
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,561
That's just not right.

364
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,246
Both Director Han
and Managing Director Han

365
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,165
probably had it rough.

366
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,501
Of course,

367
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,255
everything Director Han did

368
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,965
was wrong.

369
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,677
But the guy

370
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,180
who used to live like that…

371
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,019
met you and the people at Jungjae

372
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,105
and showed regret and remorse.

373
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,399
He seems to have changed.

374
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,321
I really wanted to tell you that.

375
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,533
He'd be too embarrassed and ashamed

376
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,077
to say it himself.

377
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,831
What an idiot.

378
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,875
Sorry?

379
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,342
They'll reach Jungjae
sooner than expected.

380
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,427
Shall we prepare to open for dinner?

381
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,887
Yes, sure.

382
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,971
Okay then.

383
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,310
Where did she go?

384
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,857
It's time to end their ridiculous show.

385
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,776
I just can't wait!

386
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,862
Come by again even after the cook-off!

387
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,323
It was the best. It was awesome.

388
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,700
-Chairman Han is here. Hurry up.
-I almost let the exterior fool me.

389
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,869
That would've been a huge mistake.

390
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:37,707
The food was as great as you'd expect
from a Diamant three-star restaurant.

391
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:42,337
It's time for the judges' evaluation
and the final result.

392
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,422
-Let's go again.
-They're the best.

393
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,341
-They make the best food ever.
-Honey, look.

394
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,097
The judges have arrived.

395
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,599
Hey, the judges are here.

396
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,568
Let's look at that camera too.

397
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,080
Welcome.

398
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,624
Welcome.

399
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,341
It's true that I have
a personal attachment to this restaurant,

400
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,803
but I will judge impartially.

401
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,972
I also

402
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,266
will put my personal feelings aside

403
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,186
and judge fairly and impartially.

404
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,731
All right. Shall we begin then?

405
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,206
This is Coq au Vin.

406
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,917
It's a traditional French dish

407
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,711
cooked with inspiration
from a Korean dish, jjimdak.

408
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,688
Motto served

409
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,150
a Korean dish with a French touch.

410
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,694
Meanwhile,

411
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,990
Jungjae served a French dish
with a Korean touch.

412
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,617
That's fascinating.

413
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,997
Is this the same dish everyone else had?

414
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,833
Did you change anything

415
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,711
or make it special for us judges?

416
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,466
-Myung-sook, get over here.
-What? Me?

417
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,842
Me? Why?

418
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,429
What's the matter?

419
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,724
He asked if this is the same dish
everyone else had

420
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,478
or if there were any special touches
added to the ones served to the judges.

421
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,562
I see.

422
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,692
Well, I wouldn't call it a special touch,

423
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,903
but it is slightly different
from what we served the others.

424
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,156
Well,

425
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,869
it's the doneness
of the meat and vegetables.

426
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,329
I took into consideration

427
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,248
the ages of the judges
and cooked them a bit longer.

428
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,501
Oh, is that so?

429
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,048
Producer Kim, we have the tally
of the evaluators' scores.

430
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,133
-We do?
-Yes.

431
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,805
Okay.

432
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,765
Let's stand by to shoot the result.

433
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,850
-Let's go.
-Okay.

434
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,019
-Stand by.
-Let's go.

435
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,485
The final result

436
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,823
-will be announced by Chairman Han.
-Sure.

437
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,243
All right.
This is making me a bit nervous.

438
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,828
Okay. Shall we see who won?

439
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,497
JUNGJAE WINS
JUNGJAE: 93, MOTTO: 89

440
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,086
It's a surprising result.

441
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,671
Okay.

442
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,256
Jungjae won.

443
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,347
The final result is…

444
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,976
a tie.

445
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,315
We tied?

446
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,900
Pardon?

447
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,612
-What's going on?
-It's a tie.

448
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,905
Madam Chairman.

449
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,033
-This is unfair!
-Producer Kim.

450
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,369
-Yes?
-This isn't right.

451
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,455
-So…
-I don't agree with this.

452
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,584
-This is wrong!
-Oh, okay. I understand.

453
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,669
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.

454
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,547
-Mathieu. Wait.
-No, don't bother.

455
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,384
Mathieu, just a moment. Let's talk.

456
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,094
Was this it?

457
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,099
This is it?

458
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,435
You put on this show just to do this?

459
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,437
You should be ashamed.

460
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,398
Okay then.

461
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,858
We can always find another judge,

462
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,404
but we can't end the competition in a tie.

463
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,614
So how about

464
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,616
a rematch?

465
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,785
A rematch?

466
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,456
A rematch?

467
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,084
We all

468
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,920
put our restaurant on the line for this.

469
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,589
You want a rematch
after pulling all this crap?

470
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you think I'm joking around?

471
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,653
I can't believe the taxi fare
was 300,000 won.

472
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,405
I only just paid off the damn debt.

473
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,617
My gosh. Chef Mo.

474
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,872
I guess I'm not too late.

475
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,250
Let's do that rematch or whatever.

476
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,337
The thing is,
Motto's chef is absent right now, so--

477
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,756
Taste my food.

478
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,176
I'll admit defeat
if you say it's not good.

479
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,179
You don't need to taste
the other restaurant's food.

480
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,518
Wait. First of all, it's great to see you.

481
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,729
-But what are you saying?
-If I lose,

482
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,316
you can wipe out this place,
steal the recipes,

483
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,027
or do whatever you want.

484
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,824
Mo Yeon-joo.

485
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,244
I can't cook right away
as I need time to prepare the ingredients.

486
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,749
If you eat breakfast,
I'll cook for you tomorrow morning.

487
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,876
What do you say?

488
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,129
You seem quite confident,

489
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,799
young chef.

490
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,135
Let's fight fair and square.

491
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,846
Oh dear.

492
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,000
How interesting.

493
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,877
This should be an opportunity.

494
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,090
What do you think
that brazen girl will cook tomorrow?

495
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,301
I don't know.

496
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,845
I guess it doesn't matter.

497
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,640
We just need a clip of me spitting it out.

498
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,644
You only ever think about the company,
don't you?

499
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,730
What?

500
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,149
Never mind.

501
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,821
You should head home first.

502
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,882
What the heck is all this?

503
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,634
What have they done to my garden?

504
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,762
My goodness.

505
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,018
Those damn production people. Jeez.

506
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,692
I sent Myung-sook and Choon-seung home.

507
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,402
What are you still doing here?

508
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,448
So…

509
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,993
About the recipes and stuff…

510
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,247
-I'm sorry for--
-If that's what you want to talk about,

511
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,457
wait until we're done.

512
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,296
Whether you apologize or beg,
I'll hear you out after this is over.

513
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,133
Okay.

514
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,761
I heard you came by.

515
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,312
Yeah.

516
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,649
For me,

517
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,068
cooking good food

518
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,488
for the people who come to the restaurant

519
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,781
is all I care about.

520
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,452
Regardless of who it is that comes,

521
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,457
serving good food
cooked with care and sincerity.

522
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,417
That's what I do.

523
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,796
So don't get the wrong idea.

524
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,771
Let's have a drink.

525
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,225
I didn't expect to find a malt bar
around here.

526
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,191
Who says whiskey bars
should only be in Seoul?

527
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,276
This place…

528
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,364
is interesting and unique.

529
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,995
I don't think we're close enough
to enjoy a drink together.

530
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,839
What's up your sleeve?

531
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,142
You suddenly say you don't care
about Hansang or being the successor

532
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,061
and tell me to keep everything.

533
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,148
Then you participate in a cook-off

534
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,192
to protect that measly restaurant.

535
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,528
What is it that you're really after?

536
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,531
Are you okay…

537
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,786
with living your whole life like this?

538
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,123
Are you really okay with it?

539
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
What are you on about?

540
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,677
When Grandma passed away,

541
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,097
-Mother wasn't around.
-Hey.

542
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,852
Don't you know the company would've folded

543
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,854
if she hadn't traveled overseas
to win the contract?

544
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,648
If that had happened…

545
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,899
I know.

546
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,238
She did everything she could
her whole life

547
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,365
to build up the company for our sake.

548
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,909
It was so we could have a good life.

549
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,329
I know she worked like crazy
despite what people said about her.

550
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,455
I do know that.

551
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,124
But…

552
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,377
was it really for our sake?

553
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,046
Or…

554
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,216
was it for her sake?

555
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,385
You're crazy.

556
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,346
In any case, this isn't going to end.

557
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,896
Is Mother…

558
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,525
even happy?

559
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,648
I HAD A HARD TIME
FINDING SOMETHING SIMILAR, YOU DOOFUS

560
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,612
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,456
It's pretty.

562
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,309
Camera 4, zoom in.

563
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,103
All the cameras are ready.

564
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,605
I can see that.

565
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,865
Stand by, everyone.

566
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,159
Ready, action!

567
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,336
Thank you for coming all this way.

568
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,380
Take a breather, and…

569
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,049
I can breathe just fine.

570
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,552
Let's get right to it.

571
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,412
Can you two sit and wait
instead of bothering me?

572
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,497
I should help--

573
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,916
I can manage on my own,
so just sit and wait.

574
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
You're being distracting.

575
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,452
By the way, what are you going to cook?

576
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,454
Something you like.

577
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,654
Forget money. Forget big titles.

578
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,410
Do you actually have a passion for it?

579
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,163
Think about that.

580
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,582
Whatever it may be.

581
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,920
But then what would you know?

582
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,088
Get off.

583
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,549
We're out of ingredients.
What she's making is it.

584
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,009
-We sold out?
-We sold out!

585
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,220
-Myung-sook!
-We sold out!

586
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,238
From now on,
I'm the ddakji queen of this area.

587
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,452
Myung-sook. I must be a born farmer.

588
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,995
-Look at this.
-You had a while to learn.

589
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,456
-Beom-woo, I grew this. Isn't it amazing?
-My goodness.

590
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,084
Wait.

591
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,193
Hey, Choon-seung. What is it?

592
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,743
Choon-seung. What did she say?

593
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,952
What did she…

594
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,045
Sir?

595
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:50,883
What?

596
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,510
Me?

597
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,470
What? Why? Why am I…

598
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,560
What? You want me to sit here?

599
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,856
-Please follow me to your seat.
-Sorry?

600
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,203
You might as well eat together.

601
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,412
Do you mind?

602
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,256
Why did he have them sit there?

603
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,174
Let me go ask what's going on.

604
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,176
No, wait. Let's see how things go.

605
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,933
You must've prepared something amazing
to cover it up like this.

606
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,521
I'd like to say something
before you start eating.

607
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,608
I'm sorry to say this,

608
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,070
but I didn't cook this last dish
for it to be judged.

609
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,619
What does that mean?

610
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,955
I admit defeat.

611
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,585
Hey, Yeon-joo.

612
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,879
What is this?

613
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,840
What do you want me to do?

614
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,718
Jungjae's main set meal today…

615
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,600
is a home-cooked spread.

616
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,195
It's something any Korean
would've had as a child.

617
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,241
Do you think I'd eat something like this?

618
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:27,247
I was taught that food should be cooked
for those who will be eating it.

619
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,918
I didn't know that my whole life either,

620
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,254
but I only realized it now.

621
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,801
I cooked it with all my heart
for the three of you.

622
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,304
I hope you enjoy it.

623
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,415
Try it. It's good.

624
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,356
You should try it, ma'am.

625
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,298
I can't wait to find out
what you'll be cooking today.

626
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:45,969
Today, we'll be making a snack
that children love.

627
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,765
It's something I often made for my sons.

628
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,308
Really? I'm curious.

629
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,768
-Are you?
-Yes.

630
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,356
Today, I'll show you
how to make shrimp rice jeon.

631
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,440
-Shrimp rice jeon?
-Yes.

632
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,192
Served with cabbage kimchi,

633
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,946
it makes for a perfect combination
and a delicious meal.

634
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,198
Shall we make it together?

635
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,764
It was good.

636
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,561
Especially the cabbage kimchi.

637
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,396
I like it.

638
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,066
A simple home-cooked meal.

639
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,651
It was nice.

640
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,863
Cut.

641
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,492
-Producer Kim.
-Yes, ma'am!

642
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,912
Did we get some decent footage today?

643
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,248
Oh, it's way better than we expected.

644
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,043
With good editing,
we should have people wiping away tears.

645
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,878
Let's wrap things up then.

646
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:43,962
Very well.

647
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,593
I enjoyed your antics.

648
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,164
As promised,

649
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,376
we'll shut down Jungjae.

650
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,294
Even if you do,

651
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,422
you're just going to reopen elsewhere,
aren't you?

652
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:28,924
Of course.

653
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,052
Even if it isn't here,

654
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,388
Jungjae will be wherever we are.

655
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,311
Just stay here.

656
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,817
I got the shots I needed for marketing,

657
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,695
and I'm pleased with the outcome.

658
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,263
Let's…

659
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,725
go for another drink next time.

660
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,370
It must've been a tiring few days.

661
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,630
Let me know…

662
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,217
the next time you visit your grandma.

663
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,416
We jumped a huge hurdle.

664
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,336
I'd have killed you long ago, you know.

665
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,545
That was random.

666
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,175
They say you should
give someone three chances.

667
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,054
Once when you stepped on my cabbage.

668
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,349
Once when you tricked me
with that beef rump.

669
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,477
And once when you pissed me off

670
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,938
with your ideas about plating and whatnot.

671
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,649
-That was--
-And then when Choon-seung came,

672
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,151
you fought him
and turned the restaurant upside down.

673
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,236
Once more then!

674
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,990
Now that I'm listing them,
I gave you way more than three chances.

675
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,120
You know, hearing all that

676
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,583
is making me realize
that we have a lot of memories together.

677
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,503
Anyway,

678
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,881
I'm letting you live despite all you did…

679
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,094
because I like you.

680
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,014
Pardon? What did you say?

681
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,228
I've grown to like you.

682
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,329
I feel the same.

683
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,749
I like you.

684
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,419
No.

685
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,133
I love you.

686
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:16,109
Oh dear,
what an awkward situation we have here.

687
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,861
My goodness.

688
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,780
Sorry. We were going to
give you guys some alone time.

689
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,532
Yeah, we were about to leave.

690
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,660
Finish up what you were doing.
Just go for it.

691
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,412
-Oh, forget it!
-Oh, forget it!

692
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,165
You're a match made in heaven.

693
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,584
You can all go home.

694
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,671
We're going to open as usual
starting tomorrow,

695
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,756
so don't be late.

696
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,218
-Do you think we'd be late?
-I might skip work without notice,

697
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,595
but I'm never late for anything.

698
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:45,472
Should we continue in the alley…

699
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,890
Jeez, this is seriously annoying.

700
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,266
-Get over here.
-What?

701
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,517
-Come here.
-Why are you picking on me?

702
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,646
You wanted to do it here, right?
Go ahead. Hurry up and do it.

703
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,106
My life was nothing but bitter,

704
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,150
but I tasted something I never had before.

705
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,028
Sometimes, it's so spicy
that it makes me frown,

706
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:05,200
but at times, not only is it just spicy,
but it's salty, sour, and astringent.

707
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,579
But ultimately, it tastes so sweet
that it even makes my blood sugar spike.

708
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,998
The taste that I've only come to know
because of you.

709
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,417
The taste of you.

710
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:21,216
AN EX-RESTAURANT CHEF'S BURGER QUEEN

711
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,520
I was cool only when I quit.

712
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,190
You're in the red again today, Young-hye.

713
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,696
Welcome.

714
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,115
How have you been?

715
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,075
What are you doing here?

716
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,454
You chose a questionable location

717
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,164
and an awkward price point.

718
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,628
If you want to sell from a truck,
you need to simplify your menu.

719
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,547
What's this about?

720
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,298
Is Hansang suing me?

721
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,926
No.

722
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,262
I also quit.

723
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,431
Why?

724
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,516
No way.

725
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,684
Do you have feelings for me?

726
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,019
What?

727
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,022
Don't. That makes me so uncomfortable.

728
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,733
I'd rather leave
than listen to this lunacy.

729
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,817
Wait.

730
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,860
If that's not it,

731
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,070
then why are you here?

732
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,701
People say you got big
because of your looks

733
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,037
or because you have a way with words,

734
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,956
but I like your cooking.

735
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,916
I mean it.

736
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,919
Forget Motto and Hansang.

737
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,381
I think you'll do better than them.

738
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,054
So I decided to work with you.

739
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,348
Yu-jin.

740
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,185
I'll take care of the food truck's
sales and marketing.

741
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,228
Even if it's
a small signing bonus, let's--

742
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,773
Please work for free for a while.

743
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,232
What?

744
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:02,650
But…

745
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,029
Aren't you afraid I might report you
for violating the labor law?

746
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,989
Get up here so we can get started.

747
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:15,830
JUNGJAE'S CHEF JIN MYUNG-SOOK'S COQ AU VIN
X 2ND GEN. KONGNAMUL GUKBAP COURSE!

748
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:19,584
2ND GEN. KONGNAMUL GUKBAP

749
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,420
Myung-sook.

750
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,756
People are lined up outside!

751
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,091
Oh my goodness.

752
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:29,969
I'm so nervous
about this collab thing or whatever.

753
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,724
Places in Cheongdam-dong in Seoul
are all about collaborations these days.

754
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:39,187
That's how you become
a famous chef nationwide.

755
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,814
Stop talking and get to work.

756
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,190
It's your restaurant, not mine.

757
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,691
Yes, Chef!

758
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,865
You can't come in yet…

759
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,371
-Hey, Myung-sook.
-Stop bothering me.

760
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,998
-No, look.
-Will you stop?

761
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,884
Hello.

762
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,179
Do I have to wait outside?

763
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,973
I've been here since dawn.

764
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,852
Who told my Eun-jae to wait in line?

765
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,311
Come sit over here.

766
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,980
Right here.

767
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,398
Thank you.

768
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,402
First things first,
I must congratulate you.

769
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,654
My Eun-jae's love has borne fruit.

770
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,780
Oh, right.

771
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,948
-Thank you.
-It's so heartwarming!

772
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,367
-Goodness. Well, thank you.
-Oh gosh.

773
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,618
Please wait a moment.

774
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,538
I'm a huge fan.

775
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,249
I can't believe you came all the way here.
You're so handsome.

776
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,584
Thank you.

777
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,086
Oh, it's cold.

778
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,468
If you don't mind me asking,
which high school did you go to?

779
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,355
Enjoy your meal.

780
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,862
THE LATE YOON OK-SEON

781
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,705
Cut.

782
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,416
How was that?

783
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,212
It was incredibly moving.

784
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,424
People really don't change, do they?

785
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,342
What?

786
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,344
Nothing.

787
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,140
I'll come again, Mom.

788
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,685
Don't get annoyed if I visit too often.

789
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,356
It's so hard to cry for the camera.

790
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,398
That was more than enough.

791
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,275
Be sure to get a close-up.

792
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,402
-Great work.
-Thank you. It came out great.

793
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,238
The first episode will air on May 12th.

794
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,572
Or has she changed?

795
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,333
Hey. Did you wrap it up?

796
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,834
Grab that end.

797
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,628
Okay. Take your time.

798
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,712
MALA MALATANG

799
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,465
Let's move it a bit to the right.

800
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,176
-A bit more.
-I just got here.

801
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,803
It's almost done.

802
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,680
That's perfect. Thanks.

803
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,808
Look at that. Not bad.

804
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,394
Yeah.

805
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,939
The owner is really pleased with it too.

806
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,443
That's good to know.

807
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,572
But is it okay to spend so much
on expenses?

808
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,492
We'll make it big
and turn it into a franchise.

809
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,827
We, as in Hansang.

810
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,955
Right, of course you will.

811
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,283
JUNGJAE

812
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,145
Ma'am.

813
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,696
Chef?

814
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,450
Hey.

815
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,161
Didn't you miss me?

816
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,790
I see you every day.

817
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,004
Hey.

818
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,223
I missed you,

819
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:09,767
you doofus.

820
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,942
I always want to be with you.

821
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,614
I always want to cook for you.

822
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,079
-Thanks to you, at last, I found
-Thanks to you, at last, I found

823
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:31,998
-the taste of you.
-the taste of you.

824
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,067
TASTEFULLY YOURS

825
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,279
