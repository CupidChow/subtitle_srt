1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,147
I forget it all the time.

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,065
Oh my gosh!

4
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,233
Mo Yeon-joo! Where are you going?

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,360
What's the matter with you?

6
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,237
What is it? Is something wrong?

7
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,823
Why are you running
all over the place this morning?

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,244
No, nothing's wrong.

9
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,288
What are you stuttering for?

10
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,456
I didn't.

11
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,543
-When did I stutter…
-Whatever. Be quiet.

12
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,129
We're going grocery shopping,
so watch the restaurant.

13
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,214
Clean up as well.

14
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,007
-You're going out?
-Get a grip.

15
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,425
See you later!

16
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,887
Don't be gone for too long.
I'll be lonely.

17
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,187
The recipe book.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,523
The recipes. Damn it.

19
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,360
The recipe book.

20
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,195
Goddammit.

21
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,285
What the…

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,334
No way.

23
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,588
LAST NIGHT

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,901
He always went on and on about
high-end and premium,

25
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,237
and this is where he works?

26
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,990
By the way, Yu-jin.

27
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,242
Why do you go so far

28
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,954
as to risk everything
to get those three stars?

29
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,831
What do you mean?

30
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,295
I do this because my honor
and pride depend on it.

31
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,298
I do it because my salary
and career path depend on it.

32
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,885
I'll mention the three stars on my resume,
get a new job, and get a raise.

33
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,720
Get a new job?

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,806
Didn't you get into Hansang
through open recruitment?

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,558
It doesn't matter how I got in.

36
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,977
No one stays at one job
for their whole life.

37
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,271
You jump ship if you're offered a raise.

38
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,398
Come on. Help me find it.

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
I found them.

40
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,717
What?

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,513
The recipes Director Han mentioned.

42
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,227
Money, honor, pride.

43
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,896
I found them.

44
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,527
-This has to be thinner.
-Yes, Chef.

45
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,737
-Step aside.
-Yes, Chef.

46
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,158
-Keep it this thin, okay?
-Yes, Chef.

47
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,369
-Let me have a taste test.
-Yes, Chef.

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,290
-It needs more black pepper.
-Yes, Chef.

49
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,922
HAN BEOM-WOO

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,965
CHEF JANG YOUNG-HYE

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,469
Come on, pick up.

52
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,097
Pick up the phone.

53
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,599
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP

54
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:32,897
This was made with 200-year-old
aged soy sauce from North Jeolla Province.

55
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,023
Noted.

56
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,486
All right, everyone. You can do this!

57
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,573
HAN BEOM-WOO

58
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,829
They're Diamant inspectors, so stay sharp.

59
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,247
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

60
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,004
Damn you, Jang Young-hye!

61
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,064
This is grilled red tilefish with scales

62
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,108
served on top of a soy sauce
scaly hedgehog mushroom purée

63
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,527
with Korean mint and spinach oil.

64
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,695
I hope you enjoy it.

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,539
-Two more pinches of salt.
-Yes, Chef.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,755
Fire the next course.

67
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,256
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

68
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,342
You must follow the recipe exactly.

69
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,302
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,846
HOW TO GRILL PINE MUSHROOM

71
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,347
ADD MINCED BEEF RUMP AND MIX
CUT SEOPSANJEOK INTO A SQUARE

72
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,435
-Step aside.
-Yes, Chef.

73
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,183
Damn it.

74
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,108
Wait.

75
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,989
Goodbye. Thank you.

76
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:06,425
TASTEFULLY YOURS

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,887
1 HOUR AGO

78
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,936
This is seopsanjeok,
infused with a wild pine mushroom aroma.

79
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,626
Hey, Jang Young-hye. Follow me.

80
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,297
Hey.

81
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,510
Don't you think…

82
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,722
Don't you think that's just wrong?

83
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,682
It's the trick you came up with
and taught me.

84
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,143
It's what you do best.

85
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,103
I know that.

86
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,355
You're right, but--

87
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,276
You can change your ways
because you won't lose it all right away.

88
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,778
You can switch sides whenever you want
and do as you wish.

89
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,197
But

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,783
did you ever stop to think about Yu-jin
and the other chefs who work for us?

91
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,037
Did you even consider
the people who worked with you?

92
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,083
Get a grip, Han Beom-woo.

93
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,962
This is your workplace,
not that restaurant.

94
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,131
So wrap things up there.

95
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,675
Our three-star menu has to be exclusive.

96
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,637
It can't be a menu people can have
at another restaurant.

97
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,268
You'd better wrap things up quickly.

98
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,326
Goddammit.

99
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:03,084
I'M NOT FEELING WELL DUE TO JET LAG,
SO I'LL BE TAKING THE DAY OFF, CHEF

100
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,544
Jet lag? We were in Japan.

101
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,529
What's up with you two?

102
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:36,242
Hey, Chef, did you hear that rumor?

103
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,369
What rumor?

104
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,746
Some shameless fool from the area

105
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,292
drank all day long, fooled around,
and skipped work without permission.

106
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,835
As if that wasn't bad enough,
the very next day,

107
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,506
he showed his thick face
as if nothing had happened.

108
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,426
Because of him,

109
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,512
a poor woman named Jin Myung-sook

110
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,725
ended up with housewife's eczema

111
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,561
that she'd never had in her 40-year life.

112
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,313
All because she had to do
the damn fool's chores too.

113
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,939
The what fool? The "damn" fool?

114
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,859
Oh, are you upset?
I wasn't talking about you.

115
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,652
Who said I got drunk and fooled around?

116
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,114
-Who on earth said that?
-Oh goodness, I wasn't talking about you.

117
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,782
Gosh, he's funny, isn't he?

118
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,826
Do you know that I returned
after sacrificing myself

119
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,453
for the greater good?

120
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,413
You don't even know anything.

121
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,956
"The greater good"?

122
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,250
Since when did drinking and fooling around
count as the greater good?

123
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,628
-I've never heard of such a thing, Chef.
-Chef Mo.

124
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,838
Have you heard that rumor?

125
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,007
Someone acted like she'd follow
Yu-jin or whatever his name is

126
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,884
to the ends of hell,

127
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,886
only to keep coming back here.

128
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,764
Oh, I get it. It's not that she didn't go.

129
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,974
She couldn't go because she was rejected.

130
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,269
For goodness' sake.

131
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,857
You hit me? Did you just hit me?

132
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,109
Yeah, I hit you!

133
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,111
Stop it.

134
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,632
You think you can get away
with this attitude?

135
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,845
How dare he.

136
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,152
You should apologize to her first.

137
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,987
Why should I?

138
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,032
I'm the one who got beat up
and was wronged,

139
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,075
so why should I apologize?

140
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,952
That happens.

141
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,161
All right?

142
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,997
Do what's best for everyone and let it go.

143
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,250
What am I, everyone's whipping boy?

144
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,043
That goes for Myung-sook
and Beom-woo's ex-girlfriend too.

145
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,711
They're all hounding me.

146
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,880
His ex-girlfriend?

147
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,798
Yeah.

148
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,008
I said I sacrificed myself.

149
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,469
You know
what Beom-woo's ex-girlfriend did?

150
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,681
She kicked my behind
with killer high heels.

151
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,433
I bet she left a hole in my butt cheek.

152
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,517
Why did she come back?

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,061
That's not what's important right now.

154
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,771
My sacrifice is important, okay?

155
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,899
Chef. You're on my side, right?

156
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,576
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP

157
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,916
YU-JIN

158
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,542
I heard you're coming back to Motto.

159
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,711
I look forward
to your glorious return home, sir.

160
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,850
Why are you here in the dead of night
when you're unwell?

161
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,150
Well…

162
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,569
I was out all day long.

163
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,488
How was business?

164
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,740
Did you handle everything?

165
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,991
What are you on about?

166
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,371
Did you lie about being unwell
to go off and see your ex-girlfriend?

167
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,416
You're a psychic.

168
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,584
What?

169
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
Nothing.

170
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,842
Take this with you.

171
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,057
What is it?

172
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,604
You said you're not feeling well.

173
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,941
It's mung bean porridge.
Eat it if you want.

174
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,406
Are you very unwell?

175
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,672
Hey.

176
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,758
You know…

177
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,344
What?

178
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,055
What is it?

179
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,184
Never mind.

180
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,479
It's not important. It can wait.

181
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,565
You're being silly.

182
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,568
Go and get some sleep.

183
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,388
I didn't slack off
because I didn't know how.

184
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,392
Sorry.

185
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,020
I had a sense of responsibility!

186
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,899
You, Choon-seung.

187
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,860
Die!

188
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,284
You dare try to take me on?

189
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,620
Die!

190
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,709
Why would you applaud for nothing?

191
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,379
I'm a golfing genius.

192
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,727
They have no idea
who I was trying to help.

193
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,646
I was…

194
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,107
How could they do this to me?

195
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,451
Jin Myung-sook!

196
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,662
DON'T FORGET YOUR BELONGINGS

197
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,874
BEOM-WOO

198
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,878
Oh, come on.

199
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,798
SHIN CHOON-SEUNG

200
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
He still won't pick up?

201
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,552
Maybe something did happen to him.

202
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,803
I'm sure he's fine.

203
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,180
I already have a lot on my mind as is.

204
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,767
Excuse me, we need chopsticks.

205
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,519
Chopsticks? I'll bring you some.

206
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,784
Aren't you being too harsh?

207
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,414
There was a reason
I couldn't go in for work.

208
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,293
How many times did I tell you?

209
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
There was a reason?

210
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,092
Do you think I go to work
at the restaurant every single day

211
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,845
because I don't have a good reason
to take a single day off?

212
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,805
Do you even know what I had to go through?

213
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,057
What did you say?

214
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,225
You didn't get a word I just said.

215
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,895
Okay, fine. Too bad.

216
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,065
You and I are done as of today.

217
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:46,982
Yeah, we're done!

218
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,486
South and North Korea can't even reunify,
so how can we get along?

219
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,821
-There's no way.
-Gosh, you're smart, aren't you?

220
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,366
Even a passing dog
in this neighborhood is smart, huh?

221
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,494
-A dog?
-Yeah, a dog!

222
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,746
You dog! Woof, woof!

223
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,082
Oh, so you've decided to bite me now?

224
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,209
Fine, go ahead. Bite me.

225
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,794
-Woof, woof!
-Bite me!

226
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,129
Look, everyone!

227
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,964
Caught both of you in the act!

228
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,468
I was wondering why you both skipped work.

229
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,969
Was it so you could fight?

230
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,930
Did you think I couldn't
or wouldn't go AWOL?

231
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,389
Does this look like we're fighting to you?

232
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,308
I got assaulted!

233
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,477
Are you incapable of realizing
that there's a valid reason

234
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,895
as to why you're being assaulted?

235
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,021
Is your head empty?

236
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,941
-Empty!
-Empty!

237
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,901
-Empty!
-Come on.

238
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,154
-Stop it. Will you help me here?
-You little…

239
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,032
-I don't hear anything.
-Pack your things, everyone!

240
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,784
-What did you say?
-What?

241
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,911
Have you all gone deaf or what?

242
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,579
Pack your stuff tomorrow.

243
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,123
Am I getting fired?

244
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,207
Him?

245
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,167
Let's go on vacation.

246
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,086
-What?
-A vacation?

247
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,715
One's distracted and the other two fight
whenever they meet.

248
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,012
You all worked hard to repay the debt,
and you're burned out.

249
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,514
What does "burned out" mean?

250
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,183
Burned out, like in a fire.

251
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,810
We're all burned and nothing's left.

252
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,562
All burned and nothing's left. Okay.

253
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,857
I feel responsible
for not looking out for my staff.

254
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,608
Let's consider this a vacation

255
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,194
to recharge and bring us together.

256
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,948
Recharging and getting closer,
that's great.

257
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,700
But what about the restaurant?

258
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,785
People are more important
than the restaurant.

259
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,703
That's right.

260
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,873
I'll take that to mean you all agreed.

261
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,166
Let's prepare for the afternoon shift.

262
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,959
I'm down.

263
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,378
-Don't fight.
-You're awesome.

264
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,966
I couldn't stop eating.

265
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,301
Me neither.

266
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,513
We're ready to pay.

267
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,639
I'll help with that.

268
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,268
-Three people, right?
-Yes.

269
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,022
Thank you. Please come again.

270
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,816
Welcome.

271
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,526
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

272
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,612
This way. Have a seat, sir.

273
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,201
Should I bring you one set meal?

274
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,285
Yes.

275
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,620
Okay.

276
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,456
-One set meal.
-All right.

277
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,041
Myung-sook.

278
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,918
-What is it?
-Chef Mo.

279
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,502
This is urgent. Come here.

280
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,879
-What?
-What is it?

281
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,882
Where are we going tomorrow?

282
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,759
Stop chatting and get to work.

283
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,552
Come on. Tell us, Chef Mo.

284
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
Mountains or the sea? Where are we going?

285
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,098
Choon-seung,
our customers are still around.

286
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,476
I know you're excited too.

287
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,811
-We're going on vacation tomorrow.
-Keep this up, and I'll call it off.

288
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,609
He didn't eat a thing.

289
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,738
PARADISE RESTAURANT

290
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,335
Last one.

291
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,214
-Gosh, I'm hungry.
-What's that?

292
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,215
What?

293
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,511
Should I bring you one set meal?

294
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,304
Yes.

295
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
Han Beom-woo, the recipe thief,

296
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,103
must apologize and compensate!

297
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,563
PARA…

298
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,736
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP

299
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,627
Hey, Newbie.

300
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,546
Your look…

301
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,051
What's the matter?

302
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,137
What is it?

303
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,555
What's going on?

304
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,223
Sir.

305
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,310
I need to borrow your truck.

306
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,063
My truck? You can't take it.

307
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,815
No, wait. Bye!

308
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,859
Go ahead, take it. It's fine.

309
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,068
The tank's full!

310
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,448
What's going on?

RESTAURANT ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

314
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,675
-Here's our contract.
-Okay.

315
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,346
Please read it carefully and sign here.

316
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,472
Okay.

317
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,974
Yes, of course.

318
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,893
We're almost wrapped up here.

319
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,352
Your business will flourish.

320
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,230
I should hope so.

321
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,608
I'm Han Beom-woo.

322
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,196
-Are you almost done?
-Yes, we're done.

323
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,655
-I'll wait outside.
-Yes, sir!

324
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,407
Yes.

325
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm heading over now. Let's have a drink.

326
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:58,794
MALA MALATANG
BY HANSANG FOOD FIELD

327
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,422
Damn it, you doofus.
You didn't recognize him?

328
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,591
Seriously.

329
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,043
PARADISE RESTAURANT

330
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,135
If you have complaints, tell me now.

331
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,224
I paid you a fair and decent amount

332
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,851
and took over your restaurant.

333
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,352
To be blunt,

334
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,481
you happily sold your restaurant
to the corporation that offered a fortune

335
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,734
only to let sales be cut in half,
causing a deficit.

336
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,320
Is that the company's fault?

337
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,323
We shut down the place
because we had no reason

338
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,533
to keep such a restaurant.

339
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,660
Were you that ticked off
and angry about it?

340
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,622
Or were you angry
that I took your recipes?

341
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,834
Ninety-three days.

342
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,545
That's how long

343
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
I stood out there.

344
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,176
Outside the Hansang headquarters.

345
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,304
I stand here today

346
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,765
to expose the fact that Hansang
is a corrupt corporation.

347
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,100
CORPORATE BULLY
CORPORATE TYRANNY

348
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,521
Don't just walk on by. Please read this.

349
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,773
Corporate bully!

350
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,775
Hansang took my recipes

351
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,945
and shut down my restaurant,
and they must pay!

352
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,739
GIVE ME BACK PARADISE RESTAURANT'S RECIPES

353
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,617
But still, you punks

354
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,620
didn't even bat an eye.

355
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,789
That's why…

356
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,667
I set the fire.

357
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,817
I wanted to show you

358
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,487
that even a worm will turn
when you step on it.

00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,499
But

361
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:47,504
you had no idea I was that worm.

362
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,546
Welcome.

363
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,508
Are you alone?

364
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,387
-Yes.
-Should I bring you one set meal?

365
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,389
-Yes.
-Okay.

366
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,808
As if that wasn't bad enough…

367
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,851
Myung-sook. Chef Mo.

368
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,895
You looked happy.

369
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
You kept…

370
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,444
smiling.

371
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,492
Cut the act.

372
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,579
Do you think that's enough reason
to forgive you for what you did?

373
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,374
What?

374
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,544
You should've taken legal action
or gone to Hansang.

375
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,461
Why would you…

376
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,383
Why would you set our restaurant on fire?
It had nothing to do with it.

377
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,221
"Our" restaurant?

378
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,600
Do those people know

379
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,229
the real reason
why the habitual backstabber

380
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,064
approached them?

381
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,360
What is it?

382
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,407
You treated other restaurants
like they were nothing.

383
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,828
Is that restaurant different?

384
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,539
Do you think

385
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,834
you could be forgiven
for what you've done?

386
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,883
If I ever see you

387
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,386
near our restaurant again,

388
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,681
I'll make sure
to put you behind bars for arson.

389
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,876
Jeonju must be closer than I thought.

390
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,879
Why did you ask to see me?

391
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,881
Sit down.

392
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,970
Why did you go see him?

393
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,390
Did you have someone tail me?

394
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:08,353
Did you go to check on the restaurant
you took over?

395
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,606
The company will handle the arsonist,

396
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,732
so don't mind him.

397
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,276
Okay. I understand.

398
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,820
I heard you're returning to Motto.

399
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,990
Ms. Jeong.

400
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,368
He's coming back, so get things in order.

401
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,702
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,872
Chairman Han.

403
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,041
I heard

404
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,462
Diamant applauded the recipes
you brought over.

405
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,426
The weapons are ready.

406
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,179
Now we just have to
shut down that restaurant.

407
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,850
That's going to take a bit more time.

408
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,027
Get it done quickly.

409
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,322
Like you always have.

410
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,938
I couldn't reach you all day.

411
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,148
Is everything okay?

412
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,191
YEON-JOO

413
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,750
I have to tell her today, no matter what.

414
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,211
I have to tell her today. Today.

415
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,545
Today.

416
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,839
I'll tell her today.

417
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,591
I'll tell…

418
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,135
Mr. Manager.

419
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,348
What…

420
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,102
Turn off the music.

421
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,896
Turn it off!

422
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:21,194
Why do you two look like that?

423
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,695
Is that what you're wearing?

424
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,157
I should be asking
why you're dressed the way you are.

425
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,450
Are you in some biker gang?

426
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,536
Beom-woo, we're going on vacation.

427
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,496
I need you to mind your TOP.

428
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,332
It's TPO, not TOP. Time, place, occasion.

429
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,253
I just don't get people

430
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,839
who care about TPO
when it's just a vacation.

431
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,507
It's so pathetic.

432
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,843
We're going to soothe
and fill our souls, not…

433
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,110
My word, who's this?

434
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,071
We're going on vacation
and the TPO is important.

435
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,198
No, go and get changed. Beom-woo said--

436
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,576
-Hey, hey!
-Why in the world…

437
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,078
This is your TPO, yeah? It's not bad.

438
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,913
Post it on social media.
Don't waste the look.

439
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,208
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

440
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,459
Give me your bag.

441
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
My goodness.

442
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,306
Come on, let's go.

443
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,900
You should ask her out first.

444
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,611
What's the point of
sitting across from each other like that?

445
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,070
Oh my.

446
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,031
How sweet.

447
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,033
LOVELY JOGGER

448
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,211
Choon-seung, play some music.

449
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,171
Yes, boss.

450
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
Yeah!

451
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,567
Let's leave today for the airport

452
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,194
Turn off your phone

453
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,363
Please don't call me

454
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,907
Even if I shout

455
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,492
It can't be helped

456
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,203
I wave my hand gently, bye-bye

457
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,832
Take me to London, Paris, New York City

458
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,544
I've fallen in love
With this beautiful city

459
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,340
Like a bird, bird, a flying bird

460
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:51,260
Freely, I fly, fly, and I breathe

461
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,973
Take me to a new world
Anywhere, wherever it may be

462
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,891
Away from this suffocating--

463
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,602
That's enough, that's enough

464
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,354
You sang enough.

465
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,275
It's snack time.

466
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,072
Snacking is the highlight of a trip.

467
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,158
Do you have anything to drink?

468
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,123
That looks so refreshing.

469
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,801
The fizz has a kick.

470
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,016
Thank you.

471
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,311
Thank you.

472
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,359
The scenery is just amazing.

473
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,987
Beom-woo, step on it!

474
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,335
I think this is it.

475
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,257
This is where the navigation system
brought us.

476
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,470
What, is it nighttime?

477
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,181
Oh, it's not.

478
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,266
Where are we? A rest stop?

479
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,101
We're at a rest stop? When will we arrive?

480
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,895
We arrived.

481
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,188
This is it?

482
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,816
Where's the villa with the pool?

483
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,903
-What about the heated pool and hot tub?
-Myung-sook.

484
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,697
It'll all be down there. Aren't I right?

485
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,532
What are you talking about?

486
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,076
The place we're going

487
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,078
is over there.

488
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,120
What?

489
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,581
-A temple?
-A temple?

490
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,291
Don't you know about templestays?

491
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,253
True inner healing happens
when you leave the secular world.

492
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,340
I got tricked real good!

493
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,258
I'm in shock!

494
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,887
I brought my bikini
thinking there would be a heated pool.

495
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,097
Yeon-joo.

496
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,266
Venerable!

497
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,937
Why are you out in the cold?

498
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,523
I had to come out to welcome you.

499
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,360
Hello.

500
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,445
My restaurant staff I told you about.

501
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,033
It's a pleasure.

502
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,452
Yeon-joo told me a lot about you.

503
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,496
I heard you're a great help to her.

504
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,415
-Just a little.
-Not that much.

505
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,795
She looked after me
and cooked for me when I was young.

506
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,088
She's my aunt.

507
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,925
Yeon-joo, you're all grown up

508
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,635
and introducing me to your colleagues.

509
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,805
Make yourselves at home while you're here.

510
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,473
Let's go inside.

511
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,560
I tried making the spinach kimchi
you made last time,

512
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,812
but it didn't taste the same.

513
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,897
-It didn't?
-Can you make it for me again?

514
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,440
-Shall we? Okay.
-Yeah.

515
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,359
Where's the head monk?

516
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,236
She's away.

517
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,155
Is that the Mo Yeon-joo we know?

518
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,282
Was she always that cute and sweet?

519
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,783
That's impossible.

520
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,973
Come on out.

521
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,854
Is this a vacation or a boot camp?

522
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,356
You can't put this on a woman
who brought a bikini.

523
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,983
I have a feeling

524
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,110
temple clothes are my personal color.

525
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,987
What do you think, Beom-woo?

526
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,488
-Do I look like a Taoist?
-Yeah.

527
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,240
You do. You can be the Cabbage Taoist.

528
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,533
Cabbage?

529
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,244
If I'm the Cabbage Taoist,
you're the Radish Taoist.

530
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,622
-Let's be quiet and go.
-Let's go.

531
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,040
It's this way.

532
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,208
It's this way.

533
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,209
It's this way.

534
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,502
So it's this way.

535
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,000
Yes.

536
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,258
Mushroom. I love zucchini.

537
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,135
Yes.

538
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,433
Yes, yes.

539
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,727
Here, Choon-seung.

540
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,570
Soy sauce.

541
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,571
Thanks.

542
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,658
Myung-sook.

543
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,039
ABSOLUTE SILENCE AT ALL TIMES HERE
DO NOT LEAVE ANY FOOD

544
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,928
Okay, I'm first.

545
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,471
Sir, I'm done.

546
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,892
Do I get anything for finishing first?

547
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,946
I finished first. Do you need help?

548
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,826
Are you practicing silence?
Quiet meditating?

549
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,933
Yeon-joo.

550
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,643
Are you asleep?

551
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,900
You asleep?

552
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,998
Why aren't you asleep?

553
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,337
Oh, so you were awake.

554
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,839
Can't sleep?

555
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,218
No, well, I was just…

556
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,475
So about what I was going to say
the other day…

557
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,060
The moon is so bright.

558
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,603
Oh my.

559
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,106
It really is bright.

560
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,193
What were you saying?

561
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,449
Never mind.

562
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,663
There was someone
I really wanted you to meet here.

563
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,791
The head monk?

564
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,335
How did you know?

565
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,046
I could tell right away.

566
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,508
The person you said was like your mother.

567
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,427
Isn't that her?

568
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,347
Yeah, my mom.

569
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,058
She's not like my mom.

570
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,602
She is my mom.

571
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,550
I'M SORRY. PLEASE TAKE HER IN.

572
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,934
Oh dear.

573
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,772
My gosh.

574
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,616
I was so happy here

575
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,870
that I never thought of
or missed my real mom.

576
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,729
The monks were my aunts and uncles.

577
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,611
And the head monk was my mom.

578
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,702
Can we add the potatoes now?

579
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,371
We sure can.

580
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,339
She always cooked me tasty food,

581
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,466
saying my heart should never get hungry.

582
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,224
There.

583
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,684
-Here.
-Yes.

584
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,853
-One.
-Okay.

585
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,857
-Two.
-That's it.

586
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:57,366
Thanks to the food I cooked with Mom
and everything she taught me to make,

587
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,911
I fell in love with cooking.

588
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,665
Oh, it's vegetables with rice.

589
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,919
SILENCE

590
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,505
Thank you for the food!

591
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,385
Back then, I was

592
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,554
just so happy.

593
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,598
Mom!

594
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,474
-Hey.
-I'm back.

595
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,727
-You're back.
-Be careful.

596
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,605
I'll do it, Auntie.

597
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,772
-What? No.
-Let me.

598
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,692
-It's fine. I'll do it.
-Let me do the rest.

599
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,820
You just got back from school. Goodness.

600
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,488
Did you study hard?

601
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,199
-Yes, but I'm hungry.
-What do you want to eat?

602
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,537
I got accepted to CIA,

603
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,081
and I cried so much

604
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,500
the day I left this place.

605
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,127
Yeon-joo.

606
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,381
Auntie.

607
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,012
Be well and healthy in the US, okay?

608
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,820
It's all okay.

609
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,199
It's okay.

610
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,325
Thank you.

611
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,243
It's okay.

612
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,755
They're people who cared for me every day.

613
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,340
To me,

614
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,468
they're all so special.

615
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,929
Especially my mom.

616
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,684
That's why I wanted you to meet her.

617
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,983
It's okay. We can come back again.

618
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,527
Of course.

619
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,654
We can come back again.

620
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,281
It feels like
I'm always the one doing the talking.

621
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,534
What?

622
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,206
I want to hear your story too.

623
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,794
The cabbage kimchi.

624
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,255
What's the story behind that?

625
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,215
Is it what your mom made for you?

626
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,306
You were so out of it while eating it
when you first came to the restaurant.

627
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,108
No.

628
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,903
It's not what my mom made.

629
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,741
It's what my grandma made.

630
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,118
I see.

631
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,997
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

632
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,584
You can tell me some other time.

633
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,924
The thing is…

634
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:06,638
It's really hard to tell.

635
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,984
HANSANG

636
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,653
The Diamant inspectors
visited Motto yesterday,

637
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,489
and the feedback
was apparently very positive.

638
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,164
You can go.

639
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,384
HAN BEOM-WOO

640
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,094
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO MOTTO

641
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,514
I DON'T NEED HANSANG
OR TO BE THE SUCCESSOR ANYMORE

642
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,071
Hello?

643
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,327
Oh, I'm sorry.

644
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,079
I bought my phone recently.

645
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,789
Call me again in two years.

646
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,543
Damn it.
Shouldn't they have called by now?

647
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,712
Do you think we failed?

648
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,757
Let's wait a bit more. Korea and the US
have different time zones.

649
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,967
Don't you mean France?

650
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,303
-It's the Diamant Guide.
-I know, okay? I know.

651
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,015
Wait.

652
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,898
Hello?

653
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,361
Hello. How are you?

654
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,364
Oh, is that so?

655
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,159
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

656
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,623
What did they say?

657
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,501
Well?

658
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,921
The Diamant Guide gave three stars

659
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,133
to just one restaurant in Korea.

660
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,684
Three stars!

661
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,311
Three stars!

662
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,063
-Three stars!
-Three stars!

663
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,023
Cheers!

664
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,919
Did you have a peaceful stay?

665
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,007
Everyone in the world commits wrongs.

666
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,511
Another word we use
for foolishness is "ignorance."

667
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:56,224
It means those who don't know
the truth of things are in the dark.

668
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,394
I hope that
when you return to your places,

669
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,856
you each find your truth.

670
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,904
He doesn't need it, my ass.

671
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,490
Han Beom-woo, you dare deceive me?

672
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,955
We're back.

673
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,998
Well done, everyone.

674
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,000
Get home safely,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

675
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,377
-See you.
-Bye.

676
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,466
What are you doing?
I'll drive you to the inn.

677
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,219
Hey, Choon-seung.

678
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:18,140
I have to discuss something with Chef Mo.

679
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,143
You want to work right after a vacation?
Just get back in.

680
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,312
Take care of my stuff for me.

681
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,356
-Okay?
-I said I'd drop you off. Get in!

682
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,359
Just go. Start driving.

683
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,070
You know…

684
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,284
I've changed a lot since I came here.

685
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:26,041
I met you, Myung-sook, and Choon-seung

686
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,835
and realized
we don't go through life alone.

687
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,298
And…

688
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,010
I realized that sincerity
means more than money…

689
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,557
and that people are more important.

690
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,769
I learned all those things…

691
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,190
from you, Yeon-joo.

692
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,281
That's why…

693
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,327
there's something

694
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,622
I have to say today.

695
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,659
Yeon-joo.

696
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:52,794
You're here.

697
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,507
I came out of curiosity.

698
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,468
To see if you were done
shutting things down.

699
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,387
Shutting down?

700
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,560
No, well, you see…

701
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,270
I guess the chef doesn't know

702
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:15,525
why you came here
and why you're working here.

703
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,486
Listen, Chef.

704
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,696
Han Beom-woo's actually--

705
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,822
Han Sun-woo!

706
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,959
You tell me yourself.

707
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,045
What's he saying?

708
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:46,681
At…

709
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,645
At first…

710
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:54,773
At first…

711
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,945
I was going to take the recipes
once I took over the restaurant

712
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,073
and shut it down.

713
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,240
At first.

714
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,287
You were going to take my recipes…

715
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,750
and shut down my restaurant?

716
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,425
That was the plan at first.

717
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,426
"At first"?

718
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,013
You already sold a dish
made with the recipe you stole from here.

719
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,225
Wild pine mushroom seopsanjeok.

720
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,018
That's your recipe, isn't it?

721
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,148
Your restaurant, Motto,
got three stars with that dish.

722
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:38,900
Congratulations.

723
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,243
Please.

724
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,958
Let me tell her.

725
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,753
Is it true?

726
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,800
Is it?

727
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,138
Is it?

728
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,862
Yeah.

729
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,052
I meant to tell you the truth sooner.

730
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,303
The truth?

731
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,096
When?

732
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,057
When were you going to tell me?

733
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,935
After all the lying and stealing,

734
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,479
now you tell the truth?

735
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,355
Will you hear me out?

736
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,315
How…

737
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:04,986
How…

738
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:12,160
How could you toy with my sincerity?

739
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:18,833
Yeon-joo.

740
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,293
Get out.

741
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,630
Get out.

742
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,759
Please leave.

743
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,598
Please.

744
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,978
JUNGJAE

745
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,324
Just…

746
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,121
Just let me go.

747
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,838
Why don't you beat me up this time?

748
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,299
Come on.

749
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,598
If only you hadn't lied
and said you didn't need Hansang,

750
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,601
I wouldn't have gone this far!

751
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,526
Goddammit.

752
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,048
I never got to tell you.

753
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,510
I'm sorry.

754
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,261
TASTEFULLY YOURS

755
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,305
I'm sorry, but we need to
close the restaurant for a while.

756
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,267
I don't know what to do.

757
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,644
He's a con man. He's a fraud!

758
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,981
I'm sorry this is all I know to do.

759
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,942
I wonder if I was the only one
who was sincere.

760
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,402
I'll see to it that the chef girl

761
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,613
won't be able to set foot
in this industry.

762
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,324
Jungjae might disappear.

763
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,743
Why would
a perfectly fine restaurant disappear?

764
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,913
