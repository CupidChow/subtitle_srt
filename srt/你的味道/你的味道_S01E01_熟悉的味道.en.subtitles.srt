1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,484
HANSANG

3
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,861
A PERFECT MEAL PREPARED WITH UTMOST CARE

4
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,367
I gave the neobiani recipe
to the sous-chef at Motto right away

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,745
and got the papers for acquisition
signed all right, sir.

6
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,915
Everything went smoothly this time.
All taken care of, sir.

7
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:26,086
As for the grilled abalone restaurant,
I kept trying to bring them around,

8
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,048
but they said they'd sell the place
over their dead body.

9
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,217
That if I showed up again, forget Hansang,

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,218
they'd just turn the…

11
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,851
Turn the place upside down, will they?

12
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,355
Well, maybe not that far.
I'll go back tomorrow--

13
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,693
Will tomorrow ever come for you?

14
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,778
Sorry?

15
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,738
There's an eraser in my head.

16
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,032
I won't remember you tomorrow.

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,202
Starting now,

18
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,329
it'll only take an hour.

19
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,672
DIRECTOR HAN BEOM-WOO

20
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,717
MANAGING DIRECTOR HAN SUN-WOO

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,886
Good morning, sir.

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,934
Let me quickly go over today's schedule.

23
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,936
The meeting should take about an hour.

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,230
Right after,
Mr. Baek from the subsidiary--

25
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,356
-Look.
-Yes, sir.

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,816
You're boring me.

27
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,317
Right. I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,407
Should we get started?

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,161
Sir, the managers of Sales Team 1
and Strategic Planning aren't here yet.

30
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,038
Seriously? I can't believe these people.

31
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,292
Only freeloaders
would keep the director waiting.

32
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,087
-Lock the door on the dot.
-Yes, sir.

33
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,216
MID-TO-LONG TERM PROFIT STRATEGY
FOR HANSANG

34
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,886
Why don't we start with Hansang XP?

35
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,137
Sure.

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,056
As part of the group's upcoming
Korean whiskey project,

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,311
we're developing cedar-cask spirits
to pair with menus at La Lecel and Motto--

38
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,650
Who needs all that explanation?
Do we look like rookies to you?

39
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,653
Isn't the National Tax Service
on your back?

40
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,782
Yes, liquor gets taxed separately,
so the NTS--

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,535
Brand it as traditional liquor,
not whiskey.

42
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,996
But the project is already underway--

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,915
-Hey, Legal Team.
-Yes, sir.

44
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,292
-What's the tax cut on traditional booze?
-I'll check.

45
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,587
It's 72% for distilled
but only 36% for traditional.

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,172
-Legal Team?
-Yes, sir.

47
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,423
Stay behind after the meeting.

48
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,216
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,010
Aren't you supposed to be the expert?

50
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:43,139
But a traditional license
is only for folk or local specialties--

51
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,849
-Hey, Production Team.
-Yes, sir.

52
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:49,270
Use local products or traditional liquor
to develop a spirit fit for aging.

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,064
-Hey, Sales Team.
-Yes, sir.

54
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,735
Drop the whiskey label. Will you line up
an OEM-capable master or distiller?

55
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,736
I'll check, sir.

56
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,616
I'm not asking. I'm telling you to do it.

57
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,825
Of course, sir.

58
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,748
All right! What's next?

59
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,583
Next on the agenda is…

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,252
HANSANG

61
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:17,048
Han Beom-woo, the recipe thief,
must apologize and compensate!

62
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:22,011
Corporate bully Hansang
must take responsibility and compensate!

63
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
CORPORATE BULLY!

64
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:27,809
Han Beom-woo, the recipe thief,
must apologize and compensate!

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,898
Corporate bully Hansang
must take responsibility and compensate!

66
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,694
Han Beom-woo, the recipe thief,

67
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,655
-Look at him trying so hard.
-must take responsibility and compensate!

68
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,073
Such a hardworking folk.

69
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,408
Corporate bully!

70
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,162
HANSANG RUINED MY BUSINESS
AND THE DIRECTOR DRIVES A LUXURY CAR

71
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,873
He's coming this way.

72
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,250
What for?

73
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,168
What is it?

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,461
What can you do?

75
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,632
What do you want?

76
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,180
Damn, he looks scary as hell.

77
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,528
A table for two!

78
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,616
What was that?

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,703
JANGSU ABALONE

80
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,079
Excuse me!

81
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
Move your car, will you?

82
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,502
This is a waiting area for our customers.

83
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,046
Come on!

84
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,340
-Mr. Yoo Su-min?
-That's me.

85
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,510
Is that right?

86
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,970
Move out.

87
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,851
Watch your tone with me.

88
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,937
I was just thinking out loud.
You heard that? Sorry.

89
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,733
This place is packed.

90
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,360
I heard your grilled abalone
is the real deal.

91
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,529
Who are you? You here to pick a fight?

92
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,739
One moment.

93
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,417
So, you're an illegal gambler?

94
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,714
What's your deal, asshole?

95
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,007
"Asshole"?

96
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
Now, that's an insult.

97
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,220
Put them away! Quick!

98
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,808
What if your family
and business partners find out?

99
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,481
Your mother owns this place, doesn't she?

100
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,026
Please talk to her for us.

101
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:54,455
TASTEFULLY YOURS

102
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,916
The grilled abalone restaurant
is ready to seal the deal.

103
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,584
How did you make it happen, sir?

104
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,254
Who is this? You got the wrong number.

105
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,214
Shame on me. I won't let you down again--

106
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,342
-Who are you? I don't know you.
-But sir--

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,558
Welcome, sir.

108
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,146
What's with the faces?
You look like cats on a hot tin roof.

109
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,397
Why the sudden visit, sir?

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,816
-I own this place, don't I?
-Of course, sir.

111
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,196
Chef Jang Young-hye
hasn't been answering my calls lately.

112
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,785
Well, she's really busy these days.

113
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,495
So am I.

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,295
Look at these dishes.

115
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,299
They looked far better in the old place.

116
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,176
Don't you agree?

117
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,139
We'll never get a three-star rating
with this kind of sloppy plating.

118
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,974
We'll be downgraded instead.

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,019
After all that I did to get that recipe…

120
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,354
Would this make me proud?

121
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,482
Or not?

122
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,151
I'm sorry, sir.

123
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,240
Unbelievable.

124
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,623
Gold leaf.

125
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,716
Not bad.

126
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,593
Right?

127
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,987
-Smoked?
-Yes, over straw fire--

128
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,113
Oh, please.

129
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,408
-Spare me the lecture.
-I'm sorry, sir.

130
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,577
I'm not a cook.

131
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,621
It's on you to make delicious food.

132
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,790
Then I spice things up to drive sales.

133
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,251
From flame to finish,
right before the customer.

134
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,502
Sequence dining.

135
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,712
I told you to keep that in mind.

136
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,298
Presentation alone doesn't cut it.

137
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,970
Maybe let the customer pour the sauce.
Experience marketing, you know?

138
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,265
Understood, sir.
I'll inform Chef Jang right away.

139
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,353
Is the truffle neobiani the main course?

140
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,898
Well, Chef Jang has yet to finish…

141
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,530
Where is she?

142
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,158
Where is Jang Young-hye?

143
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,496
Excellent! One, two!

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,874
That's great. You look amazing.

145
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,752
Nice! You could pass for an actress.

146
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,215
Amazing! One more time. One, two. Nice.

147
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,511
Let's have you hold up that wine glass
for a few final shots.

148
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,596
Okay, let's go.

149
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,347
One, two. That's great.

150
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,226
Now, a gentle smile for the camera.
One, two!

151
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,522
I heard reserving a table at Motto
these days is like winning the lottery.

152
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,275
They say it's easier to win the lottery.

153
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,156
Of course. You're fully booked
for the next three months.

154
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,325
How does that make you feel?

155
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,744
I'm so grateful.

156
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:24,415
My staff tell me that some people
resell their reservations at a markup

157
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,043
like it's a K-pop concert or something.

158
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,213
I don't know why they go that far.
It puts me in a pickle.

159
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,257
That's pretty intense.

160
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,888
Where do you usually find inspiration
for new dishes?

161
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,559
Much of it comes from
my grandmother's cooking when I was a kid.

162
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,605
My paternal grandmother
used to make the best cabbage kimchi.

163
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,482
-Your maternal grandmother.
-Oh my gosh!

164
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,655
-Let's take a quick break.
-Sure, let's do that.

165
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,867
Your maternal grandmother, you fool.

166
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,497
That's what you said during the interview
with the other magazines.

167
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,539
Did I?

168
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,377
I have every reason to be confused.

169
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,547
I go on and on about some cabbage kimchi
I've never even tried.

170
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,592
I like the cabbage kimchi. It's tasty.

171
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,470
I didn't know "tasty"
was in your vocabulary.

172
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,141
Anyway,

173
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,978
stop giving interviews
without the PR Team's sign-off.

174
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,606
-It's a breach of contract.
-Oh, yeah?

175
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,610
What about launching a new menu
without the head chef's approval?

176
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,362
That's a breach too, right?

177
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,366
You make it sound like
I didn't give you time to work on it.

178
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,619
How could I possibly whip up
all those courses in one month?

179
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,871
If you hadn't been off
chasing the limelight,

180
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,624
you or anyone could have pulled it off.

181
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,129
The limelight?

182
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,589
Was any of that for my benefit?

183
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,217
I did it all for Motto, all right?

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,387
To promote the restaurant.

185
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,139
Three stars.

186
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,769
When it comes to restaurant marketing,
I'm the expert here.

187
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,271
So leave it to me.

188
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:15,484
You, Chef Jang Young-hye,
just get me those three stars.

189
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:21,407
With no room for creativity, I can't just
pull three stars out of thin air.

190
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,789
Creativity?

191
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,500
Do I ever ask that of you? Creativity?

192
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,294
No.

193
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:39,341
I got you the most famous recipes
in Seoul, no, in all of Korea.

194
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:44,346
So just follow them to a tee
and make the food look pretty.

195
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,723
Is that really so hard?

196
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:50,394
I nearly forgot about you
and your obsession with three stars.

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,690
We'll be launching this season's menu
the day after tomorrow, as scheduled.

198
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,610
You have until then

199
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,363
to perfect the truffle neobiani,
our main dish.

200
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,449
Got it, Chef Jang Young-hye?

201
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,927
Have you been busy? I heard
you haven't been going to the riding club.

202
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,471
Are you keeping tabs on my schedule now?

203
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,140
Take it easy.
No need to push yourself so hard.

204
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,809
But then again, it must be tough

205
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,103
for a team that only sold frozen food
to run a fine dining restaurant.

206
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,314
If only your team had done better
with the restaurants.

207
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,108
I'm busting my ass because your food
is worse than frozen food.

208
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,784
No matter how hard you try,
it's your one star up against my two.

209
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,826
You know that, right?

210
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,787
Let's make something clear.

211
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,414
Motto got one star right out of the gate,

212
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,625
whereas La Lecel

213
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,962
took three years to earn two stars.

214
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,631
Now, who's up against who?

215
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,093
Don't push it, Beom-woo.

216
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,642
You had a little something.

217
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,444
I'll let you off the hook this time.

218
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,076
Today, the residents of Bakdanri Village
are getting together to do kimjang,

219
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,373
and they're getting a surprise visit
from none other than…

220
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,666
Hello, everyone!

221
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,252
…Chairman Han Yeo-ul
of Hansang Food Field!

222
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,296
This is yellow corn flour.

223
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,673
Chairman Han
has brought yellow corn flour.

224
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,092
It's added to the mix for a richer flavor.

225
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,052
It looks so delicious!

226
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:54,101
Listen, I'll pack all this up for you
and deliver your kimchi nationwide!

227
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,187
I'm never doing that again.

228
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,774
Chairman Han Yeo-ul
is making a huge offer to deliver--

229
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,493
This is saw-edged perch from Yeosu.

230
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,680
-Park?
-Yes, ma'am.

231
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,142
How long have you been with us?

232
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,519
About seven years, ma'am.

233
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,607
You made sugata sashi out of this
rare saw-edged perch.

234
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,650
Pardon?

235
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,070
I'd prefer a feast for the tongue,
not just the eyes.

236
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,489
-You hear me?
-My apologies, ma'am.

237
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,868
-Come with us.
-Forgive me, ma'am.

238
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,329
Ma'am!

239
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,958
I'm sorry. Please give me another chance!

240
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,293
-None of them lasts ten years.
-Please give me another chance!

241
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,095
Listen, sons.

242
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,848
I've dedicated my whole life to food.

243
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,476
But you know…

244
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,522
That guide or whatever from overseas

245
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,193
giving out those petty little stars.

246
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,862
Those standards drive me mad.

247
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,574
But my anger

248
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,537
has no legs to stand on.

249
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,624
Is the great Hansang Group…

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,213
struggling to get
those three measly stars?

251
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,258
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,845
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,179
Mark my words.

254
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,682
Three stars.

255
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,270
Whoever brings me that first
will be the next owner of Hansang.

256
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,155
THE DIAMANT GUIDE SEOUL

257
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,203
TRUFFLE NEOBIANI

258
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,175
This is our main dish, truffle neobiani.

259
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,243
How long did this take?

260
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,790
Exactly one month and five days
since you gave me the recipe.

261
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,208
It took you long enough.

262
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,586
It has a nice kick to it.

263
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,132
But the plating…

264
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,308
I guess we could launch it
as a Motto original.

265
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,272
All right. We're launching
the new menu tomorrow as scheduled.

266
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,236
We have to get three stars this time,
no matter what.

267
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,904
Is that clear?

268
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,863
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

269
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,989
Director Han!

270
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,371
I told you, I don't know you.
You keep popping out of nowhere.

271
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,957
Sir, you need to hear this.

272
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,087
There's a restaurant that also has
truffle neobiani on their menu.

273
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,679
What the hell…

274
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,807
What the hell are you talking about?

275
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,771
What?

276
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,773
It looks exactly the same.

277
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,153
I did a quick search on SmartGPT
for a similar dish, just to be safe.

278
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,073
What's the motto of Motto?

279
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,283
"Unique, only one."

280
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,076
-That's how we'll get the three--
-I get it.

281
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,539
This looks like a fine-dining restaurant.
Where's this place?

282
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,499
Jeonju, sir.

283
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,709
Fine Dining Jeonju?

284
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,670
Which company is it affiliated with?
Do they have a Diamant star?

285
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,630
One star? Or two stars?

286
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,467
It's located in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do.

287
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,303
I see.

288
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,140
Anyway, damn it, the launch is tomorrow.
What do you suggest we do?

289
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,641
I don't know.

290
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,730
I'll hold off on the pamphlet order,

291
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,318
as well as the influencer bookings
we've lined up for the launch.

292
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,694
Who said you could?

293
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,531
I'll take care of it today.
Just have everything on standby.

294
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,870
How dare they mess up my plan?

295
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,727
Come on.

296
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,688
ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS
WHILE WALKING SLOWLY

297
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,439
Are you kidding me?

298
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,822
I have no time to walk slowly,
let alone enjoy anything right now.

299
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
Turn left shortly.

300
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,403
Turn right in about ten meters.

301
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,113
WALK FOR 20 MINUTES

302
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,241
Turn right.

303
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,119
-What in the world…
-You have gone off route.

304
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,871
-Come on!
-This is an accident-prone area.

305
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,456
-Oh my gosh!
-Oh jeez.

306
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,752
-How do I get here?
-What do you mean, here?

307
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
Never mind. Enjoy yourself.

308
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,256
Have fun taking pictures.

309
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,883
Searching for a new route.

310
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,968
Man, what a town.

311
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,889
Turn left.

312
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,099
Go straight shortly.

313
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,286
-You'll soon arrive at your destination.
-Am I going the right way?

314
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,500
Where on earth is this place?
It's impossible to find.

315
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,126
Where… This has to be the right place.

316
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,882
JUNGJAE

317
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:08,011
You have arrived at your destination.
Ending navigation.

318
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,143
What the heck?

319
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,233
I guess retro is the trend these days.

320
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,362
BREAK TIME
15:00 - 17:00

321
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,614
JUNGJAE

322
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,032
"Jungjae"?

323
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,870
Interesting.

324
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,959
What, should I announce myself now?

325
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,838
Goodness gracious.

326
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,242
Excuse me.

327
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,092
Ma'am?

328
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,720
Sir?

329
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,473
Anybody?

330
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,768
Anyone…

331
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,999
Excuse me. Hello.

332
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,545
Hello?

333
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,382
Where can I find the owner of this place?

334
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,094
Goodness, is she hard of hearing?

335
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,472
Excuse me.

336
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,808
Is the owner of this restaurant around?

337
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,194
Excuse me?

338
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,863
What?

339
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,824
That's dangerous!

340
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,587
Damn it!

341
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,634
Hey! What was that for?

342
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,845
Seriously. Excuse me!

343
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,600
All that over some worthless napa cabbage?

344
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,814
Anyway, where's the owner?

345
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,441
This is who I am.

346
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,319
You know Hansang, right?

347
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,490
I need to have a word
with the owner of this restaurant.

348
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,033
So can you tell me…

349
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,003
What are you playing at?

350
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,255
I can't believe this.

351
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,757
I haven't felt this fired up in a while.

352
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,180
Hey!

353
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,516
Stop for a second.

354
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,315
Are you the owner here?

355
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,699
Even so, did you have to tear up
my business card like that?

356
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,202
I'm just here to ask about this neobiani.

357
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,246
You made this, right?

358
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,276
Right then.

359
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,403
Ma'am?

360
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,782
If you don't mind, I'd like some neobiani…

361
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,373
You mean you can't
because it's break time, right?

362
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,501
I'll come back in two hours for dinner.

363
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,794
I don't think so.

364
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,171
So you can talk?

365
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,549
Why can't I come back?

366
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,885
Ma'am?

367
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,553
You owe me an apology.

368
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,472
Do I?

369
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,556
For what?

370
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,146
For earlier?

371
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,359
Do you have any idea
how expensive this suit is?

372
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,821
And do you know
the price of the cabbage you stepped on?

373
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,614
How much?

374
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,742
How much do you want?

375
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,286
-Typical spoiled rich boy.
-Excuse me?

376
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,247
Be it soft rot or downy mildew,

377
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,875
it survived every pest and disease
through the summer.

378
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,337
I sowed the seedling,
then tilled and fertilized the soil.

379
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,507
How much are you willing to pay
for the life of my precious baby?

380
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,311
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,148
I sincerely apologize.

382
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,276
That aside, about this neobiani--

383
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,820
It's not neobiani
but seopsanjeok, you doofus.

384
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,114
What? Doofus?

385
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,369
Whatever you call it,
will you make me some--

386
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,495
I won't.

387
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,582
Will you please stop cutting me off?

388
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,791
I'm out of ingredients.

389
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,376
You can go buy them.

390
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,545
They're not easy to come by.

391
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,425
What in the world do you need?

392
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,136
It's not like
I'm asking for a lavish royal feast.

393
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,680
Why don't you go get them yourself,
you punk?

394
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,765
Punk?

395
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,100
Punk?

396
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,769
Did you just call me a punk?

397
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,572
All right. What is it that you need?

398
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,531
Chef?

399
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,241
Beef rump.

400
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,077
Beef rump?

401
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,746
Yes, beef rump.

402
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,790
Is that all you need?

403
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,962
From a cow raised by Jeong Seong-cheol
at Mawon Farm.

404
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,672
That's the beef rump I need.

405
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,429
Look, Chef, it's all the same anyway.
I'll get the best, most expensive cut--

406
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,472
Enough!

407
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,809
It has to be that beef rump.

408
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,730
Darn it!

409
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,945
It's basically the same stuff.
Why's she being so picky?

410
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,242
STREAMSIDE NAMBU MARKET

411
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,799
Hey, give me 200 grams of beef rump.

412
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,427
The best, most expensive cut you've got.

413
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,183
From a cow raised by Jeong Seong-cheol
at Mawon Farm.

414
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,560
That's the beef rump I need.

415
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,478
Wait a second.

416
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,189
-What a pain.
-What was it? Dawon?

417
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,733
Mawon?

418
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,569
Bawon?

419
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,822
Anyway, I heard that farm raises cows.

420
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,992
Give me 200 grams of beef rump
from a cow raised on that farm.

421
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,418
Thank you.

422
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,005
Go on and find it if you can, young man.

423
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,674
Beef rump from Mawon Farm.

424
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,886
Who is he kidding?

425
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,061
Is the whole town messing with me today?

426
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,396
Am I being pranked or something?

427
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,316
What is he going on about?

428
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,693
You know what?

429
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,780
I'll take everything from here to there.

430
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,578
I'll also take everything in that fridge.
And let's see…

431
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,706
Just give me all the beef rump you've got.

432
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,416
Goodness me!

433
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,171
Honey, we're having a feast today!
We'd better butcher a whole cow!

434
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,380
Wait, hang on.

435
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,382
I'd like the beef rump

436
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,053
of that cow you're planning to butcher.

437
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:14,182
Oh my! You're my lucky star, aren't you?
I'll be right back.

438
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,105
Hello? Any news from La Lecel?

439
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,316
Nothing from Han Sun-woo yet?

440
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,986
Okay, talk to you later.

441
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,747
I'm out of eggs.

442
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,044
Well, I'd love to sell some.

443
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:30,174
But my wife hurt her back
collecting eggs this morning.

444
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,803
She's away in the hospital right now,
so what can I do?

445
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,597
What's that got to do with selling eggs?

446
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,101
Those chickens only allow her
to take their eggs.

447
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,187
If someone else goes in,
they just sit there like rocks.

448
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,355
I'm telling you.

449
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,357
They won't budge at all.

450
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,484
So you don't need to sell eggs
to get by, huh?

451
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,321
I'm serious! Why would I lie to you?

452
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,867
You can collect them yourself if you want…

453
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,076
Oh my.

454
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,245
Well, aren't you brave.

455
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,288
Be careful.

456
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,540
They even feed on snakes.

457
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,147
You little…

458
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,066

That hurts!

462
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,681
You popped out of nowhere and scared me!

463
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,517
Do that again,
and I'll hit you with my sickle.

464
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,394
What did I do?

465
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,729
Lurking outside someone else's restaurant.

466
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,439
What are you, a pervert?

467
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,191
Perv…

468
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,402
You asked for it!

469
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,903
Beef!

470
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
What beef?

471
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,825
Beef rump?

472
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,911
Beef, beef, rump, rump.

473
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,498
Who knew a lunatic like yourself
would show up at my restaurant?

474
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,252
That's a bit rich coming from you.

475
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,922
I told you to get beef rump,
not to turn beef-brained.

476
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,425
Beef rump.

477
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,346
I scraped up every last piece
of Mawon Farm beef rump in town.

478
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,140
You see this?

479
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,766
"Mawon Farm."

480
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,352
When I say I'll do something, I do it.

481
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,980
Ready to cook? Should I turn the stove on?

482
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,358
Why are you smelling that?

483
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,447
How dare you try to con me,
you sneaky little thing?

484
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,991
What?

485
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,550
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

486
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,511
-But I really need that neobiani today--
-Seopsanjeok.

487
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,349
Yes, that seop thing. That sanjeok thing.

488
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,725
I must have it, no matter what.

489
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,518
-Why are you--
-Why am I going this far?

490
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,479
Because I must have it.

491
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,773
Because I need to have it!
Because I want it!

492
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,983
Why are you being so loud?

493
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,568
That was my question actually.

494
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,490
And you keep saying you want it,
but your face is telling me otherwise.

495
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,742
Don't judge a book by its cover.

496
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,537
I truly want it with all my heart.

BREEDING FACILITY: MAWON FARM

499
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,368
What the hell?

500
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,537
So there was one from Mawon Farm.

501
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,750
Do you like hiking?

502
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,753
No.

503
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,007
Mushrooms?

504
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,676
You can get them from the supermarket.

505
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,136
Why climb a mountain for it?

506
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,638
Why look for it in the mountain?

507
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,558
I'm a director of a large corporation.

508
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,687
I hit the emergency button,
and they all show up.

509
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,190
The press and the police included.

510
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,736
Let me just say, now that we're out here,

511
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,279
don't get any funny ideas.

512
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,160
Quit being a drama queen.
You're not going to die.

513
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,122
All I want…

514
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,709
All I want is for you to make me a meal!

515
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,687
I found it!

516
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,690
It's right here!
You want mushrooms, right? Here it is.

517
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,816
Let's go back now.

518
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,985
That one's too young. It's no good.

519
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,363
It's basically the same stuff.

520
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,615
There's one right here.

521
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,213
What is it?

522
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,173
Did you find something?

523
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,854
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

524
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,606
I picked a mushroom.

525
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,150
You can just buy it. Why risk danger?

526
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,445
The moment pine mushroom's picked,

527
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,280
its fragrance starts to fade.

528
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,991
So it's crucial to keep it intact.

529
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,495
Even the tiniest scratch
can change the flavor.

530
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,665
But then what would you know?

531
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,916
Get off.

532
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,506
YEON-JOO'S

533
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,951
Is that cabbage kimchi?

534
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,996
What else could it be? Radish kimchi?

535
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,581
Can I try some?

536
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,167
If you want.

537
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,024
Chew it properly.

538
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,493
Your food is my favorite, Grandma.

539
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,250
It's good.

540
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,605
Snap out of it.

541
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,858
You're here on business.

542
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,735
He really must be a lunatic.

543
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:19,078
The ingredients are different,
and so is the recipe.

544
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,080
It's a completely different dish.

545
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,584
The meat looks thicker.

546
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,002
Is it minced meat?

547
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
The pine mushroom is oven-roasted.

548
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,176
The similar mushroom garnish
could confuse people,

549
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,303
but it's a different dish for sure.

550
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,446
Thanks for letting me watch.

551
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,198
It looks delicious.

552
00:42:59,034 --> 00:42:59,952
What are you doing?

553
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,207
Is this enough for the food?

554
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,010
Fine.

555
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,221
Since you put so much effort into it,
I'll give it a try.

556
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,058
What are you going on about,
talking to yourself?

557
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,923
What is this?

558
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,676
Neobiani is made by scoring
thinly sliced meat,

559
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,054
then marinating and grilling it.

560
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,390
Seopsanjeok is made by mincing the meat,
kneading it into a patty,

561
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,475
and grilling it.

562
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,271
-The pine mushroom gives it the kick.
-I see you picked up a few things.

563
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,906
How much does the restaurant make?

564
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,450
Can you even profit in a place like this?

565
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,205
Given the poor location,
the rent can't be more than 5%.

566
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,957
And you don't compromise on ingredients.

567
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,460
Considering the rate of cost to sales…

568
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,297
Daily revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 won?

569
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,426
More or less?

570
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,430
The food is good, no doubt.

571
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,559
But this place is well tucked away,
and the tableware is nothing special.

572
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,478
This counter-seating setup? Not bad.

573
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,898
But the chairs would have to be
at least 10 cm taller.

574
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,692
And these lights are way too dim.

575
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,111
From the outside, you can't tell
if it's a restaurant or a bar.

576
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,907
From what I see, there seems to be issues
with how this place is run.

577
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,034
So what are you trying to get at?

578
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,453
I'll…

579
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,624
do you the favor of acquiring it.

580
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,009
Leave if you're done eating.

581
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,513
I'll fund the acquisition generously--

582
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,142
I don't need any of that.

583
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,397
What a load of nonsense.

584
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,165
If you don't like
the sound of "acquisition,"

585
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,749
how about we call it an investment?

586
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,502
I'm not asking for much in return.

587
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,880
Just something small, you know?

588
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,508
Nothing too crazy.

589
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,552
For example,

590
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,931
maybe we can exchange recipes.

591
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,725
Be on close terms.

592
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,228
Working with big corporations like us
comes with some upsides.

593
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,940
Not all of us are bad, you know.

594
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,527
Running a business
can be a pain in the neck.

595
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,405
But Hansang will have your back.

596
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:28,285
You just focus on your forte
and keep cooking.

597
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,411
All right?

598
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,081
We'll take care of
all this meaningless stuff.

599
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,418
"Meaningless"?

600
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,337
Oh dear.

601
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,048
So meaningless that you just stuffed it
all into your trap?

602
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,425
I didn't have any of that.

603
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,930
To sow these tiny seedlings,

604
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:51,975
you factor in climate,
cultivation methods, and cropping system.

605
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,230
You pinch the shoots and ridge the soil,
adjusting for space, time, and fertility.

606
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,857
All that takes 120 days.

607
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:05,405
Only after 120 days of constant care
do you get white soybeans.

608
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,243
Do you think that's it?

609
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:13,789
You soak and grind the beans, strain them,
then add brine to get soybean liquid.

610
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,918
Then you let it simmer on low heat
for ages, stirring nonstop.

611
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,963
That's how you get the tofu

612
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:24,132
in the seopsanjeok
that you scarfed down earlier.

613
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,803
Okay, I get it.

614
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,932
I see your point, so please calm down.

615
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,183
Management?

616
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,351
Maintenance?

617
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,686
Please.

618
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,356
You money-hungry people
think you can make food and sell it?

619
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,194
You have no idea how much value there is

620
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:48,448
in the work, care,
and sincerity behind it.

621
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,577
Listen, I've heard enough.
What did you call me?

622
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,995
Money-hungry?

623
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,290
Sincerity?

624
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,333
About this sincerity you speak of,

625
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,962
at the end of the day,
without having or making money,

626
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,799
how will you run this place
that you love with all your heart?

627
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,678
Why do you run a restaurant?

628
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,764
Is it because you want to?

629
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,186
Forget money. Forget big titles.

630
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:23,942
Do you actually have a passion for it?

631
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,653
Think about that.

632
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,114
Whatever it may be.

633
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,007
JUNGJAE

634
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,181
Forget it.

635
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,892
It's her loss, not mine.

636
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,650
Where the hell is it?

637
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,924
About this sincerity you speak of,

638
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,636
at the end of the day,
without having or making money,

639
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,223
how will you run this place
that you love with all your heart?

640
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,767
Why aren't you answering the phone?

641
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,607
Wait.

642
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,610
I swear I heard her chopping.

643
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,951
She must've gone to the market.

644
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,623
Darn it.

645
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:58,346
You've gotten better at acting.
You should be an actress.

646
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,561
When are you going to pay
your overdue rent?

647
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,772
You said you'd pay me within a month.

648
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,940
Did I say a month?

649
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,942
I'm pretty sure I said two.

650
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,360
Are you kidding?

651
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,074
You should sell something like
kongnamul gukbap, bean sprout rice soup.

652
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,954
You don't have a sign or a menu.
What are you trying to sell here?

653
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,372
There's a sign outside.

654
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,374
And I've got the menu right here.

655
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,626
What are you on about?

656
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:32,005
You made a big deal about running some
fine timing restaurant or whatever,

657
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,757
but look at you.

658
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,592
For goodness' sake.

659
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,304
Let's cut to the chase.
You have one month, all right?

660
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,808
If you can't pay up by then,
you're out of here!

661
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,736
Wait.

662
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,447
You gave that to me.
You can't take it back!

663
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,200
Please let me keep it.

664
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,327
Quiet!

665
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,037
You don't deserve it.

666
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,914
One month!

667
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,756
It's fine dining, not fine timing.

668
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,425
My sun visor…

669
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,104
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

670
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,485
-What? I'm on my way back right--
-Sir, hurry! Turn on the TV!

671
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,946
-Turn on the TV right now!
-What?

672
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,990
-What's going on?
-Hurry!

673
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,501
Mr. Yoo, the owner
of a popular seafood restaurant,

674
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,170
has attempted to take his own life
in his home.

675
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,047
According to a note left by Mr. Yoo,

676
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,133
Company H threatened him

677
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:02,637
in an attempt to take over the restaurant
he runs with his parents.

678
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,098
Out of guilt
for losing the family restaurant,

679
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,809
he attempted to take his own life.

680
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,937
He was said to be unconscious
at the time of transport

681
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,982
and was rushed to a nearby hospital.

682
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,861
Police are investigating Company H
following evidence of blackmail.

683
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,279
This is Kim Mi-na from JNB News.

684
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,489
We kept the company name out of the news,

685
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,700
but we can't stop the rumors
spreading in the stock market.

686
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,745
We should decide
on the dismissal of Director Han.

687
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,833
We'll begin the vote now.

688
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,420
All in favor of dismissing Director Han,
please raise your hand.

689
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,890
With this, the motion to dismiss
Director Han Beom-woo has passed.

690
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,079
Luckily, he made it through.

691
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,330
It's Room 302.

692
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,542
What are you going to do?

693
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,211
I don't know.

694
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,756
I guess I should get on my knees
or something.

695
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,894
Reporters, please step outside!

696
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,772
-You're interfering with treatment!
-Please leave!

697
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,568
-Please step outside.
-Excuse me, please leave.

698
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,946
-Please clear out!
-Please leave.

699
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,341
Hello. Yes, of course.

700
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,512
Don't worry about a thing.

701
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,974
They pumped my stomach right away,
so I'm okay now.

702
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,936
I just downed it with some vitamins.

703
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,440
The money?

704
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,776
Of course, I already checked it.

705
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,239
One moment, please.

706
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,206
Yes, I'll be careful.

707
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:41,379
Please tell Managing Director Han
that I said thank you.

708
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,506
Yes.

709
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,425
Take care. Bye.

710
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,514
Managing Director Han?

711
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,270
Han Sun-woo, you son of a…

712
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,908
Ma'am, it's a call
from Director Han Beom-woo.

713
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,247
Hello?

714
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,584
And?

715
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,005
So you got played by him,
and now you're snitching?

716
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,257
No, that's not it.

717
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,718
-The point is--
-The point is

718
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:32,347
our stock price
took a nosedive because of you.

719
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,767
Like I always say,
the loser takes the fall.

720
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,269
But he played dirty!

721
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,190
Fair or not, winning is all that matters.

722
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,693
What's the matter? Play it like Sun-woo.

723
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,531
No, I could never stoop that low.

724
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:53,159
Isn't getting the three stars
what matters most? I'll make sure to--

725
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,829
Sun-woo will manage Motto
for the time being.

726
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:07,173
All my hands are tied now.
What do you expect me to do?

727
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,258
Find it.

728
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,260
Find what you can do.

729
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,763
That's the real test of your ability.

730
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,357
Goddammit.

731
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,402
How the hell am I supposed to…

732
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:38,830
JUNGJAE

733
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,293
Jin-dol!

734
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,676
Can we have a quick chat?

735
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,029
What was that?

736
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,325
NO SMOKING IN FRONT OF RESTAURANT
I'LL BEHEAD ANYONE WHO DOES

737
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,454
Pick up the butt.

738
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,773
TASTEFULLY YOURS

739
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,483
We can get three stars no problem.

740
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,985
I'll think about it

741
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,612
-if you agree to work here.
-Work?

742
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,532
That's why we should hire someone.

743
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,908
What do you think?

744
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,993
She'll be working with us, starting today.

745
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,789
Perhaps the restaurant ended up like this
because of your inferiority complex!

746
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,291
Have you seen the wild look in her eyes?
She's insane!

747
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,252
What are you thinking about?

748
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,419
I must have it.

749
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,213
Who was it?

750
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,464
Who the heck is that?

751
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,467
