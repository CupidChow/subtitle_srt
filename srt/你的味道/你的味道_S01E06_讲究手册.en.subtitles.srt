1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,815
I'm an orphan.

3
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,194
What?

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,906
I was a baby, so I don't even remember.

5
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,534
But apparently, I was abandoned
at a hermitage at the base of a mountain.

6
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,414
All I remember of my childhood

7
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,251
is the mountain, the forest,
the temple, and monks.

8
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,711
That's about it.

9
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,007
Then I got older,

10
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,676
and I fell in love with cooking.

11
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,929
That's how I made my living.

12
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,683
Then I studied at CIA
and ended up in Japan.

13
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:45,647
At Le Murir, which you also know of.

14
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,989
That's where I met Min.

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,413
I liked him a lot.

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,627
It was the first time
anyone had treated me nicely.

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,637
I see, but…

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,432
I didn't want to know all that.

19
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,978
Anyway, now,

20
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,689
you're broken up.

21
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,028
So…

22
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,031
why is he here?

23
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,326
He wants me to come back to Murir.

24
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,883
Are you going to go?

25
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,729
Why would I go?

26
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,564
Our restaurant's doing so well.

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,613
Right.

28
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,533
We might take over
the entire neighborhood.

29
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,548
BAEKSU INN

30
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,649
JEON MIN

31
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:00,949
Yeah?

32
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,034
Yeon-joo.

33
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,412
About the thing
I wanted to talk to you about…

34
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,623
The truth is…

35
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,251
Chef Tatsuo is very ill.

36
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,838
This might be…

37
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,467
your last chance to see him.

38
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,220
I'll wait for you.

39
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:28,643
TASTEFULLY YOURS

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,522
Where have you been all this time?

41
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,357
What are you talking about?
She went to Sapporo?

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,692
Yeah.

43
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,655
Do you think Chef Mo
abandoned us and the restaurant?

44
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,907
Neither of you showed up on time,

45
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,826
so we were getting ready
to open without you guys.

46
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,327
Then I found this in the kitchen.

47
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,832
Something urgent came up,
so I'm going to Sapporo.

48
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,669
I need you to take over
Jungjae's new kitchen for a while.

49
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm sorry I only had time
to leave this short note.

50
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,344
Han Beom-woo. Wait until I contact you.

51
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,555
But…

52
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,557
What is this?

53
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,436
Isn't that an earthenware pot?

54
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,813
The earthenware pot stand.

55
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,898
-The earthenware pot stand.
-This isn't it.

56
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,734
-This is the stand.
-Right.

57
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
The earthenware pot stand.

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,406
This is too heavy.

59
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,700
What in the world did she leave here?

60
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,704
Hey, I found it!

61
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,706
-Look.
-What is it?

62
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,042
What's this?

63
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,505
JUNGJAE MANUAL

64
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,176
Jungjae manual.

65
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,013
Number one.

66
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,851
Jungjae is a restaurant
that changes with the seasons.

67
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,689
The menus shift
to incorporate seasonal produce.

68
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,193
But we welcome customers

69
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,195
with an unchanging heart.

70
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,238
Beom-woo.

71
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,949
I really will kill you
if you smoke outside again.

72
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,495
Number two.

73
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,415
The seasonal vegetables
growing in the garden

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,418
may not always be pretty.

75
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,214
It's because we don't use
chemical fertilizers or pesticides.

76
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,423
They're organic.

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,134
Choon-seung.

78
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,054
Wash your hands after being in the garden,

79
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,764
-or I'll wring one of them off.
-That's good.

80
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,681
Darn it.

81
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,684
Number three.

82
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,938
Buy all the other ingredients
at Nambu Market

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,398
-where it's guaranteed to be fresh.
-How much is this?

84
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,362
And Myung-sook, don't get into fights
with the elders there.

85
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,114
This isn't right.

86
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,824
-You can't do that.
-What was that?

87
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,617
-Leave it. No.
-Why not?

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,077
That doesn't matter.

89
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,289
I'm leaving you with all the recipes
that contain all of Jungjae's past.

90
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,419
Myung-sook, please be Jungjae's head chef
for the time being.

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,421
Number four.

92
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,215
How many more are there?

93
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,638
Oh gosh.

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,649
It ends at number 135.

95
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,734
This means she doesn't trust us.

96
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,903
This reeks of distrust.

97
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,284
Should I have just given them time off?

98
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,378
Has it been five years?

99
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,841
Yeah.

100
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,391
About that incident…

101
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,185
What?

102
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,773
When I took the fall
for what you messed up and quit?

103
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,575
You're all aware of the customers
we're serving today, right?

104
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,702
We're serving Diamant inspectors.

105
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,916
All because of you!

106
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,670
Given Chef Tatsuo's poor health,

107
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm afraid the truth might shock him.

108
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,468
I won't bring it up.

109
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,930
I didn't mess up.

110
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,182
I made a mistake.

111
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,851
I'm only going to visit Chef Tatsuo.

112
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,657
Why did she go? What did she go there for?

113
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,076
And why can't I call her?

114
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,581
They seemed to have a pretty deep past.

115
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,377
Sapporo.

116
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,546
Le Murir.

117
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,881
Also,

118
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,718
why did she keep it a secret
about CIA and Le Murir?

119
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,611
Get lost.

120
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,782
A man fights with his abilities.

121
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,703
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

122
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,332
AFTER HARDSHIP COMES PLEASURE

123
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,962
JUNGJAE'S MEAL OF THE DAY
AUTUMN VEGGIE BUGAK,

124
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,505
SHORT-NECKED CLAM SOUP,
MUSHROOM SEOPSANJEOK,

125
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,048
STEAMED EGG, CABBAGE KIMCHI
& WOLGWACHAE

126
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,970
Watch me.

127
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,357
2. YAKBAP-LIKE RICE
DATES, CHESTNUTS, RAISINS…

128
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,187
On three, say, "We can do it."
One, two, three.

129
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,521
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

130
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,903
-The bill, please.
-Yes, sir.

131
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,154
Here's your food.

132
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,530
Chef, two more set meals.

133
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,865
Yes, Chef. Oh no.

134
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,909
That's me. I'm the chef.

135
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,453
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

136
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,580
This isn't cooked properly.

137
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,624
That can't be.

138
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,917
It's not cooked.

139
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,171
I'm sorry about that. Excuse me.

140
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,676
Chef.

141
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,595
Apparently, it's undercooked.

142
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,597
Oh no.

143
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,267
But I followed the recipe.

144
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,978
Just hurry up and make a new one.

145
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
-A new one? Okay.
-Another one. Quick.

146
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,234
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Oh dear.

147
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,276
We'll make a new one for you.

148
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,905
It's okay. We'll just pay.

149
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,240
This place is a mess.

150
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,741
It won't take long.

151
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,909
Excuse me?

152
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,787
I can do it in no time.

153
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,997
We can't do it.

154
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,836
Chef Mo overestimated us big time.

155
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,920
Right?

156
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,214
I see.

157
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,677
This says five, not three.

158
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,596
Take a look. Is this a three or a five?
Am I the only one who's confused?

159
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,683
Is it just me?

160
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,060
-It was five minutes, not three.
-Chef Mo.

161
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,147
I miss you, Chef Mo.
When will you be back? Hurry back.

162
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,273
Chef Mo.

163
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,986
HANSANG FOOD FIELD

164
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,988
Let's wrap up the meeting.

165
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,828
-Good night.
-Good night.

166
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,288
You can't go in.
The meeting's not over yet.

167
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,459
Can I have a word with you,
Managing Director Han?

168
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,463
Can you all excuse us?

169
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,600
I heard an outrageous rumor.

170
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,644
-It's not a rumor.
-What?

171
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,354
It's true.

172
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,984
We found your replacement
as La Lecel's head chef.

173
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,570
How could you do that
without a word to me?

174
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,781
Let's be honest. You don't have
what it takes to get three stars.

175
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,367
You're crazy.

176
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,746
I went to a lot of trouble
to scout this chef.

177
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,291
Why don't you work under them
and learn a thing or two?

178
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,627
You're a total psychopath.

179
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,546
Do you think I'll back down that easily?

180
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,256
What are you going to do then?

181
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,805
What are you going to do?

182
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,890
Unbelievable.

183
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,894
Compared to you, Beom-woo was an angel.

184
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,689
Thanks for the compliment.

185
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,276
If you don't like the idea, quit.

186
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,948
Prepare to return to Motto.

187
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,658
What? Just like that? What about La Lecel?

188
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,369
I don't care about La Lecel anymore.

189
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,915
Tell the team and prepare for the move.

190
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,751
Are you just going to let this happen?
Shouldn't you do something?

191
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,586
What do you mean?
You have to explain so I can--

192
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,471
Let's see who wins.

193
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,038
It's not too late for us.

194
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,833
We can go back.

195
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,776
Was that a ghost?

196
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,861
Show yourself.

197
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,405
No.

198
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,282
That must've been a water deer.

199
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,867
Oh yeah?

200
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,041
-Mr. Manager.
-Did you forget something?

201
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,918
You have a visitor.

202
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,211
Who?

203
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,637
Hey, you. What are you doing here?

204
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,681
"Hey, you"? He said he was older than you.

205
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,479
Yeah, he is older.

206
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,525
Hello. I'm Beom-woo's neighborhood friend.

207
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,110
My name is Lee Yu-jin.

208
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,488
Nice to meet you. I'm Shin Choon-seung.

209
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,823
You look pretty familiar.

210
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,243
I was on my way to the market,

211
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,121
and he suddenly stopped me to say hi.

212
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,457
He said he saw me
at the food truck festival.

213
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,960
-Right.
-What exactly did you say?

214
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,170
You said something
about my striking beauty.

215
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,089
I said, "How could I forget

216
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,132
a lady of such beauty?"

217
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,385
Are you into older women?

218
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,261
Sorry?

219
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
Beom-woo.

220
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,017
How have you been?

221
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,520
I missed you so much, Beom-woo.

222
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,897
Didn't you miss me?

223
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,148
You cheeky punk.

224
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,733
You'd better watch it.

225
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,152
You're older?

226
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,904
You're absolutely unbelievable.

227
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,157
You seemed to be struggling,
so I came to help you.

228
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,576
Okay, but why are you
an older friend of mine?

229
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,081
We can't just take it back
when that's what we told them, can we?

230
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,626
We're planning to reopen Motto.

231
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,877
That damn Motto.

232
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,713
Damn Motto.

233
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:50,175
Sir, I noticed that this place
has some amazing recipes.

234
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,510
If we can just take them

235
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,887
and tweak them
to make them more luxurious--

236
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,972
Yu-jin.

237
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,936
We should

238
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,981
stop doing things like

239
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,901
stealing recipes from other restaurants.

240
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,069
What?

241
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,573
Now you want to be the good guy?
After everything you've done?

242
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,867
I'm not joking.

243
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,245
It feels like my head is about to explode
every single day.

244
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,331
I laugh, cry, then laugh and cry again.

245
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,293
Every day is total chaos.

246
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,420
Forget all that.

247
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,464
At this point, it's all or nothing.

248
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,592
Hey, everyone. Do you know why he's here?

249
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,304
-Come over here.
-What's going on?

250
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,431
Do you know what he came here for?

251
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,185
-He came here to take all the recipes.
-No…

252
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,812
He came here to steal all the recipes!

253
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,190
-Beom-woo?
-What's he saying?

254
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,483
-Is this true?
-Well…

255
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,817
Don't just stutter.

256
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,736
-Is it a yes or no?
-Chef Mo!

257
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,365
Sir, why did you stop mid-sentence?

258
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,578
Huh? What?

259
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,746
What?

260
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,581
-What?
-Me?

261
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,167
Yeah, you, Yu-jin.

262
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,836
Who told you to stand straight?
Stick your head in here.

263
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,880
Come on.

264
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,716
You little punk.

265
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,594
Mr. Seoul!

266
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,556
You offered to help out.
Where are you and what are you doing?

267
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,436
Beom-woo, is that how I taught you?

268
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,938
-No.
-You deserve another noogie.

269
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,147
Here's one more.

270
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,024
Here's another noogie. There you go.

271
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,150
You must be best friends.

272
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,569
-I'll put him right in his place.
-Goodness.

273
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,655
I'll give you a hundred noogies today.

274
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,740
-Don't be too harsh.
-Come here, you.

275
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,246
What's this?

276
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,125
Can't you tell? It's plum extract
that we use instead of sugar.

277
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,168
Oh, plum extract.

278
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,171
-And then--
-What's this?

279
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,840
This?

280
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,174
-This is--
-Yu-jin.

281
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,345
Why do you need to know that?

282
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,429
Hey.

283
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,348
You brat.

284
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,559
-I can ask if I'm curious, can't I?
-That's right.

285
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,646
I can't help but be curious
when I witness such great talent.

286
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,231
Oh, my arms aren't strong enough.

287
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,941
Oh, give that to me.

288
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,321
This is ginger liquor.

289
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,907
What are you doing?

290
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,785
Did we use ginger for this?

291
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,412
I use ordinary cooking wine,

292
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:27,207
but our chef wrote in her recipe book
that I should use

293
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,127
the ginger liquor she made.

294
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,795
-A recipe book?
-Hang on.

295
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,381
Where did the book go?

296
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,216
I put it right here.

297
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,635
-What? The recipe book?
-What on earth?

298
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,887
Where…

299
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,471
What's this recipe book?

300
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,515
-What is it?
-Where did it go?

301
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,060
-That's so strange.
-Where did you put the book?

302
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,770
Myung-sook, here's the soy sauce.

303
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
I'll open it for you.

304
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,236
What was that cold, indifferent touch?

305
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,321
Ta-da!

306
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,948
Did you make this, Myung-sook?

307
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,825
-No, our chef did.
-I see.

308
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,994
-"Myung-sook"?
-It has a different color.

309
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,289
The color and smell are nothing like
what you'd get at a store.

310
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,082
Here. Have a taste for yourself.

311
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,126
You can't let him
taste our secret soy sauce.

312
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,336
You're feeding it to him?

313
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,882
-Isn't it good? Amazing, right?
-Yes.

314
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,093
Our chef made it
with 200-year-old aged soy sauce.

315
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:21,970
200 years?

316
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,014
It's made in Joseon, huh?

317
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,808
How are you so witty?

318
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
Are you a comedian?

319
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,519
I'm a comedian from Seoul.

320
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,104
-You're hilarious.
-I'm not.

321
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,357
Are you there?
Report what you have so far.

322
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,234
Okay. So…

323
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,904
I think I can get the recipes today
if I'm lucky.

324
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,698
Apparently, there's a recipe book.

325
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,617
Bring it with you. How's Beom-woo?

326
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,702
He's out of sorts.

327
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,496
Okay. I'll get back as soon as possible.

328
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,997
Yes.

329
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,041
Okay, got it.

330
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,794
Damn it.

331
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,677
What should I do with that punk?
What should I do?

332
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,768
"Myung-sook"?

333
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,812
Is he out of his mind?

334
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,814
That goes for Chef Jin too.

335
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,482
She fell for the way he talked to her.

336
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,819
I can't stand him! I want him gone!

337
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,903
Oh my gosh.

338
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,286
Should we

339
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,371
get rid of him?

340
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,457
Like forever?

341
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,043
Why would you say that?

342
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,255
What are you thinking?
That's not what I meant.

343
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,596
You're a genius.

344
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,348
I'm the alcohol expert!

345
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,023
Are we allowed to do this?

346
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,482
He's your close friend.

347
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,197
I'll be waiting.

348
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,282
Call me.

349
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,868
I'm doing my very best

350
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,411
to protect Jungjae.

351
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,495
YEON-JOO

352
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,207
Text me back when you get this.

353
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,920
Beom-woo, I don't think we should do this.

354
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,716
I don't hate him enough
to want to get rid of him.

355
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,176
Hey, hey.

356
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:32,142
Are you okay with an outsider
causing trouble at our restaurant?

357
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,020
Are you okay with that?
Are you going to let him do that?

358
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,188
You're an outsider too.

359
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm a local.

360
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,866
-Get a hold of yourself.
-Yeah, okay.

361
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,367
Identify the enemy.

362
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,788
Just remember this, Choon-seung.

363
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,749
-Get him completely drunk.
-Completely drunk.

364
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,292
-Pickle him.
-Pickle him.

365
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,835
-Sink him.
-Sink him.

366
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,795
Got it.

367
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,797
Don't you worry.

368
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,757
I have a secret weapon.

369
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,843
The Shin Choon-seung collection.

370
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,942
Welcome.

371
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,028
Take a seat.

372
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,284
Oh, silly me.

373
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,963
JUNGJAE'S RECIPES

374
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,843
All right, so these are

375
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,679
Shin Choon-seung's special masterpieces
made with dedication and care.

376
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,682
My traditional moju and homemade liquor.

377
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,978
This moju has a whole new level to it.

378
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,604
And this homemade liquor.

379
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,399
It will shock you.

380
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,151
Here. Let me pour you a shot.

381
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,737
The first shot will take you to paradise.

382
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,365
The second to hell.

383
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,200
And the third…

384
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,036
Would you like to see for yourself?

385
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,998
Come on.

386
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,586
Let's go.

387
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,844
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

388
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,485
Cheers!

389
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,696
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

390
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,406
Here, cheers!

391
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,408
I'm getting drunk.

392
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,160
Man, I'm getting drunk.

393
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,246
Here comes more alcohol.

394
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,501
It's time to start over.

395
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,378
Start over!

396
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,047
What is this, you ask?

397
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,883
I made this with all my pent-up fury

398
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,053
after my father chewed me out.

399
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,137
Choon-seung.

400
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,348
Let's drink from a glass.

401
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,766
Oh, from a glass?

402
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,517
A glass sounds perfect!

403
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,811
Sounds good!

404
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,356
Here.

405
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,483
Here.

406
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,362
As much as I love you.

407
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,907
-Here.
-No.

408
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,659
-Here.
-Just a little.

409
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,078
Now it's Choon-seung's turn.

410
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,580
All right!

411
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,540
Down it all, Choon-seung. Come on.

412
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,625
Bottoms up!

413
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,502
Bottoms up!

414
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,710
You're such a lightweight.

415
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm Shin Choon-seung.

416
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,297
Well done.

417
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,548
-I did well?
-Good job.

418
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,560
I know you're trying.

419
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,565
The hangover will keep him there
for at least three days.

420
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,109
-Let's go.
-Yeah, get out here.

421
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:55,113
You need to get out.
You're the one who's still in there.

422
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,239
We taught him a lesson,

423
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,325
so he'll stay far away
from our restaurant.

424
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,035
-And from Myung-sook.
-Yes!

425
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,203
You clever punk.

426
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,039
Good job, bro!

427
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,290
Yeah, baby!

428
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,047
I'll let you off this once.

429
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,052
Hello?

430
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
Where are you?

431
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,680
Are you in Sapporo?

432
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,268
Hey, do you know how worried I was?

433
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,562
You should've told me
if you were going somewhere.

434
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:30,023
How are things at the restaurant?
Is everything okay?

435
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,817
That's the only thing you care about.

436
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,487
Don't you want to know how I'm doing?

437
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,740
You picked up, so I guess you're fine.

438
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
Forget it.

439
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,994
Stop worrying about the restaurant

440
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,121
and hurry back.

441
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,247
Yeon-joo.

442
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,792
All right. Bye.

443
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,918
Who was that?

444
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
Hello?

445
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,713
Did you hang up?

446
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,964
Did you hang up?

447
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,258
You hung up on me?

448
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,760
-Hey!
-What?

449
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,098
It's that punk's voice.

450
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,683
Why is she with him in Japan?

451
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,355
This isn't good.

452
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,316
She's there with him, huh?

453
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,236
This…

454
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,115
is not…

455
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,035
I've seen those eyes before.

456
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,793
What are you doing? This is confinement.

457
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,757
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

458
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,217
It's not confinement.

459
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,261
-It's not confinement.
-Okay.

460
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,471
It's a vacation. Say it. "Vacation."

461
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,850
-Vacation.
-Vacation.

462
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,856
Yu-jin, stay here for a while.

463
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,024
I'll let you out
when I'm back from Sapporo.

464
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,110
Enjoy your vacation.

465
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,114
-Choon-seung.
-Yeah?

466
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,241
You're the hero
who protected our restaurant.

467
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
Come on, I'm no hero.

468
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,370
You are.

469
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,664
What's a hero doing, sitting out here?

470
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,790
Stand up, you brave soul.

471
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,209
There you go.

472
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,211
-Choon-seung.
-Yeah.

473
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,588
-You know what?
-What?

474
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,798
I need to go to Sapporo.

475
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,383
Oh, Sapporo!

476
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,635
-My hero!
-Yeah!

477
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,803
I must ask.

478
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,139
Do you have money?

479
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,517
Hang on.

480
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,689
You barely know me
and you're asking for money?

481
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,899
Hang up, punk.

482
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,442
Why that…

483
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,735
It's for love!

484
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,159
I love her.

485
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,037
That's why.

486
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,126
Don't you think I should go to Sapporo?

487
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,170
You're cool.

488
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,884
You're a thousand times cooler
than that guy, Beom-woo!

489
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,677
You must go.

490
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,262
I'll get you the money.

491
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,014
-Trust me.
-I trust you.

492
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,474
-Trust me!
-I trust you!

493
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,184
-Trust me!
-I trust you!

494
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,852
I trust you!

495
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,229
You thief!

496
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,731
You bastard!

497
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,025
No, Father, wait. Hear me out.

498
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,194
Stop right there, you punk!

499
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,570
I'm sorry, Beom-woo!

500
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,072
Stop right there!

501
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,491
My goodness…

502
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,164
Don't touch me there.

503
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,124
He's such an embarrassment.

504
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,794
I'm embarrassed to death.

505
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,047
What an embarrassment!

506
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,842
Damn it.

507
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,422
You have to eat

508
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,674
-for your health, sir.
-No.

509
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,676
No, this isn't it!

510
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,103
This isn't the dish I was talking about.

511
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,855
This isn't it.

512
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,565
This isn't it.

513
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,911
Who…

514
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,455
are you?

515
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,802
I asked you a question!

516
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,471
Who are you?

517
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,354
What a strange person.

518
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,326
He once was the best chef in the world,

519
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,410
but now…

520
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,165
He has dementia.

521
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,751
He refuses

522
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,965
to eat anything
unless it's what he wants to eat.

523
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,384
I thought seeing you

524
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,179
might revive his memories
before his condition worsened.

525
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,896
I'm sorry.

526
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,441
I didn't think of how you'd feel.

527
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,909
This might be the last time I see him.

528
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,211
Aren't you tired?

529
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,802
How's Chef Tatsuo?

530
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,179
Is he still unable to eat anything?

531
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,641
He can't eat the hospital food.

532
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,103
I cook something for each meal,
but it's no use.

533
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,024
I just don't know
what it is that he wants.

534
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,360
His condition is getting worse

535
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,195
because he's not eating.

536
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,198
Deep-fried butterbur shoots?

537
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,950
That was the first thing I made him.

538
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,994
Apparently, it wasn't it.

539
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,872
What is it that he wants to eat?

540
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,504
He might like what you make.

541
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,924
He doesn't even recognize me.

542
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,469
He might not,

543
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,095
but he'll remember your food.

544
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,766
He loved your food, Sophie.

545
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,772
I don't mean to put pressure on you.

546
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,028
Do you want to drop by Murir
while you're here?

547
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,532
What's the point?

548
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,703
It's where we used to work.

549
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,164
It might be

550
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,875
our last time together.

551
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,068
How does it feel?

552
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,090
Excuse me.

553
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,769
It's good.

554
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,452
Make them even.

555
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,536
Understood.

556
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,163
Am I late?

557
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,831
You're fine.

558
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,960
All right.

559
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,175
You're all aware of the customers
we're serving today, right?

560
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,844
We're serving Diamant inspectors.

561
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:07,058
Each dish will define Le Murir's name.

562
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,518
Let's focus and do our best.

563
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,897
I'm counting on you all.
Let's get to work!

564
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,273
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

565
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,947
Looks good to go.

566
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,378
-I'll bring them to Table One.
-To Table One.

567
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,924
What's the matter?

568
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,219
There seems to have been a problem
in the preparation step.

569
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,763
That was a close call.

570
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,392
Who was it?

571
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,104
Who prepared it?

572
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,733
Who prepared the pufferfish?

573
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,488
I…

574
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,866
It was…

575
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,622
It was me.

576
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,919
Do you know what you've done?

577
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,881
With this incident,

578
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,260
everything I've built and worked for
went down the drain.

579
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,430
Three stars down the drain

580
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,350
and Murir's reputation completely ruined!

581
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,560
All because of you.

582
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,563
All because of you!

583
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,358
I'll take responsibility.

584
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,989
I'll take full responsibility…

585
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,244
and resign.

586
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,973
It's still the same.

587
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,437
It's gotten old.

588
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,358
And now I've become the head chef.

589
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,945
I wanted to change the whole place.

590
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,450
But you know what Chef Tatsuo's like.

591
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,831
We laughed and cried here.

592
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,875
So much happened.

593
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,460
You and I both

594
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,546
learned a lot from Chef Tatsuo.

595
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,799
Right?

596
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,096
Let's look.

597
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,892
-For what?
-Something Chef Tatsuo would eat.

598
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,352
Let's do whatever we can.

599
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,784
I'll start running Murir soon.

600
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,914
So being a head chef wasn't enough.
Now you want to be a chef-owner too?

601
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,750
Did you get Chef Tatsuo's approval?

602
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,710
You saw what state he was in.

603
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,421
After what happened to him,

604
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,548
Murir went through a rough patch.

605
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,343
Someone has to run the place
with a big picture--

606
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,263
Being a chef and running the business
won't be easy.

607
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,808
Why don't you come back and work with me?

608
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,561
That way I can make up for
what I did wrong--

609
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,522
We ended that discussion in Korea.

610
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,941
It's not over for me.

611
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,693
We can start over.

612
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,694
Hey.

613
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,988
What on earth are you doing
in that rundown restaurant?

614
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,659
I get why you're there
doing what you're doing.

615
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,537
But Murir suits you better,

616
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,996
and it needs you.

617
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,123
Stop.

618
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,974
You speak too freely just because you can.

619
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,105
Did you call our restaurant rundown?

620
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,693
So what if you work at
a fancy three-star restaurant

621
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,696
when all that comes of your mouth is crap?

622
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,863
You…

623
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,783
What are you doing here, you doofus?
What about the restaurant?

624
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,912
I left our restaurant
to our trusted family.

625
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,708
Before you worry about our restaurant…

626
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,960
This man here…

627
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,338
Should I say, your former colleague?

628
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,258
You should worry about him, Chef.

629
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,261
He keeps trying to cross the line.

630
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,223
There's something you don't know.

631
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,771
We already…

632
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,774
crossed the line.

633
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,536
Stop talking nonsense.

634
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,705
I'll be in touch when I think of a dish.

635
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,789
Let's go.

636
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,336
Come on.

637
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,100
Hey, Chef.

638
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,353
I came here to ask you something.

639
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,481
Hello? Hey.

640
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,107
How are you not slipping?

641
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,609
Hey, wait up.

642
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,235
I came to ask you something!

643
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,030
What do you want to know? What is it?

644
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,784
We held hands, kissed, and dated, okay?

645
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,288
Then I got stabbed in the back
because I was pathetic.

646
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,123
So what?

647
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,875
That's random.

648
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,461
You said you wanted to ask me something.

649
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,256
Why didn't you tell me
you worked at Le Murir?

650
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,677
That's what I wanted to ask you.

651
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,305
You should've stayed at Jungjae.
Why did you come all the way here?

652
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,391
Why do you think I'm here?

653
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,642
I came to get you.

654
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,435
I was worried you wouldn't come back.

655
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,189
Who wouldn't go back?
Me? I'd leave Jungjae?

656
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,359
You were going to come back, right?

657
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,362
I know you're not the kind of person
to ditch your restaurant.

658
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,656
I know that.

659
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,534
But coming to a place like this
and reminiscing about the past

660
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,077
can get you all emotional and whatnot.

661
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,414
That's when you need a friend
who can give you objective advice…

662
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,749
I came because I missed you!

663
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,798
Did your heart skip a beat?

664
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,175
As if.

665
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,639
Come on. Where are you going?

666
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,100
Why did you come to Sapporo?

667
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,685
To tie up loose ends.

668
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,230
I want to sort out some things.

669
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,862
Sort out what things?

670
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,738
You don't need to know.

671
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,576
Oh, I know a good takoyaki place.
Do you want to go?

672
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,660
Forget it.

673
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,838
Can I help you? We're closed for the day.

674
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,009
Who are you? I don't recognize you.

675
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,093
Pardon?

676
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,850
Did they hire new staff already?

677
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:10,934
Damn it.

678
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,731
Will this do?

679
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,193
What brings you here?

680
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,947
I used to be the head chef here.

681
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,866
I'm here for my stuff.

682
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,826
It won't take long.

683
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,747
You can't go inside.
We're not allowed to admit strangers.

684
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,334
Strangers?

685
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,503
Look up Jang Young-hye.

686
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,880
I'm a chef that's prettier
than most actresses.

687
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,006
Haven't you heard of me?

688
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,466
Oh, that's you.

689
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,469
Managing Director Han told us
to put some stuff in the storage room.

690
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,637
One moment.

691
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,139
What? Storage room?

692
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,947
-Does he think I'll back out that easily?
-Did you finish prepping the ingredients?

693
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm Jang Young-hye.

694
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,578
Who is he bringing in as my replacement?

695
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,043
What the heck?

696
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,551
"Hansang and Le Murir's
mergers and acquisitions proposal"?

697
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,647
I think he's asleep.

698
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,709
He didn't eat anything today either.

699
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,406
Should we head to the market first?

700
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,409
We could go to Nijo Market.

701
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,995
Or if we want seafood,
we can go to Kitano Gurume.

702
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,371
It's where we often went.

703
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,707
It's uncomfortable.

704
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,711
It's uncomfortable?
Want me to fix your seat belt?

705
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,795
No.

706
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,049
What you're doing
makes me feel uncomfortable.

707
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,718
What am I doing?

708
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,012
You're being nice to me
like you were in the past.

709
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,018
Then is it fine
if it's no longer in the past?

710
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,983
Let's get going.

711
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,577
That could've been dangerous.

712
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,997
Are you crazy? Do you have a death wish?

713
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,708
Mo Yeon-joo, get a hold of yourself.

714
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,502
How could you leave that behind?

715
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,339
Did you forget something?

716
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,555
Me. You left me behind.

717
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,933
Don't forget me.

718
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,110
This takoyaki is really famous.

719
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,779
Do you want some?

720
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,953
You're a pretty rough driver.

721
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,735
Would you like to try some Hanasaki gani?

722
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,779
Oh, Hanasaki crab.

723
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,656
It's delicious.

724
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,908
-It looks good.
-Indeed.

725
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

726
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,121
It's huge.

727
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,205
It looks good.

728
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,461
It's delicious.

729
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,920
It's nice.

730
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,806
They must be in peak season.
Look at the kegani, horsehair crabs.

731
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,850
The crab miso soup
we had for our staff meal

732
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,268
would be perfect on a day like this.

733
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,978
We'd make the bisque soup first,

734
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,938
then make soup with horsehair crab.

735
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,734
You were the fastest
at making bisque at Murir.

736
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,028
It looks easy, but it's complicated.

737
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,362
It is.

738
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,823
You have to flambé the cognac
and boil it over and over again.

739
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,576
What? Bisque?

740
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,453
How did you know I love a good bisque?

741
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,539
I had bisque with toast
when I studied abroad.

742
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,333
What about bisque?

743
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,877
We need to figure out
what Chef Tatsuo will want to eat.

744
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,379
You do? What does he like?

745
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,924
I don't know.

746
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,385
I've seen him cook for others,

747
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,554
but I've never really seen him eat.

748
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,474
Jeon Min, long time no see.

749
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,226
It has been a while.

750
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,562
How's Chef Tatsuo doing?

751
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,356
Is he still not eating anything?

752
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,442
-No.
-I see.

753
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:58,573
I wonder when I can give him
the truck full of uni he asked for.

754
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,117
As in sea urchins?

755
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,163
Do any of Chef Tatsuo's recipes
call for uni?

756
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,915
No, they don't.

757
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,834
Uni…

758
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,794
Uni?

759
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,712
Uni.

760
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,842
Should we go get dinner?

761
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,343
I'll be off then.

762
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,971
Is there anything you want?

763
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,348
-What do you want to eat?
-I'll join you if you're having dinner.

764
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,144
Isn't Japan known
for its convenience store lunch boxes?

765
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,980
How about a bento box back at the hotel?

766
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,190
Why would we have convenience store bento
all the way here in Sapporo?

767
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,775
Sapporo has the best horsehair crab.

768
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,819
Crab? You make me feel crabby.

769
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,237
You remember, right?

770
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,990
We had it once,
and you fell in love with it.

771
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:43,201
You hung around the restaurant,
saying you wanted to steal the recipe.

772
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,120
-I did?
-Yeah.

773
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,746
I guess it kind of rings a bell.

774
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,958
But I don't feel like crab today.

775
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,711
Right? Forget crab, and let's have
a convenience store bento box.

776
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,088
What do you say
to a romantic bento dinner?

777
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,884
-Well?
-I'm off to drink a highball.

778
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,820
I'm going to the bathroom.

779
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,113
Wait here and don't fight.

780
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,073
Okay.

781
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,658
Why would we fight?

782
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:43,970
It's quite surprising

783
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,642
that Yeon-joo is working
with someone else.

784
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,313
She never was the type
to get along with others.

785
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,657
You're really getting on my nerves.

786
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,285
You've known her for a few years,

787
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,537
and you're acting like
you know everything about her.

788
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,331
I'm not acting like it.

789
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,667
I do know everything about her.

790
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,587
Didn't I tell you that we--

791
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,089
Yes, sure, whatever.

792
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,423
Briefly.

793
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,593
You guys dated very briefly.

794
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,762
Briefly?

795
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,016
I wouldn't call three years brief.

796
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,148
Whether it was 3 years or 365 years,

797
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:41,236
what's important is that you're her past.

798
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,991
Her past, huh?

799
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,764
Do you know why

800
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,017
Yeon-joo opened a restaurant in Jeonju?

801
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,063
What? What are you going to say now?

802
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,109
Why do you think
the restaurant is called Jungjae?

803
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,328
Doesn't it mean "refined,"
as in refined salt?

804
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,164
We'd made a promise.

805
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,333
Goddammit.

806
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,918
That one day, the two of us

807
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,923
would open a restaurant called Jungjae
somewhere other than Seoul--

808
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,426
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much.

809
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,510
Thanks for the food!

810
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,599
What did you say? I couldn't hear.

811
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,309
What are you doing?

812
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,480
I told you to order lots of skewers
and this is all you got?

813
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,659
Are you going to eat or not?

814
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,578
The food's getting cold.

815
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,498
I was about to eat.

816
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,803
CHEF JANG YOUNG-HYE

817
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,772
Goddammit, it's cold!

818
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,608
What? What do you want?

819
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,277
If the recipient can't come to the phone,
stop calling.

820
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,155
What are you,
my actual ex-girlfriend or something?

821
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,199
What the hell are you going on about?

822
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,368
Don't you know I'm returning to Motto?

823
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,663
You change sides as easily
as a chameleon changes colors, don't you?

824
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,040
Since when did that sneaky act
pass for a simple return?

825
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,125
What?

826
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,668
Whatever.

827
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,169
Yu-jin's with you, isn't he?

828
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,379
Why can't I reach him?

829
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,261
How would I know?

830
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,429
Why are you asking me about him?

831
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,807
He must be too busy to talk to you.

832
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,434
Just pretend that he died
because he was too swamped.

833
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,854
Get a hold of yourself,
Director Han Beom-woo.

834
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,022
We might all go down together!

835
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,733
What did you say? "We"?

836
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,943
"We"?

837
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,405
Since when were you and I a "we"?

838
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,408
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

839
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,410
Stop talking.

840
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,996
Did you see what I sent you?
Look at it now!

841
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,874
You're talking way more
than I am right now.

842
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,838
Your brother screwed me over
and found my replacement himself.

843
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,799
We're seriously done for.

844
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,469
LE MURIR HEAD CHEF JEON MIN

845
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,679
What the heck?

846
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,019
Han Sun-woo's completely determined.

847
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,063
He's using a cheat code
to take over Hansang.

848
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,069
What does he have going with Han Sun-woo?

849
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,280
Hello? Han Beom-woo?

850
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,698
Hansang, Le Murir.

851
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,535
Le Murir, Hansang.

852
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,828
What are you saying?

853
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,205
Hey, Han Beom-woo!

854
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,834
-Seriously.
-How do you remember that?

855
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,128
How could I ever forget that?

856
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,136
-So many ridiculous things happened.
-I know.

857
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,936
All sorts of things happened.

858
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,020
You bet.

859
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,148
Who taught the idiot
that couldn't even hold a knife?

860
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,173
TASTEFULLY YOURS

861
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,761
He betrayed us
and went to Sapporo to get a girl?

862
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,347
You're pretty close to Hansang Group.

863
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,432
I think we can give each other
what we want.

864
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:24,352
Don't you think it's more suspicious
that you're working at a restaurant

865
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,478
in the countryside?

866
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,022
I'll get the recipes.

867
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,359
I feel like
I'm finally working toward my dream.

868
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,820
Do you have any idea what you just did?

869
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,698
What you did can never be justified.

870
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,826
