1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,025
A FEW YEARS AGO

3
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,277
So you came here to open a restaurant?

4
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,739
In that case…

5
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,244
This spot would be perfect.

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,331
It's been vacant for a long time,

7
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,416
but once you clean up the place,

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,126
it won't be just a regular restaurant.

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,837
It'll look as fancy
as those city restaurants.

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,717
Behind these doors
is a space as big as a soccer field.

11
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,011
Behind the next set of doors,

12
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,972
you'll find a beautiful vegetable garden
unfolding right before…

13
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,769
Anyway, you'll never find a place
with this layout or price anywhere else

14
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,062
in Hanok Village.

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,775
So what do you say?
Will you take a look inside?

16
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:52,904
GEUMSEONG BARBERSHOP

17
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,656
I'll take it.

18
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,994
Oh, what a good choice. Good girl.

19
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,288
Here.

20
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,457
This is a gift
to commemorate your contract.

21
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,169
May our friendship last forever.

22
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,592
I finally rented this out.

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,853
TASTEFULLY YOURS

24
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,066
The amuse-bouche is bugak,

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,776
and the naengchae is a salad.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,486
Steamed egg instead of soup

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,946
with seopsanjeok as the main dish.

28
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,656
And for dessert,

29
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,491
you just served dried persimmon.

30
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,953
You imitated a fine dining menu
when this isn't even Seoul.

31
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,788
Who says fine dining is only for Seoul?

32
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,333
You know,

33
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,211
I did some asking around.

34
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,505
And I found out you need to pay back
some money within a month.

35
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,300
-What about it?
-I'll take care of it for you.

36
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,307
RESTAURANT ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

37
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,267
Just sign this.

38
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,492
I have another one.

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,626
I have many copies.

40
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,795
Which one will you sign? Here you go.

41
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,844
You know the "sincerity" you talked about?

42
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
I thought hard about it.

43
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,849
And I realized that it's quite important.

44
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,142
I'm not interested in an acquisition.

45
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,103
But I might consider an investment.

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,814
Acquisition, investment, same difference.

47
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,483
Okay then.

48
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,361
From now on,
Hansang and I will support you

49
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,529
with our utmost sincerity.

50
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,156
Sign here.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,201
I'll think about it
if you agree to work here.

52
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,204
If I do what?

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,539
Me? Here? Work?

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,504
Well, you see…

55
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,923
My annual salary is…

56
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:21,010
You say that not knowing
how much my hourly pay is.

57
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,220
Corporate funding?

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,389
I don't believe in that stuff.

59
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,099
You people are all talk.

60
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,186
But if you like this restaurant
and want to invest in it,

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,230
then I'll think about it is what I meant.

62
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,818
And before that, I'll see if you qualify
by watching you work.

63
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,653
In general,

64
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,864
the one being funded
should prove their worth--

65
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,706
Sir, it looks like our operating funds
will be cut off in a few days.

66
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,375
We'll be in real trouble
if you don't find a solution quickly.

67
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,303
Let me see.

68
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,805
This is new.

69
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,182
So what you're saying is

70
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,020
you'll keep a highly qualified individual
like myself here

71
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,148
to manage and oversee the place.

72
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,568
All right, I see what you're saying.
That's pretty smart.

73
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,487
What are you blabbering on about?
Are you going to do it or not?

74
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,706
For one month
from when this contract is signed,

75
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,374
Han Beom-woo
will manage the restaurant's capital

76
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,792
as the temporary manager.

77
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,670
Should special circumstances such as
disasters or nationwide epidemics occur,

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,130
the contract duration
will be renegotiated.

79
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,132
Once the debt is paid within a month,

80
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,301
Han Beom-woo will personally
invest in the restaurant.

81
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,054
After the investment, Mo Yeon-joo reserves
the operation and management rights.

82
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,015
When the agreed amount is secured
before the contract expires,

83
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,141
Han Beom-woo will sign

84
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,477
a personal investment agreement following
the termination of the temporary contract.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,146
What's your name?
I need to know to sign the contract.

86
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,481
I haven't agreed to it yet.

87
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,524
I thought we came to an agreement.

88
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
-Mo Yeon-joo.
-The restaurant is called Mo Yeon-joo?

89
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,197
No, it's "Jungjae."
It's on the sign outside.

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,656
Oh, got it.

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,701
The restaurant is called Jungjae,
and your name is Mo Yeon-joo.

92
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,585
Everything that happens in the kitchen
falls under Mo Yeon-joo's purview,

93
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,630
and Han Beom-woo is never to interfere.

94
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,884
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THE KITCHEN
FALLS UNDER MO YEON-JOO'S PURVIEW,

95
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,178
AND HAN BEOM-WOO IS NEVER TO INTERFERE

96
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,558
Everything that happens in the dining hall
falls under Han Beom-woo's purview,

97
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,144
and Mo Yeon-joo
is never ever to interfere.

98
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,368
HAN BEOM-WOO

99
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,208
I guess something's going on.

100
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,419
I just threw it out there,
but you even agreed to work here.

101
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,380
Or are you out of money?

102
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,175
I guess something's going on with you too.

103
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,761
I didn't think you'd ever agree to it.

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,930
I need to get it back.

105
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:12,932
Get what back?

106
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,267
My sun visor.

107
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,145
What? Your sun visor?

108
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:19,897
I see.

109
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,285
Hey. You have all the resumes
we received, right?

110
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,704
Send me a few that you think
will make decent sous chefs,

111
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,706
and get ready to open a restaurant.

112
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,583
Sorry? A new restaurant?

113
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,670
I'm going to steal
all the recipes from here.

114
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,214
Weren't you going to pay her
and acquire the place?

115
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,383
What happened?
Does she want to be paid upfront?

116
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,970
The chef is something else.

117
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,722
Both in terms of personality and skill.

118
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,767
I must have it, no matter what.

119
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,728
-The chef?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,857
What? No, the recipes. What…

121
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
With those recipes,

122
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,028
we can get three stars no problem.

123
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,950
STREAMSIDE NAMBU MARKET

124
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,834
I'm here.

125
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,461
Where are you?

126
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,766
You can't change the rendezvous point
so unexpectedly.

127
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,186
Deals are never made on just one spot.

128
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,284
This batch is top quality.

129
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,328
Say less.

130
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,748
Everyone who's taken some
keeps asking for me.

131
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,334
Why so secretive?

132
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,215
You sneaky little bastard.
You sure have a knack for scaring people.

133
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,343
What is it?
Why are you being so secretive?

134
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,719
Secretive, my foot.

135
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,805
I told you I had a limited supply
and to keep it a secret.

136
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,223
Why'd you bring a straggler?

137
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,182
Maintain security!

138
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,225
Stop.

139
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,395
"Security"?

140
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,355
"Supply"?

141
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,150
"Top quality"?

142
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,571
Are you into…

143
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,614
drugs or…

144
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,325
Don't be ridiculous, you fool.

145
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,702
What did you say?

146
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,453
Let's just go.

147
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,163
Let's talk later.

148
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,373
Wait. Stop again.

149
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,166
What did you buy so much of? Let's see.

150
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,251
Let me see it.

151
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,836
What is it?

152
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,300
-How much was this?
-Are you serious?

153
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,926
You're embarrassing me. Stop.

154
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,137
I'm in charge of
managing the restaurant now.

155
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,848
I need to know if you're overspending
or being ripped off.

156
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,435
Why do you care if I get ripped off?
Why are you kicking up a fuss?

157
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,687
All right, stop.

158
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,816
How about you continue your love spat
after you settle the tab?

159
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,192
-We're not a couple!
-We're not a couple!

160
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,903
Why would you feel insulted?

161
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,824
It's a figure of speech.
Don't take it literally.

162
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,659
I'll pay you soon.

163
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,453
"Soon"? Come on.

164
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,999
Then you don't deserve
any of my precious chili powder.

165
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,544
-What?
-If you want it, pay up what you owe.

166
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,047
I brought you some
even though it sells out at the store.

167
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,757
But…

168
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,011
Are you serious? It was just chili powder?

169
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,184
OPEN
MEALS AVAILABLE

Why are you crying?

172
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,865
You sound like
the world has come to an end.

173
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,409
Listen carefully.

174
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,204
I went through all of your ledgers.

175
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,581
Your rate of cost to sales is outrageous.

176
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,500
Your monthly spending on ingredients is…

177
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,920
It's a miracle
this restaurant hasn't gone under.

178
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,424
The rate of cost to sales
should be no more than 30%.

179
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,136
Okay. Let's make it 40%.

180
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,640
Are you listening? 40!

181
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,974
100%!

182
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,395
His chili powder is 100% homegrown.

183
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,231
It's a steal for that price and quality!

184
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,358
You don't even know anything.

185
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,694
You can't even pay your tab

186
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,822
and you're going on about
quality homegrown products?

187
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,700
If you want to clear your debt,
cut down on ingredients.

188
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,288
Not the ingredients.
I can't cut down on that.

189
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,959
What about our margin then?
How will you pay off your debt?

190
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:55,464
Using good ingredients
is a matter of principle, not choice.

191
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,342
So you won't spend less on ingredients
even if your life depends on it?

192
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,760
Where are you going?

193
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,345
I'm not done yet.

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,184
Hey. This is a really bad habit, you know.

195
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,894
I'm still talking.

196
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,895
Hello?

197
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,820
Okay. I get it, Chef.
That's how you do things.

198
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:27,121
I think our restaurant's biggest problem
is the exterior.

199
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,498
You can't tell
if it's a restaurant or a warehouse.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,503
If we were to
renovate the exterior a little bit…

201
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,172
Renovate what?

202
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,757
I guess we can't renovate anything.
We don't have the money.

203
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,302
The second best option
is to change the interior.

204
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:42,887
Let's add more tables.

205
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,017
We can't do any renovations,
you won't compromise on ingredients.

206
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,478
What else can we do but add more tables?

207
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,439
Your sales aren't increasing
because your table turnover rate is low.

208
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,525
From what I saw of the dining hall,

209
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,694
I think we can add about two more tables.

210
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,946
And let's open the door inside
to make a private room.

211
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,282
We should try to utilize the space.

212
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,035
I can't handle it on my own
if we add another table.

213
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,039
That's why we should hire someone.

214
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,124
I did the calculations.

215
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,293
We can afford to hire one person

216
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,087
to do the dishes and prep ingredients.

217
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,798
Excuse me?

218
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,259
You need to spend money to make money

219
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,053
and make more money with that money.

220
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,514
That's the market economy and capitalism.

221
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,307
Who am I talking to?

222
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,517
Are you not going to pay off your debt?

223
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,647
It's not ripe yet.

224
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,315
I thought that was your baby.

225
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,569
Whether we hire or not,
the final decision is mine.

226
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,529
What?

227
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,031
Well, of course!

228
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,825
I made a list of some candidates
just in case.

229
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,285
Oh jeez!

230
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,788
Sorry.

231
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,752
How about him?

232
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,004
He even studied at CIA.

233
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,798
You don't know CIA, do you?

234
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,841
It's a culinary school in America.

235
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,219
No way.

236
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,388
He was at De Murry?

237
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,101
Oh, it's a three-star
French restaurant in Japan.

238
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,104
Do you think those candidates
are a good fit for a place like this?

239
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,399
Jeez, you're frustrating.
Who cares if they're a good fit or not?

240
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,401
We'd be lucky to have someone
with such experience.

241
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,694
He worked at De Murry.

242
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,654
And you need to hire someone like this

243
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,156
so they can fill in for you
if something comes up.

244
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,825
Fill in for who?

245
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,371
Don't take it the wrong way.

246
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm just saying. That's all.

247
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
Yeah, okay. I'm used to this now.

248
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,089
It's "Le Murir,"
not "De Murry," you muttonhead.

249
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,717
Muttonhead?

250
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,388
Which century is she from?
No one uses that word anymore.

251
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,183
Oh, right.

252
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,020
It's Le Murir. Yes, it is.

253
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,149
Wait. How does she know that?

254
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,483
I'm off to the market!

255
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,154
Gosh, kids these days
have such long eyelashes.

256
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,365
They're an enhanced species.

257
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:14,038
They're freakishly tall and handsome
and have such great skin.

258
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,251
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

259
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
What do you want?

260
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,968
Who are you?

261
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,720
Apparently, this is the latest trend.

262
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,681
-What do you think?
-Sorry?

263
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,141
This.

264
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,477
Looks nice, I guess.

265
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,355
By the way, where's the owner?

266
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,274
He went to the bathroom.
What do you want?

267
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,693
10,000 won's worth of
balloon flower roots.

268
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,986
Sure.

269
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,949
Balloon flower roots

270
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,994
Can you bag the big ones?
Lots of them, please.

271
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,954
-Big ones?
-Yes.

272
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,288
It's not mine, so I'll give you lots.

273
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,627
Do you have castor bean leaves,
not taro leaves?

274
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,549
Eun-jae confessed his feelings
with castor bean flowers.

275
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,093
The meaning of that flower is love.

276
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,553
It's so romantic.

277
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,602
Did you not watch Lovely Jogger?

278
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,940
Oh my gosh. No way.

279
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,526
You haven't watched this yet?

280
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,278
What's this?

281
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,782
Oh my gosh. I'm so jealous of you.

282
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,868
You have something to look forward to.
You're so lucky.

283
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,288
We don't have castor bean leaves.
How about some taro leaves instead?

284
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,251
I thought you couldn't eat them
because they're poisonous.

285
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,714
There's a lot you don't know.

286
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,925
You boil the taro leaves.

287
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,052
Rinse them in rice water,

288
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,804
then squeeze them but don't crush them.

289
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,598
Then put some perilla oil in a pan
and stir-fry them.

290
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,976
It's such a delicacy.

291
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,936
Do you want some?

292
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,062
Want what?

293
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,816
She asked for castor bean leaves,
so I told her to try taro leaves.

294
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,028
You think Chef Mo would buy just anything?

295
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,404
She can't even pay her tab.

296
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,783
I'll just take a pack of young radishes.

297
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,911
What kind of chef
is reluctant to try new ingredients?

298
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,331
"You see, cooking

299
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,293
is all about the journey and challenges."

300
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,713
That's a line from Lovely Jogger.

301
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,674
While picking taro leaves…

302
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,967
Give it a go.

303
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:32,926
She may not look it,

304
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,512
but she's the ace of our neighborhood's
kongnamul gukbap restaurant.

305
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,351
Candidates five and seven
are incredible at replicating recipes.

306
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,106
Okay. Tell five and seven
to come for an interview tomorrow.

307
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,025
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

308
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,446
Ms. Mo, let's finish our conversation.

309
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,532
If you say you'll hire someone
and then not cooperate--

310
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,617
I hired someone.

311
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,744
What?

312
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,205
My goodness, it's so spacious.

313
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,708
I thought it was an abandoned house,
but it's an actual restaurant.

314
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,919
I'm sorry. Our break time isn't over.

315
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,629
Could you wait outside for a bit?

316
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,881
Excuse me, you can't…

317
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,841
What's going on?

318
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,677
She'll be working with us, starting today.

319
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,891
She worked at
2nd Gen. Kongnamul Gukbap for 15 years.

320
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,394
She can do everything
from prepping ingredients to serving,

321
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,563
dishwashing, and even cleaning.

322
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,318
So you're the restaurant manager, right?

323
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,615
She just happened to be looking
for a new job.

324
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,659
It was perfect timing.

325
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,452
I'm Jin Myung-sook.

326
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,788
You can consider me your older sister
and call me by my name.

327
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,875
Myung-sook.

328
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,837
Myung-sook.

329
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,469
What are they doing out there?

330
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,019
Are you kidding me? Are you insane?

331
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
We should hire someone with expertise!

332
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,815
She is an expert.

333
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,733
She has 15 years of experience.

334
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,362
Even so!

335
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,656
The fancy qualifications you showed me
aren't everything.

336
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,075
Why do I lose even when we're not talking?

337
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,077
You said the decision was mine.

338
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,495
You clearly said that.

339
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,248
Are they dating or fighting?

340
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,376
What kind of man goes back on his word?

341
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,253
I lose even harder when we talk.

342
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,255
Why are you talking to yourself
while looking at me?

343
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,758
Also, you should focus on the dining hall,
not the kitchen.

344
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,429
You go on and on about adding tables
when you don't even have money.

345
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,847
This is unbelievable.

346
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,600
Just you wait, okay?

347
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,809
You just wait.

348
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,438
I'll bring the most amazing tables
you've ever seen.

349
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,816
Bring tables? You?

350
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,942
How? You don't have any money.

351
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,404
I don't believe this.
No one has ever said that to me before.

352
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,906
Han Beom-woo has no money?

353
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,408
Wait right here, okay?

354
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,038
I'll bring the best tables
and by tomorrow morning, it will be--

355
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,916
-It will be what? What?
-It will be…

356
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,376
Stop yapping and just bring them.

357
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,463
-Good grief.
-I swear…

358
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,508
If only I could just flick her forehead.

359
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,968
Come here, you.

360
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,780
Welcome, sir.

361
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,073
Do you have a reservation?

362
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,699
I don't.

363
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,952
-I'd like a royal suite, please.
-Sure.

364
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,294
What is it? The timing of your call
is incredibly ominous.

365
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,213
Sir, your reserve fund
will also be managed

366
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,173
by the Financial Affairs Department.

367
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758
They've suspended your company cards,

368
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,969
and they want you to return
the company car. What now?

369
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,388
-The car?
-Yes.

370
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,431
-My car?
-Yes.

371
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,101
-Even the car?
-Yes.

372
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,562
Come on, this is so unfair.
How am I supposed to get around?

373
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,442
Damn it.

374
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,360
Sir?

375
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,862
What do we do now?

376
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,158
You called at the perfect time.

377
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,119
I was just about to get a room.

378
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,954
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,873
-I mean, I came all the way here.
-Your cards have been cut off.

380
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,209
I should stay at a hanok, not a hotel.

381
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,544
-Sorry?
-You're right.

382
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,837
You won't be able to book a hanok either.

383
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,588
-That's a good idea.
-What is?

384
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,008
-Yeah, I know.
-Sir.

385
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,970
That was brilliant timing.

386
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:52,060
BAEKSU INN

387
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,817
Damn it!

388
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,453
You asked about
the monthly room rental, right?

389
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,954
Yes.

390
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,374
Okay, so the thing is,

391
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,251
I usually use credit cards.

392
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:21,173
So I'm a little short on cash.

393
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,761
With that being said,
could I stay for two or three nights--

394
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,139
Excuse me.

395
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,892
Yes, excuse you.

396
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,774
This is a limited edition watch.

397
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,277
I'm not saying I'm giving it to you,
but if you hold on to it

398
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,197
for a couple of days as I said earlier…

399
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,492
I should change the name of the inn.

400
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,453
I named it "Baeksu,"
and it's really attracting jobless people.

401
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,581
-Come on, man.
-What?

402
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,876
I mean, this is a city of nobles.

403
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,170
In this city of gentlemen,

404
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:04,007
aren't you being too harsh
and cruel to an outsider like me?

405
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,301
I don't have anything else to offer.

406
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:11,264
Well, that jacket looks expensive.

407
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,393
This jacket?

408
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,522
Are you kidding me?

409
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,899
You can't even buy this in Korea!

410
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,443
Do you actually take me for a beggar?

411
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,221
I got robbed blind, didn't I?

412
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,014
What?

413
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,307
Nothing.

414
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,145
The jacket suits you.

415
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,023
This is a great room.

416
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,900
It's like royalty.

417
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,280
You know, like the ones
used by royalty back in the day.

418
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,906
Like Crown Prince Sado's?

419
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,575
A crown prince?

420
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,662
Well, I did put a great deal of work
into the decor.

421
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,747
I'm quite tired. Goodbye now.

422
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,499
Thank you. Bye.

423
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,218
SAMSHIK

424
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,903
You go on and on about adding tables
when you don't even have money.

425
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,196
You don't even have money.

426
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,619
You don't even have money!

427
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,498
No, wait. Hang on.

428
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,584
Move slowly. Keep it level.

429
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,128
Left, right. Left, right.

430
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,340
-We'll be off then.
-Bye.

431
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,674
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

432
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,352
Would it be nicer with a bigger curve?

433
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,522
I would've had them custom-made
if we had more time.

434
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
What do you think?

435
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,738
-Looks no good at all.
-I agree.

436
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,865
Who's Samshik?

437
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,660
Was he mugged on the way?
He looks dreadful.

438
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,079
Not me! I'm asking about the tables!

439
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,456
They're fine.

440
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,250
"Fine"?

441
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,585
Hey, look closely.

442
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,715
Do you know what it took to get these?

443
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,511
Man, this is one luxurious watch.

444
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,140
Enjoy the tables.

445
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,977
You know you practically
got them for free, right?

446
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,898
Let's see. Are these even durable?

447
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,650
Oh gosh!

448
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,820
I noticed the top come right off earlier.

449
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,446
See? I told you.

450
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,867
What are you doing?

451
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,998
Why bring these here if you're going to
treasure them like that?

452
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,333
-You should've just taken them home.
-Tell me about it.

453
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,630
Could you be a little more careful?

454
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,465
Sure thing.

455
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,264
Where are you going? We're opening soon!

456
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,183
I'm not going out to slack off!
Don't worry.

457
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,602
Okay. Go have fun.

458
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,068
CHEF'S SPECIAL
FINE DINING

459
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,821
JUNGJAE

460
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,787
JUNGJAE
SEOUL'S FINE DINING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

461
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,714
How are you? I opened a restaurant.

462
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,632
I can guarantee that it's delicious.

463
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,925
I'd love for you to visit.

464
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,678
It's been a while,
so it'd be nice to see you.

465
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,729
HOW ARE YOU? I OPENED A RESTAURANT
I CAN GUARANTEE THAT IT'S DELICIOUS

466
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,314
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

467
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,732
Sorry.

468
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,692
-I'm busy.
-I'm sorry.

469
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,402
-I'll visit some other time.
-I'm not free.

470
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,489
-My schedule is packed.
-Maybe next time.

471
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,991
I guess word got out
that I'm out of my seat now.

472
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,952
Man, this is going to be
a pain in the butt.

473
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,538
Damn it.

474
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,210
I'm busy, but I'll make the time.

475
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,378
Where is it?

476
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,590
The Hanok Village near the stream,
second alley, third entrance.

477
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,135
I'm sorry, but that's too far away.

478
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,471
I'll give you a shout-out
if you send me photos though.

479
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,315
No, not you. Don't go!

480
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,320
I should just kill myself.

481
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,410
That's gross.

482
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,162
Customers just walked in.

483
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,664
How about you go and serve them?

484
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,251
My gosh, what a dreadful sight.

485
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,422
Pay in advance, please!

486
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,632
We don't…

487
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,843
You're paying?

488
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,803
How cool is that?

489
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,179
Thanks.

490
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,351
That's all right, ma'am.

491
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,771
Enjoy the meal at your leisure,
and you can pay on your way out.

492
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,779
Two set meals.

493
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,740
-One moment, please.
-Okay, two set meals.

494
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,205
What do you think about the casual tone
she takes with the customers?

495
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,333
What do I think? I think it's nice.

496
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,376
What?

497
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,420
She sounds friendly.

498
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,047
Fine. Forget the casual speech.

499
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,716
But isn't it wrong to ask
for payment in advance?

500
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,552
They say it's more convenient.

501
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,305
She said that's how things were
at the kongnamul gukbap restaurant too.

502
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,765
But this is…

503
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,100
We don't sell kongnamul gukbap!

504
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,603
Sounds like you're being condescending
about the kongnamul gukbap restaurant.

505
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,313
That's where I used to work, you know.

506
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,024
No, that's not it.

507
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,361
Excuse me.

508
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,783
Those who pay in advance
rarely order more food.

509
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,994
People who pay on the way out
are 50% more likely to order extra,

510
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,621
leading to increased sales.

511
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,832
That's based on data analysis performed by
those in this industry, myself included.

512
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,918
According to my data analysis,

513
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,879
paying in advance
increases table turnover rate.

514
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,297
Also,

515
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,424
if I feel that you're being condescending,
it means you are.

516
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,552
Saying you're not when I feel you are,
still comes off as condescending.

517
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,681
You do nothing but play around
on your phone, so I was trying to help.

518
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,642
I never played around.

519
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,019
-Sure.
-Do you even know what viral marketing is?

520
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,646
-Viral marketing is--
-Oh.

521
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,814
Excuse me.

522
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,150
Hall Manager.

523
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,070
If you're done viral marketing,
go and serve them.

524
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,989
Yes, sir.

525
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,871
Is there something you need?

526
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,998
-Can I have some water?
-Sure.

527
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,543
Plating…

528
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,129
Plating is really crucial.

529
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,468
Who are you off to see? Oh my gosh.

530
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,389
My goodness! It was you?

531
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,807
You were the dad?

532
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,685
You should've said so, you punk.

533
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,563
You drove everyone crazy and now it's out?

534
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,817
Can you concentrate on the dishes
when you're doing the dishes?

535
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,778
Watching my dramas keeps me efficient.

536
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,496
For goodness' sake.

537
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,708
Someone's being real tight.

538
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,138
SALES LOG, INVENTORY LOG

539
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,903
Why don't you help out
instead of just being on the laptop?

540
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,281
I'm managing the finances,
the most important part of this business.

541
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,449
I see.

542
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,037
-Oh dear.
-Oh, come on.

543
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,331
My mistake. This was a real mistake.

544
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,540
How was that a mistake?

545
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,752
Forget it.

546
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,253
Oh dear.

547
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,839
Why is it so gloomy out?

548
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,926
It's a perfect day for kimchi jeon.

549
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,595
Why are you thinking about
eating kimchi jeon at work?

550
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,138
Don't.

551
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,016
I'm telling you now, don't do it!

552
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,492
By any chance…

553
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,619
OH, THIS DOESN'T FIT MY FEED

554
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,205
-Do you have anything else?
-Yes!

555
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,915
-Perhaps with better plating.
-Yes.

556
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,253
We serve sotbap
in the afternoon course, right?

557
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,714
Can you quickly make that right now?

558
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,049
Make sure the plating looks good.

559
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm good friends with this influencer,

560
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,347
and she offered to give us a shout-out.

561
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,308
She has 1.3 million followers.

562
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,936
You want me
to cook a stone pot rice for that?

563
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,897
Are there any plates
that will look pretty in photos?

564
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,401
Don't you know sotbap
is all about keeping it hot?

565
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,528
I know that.

566
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,072
It's for social media, to show others.

567
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,701
Sotbap is served in a pot.
Even a halfwit would know that.

568
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,537
Yes, you're right. I'm a halfwit.

569
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,124
So Chef Mo, please make it
and put it on top of a pretty plate.

570
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,960
Wait, no.

571
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,046
Should we change the pots
to more fancy-looking ones?

572
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,298
How about something
from Le Caub or Stareuset?

573
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,759
Pots that are ridiculously expensive
just because of their names?

574
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,969
Are you kidding me?

575
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:37,056
Yes, Chef. Just make sure
that the dish looks extra nice.

576
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,809
How, exactly?
You want me to top it with a flower?

577
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:44,188
Anything that isn't meant to be eaten
shouldn't be placed on a dish.

578
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,232
What nonsense are you yapping on about?

579
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,447
I really can't get through to you.

580
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,115
Listen.

581
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,826
I need to send some photos over.

582
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,539
Just cook something that looks pretty.
It can be anything.

583
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,124
Just make something!

584
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,334
It doesn't have to taste good.
Just whip up something.

585
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,629
This is what
all the famous restaurants in Seoul do.

586
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,131
Don't you know viral marketing?

587
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,091
You have such a low standard.

588
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,135
So this is the standard
of a big corporation, huh?

589
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,636
What did you say?

590
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,014
-"Low standard"?
-Yeah, low standard!

591
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,437
Oh no.

592
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,782
IF YOU'RE BUSY, I'LL DO IT NEXT TIME

593
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,326
I HAVE TO HEAD TO MY NEXT APPOINTMENT!

594
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,184
I told you…

595
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,897
I told you not to make kimchi jeon!

596
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,612
Let me make this clear.

597
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,905
This place

598
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,993
isn't where you cook what you want to eat,
watch viral shows, and slack off, lady…

599
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,829
Myung-sook!

600
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,791
Didn't you say
you worked in the field for 15 years?

601
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,043
I don't know how you were trained
at your previous job,

602
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,754
but according to my standards,

603
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,173
everything,

604
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,592
absolutely everything you do

605
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,469
falls short of
even the most basic standards!

606
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,595
The basics!

607
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,724
You rejected all the qualified chefs.

608
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,018
Do you even want to pay off your debt?

609
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,771
You don't want a chef who went to CIA
or the help of an influencer.

610
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,731
What the hell do you want me to do?

611
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,694
Perhaps the restaurant ended up like this

612
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,904
because of your pride…

613
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:57,947
No.

614
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,409
Because of your inferiority complex!

615
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,418
Since the two of you are so great
and qualified, do whatever you want.

616
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,753
Cook everything you want to eat.

617
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,130
I don't care anymore.

618
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,634
JUNGJAE

619
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,266
Goddammit!

620
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,769
Calm down.

621
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,689
I just need to endure it for a month,
get the recipes,

622
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,899
and take over the restaurant.

623
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,150
Yeah, that's it.

624
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,675
It looks like we should have makgeolli.

625
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,927
Rice wine? What with?

626
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,969
I want pajeon.

627
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,888
Hey, look.

628
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,474
Samshik, you punk.

629
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,061
Damn it. What the…

630
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,273
It's not Samshik. Why did you hit him?

631
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,817
-I said it wasn't him.
-Why did you hit him?

632
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,486
You said it was Samshik.

633
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,029
Who are you calling Samshik?

634
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,490
SAMSHIK

635
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,288
Whatever. Just go.

636
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,915
GACHUKSO, HONALDO

637
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,708
What's that? "Jungjae"?

638
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,418
-It's trash.
-Jung-jae's trash?

639
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,173
It's a flyer for Jungjae, the restaurant,
but now it's just trash.

640
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,716
Why are you holding trash?

641
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,051
Did you and your wife fight?

642
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,220
My wife?

643
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,055
Or is your mother-in-law here
or something?

644
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,811
Mom-in-law? It overlaps, oddly enough.

645
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,689
Damn it.

646
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,357
JUNGJAE

647
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,485
My gosh. It's raining hard.

648
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,948
Where did he go without an umbrella?

649
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,492
Who are you talking about?

650
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,329
I think I was out of line.

651
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,373
I could've made the jeon at home.

652
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,001
Don't worry.

653
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,171
He wrote all that stuff in the contract,
so he has to keep his word.

654
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,089
What's that?

655
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,924
Don't worry about it.

656
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,847
JUNGJAE

657
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:35,813
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP 3RD BRANCH
BROTHER'S VEGETABLE SHOP 4TH BRANCH

658
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,358
So what I'm saying is…

659
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,485
Listen.

660
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,574
It's not just the tables
that I'm upset about.

661
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,367
It was a huge opportunity!

662
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,370
Celebs with a huge following
don't just offer to do free PR.

663
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,831
That's not how things work
in this industry.

664
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,541
Right, you have a point.

665
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,961
Chef Mo does have
quite an odd personality.

666
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,255
-She sure does.
-Even odd has its limits.

667
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,008
Have you seen the wild look in her eyes?
She's insane!

668
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,094
That's not all. She's incredibly stubborn.

669
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,222
Sometimes, she's not just stubborn.
She's simply a pain.

670
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,557
-My point exactly.
-I know.

671
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,185
And it's not like her food
is that extraordinary.

672
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,478
Is her food that tasty?

673
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,729
Right.

674
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,358
-Maybe that's why it's tasty.
-Yeah.

675
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,318
Anyone can make the food she…

676
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,528
Well, not anyone can.

677
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,406
Right. People don't go
because they don't know it's a restaurant.

678
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,409
Those who know take their kids
and their kids' kids there.

679
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,328
It's a hidden gem, I tell you.

680
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,705
It's too tucked away though.

681
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,290
It's well-hidden.

682
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,630
Thanks for the drinks. Good day.

683
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,095
Of course, people like you are needed
so the people who cook can shine.

684
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,513
People like me?

685
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,891
I'm sure Chef Mo knows

686
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,770
that what you do, Newbie,
isn't entirely meaningless.

687
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,438
"Newbie"?

688
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,365
This is…

689
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,747
Oh, look. Our manager's back.

690
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,835
What do you want?

691
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:25,548
Nothing. It's just that the cockles
are so fresh today.

692
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,551
We have a fantastic dinner menu.

693
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,470
-I need some more cockles.
-You do?

694
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:36,392
Then mix that up.
I'll quickly shell you a few more.

695
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,569
The plates…

696
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,448
You do have pretty plates.

697
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,158
You do?

698
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,039
I should go get some spring onions.

699
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,375
I'll take a while.

700
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,234
What's this? Is it for me?

701
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,447
Restaurants are all about
sanitation and hygiene.

702
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,616
Next to that is the staff meal.

703
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,743
MR. MANAGER

704
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,331
She made it with what we had
to save as much as possible.

705
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,335
She asked the customers to pay in advance
to make sure the accounts were balanced.

706
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,463
Myung-sook always puts
the restaurant first.

707
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm back.

708
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,763
I'm sorry I came back so soon.
Is everything okay?

709
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,099
-I need some chili powder.
-Okay, chili powder.

710
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,267
Let's add it in.

711
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,937
Chili powder!

712
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,648
What's that?

713
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,361
-Chili powder.
-What?

714
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,403
What's this?

715
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,240
Is this chili powder?

716
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,413
How did you get this?

717
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,626
You didn't steal it, did you?

718
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,796
You have a way of saying things so nicely.

719
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,756
It's so sweet. It's like sugar.

720
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:35,928
What are you doing?

721
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,932
Did you drink during working hours?

722
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,850
No, listen.

723
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,020
I met the vegetable shop owner
and butcher shop owner.

724
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,815
And they said
people here drink as they work.

725
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,192
I refused, saying I don't drink.

726
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,736
But they kept offering,
and I just accepted it.

727
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,613
-Newbie!
-One after another…

728
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,991
That's them right there.

729
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,452
-Sirs!
-What brings you here?

730
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,372
Come on in! What are you waiting for?

731
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,416
-Come in.
-Did you bring someone?

732
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,544
-You shine even brighter back there.
-Goodness me.

733
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:11,213
Meat and Veggie are here.

734
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,464
-This place looks nice.
-It does.

735
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,967
-Find a seat.
-You're not here to see me?

736
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,219
-Come in.
-No, it's our team dinner.

737
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,306
See? This is marketing.
Aren't you going to take their orders?

738
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,434
Just a moment, everyone.

739
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,436
-Come in.
-This place has changed a lot.

740
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,938
This is actual stone. It's real stone.

741
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,441
-Come this way. Sit over here.
-Good idea.

742
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,818
This makes it easier to manage.

743
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,819
This was a good idea.

744
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,529
-Stop that.
-Myung-sook.

745
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,823
Serve your special kimchi jeon for free.

746
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,783
-Our newbie's good.
-For free.

747
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,828
His build is like Son Heung-min's.

748
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,080
Right. I'm glad we recruited him.

749
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,832
Yeah. I smell cockles.

750
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,300
Here they are.

751
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,513
Oh, right. Two more cockle
and buckwheat jeon!

752
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,598
Okay.

753
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,479
Here's some suyuk
and cockle and buckwheat jeon.

754
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,025
Here's your makgeolli.

755
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,818
Two more of these.

756
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,070
-Two more.
-Okay.

757
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,132
This isn't food. It's art.

758
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,385
Chef Mo is an artist.

759
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,984
-I can't.
-Just take a sip.

760
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,569
Drink up.

761
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,120
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

762
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,340
We should go now. It's time to pay.

763
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,134
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

764
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,386
-Ask you parents to bring you again.
-Thank you.

765
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,971
-Bye.
-Take care.

766
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,350
-Come again.
-Tell me if you need more chili powder.

767
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,520
I'm drunk on alcohol and good flavor.

768
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,021
Sirs, you have my loyalty!

769
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,314
Join us for a soccer game!

770
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,399
-I will.
-Go home.

771
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,775
-Bye!
-Get home safely.

772
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,985
-Go on then.
-Bye!

773
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,532
Gosh, I'm tired.

774
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,622
That's so childish.

775
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,458
Fine. Upward, one, two, three.

776
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,542
-Hey.
-Hey.

777
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,338
I'm so tired and hungry.

778
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,175
The shirt feels nice.

779
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:11,727
Who are you?

780
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,355
You look very different
when you're off the clock.

781
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,024
Hashtag, OOTD.

782
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,443
Hashtag, today's fashion.

783
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,029
Hashtag, fake leather jacket. You know?

784
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,364
Are you off to a club?

785
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,700
Why would I go to a club?

786
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,369
That's only fun on the weekends
when you go to shake your booty.

787
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,413
-Oh my.
-Like this.

788
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,664
Please stop.

789
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,333
Did you come here together?

790
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,418
It was a long day for us all.

791
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,004
How about the three of us go grab a drink?

792
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,464
A team dinner?

793
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,716
It's either Beer Shop
or a sundae restaurant.

794
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,135
The makgeolli place
across the road is nice too.

795
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,012
I'll call and ask if they have a table.

796
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,641
You should publish a guidebook
instead of working in a kitchen.

797
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,102
If you spend like that
as soon as you earn--

798
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,812
-You don't want to?
-What?

799
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,356
-Forget it then.
-Oh dear.

800
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,776
-I'd love to.
-Right?

801
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,445
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

802
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,326
Who the heck is that?

803
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,681
Who was it?

804
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,392
Oh, is he your clubbing buddy?

805
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,437
-No.
-Which bastard stole my employee?

806
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,273
-Tell me right now.
-Who are you?

807
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,607
Was it you?

808
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,319
Who's this thug lacking in manners,
awareness, and style?

809
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,404
Was it you?

810
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,780
I asked you a question.

811
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,574
Who am I?

812
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,409
I'm someone who's completely lost it

813
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,619
because I lost an employee
of 15 years, okay?

814
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,747
Myung-sook.

815
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,710
Myung-sook.

816
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,546
-What happened to your face?
-What?

817
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,966
How hard did you put her to work
that she got this haggard in a few days?

818
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,010
Did the facelift go wrong?

819
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,137
Myung-sook, come with me.

820
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,472
Let's talk it out.
I know how you feel now.

821
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,432
I won't go.

822
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,393
Come on!
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.

823
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,811
-Let go. I'm not going.
-Hey!

824
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,938
We'll go and talk. Trust me.

825
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,148
Oh my goodness.

826
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,193
Why are you putting your hands on a woman?

827
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,613
Let go of me!

828
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,031
Please let go.

829
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,198
Jeez.

830
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,283
I let go.

831
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,542
What did you do to convince her to stay?

832
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,128
It's not right
for fellow restaurant owners to do this

833
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,671
in the same neighborhood!

834
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,049
You poached and stole my employee
with some sweet talk.

835
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,092
Why would you say something like that?

836
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,136
You offered a raise
of one million won, huh?

837
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,679
No, they didn't.

838
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,765
-We did?
-And a bonus on top of that.

839
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,309
And you said you'd pay for her to stay
at a fancy hotel.

840
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,977
Don't stop me.

841
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,687
-We did?
-What else was there?

842
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,857
A chef? You offered to make her a chef?

843
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,567
-What?
-What?

844
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,110
-We did?
-We did?

845
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,904
See, it's not like that.

846
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,032
Oh dear. I don't know what to do now.

847
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,083
Rolled omelet sounds good too.

848
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,795
But when it comes to rolled omelets,
it's all about how many eggs were used.

849
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,298
Their swordtip squid is good too.

850
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,051
You've been looking at the menu forever!

851
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,136
Tell us what happened.

852
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,139
The one million won raise and bonus.

853
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,725
Staying at a hotel and the chef title.

854
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,851
I'll order for us first.

855
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,311
-Myung-sook.
-Okay.

856
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,023
I bluffed.

857
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,316
You bluffed?

858
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,944
I worked there for so long,

859
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:53,156
but he did nothing for me
and just looked down on me.

860
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,909
As soon as Chef Mo
asked if I wanted to work with her,

861
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,994
I went back there and bragged.

862
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,665
I told him that someone else
wanted to work with me.

863
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,417
He suddenly got angry

864
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,586
and told me to get lost
and work there instead.

865
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,672
What would I say in that situation?

866
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:13,051
I had no choice but to shout back.

867
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,763
So I told him she'd offered me
all these things if I worked with her

868
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,600
and that they'd regret letting me go.

869
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,977
That's it.

870
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,603
There's a limit to what to bluff about.

871
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,980
Come on.

872
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,899
I have some pride too, you know.

873
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,192
Stop it.

874
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,528
Let's be honest.

875
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,448
I don't have a skill to be proud of.

876
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:39,077
All I did was show up every day
and work at that restaurant.

877
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:44,249
I can't hold my head up high
unless I bluff a bit.

878
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:47,544
Oh, come on.

879
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,296
Why can't you hold your head up high?

880
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,133
Your 15-year experience
is a skill in itself.

881
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,804
Whatever. You're a chef now.

882
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,890
It's not hard to be one.

883
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,687
Hey. That's a bit too…

884
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,356
He's right. I can't be a chef.

885
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,067
Why can't you be one?

886
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,445
Why do you think you're not good enough?

887
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,908
Just say you'll do it.

888
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,035
Yeah, okay. I'll do it.

889
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,371
I'll be a chef. Gosh, thank you.

890
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,290
Chef. Cheers.

891
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,252
-Chef.
-To our new chef.

892
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,299
Anyway,

893
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,804
I noticed the gukbap restaurant owner
was pretty young.

894
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,222
He's not the owner.

895
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,099
He's a loser.

896
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,727
His grandfather left his dad
the restaurant,

897
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,104
and he just mans the counter.

898
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,690
It's called 2nd Gen. Kongnamul Gukbap
and not 3rd Gen. for a reason.

899
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,234
They haven't acknowledged him yet.

900
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,945
He has the eyes of a man
whom you can't reason with.

901
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,282
Why worry?

902
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,827
Someone here has eyes just as potent.

903
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,539
-What?
-Why? What?

904
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,582
I'll talk to him.

905
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,126
Let's just clink glasses and drink.

906
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,964
Let's not drink too much.

907
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,466
Staying in peak condition
is also a part of…

908
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,551
Part of…

909
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,021
I have a physical checkup tomorrow.

910
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,986
2ND GEN. KONGNAMUL GUKBAP

911
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,446
Why did you come back alone?

912
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,031
Where is she?

913
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,243
You failed to convince an employee
to change her mind?

914
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,619
She wasn't just any employee.

915
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,788
She was the ace of our restaurant!

916
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,749
All you did was make a fool of yourself
in front of them.

917
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,668
You fool. You moron.

918
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:56,882
Father, I almost won her back.

919
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,885
And I didn't make a fool of myself.
I sent a formal notice.

920
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,094
You did what?

921
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,638
Sorry, everyone.

922
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,349
Trust me and wait a bit.

923
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,268
I'll sort it all out.

924
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,061
Why do I even expect anything from you?

925
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,064
-Can I pay?
-Of course you can.

926
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,317
Why are you yelling at Choon-seung?

927
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,279
Don't even mention that fool.

928
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,114
I ought to just…

929
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,409
You're not okay.

930
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:28,163
Cheers.

931
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,849
You're drunk, aren't you?

932
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,560
You're drunk.

933
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,814
-I'm not drunk.
-You know,

934
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,859
back when I used to go to Harton…

935
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:03,615
there was no soju in Koreatown.

936
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,909
Why? I'd drunk it all.

937
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,995
How dare you take me on?

938
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,831
Stop talking and drink.

939
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,708
Drink up. Fill your glass.

940
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:14,960
-Can you manage?
-Yeah.

941
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,921
You're drunk. You are.

942
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,590
-Drink up.
-Yeah, go ahead and drink it.

943
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,167
What are you thinking about?

944
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,461
-Your lips.
-My…

945
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,380
Darn you!

946
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,217
Why do your lips look like that?

947
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,803
It's vibrating.

948
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,977
FINE-DINING RESTAURANT LA LECEL
HIRES STAR CHEF JANG YOUNG-HYE

949
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,188
"I'LL BECOME AN AMBASSADOR
OF KOREAN CUISINE"

950
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,858
What kind of ridiculous nonsense is this?

951
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,738
-You may look around freely.
-Thanks.

952
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,877
Diamant.

953
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,629
Two stars.

954
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,595
I looked around the kitchen and wow.

955
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,180
It was truly impressive.

956
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,432
I'm glad you like it.

957
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,933
I look forward to working with you.

958
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,686
I won't disappoint you.

959
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,980
I promise to get you three stars.

960
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,815
To three stars.

961
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,987
With that eyesore Han Beom-woo
out of my sight,

962
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,990
I can focus on my cooking now.

963
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:11,910
He's utterly helpless.

964
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:21,336
I'm speaking too harshly
of your brother, aren't I?

965
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:23,963
Not only is he helpless

966
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,508
but he's more persistent than you think.

967
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,676
Sorry?

968
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,097
Do you know how I'm different
from that bastard?

969
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,517
I actually like…

970
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,853
what I do.

971
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,899
That's why he can't make it.

972
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,320
He couldn't in the past, he can't now,

973
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,322
and he never will.

974
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,259
Damn you, Chef Jang!

975
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,177
Who was it?

976
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,388
-Your call cannot be connected
-Voicemail.

977
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,099
-and will go to voicemail after the beep.
-Voicemail.

978
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,478
Damn you, Chef Jang!

979
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,191
Do you call yourself human?

980
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,318
How could you stab me in the back?

981
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,363
How could you, Jang Young-hye?

982
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,740
Young-hye!

983
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,494
This isn't right.

984
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:41,124
Yeah, I was a bit rude to you.

985
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,709
I give you that.

986
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:46,796
But still, how could you do this to me?

987
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,008
Someone like him
even has a girlfriend, huh?

988
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,844
How could you abandon me?

989
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,722
Okay, fine. I get that too. I get it.

990
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:00,059
But how could you leave me
for my older brother?

991
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,811
That's just wrong!

992
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,354
Is this a third-rate drama?

993
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,654
I'm going to crush you both. You hear me?

994
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,575
I'll steal all the recipes from this place

995
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,369
and crush you both.

996
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,289
What's he saying?

997
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:25,793
All of you. I'll crush you all.

998
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,089
I'll crush both of you.

999
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,675
-Mark my words.
-Hey.

1000
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,388
Where's Myung-sook? Tell me.

1001
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,182
What do you want now?

1002
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,100
What do you think?

1003
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,562
I thought about this all night long.

1004
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:48,483
I can't eat without her.

1005
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,736
You both think
you're in a drama or something?

1006
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,113
What is it?

1007
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,159
Your dad won't give you the restaurant
because you lost an employee?

1008
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,374
I'm the owner!

1009
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,376
My father…

1010
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,878
is the chairman.

1011
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,881
You'll never become the owner.

1012
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,011
I'm the owner!

1013
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,640
Let go.

1014
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,475
Want me to twist your arm again?

1015
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,937
Want me to pull out your hair?

1016
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,566
Let go. Damn it.

1017
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,694
-Let go.
-You let go.

1018
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,279
-Let go.
-You let go first.

1019
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,462
My chest…

1020
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,677
What did you say earlier?

1021
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,266
Me? What? Why?

1022
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,226
Be honest.

1023
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,896
Why did you come all the way here?

1024
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,267
TASTEFULLY YOURS

1025
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,810
The rumor is all over town.

1026
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:48,770
We'll give as good as we got.

1027
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,607
Find out in detail
what Han Beom-woo is doing there.

1028
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,443
The police say they think it was arson.

1029
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,738
-Why the hell did you commit such a crime?
-Do you have proof?

1030
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,616
I'm sure there's something
we can do for the restaurant.

1031
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,827
I can't believe
the things I'm getting myself into.

1032
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,454
I was just worried.

1033
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,500
Do you even know
who this guy is and what he does?

1034
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,836
