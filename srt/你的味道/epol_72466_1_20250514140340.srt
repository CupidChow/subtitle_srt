00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
Get fully players

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,340
You can still get full

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,420
You can still get full

Save Mits instance

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Let's go.

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,520
No, no, no.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
Not that I don't have it.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,300
I'll go back tomorrow.

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,060
Do you have it?

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,120
Tomorrow?

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,180
Pardon?

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,440
There's an eraser in my head.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,840
I'll forget you tomorrow.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:16,920
Now.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,920
For an hour.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Oh, my.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Hello, sir.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,920
I'll briefly brief you on today's schedule.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
We're going to have an hour of meeting today.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
After the meeting, we have a meeting with the CEO of the agency.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Jang.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,040
Yes.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,120
You talk too much.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Oh, yes.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,320
Shall we get started?

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,320
That's before the sales team leader and the strategic planning manager arrive.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Why are you always like that?

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,320
You mean the people who are later than the director were fired from the company?

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Jung's team, just lock the door in the meeting room.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Let's start with Hansang XP.

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,400
Yes.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Hansang XP is a Korean whiskey business that is being prepared by the group.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
It's a mainstream that will pair with L'Arcel and Moto.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's a new product developed through a tree.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Who are you explaining to?

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Is there a new employee here?

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I heard you got a comment from the national agency.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Yes, the Jojo side is a separate branch.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,440
The national agency...

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Don't sell it as whiskey.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Turn it into a traditional drink.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,440
But the whiskey business that's already going on...

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Hey, team.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Yes.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
What's the percentage of the traditional liquor stock?

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll check it right away.

52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,920
72% of the evidence, half of the traditional liquor, 36%.

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Team.

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Yes.

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
It's left after the meeting.

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Is this something you don't know about me?

58
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
But the traditional liquor license is either a national liquor or a local specialty.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Hey, team.

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Yes.

61
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Find local specialty or traditional liquor that is currently on sale and develop a high-grade liquor that can be aged.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Hey, sales team.

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Yes.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Can you hire a master, an expert, and a company that can sell liquor and OEM?

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'll check it.

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
It's not a favor, it's what I'm telling you to do.

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Now, the next one.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yes, the next one.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Recipe thief Han Beom-hoon!

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Apologize and compensate!

72
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,120
One award for the big company's

73
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,120
reprimand is responsible and compensated.

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Recipe thief Han Beom-hoon!

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Apologize and compensate!

76
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,120
One award for the big company's

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
reprimand is responsible and compensated.

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Recipe thief Han Beom-hoon!

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
You've done a lot.

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
You're working hard.

81
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Big company's reprimand!

82
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
You're coming this way.

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Why?

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
What?

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
What if I come?

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
What? Where?

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
What?

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
You look so scary.

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Hey, run!

90
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Excuse me!

91
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Get the car out!

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
This is where customers wait.

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Get the car out!

94
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Mr. Yoo Soomin?

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Yes.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Is that right?

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Move!

98
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
When did you see me?

99
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I was talking to myself. Did you hear me?

100
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Sorry.

101
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Wow, there are so many people.

102
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I heard that the abalone soup is so famous here.

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Who are you?

104
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Why are you here?

105
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Wait a minute.

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
You're here.

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
You're here.

108
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
You're here.

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
What are you doing?

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
What?

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
You're talking to yourself.

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Hide it.

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
What if the client finds out that you're pretending to be a worker?

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Right?

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Boss?

116
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
So you're the mother, right?

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Please talk to her.

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Please talk to her.

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I heard that you're going to sign up for the abalone soup restaurant right away.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
What did you do, sir?

121
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Who are you?

122
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I don't know you.

123
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Who are you?

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
I don't know you.

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Are you here?

126
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
What's wrong with your face?

127
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
You look like a dog.

128
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
How did you come all of a sudden?

129
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
This is mine.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Our chef didn't answer the phone these days.

131
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
He hasn't answered the phone these days.

132
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Well,

133
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Chef Jang is busy these days.

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm busy, too.

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
The food looks more appetizing

136
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
when it was in the restaurant.

137
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Right?

138
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
If you plate it roughly like this,

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
the judges will come to the three stars

140
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
and kill the stars that were there.

141
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
If you do this,

142
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,840
I'll be rewarded for bringing the recipe.

143
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Will you eat it?

144
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Will you eat it?

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Oh, my God.

147
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Gold rice.

148
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Not bad.

149
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Right?

150
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Hunyeon?

151
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Yes, I'm going to make Hunyeon at home.

152
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
I told you not to explain.

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I don't know how to cook.

155
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
You're the ones who make the food delicious.

156
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm going to sell it to make it look good.

157
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
From the front of the customer to the plating.

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Sequence dining.

159
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
I told you to recognize it.

160
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
It's not enough just for showing.

161
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
You can apply the sauce to the customer.

162
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Experience marketing.

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
You know?

164
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes, I see. I'll tell Chef Jang right away.

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
What's the main menu for today?

166
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Truffle nabe?

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's not Chef Jang yet.

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Where's Chef Jang?

169
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Where is it?

170
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Yes, that's great.

171
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
One, two.

172
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Yes, that's great.

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yes, that's great.

174
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I don't know if it's a chef or a student.

175
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
That's great.

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
One more time. One, two, three.

177
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Yes, that's great.

178
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Now, let's listen to the wine glass in front of you.

179
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Let's wrap it up.

180
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
One, two, three.

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Look at the camera and smile.

182
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
One, two, three.

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
I heard that motorbikes are the best in the world these days.

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
They say it's easier to get a ride.

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,840
I heard that the reservation was already full for three months.

186
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
How do you feel?

187
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm thankful.

188
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I heard from the staff that there are people who sell reservations

189
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
like they sell tickets to the concert.

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
I don't know why they do that.

191
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
It's hard to be a person.

192
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Oh, that's it?

193
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Where do you usually get inspiration when you develop a menu?

194
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,840
I get inspiration from my grandmother's food when I was young.

195
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
My grandmother made really delicious cabbage kimchi.

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Oh, my gosh!

197
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Let's take a break.

198
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Yes, sir.

199
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Look at your grandmother.

200
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Cosmo and Mari said that she was your grandmother in the magazine interview.

201
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Did they?

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm just confused.

203
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I've never eaten cabbage kimchi before.

204
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Why are you sitting there?

205
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Is it good?

206
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Cabbage kimchi.

207
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,840
You're saying it's good because you're a doctor?

208
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Forget it.

209
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
Why do you keep getting an interview schedule without permission from the PR team?

210
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
This is a violation of the contract.

211
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh, really?

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,840
Then launching a menu without the permission of the head chef.

213
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
That's also a violation of the contract.

214
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,840
No, who would have thought I didn't give you time to develop a menu?

215
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
How do you develop all those course menus in a month?

216
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
You're in a variety show, shooting a photo.

217
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,840
If you had time to spare, I would have developed it.

218
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Spare time?

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Did I go on a variety show because I liked me?

220
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
It's all our motto.

221
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,840
We're going to promote the restaurant.

222
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Three stars.

223
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm much more professional than Chef Jang Young-ae in restaurant marketing.

224
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
I'll do it myself.

225
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Chef Jang Young-ae, bring three stars.

226
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,840
So, you're going to have to give me time to develop my creativity to bring three stars or not?

227
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Creativity?

228
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Do I ask you for that?

229
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Creativity?

230
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
No.

231
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,840
The recipe I brought from Seoul is the most famous restaurant recipe in Korea.

232
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,840
But, you're telling me to follow the recipe and make it pretty?

233
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Is that so hard?

234
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I forgot for a second.

235
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm crazy about three stars.

236
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,840
The launch of this season's menu will be as planned.

237
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Until then, the main menu truffle nubian is completely prepared.

238
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Chef Jang Young-ae.

239
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm going to the restaurant.

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
You seem busy these days.

241
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
You said you didn't go to the horse racing.

242
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Do you even take my schedule?

243
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
It's okay.

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,840
It's not easy to run a fine dining in a team that sells frozen food.

245
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm having a hard time because I heard it's worse than frozen food.

246
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Even if you look at it, it's only possible for one star to be a two-star.

247
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
You know that, right?

248
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Wait a minute.

249
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
We can't bring the stars as soon as we open it.

250
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,840
L'Arcèle is a two-star in three years?

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Who is being a two-star?

252
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Stop messing around.

253
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Beom-woo.

254
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
What's on your face?

255
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
I'll let you off today.

256
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Today, residents of Parkdalli Village are gathering to open a restaurant.

257
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,840
The main character of the guest who secretly visited the village is...

258
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Hello.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
The owner of the Han-sang Food Fair.

260
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
It's corn powder.

261
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
The owner of the Han-sang Food Fair prepared corn powder.

262
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Mix it thoroughly in the kimchi.

263
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
It looks very delicious.

264
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I'll pack this and deliver it to your house.

265
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I'll deliver it to your house.

266
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I won't do it again.

267
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I won't do it again.

268
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
This is chicken feet from Yeosu.

269
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Mr. Park.

270
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Yes?

271
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
How long have you been working at my house?

272
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
It's been about seven years, sir.

273
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,840
You should have lived with this precious chicken feet.

274
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Pardon?

275
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
You should have made it taste better than the snow.

276
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Pardon?

277
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Let's go.

279
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm sorry, sir.

280
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I'm sorry, sir.

281
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
I'm sorry, sir.

282
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
I'm sorry, sir.

283
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Please give us another chance.

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
How can they leave behind ten years?

285
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,840
This woman has lived her whole life as a food.

286
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
But...

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
The guide book she made abroad...

288
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Guide?

289
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,840
One star, two star, three star...

290
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I'm so angry with that standard.

291
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
But I want to get angry.

292
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,840
I have to be angry to get angry.

293
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,840
In my fantasy group.

294
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Can't you get those three stars?

295
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Keep in mind.

297
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Three stars.

298
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,840
The one who brings them is the owner of this fantasy.

299
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm not the main menu of the auto.

300
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
How long did it take?

301
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
From the date you gave the recipe,

302
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
exactly one month and five days.

303
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,840
It took a long time.

304
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,840
The kick isn't bad.

305
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,840
But the plating...

306
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,840
It's not bad to launch the original motor.

307
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,840
We'll launch the main menu tomorrow.

308
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,840
We have to get the three stars this time.

309
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Got it?

310
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Sir!

311
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I don't know you.

312
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Why do you keep coming out?

313
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Sir, it's not that.

314
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
I'll give you the three stars.

315
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
What the...

316
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
It's the same sound.

317
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
What?

318
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
It's exactly the same.

319
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,840
I searched for a similar menu on the smart GPT.

320
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
What's the motto of our dining motor?

321
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Unique only one.

322
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
That's the three stars.

323
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,840
I got it.

324
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
It feels like fine dining.

325
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Where is it?

326
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Jeonju.

327
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Fine dining Jeonju?

328
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Where?

329
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Can I see the D?

330
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
One star? Two star?

331
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Jeonju. Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do.

332
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Anyway,

333
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
we have to launch it tomorrow.

334
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
What should we do?

335
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Hold the order pamphlet.

336
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,840
And I'll take care of the influx reservation.

337
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I'll take care of it.

338
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Do whatever you want.

339
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I'll take care of it today.

340
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
So, all of you, stand by.

341
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
How dare you mess up my plan?

342
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I'll take care of it.

343
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I'll take care of it.

344
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't have time to walk slowly.

345
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
I don't have to look at the map.

346
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Turn left in a moment.

348
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Turn right about 10 meters ahead.

349
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Turn right. Turn right.

350
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
What is this place?

351
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Oh my gosh.

352
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Oh my gosh.

353
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Here.

354
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
How do I get there?

355
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Put it down.

356
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Put it down.

357
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Oh my gosh.

359
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Turn left.

360
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Turn right in a moment.

361
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Oh my gosh.

362
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Turn right in a moment.

363
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Is this right?

364
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Where are you?

365
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Why are you hiding?

366
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
This is the right place.

367
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
What?

368
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
We've arrived at our destination.

369
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
We're closing the road.

370
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
We're closing the road.

371
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
What?

372
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Well, retro is popular these days.

373
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Jungjae?

374
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
It's fun.

375
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Come here.

376
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Excuse me.

377
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
Ma'am.

378
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Sir.

379
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Sir.

380
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Hello?

381
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Sir.

382
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Hello?

383
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Hello?

384
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Where is the owner?

385
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
I don't understand.

386
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Excuse me.

387
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
Is the owner here?

388
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
What?

389
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
It's dangerous.

390
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
Oh my gosh.

391
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Hey!

392
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
What are you doing?

393
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Excuse me.

394
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,840
You're hurting me because of the high-end cabbage.

395
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Never mind.

396
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Where is the owner?

397
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I'm like this.

398
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
You know Hansang, right?

399
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I have something to say to the owner.

400
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Where is the owner?

401
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,840
What are you doing?

402
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Wow.

403
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
It's been a while since I played a game.

404
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Hey!

405
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Hey!

406
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
Wait!

407
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Wait!

408
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
Were you the owner?

409
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Sir,

410
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
you're right.

411
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
You can't just tear it up.

412
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
It's nothing.

413
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Nubian made it here, right?

414
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Yes.

415
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Excuse me.

417
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,840
Excuse me.

418
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
If you don't mind,

419
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
can I have Nubian?

420
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
It's break time.

421
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
So you can't have it.

422
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Then,

423
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
let's have dinner for two hours.

424
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
No.

425
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
You're right.

426
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Why not?

427
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
What?

428
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Shouldn't you apologize first?

429
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Me?

430
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
What?

431
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Earlier...

432
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Do you know

433
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
how much this dress costs?

434
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,840
You know how much this cabbage costs?

435
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
How much?

436
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
How much?

437
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Are you a king or what?

438
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
What did you say?

439
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Water is a disease, and it's a cancer.

440
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
He's been through all kinds of diseases.

441
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
He's been buried in the ground,

442
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
and he's been put on the ground.

443
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
How much is his life worth?

444
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm sorry.

445
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I'll apologize.

446
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
But...

447
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Nubian...

448
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm upset.

449
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
What?

450
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
So,

451
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
can you make this for me?

452
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
No.

453
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Can you stop talking?

454
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I don't have the ingredients.

455
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
You can just buy them.

456
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
They're not that easy to find.

457
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
What kind of ingredients do you need?

458
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm not asking you to reflect on the king's life.

459
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Then,

460
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
go and buy them yourself.

461
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
You bastard!

462
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Did you just call me a bastard?

463
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
What do you need?

464
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Chef?

465
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Udon.

466
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Udon?

467
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Yes, udon.

468
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
Udon is enough, right?

469
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,840
The cow I raised in the farm in the garden.

470
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
The udon of that cow.

471
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Chef, the udon is all over there.

472
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
It's the most expensive and the best...

473
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Aha!

474
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
The udon of that cow.

475
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
No.

476
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Aha!

477
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
The udon is all over there.

478
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Why are you so picky?

479
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm just thinking.

480
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Yes, 200g of udon.

481
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,840
The best and the most expensive udon in this restaurant.

482
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,840
The cow I raised in the farm in the garden.

483
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
The udon of that cow.

484
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
The...

486
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
The garden?

487
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
The garden?

488
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
The garden?

489
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
Anyway, the cow I raised in that farm.

490
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
The udon of the cow I raised in that farm.

491
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
200g.

492
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Yes, yes, yes.

493
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,840
If you can find it, go to the shop.

494
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The udon of the garden farm.

495
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Oh, this neighborhood.

496
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Is this an event for me?

497
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Is this a hidden camera?

498
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Excuse me.

499
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
From here to here.

500
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Give me everything.

501
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
And the thing in the refrigerator.

502
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
And the thing in the refrigerator.

503
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
And the udon in the restaurant.

504
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Give me everything.

505
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Wow, wow!

506
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
It's a cow.

507
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
It's a cow.

508
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Wait, wait, wait.

509
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
The cow.

510
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
The udon.

511
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
To me.

512
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Oh, my.

513
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Wait a minute.

514
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Yes.

515
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Where's Lars?

516
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Hanson doesn't move much, does he?

517
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Okay, hang up for now.

518
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm going to make udon.

519
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm going to make udon.

520
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
I'm going to make udon.

521
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I'm going to make udon.

522
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,840
I'm going to make udon.

523
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
I'm going to make udon.

524
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm going to make udon.

525
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm going to make udon.

526
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
I'm going to make udon.

527
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
I'm going to make udon.

528
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm going to make udon.

529
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
I'm going to make udon.

530
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
I'm going to make udon.

531
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm going to make udon.

532
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
I'm going to make udon.

533
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm going to make udon.

534
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
The eggs are all broken.

535
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
I want to sell them, too.

536
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
But my wife

537
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
There's an egg temperature.

538
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Her back was broken, so

539
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
there's no way to go to the hospital in the morning.

540
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
What should I do?

541
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
What does that have to do with a sale of eggs?

542
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,840
If someone else goes in, you'll have to sit there and wait.

543
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Aren't you a coward?

544
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
You think you can live without selling eggs?

545
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I'm serious.

546
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
How can I be a beggar?

547
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,840
If you need money, go and get it yourself.

548
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
I guess there's no luck.

549
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Be careful.

550
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Don't let anyone chase you.

551
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,800
açıl

552
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,400
OK, I got it, too!

553
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,360
But you'll never kill me.

554
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,840
As soon as he comes...

555
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
What will I do about it?

556
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,580
Just laugh or lose twice

557
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,380
The world ends

558
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,840
Kyaa!

559
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,600
Yaaaaaaaaaah!!!!

560
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,840
Gyaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

561
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Turn into a thousand earths

562
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
There it is!

563
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Teacher−

564
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,340
Hey...

565
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,160
Hey!

566
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:49,140
Where did you get this?

567
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I got it from Melvin.

568
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,380
But you still keep wanting to get sold by about two billion a month but now you gotı

569
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,380
such a difficult job.

570
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,520
Because of a thing's you would've liked to base it on a real business.

571
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I'm just saying.

572
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,520
How dare you come out and scare me?

573
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
If you do that again, I'll shoot you with the arrow you just saw.

574
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
What did I do?

575
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
In front of your restaurant.

576
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Are you a pervert?

577
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Pervert?

578
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
You said you wanted beef.

579
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Beef!

580
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
What kind of beef?

581
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Udon?

582
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Udon, udon, gently.

583
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
You're a crazy person who keeps messing with the restaurant.

584
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,520
Even if I don't know anyone else, I don't think you'd listen to me.

585
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I told you to buy udon noodles.

586
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
You're going to do this?

587
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
Udon noodles.

588
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,520
I've been to all the udon noodles in this neighborhood.

589
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Here.

590
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Can you see it?

591
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Mawon Farm.

592
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I'm the kind of person who only says I'm going to do it.

593
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
What do you do?

594
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Do you cook right away?

595
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Do you light it up?

596
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
What are you doing? Why are you smelling it?

597
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
How dare you lie to me?

598
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
What?

599
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Teacher, I'm really sorry.

600
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
But today, the Nubian...

601
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
The Seopsanjo.

602
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Yes, that Seop...

603
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
That Sanjo.

604
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
You have to eat it.

605
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Why are you doing this?

606
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Why are you doing this?

607
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Because I have to eat it.

608
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Because I have to eat it.

609
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Because I want to eat it.

610
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Why are you so loud?

611
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
That's what I was going to say.

612
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,520
And with an expression that I don't want to eat anything,

613
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
What do you want to eat?

614
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
You can't judge people by their expressions.

615
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,520
I really want to eat it.

616
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
I want to eat it.

617
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
What?

618
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
There was a real one in the village.

619
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you want to ride the mountain?

620
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
No.

621
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Mushrooms!

622
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,520
You can buy mushrooms at the mart.

623
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Why are you riding the mountain?

624
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Why are you riding the mountain?

625
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm moving to a big company.

626
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
I'm going to...

627
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm moving to a big company.

628
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
If I press the emergency button, everyone will come.

629
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
Maskers or police.

630
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
You...

631
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Don't think about doing anything stupid by bringing me here.

632
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Don't overreact. You won't die.

633
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
I just...

634
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I just want to eat!

635
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
I just want to eat!

636
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Here it is!

637
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Here it is!

638
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
You said you were looking for mushrooms.

639
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Let's go down.

640
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
That's a young man.

641
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Mushrooms are here.

642
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
They're already here.

643
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
What? Is there something there?

644
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

645
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
I'm picking mushrooms.

646
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,520
You can buy them with money. It's dangerous.

647
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
The moment the mushrooms break up on the ground,

648
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
the scent is gone.

649
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
It's most important to keep it as it is.

650
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Even if you get hurt a little, the flavor changes.

651
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Is there something wrong with you?

652
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
What are you talking about?

653
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
What are you talking about?

654
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Is this cabbage kimchi?

655
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
It's not cabbage kimchi.

656
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
It's radish kimchi.

657
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Can I try it?

658
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Go ahead.

659
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm sorry.

660
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Chew it.

661
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I like the one my grandma made the most.

662
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
It's good.

663
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Wake up.

664
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Business.

665
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
I think he's really crazy.

666
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Different ingredients, different recipes.

667
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,520
It's a completely different dish.

668
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
The meat looks thicker.

669
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Is it minced?

670
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,520
You baked the mushrooms in the oven.

671
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,520
It may be confusing to decorate the mushrooms similarly,

672
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,520
but it's a different dish.

673
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
Did you see it well?

674
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
It looks delicious.

675
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
What are you doing?

676
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Is this the price of food?

677
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Okay.

678
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
The person who made it is sincere.

679
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Let's talk.

680
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,520
He's playing alone, playing the drums, and playing the drums.

681
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
What is it?

683
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
What is it?

684
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
It's a bit of a shame to cut the meat that was thinly spread and marinate it in the sauce.

685
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,520
It's a bit of a shame to chop the meat and knead it and bake it.

686
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
The mushrooms were a kick.

687
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
I heard it with my ears.

688
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
How much is the restaurant's sales?

689
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Is there a business in this place?

690
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,520
The wood is bad, so the rent is about 5%.

691
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
But it's a life of ingredients.

692
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
If you look at the cost,

693
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
20% to 30% per day?

694
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
That much?

695
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,520
It's delicious, but it's in an ambiguous location.

696
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
It's a bit of a challenge.

697
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
The shape of the table? Not bad.

698
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,520
But to go like that, you have to raise the chair by about 10cm.

699
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
The lighting is too dark.

700
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,520
If you look at it from the outside, it's a restaurant or a bar.

701
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,520
So I think there's a problem with the overall restaurant management.

702
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
So what do you want to say?

703
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,520
I'll take over the restaurant.

704
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
I'll take over.

705
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,520
If you're asleep, go in.

706
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,520
I can fill in the commission.

707
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
I don't need anything else.

708
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I fell asleep because it sounded ridiculous.

709
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
I'm going to sleep.

710
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,520
If the word, commission, is a little bit small,

711
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
How about investment?

712
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,520
It's not hard.

713
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Just a simple thing.

714
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Just a small thing.

715
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,520
For example,

716
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Recipe?

717
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Share each other

718
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Like this, close.

719
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Big companies like us have advantages.

720
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,520
Big companies are not all bad guys.

721
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Management, difficult, annoying.

722
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,520
Han Sang supports all of that.

723
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,520
You just have to cook the food you're good at.

724
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Han Sang will take care of all this useless stuff.

725
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
What's useless?

726
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Did you just get hurt in your mouth?

727
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
I've never eaten anything like this.

728
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
This little bastard.

729
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,520
The weather, the way of breeding, the nature of the crops.

730
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
I've been looking at it and I've been doing it.

731
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,520
The food supply, the time of the crop, the soil, the fertilizer.

732
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I've been adjusting it, I've been doing it.

733
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,520
It's been 120 days.

734
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,520
You have to look at it for 120 days.

735
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,520
That's when it becomes a white bean.

736
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Do you think that's the end?

737
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
If you soak the beans, grind them, strain them, and then make a bean soup.

738
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
It's not even a strong fire.

739
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,520
Keep stirring it over a low heat and boil it for a while.

740
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
That's how you boil it.

741
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,520
It's going to be the tofu in the pot you ate earlier.

742
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Okay.

743
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Okay.

744
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,520
I know that, so calm down.

745
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
Management?

746
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,520
Management?

747
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,520
What, crazy people only care about money make food?

748
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
That's it?

749
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Hey, this process and sincerity.

750
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,520
I don't even know how much value it has.

751
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
Let's see.

752
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Hey, what if you're crazy about money?

753
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,520
Sincerity?

754
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
The sincerity you're talking about.

755
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,520
You have to earn money.

756
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,520
You have to have money to run your favorite restaurant.

757
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Why do you run a restaurant?

758
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Because you want to?

759
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,520
Not money, not business card.

760
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Do you really have this sincerity?

761
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,520
Think about it.

762
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Whatever it is.

763
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Ha ha ha!

764
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,520
It's okay.

765
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,520
If you don't do it, it's a failure.

766
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Where are you?

767
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
I'm sorry.

769
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,520
The sincerity you're talking about.

770
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
You have to earn money.

771
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,520
You have to have money to run your favorite restaurant.

772
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Why don't you answer your phone?

773
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,520
I heard a sound.

774
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
It's like a market.

775
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,520
You've improved a lot.

776
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,520
You could be an actress.

777
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,520
When are you going to pay the rent?

778
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,520
You said you'd pay it in a month.

779
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
Was it a month?

780
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,520
I think I said two months.

781
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
Are you kidding me?

782
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,520
You should sell bean sprouts soup.

783
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
You're not going to be able to eat this.

784
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,520
I'm going to eat it.

785
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,520
You should sell bean sprouts soup.

786
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,520
There's no signboard, no menu.

787
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,520
What are you going to sell?

788
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
The signboards are outside.

789
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,520
The menu is here.

790
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
What are you talking about?

791
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,520
Pineapple?

792
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm going to do that.

793
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
I'm going to do that.

794
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
I don't have anything to say.

795
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
It's a month.

796
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
If it doesn't work,

797
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,520
take out the store.

798
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
That's...

799
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Where's the thing you took out?

800
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Give it to me.

801
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Shut up.

802
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,520
You're pretty.

803
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm going.

804
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,520
It's not a pineapple. It's a pineapple.

805
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
My sun cap.

806
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,520
What?

807
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,520
It's on TV.

808
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,520
What?

809
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,520
What are you talking about?

810
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
I'm going to do that.

811
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,520
The police are investigating the threat of H.

812
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,520
This is Kim Min-ah.

813
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,520
It's not right to go out with a single shot,

814
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,520
but there's no way to escape.

815
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,520
Let's start with the board of directors.

816
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
Let's start voting.

817
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,520
If you agree with the board of directors,

818
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
please reject it.

819
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
As a reason,

820
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,520
I will inform you that the meeting of director Han Bum-woo has been concluded.

821
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
Fortunately, life is not a problem.

822
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,520
It's number 302.

823
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
What are you going to do?

824
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,520
I don't know.

825
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,520
You have to kneel down.

826
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
I'm going out.

827
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
Hello.

828
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,520
Yes, yes.

829
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,520
What are you worried about?

830
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,520
The upper part of the car is clean.

831
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,520
I just put the vitamin in.

832
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Money?

833
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
I checked.

834
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
Wait a minute.

835
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
I'll be careful.

836
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,520
Please tell Director Han that I'm grateful.

837
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
Yes, yes.

838
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,520
Yes, I'll do it.

839
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
Director Han.

840
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,520
Han Sun-woo.

841
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,520
Chairman, Han Bum-woo is calling.

842
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
Hello.

843
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
So what?

844
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Are you blaming me for getting hit by Director Han Sun-woo?

845
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,520
No, it's not that.

846
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,520
The important thing is...

847
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,520
The important thing is that our stock price fluctuated because of you.

848
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,520
I told you all the time.

849
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
It's the wrong guy to meet.

850
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,520
But this is cheating.

851
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Whether it's cheating or not,

852
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,520
you just have to win.

853
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
I'm not cheating.

854
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,520
Whatever you say.

855
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
You just have to win.

856
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,520
What's the problem?

857
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
You do it like Sun-woo.

858
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,520
No, I don't even compare.

859
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Anyway, three stars are the most important thing.

860
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,520
I'll get three stars somehow.

861
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
I'll leave it to Sun-woo for a while.

862
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,520
I know that.

863
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,520
If you cut your hands and feet like that, what am I supposed to do?

864
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,520
You have to remember what you can do.

865
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
It's your ability to find it.

866
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
What the hell is that?

867
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
What the hell?

868
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,520
Really?

869
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,520
Shall we talk for a while?

870
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
What are you doing?

871
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:49,760
Pick up the

872
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:11,520
I'm going to be a three star.

873
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,520
If you're working here, I'll think about it.

874
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
Work?

875
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
You just have to pick an employee.

876
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,520
What do you mean?

877
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,520
He's the employee who's going to work with us from today.

878
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,520
Isn't it because of your self-righteousness that you're like this?

879
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
Did you see him look at me?

880
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,520
He's crazy.

881
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,520
What are you thinking?

882
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,520
I'm gonna have to go.

883
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Who is it?

884
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,520
What's that?
