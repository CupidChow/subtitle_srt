1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Cis dice

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You came down with the recipe for the restaurant.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then...

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the right place.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why do you have to clean it up?

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What is a restaurant?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're telling me to go to a restaurant?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you open this door and go in,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
there's a big living room like a playground.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you open the next door and go out,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
there's a bright garden.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Anyway, there's no such thing as this city or this structure in Hanok Village.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How about we go inside?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll go here.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, my. You're so good.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're so nice.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a gift for the contract.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Our friendship forever.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is me.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The main menu is soup, salad, soup, steamed eggs, and the main course.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You must have bought a lot of t-shirts.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're good at fine dining.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're not even in Seoul.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm fine dining in Seoul.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I looked it up a little bit,

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and there's a price I need to pay for a month.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll solve it for you.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Here's your autograph.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's okay. There's another one.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a lot.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Where do you want to put it?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I thought about the sincerity you said last time.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But that's pretty important.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to keep the receipt and think about the investment.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's what I'm saying.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Investment or receipt.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now, I'll be by your side from now on.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll support you and our Hanzang.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sign?

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you're working here yourself, I'll think about it.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What? Me?

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Work?

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Excuse me.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
My salary...

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think you're saying that because you don't know how much my salary is.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A big company?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't believe that.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're just talking nonsense.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if you want to invest in this restaurant,

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll think about it.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Before that, I'll see if I have the right to do it.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Generally, the one who receives the money should prove their right first.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Director, I think the operating budget will be blocked in a few days.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We need to find a way to stop it.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hold on.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's interesting.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you're going to place a high-class person like me in the restaurant

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and be the manager?

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ohohohohoho.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ohoho, you're pretty smart.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why are you talking nonsense?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So are you going to do it or not?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For a month after the contract was signed,

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the restaurant's capital management is managed by the temporary manager, Han Beom-woo.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When a disaster or a national epidemic occurs,

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the contract is adjusted.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Han Beom-woo's personal investment in the restaurant

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
is at the same time as the payment of the debt.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Even after investment, the restaurant's management is managed by Mo Yeon-ju.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When the promised amount is made earlier than the end of the contract,

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the temporary contract is terminated early and Han Beom-woo writes his personal investment contract.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's the name?

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You need to know the name to sign the contract.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't say I was going to do it yet.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We just finished talking.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mo Yeon-ju.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is the restaurant's name Mo Yeon-ju?

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's written outside. That's Jung Jae.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, okay.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So the restaurant's name is Jung Jae.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your name is Mo Yeon-ju.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Everything that happens in the kitchen is Mo Yeon-ju's responsibility,

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and Han Beom-woo never intervenes.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everything that happens in the hall is Han Beom-woo's responsibility,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and Mo Yeon-ju never, never intervenes.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Everything that happens in the hall is Han Beom-woo's responsibility,

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and Mo Yeon-ju never, never intervenes.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But something happened.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just looked it up, and it says that he works here.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Or maybe he ran out of money.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Something happened to you, too?

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I thought you wouldn't do it even if you died.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bring me the road.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What do you bring?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
My thumbcap.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What? Thumbcap?

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, send some people to the office

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that we hired to be the assistant chef.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Prepare the restaurant's open setting.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What? A new restaurant?

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to take all the recipes from this restaurant.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Weren't you going to pay enough money and get it?

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why? You can't get a couple?

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This chef is not easy.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I need to get the results and skills.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll do it.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The chef?

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, the recipe.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If it's that good, it's a three-star.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We're here. Where is he?

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's not here.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why is he changing the place all of a sudden?

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not always done in one place.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is the best one.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't say.

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Everyone wants more.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you laughing at?

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is a surprise.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What? Why are you so secretive?

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What secret?

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're not going to tell me that you don't have money.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're going to keep it safe.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Stop.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Security?

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Money?

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The best?

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you have any medicine?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're talking like a drug.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What?

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go. Let's go.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Stop.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why did you buy so much?

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Give it to me.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Give it to me.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why did you buy so much?

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How much is it?

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you doing this to me?

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm in charge of the restaurant.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I need to know if this is overspending.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're not going to use it.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you dragging it?

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Stop.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The couple fight will start with the cost of the food.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's not a couple.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why do you feel bad?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's what I'm saying.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The cost of food will be paid soon.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Soon?

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then you don't deserve to get this gold.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're going to get the food you want?

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you sell it, you'll be sold out.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What?

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Was it chili powder?

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why are you crying?

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I thought you were a countryman.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Listen.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I looked at the information.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Does the cost of food make sense?

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The monthly cost of ingredients is...

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This restaurant is still under pressure.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The cost of food is at least 30%.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's get it to 40%.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Can you hear me?

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
40%.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
100%.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
100% gold?

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The chili powder.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's cheap.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I didn't even know.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can't even pay for the food.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
100% domestic?

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Quality?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If you want to pay, reduce the cost of ingredients.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I won't reduce the cost of ingredients.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I won't.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then how do we pay the cost of ingredients?

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How do we pay the cost of ingredients?

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Using good ingredients is a matter of principle.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not a matter of choice.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You can't even reduce the cost of ingredients?

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Where are you going?

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not done talking yet.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You have a very bad habit.

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're talking to someone.

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I agree with your style.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think the biggest problem with our restaurant is the exterior.

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The exterior that you don't know if it's a restaurant or a warehouse.

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think if you slightly change the exterior...

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What do you mean?

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can't change it.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You don't have money.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So let's extend the interior with a book.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can't change the interior or the ingredients.

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can't change the interior.

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't change the interior or the ingredients.

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Then what do we do?

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We have to extend the table.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The turnover rate is not good, so the sales are not going up.

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think I can extend the table by two more.

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And there's a door inside.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's open the door and use it as a room.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's use the space a little bigger.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If you extend the table, you can't handle it alone.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So we can hire an employee.

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I've looked at all the calculations.

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can hire one employee to prepare the ingredients.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Look at this.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You have to invest money to make that much money.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You make more money with the money you earn.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is the market economy and this is capitalism.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Who am I talking to?

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Aren't you going to pay?

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not as good as it looks.

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're a real bastard.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll make the final decision.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hiring an employee.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Huh?

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Of course.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I just picked a list just in case.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Sorry.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How about this?

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He's from the CIA.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You don't know CIA, do you?

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a cooking school in America.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is this the Dumb Mural?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mural?

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a French three-star restaurant in Japan.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you think they all go well with restaurants?

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm so frustrated.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm the only one who thinks they go well with restaurants.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If this is the spec, I should thank you.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's Dumb Mural.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And I need to hire someone with a spec like this

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
so I can cook at Yu Sa's.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yu Sa's what?

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm used to it.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not Mural.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's Mural.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's Le Mural.

251
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You idiot.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Idiot?

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When did he start talking?

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's an idiot?

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh!

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, right.

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's Le Mural.

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, right.

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How does he know that?

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to the market!

262
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The MCs have long eyebrows these days.

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a good guy.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He's tall, handsome, and has good skin.

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I like him.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Who is it?

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Who is it?

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's a trend here.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What?

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Where's the owner?

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He went to the bathroom.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What would you like?

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I have 10,000 won worth of doraji.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Doraji?

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Please put a lot of this in the basket.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
In the basket?

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll give you a lot.

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's not my house.

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
How about a very pretty one?

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Eunjae confessed to me with a very pretty flower.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I love you.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll be very romantic.

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Didn't you see the flower?

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You haven't seen this yet?

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is this?

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh my!

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh my, this doll is really nice.

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh my, there's a joy in life.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh my, I know.

294
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But we don't have a lot of leaves.

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What about the leaf?

296
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We can't eat the leaf because it's poisonous.

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This girl doesn't know much yet.

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Boil the leaf.

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then, rinse it with rice water.

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Don't crush it too much.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And fry it with oil in a frying pan.

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's no such thing as a delicacy.

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Give me some.

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

305
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I wanted to buy a leaf because I found a lot of leaves.

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Will you buy anything?

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You can't even pay for the food.

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Just give me a leaf.

309
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The chef is afraid of ingredients.

310
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Cooking is a challenge and a journey.

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Eunjae ran and died.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm just picking the leaves.

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Honey, this is the best restaurant in my neighborhood.

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The recipe for No. 5 and 7 is very good.

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay, tell No. 5 and 7 to come to the interview tomorrow.

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's finish what we were talking about.

317
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If you come out like this because you're going to hire a staff...

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I did.

319
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What?

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, really?

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I thought you were going to leave.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're a restaurant.

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry. It's break time.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Can you wait outside?

325
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Excuse me.

326
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What?

327
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's the employee who's going to work with us from today.

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He worked at the second-generation bean sprout soup restaurant for 15 years.

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He's been cleaning, serving, and washing the dishes.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He's a person who can't do anything but clean.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hello.

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is the manager.

333
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's considering a new job.

334
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's got a great timing.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
My name is Jin Myung-sook.

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Just call me Noona.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Noona?

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Noona.

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Noona.

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You're so small that you can't even come.

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you kidding me? Are you crazy?

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you crazy?

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You should hire someone professional.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm not a professional.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I've been working for 15 years.

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But still...

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
All the fancy specs you showed me aren't all.

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why can't I win without talking?

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You said you'd make the decision.

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You said so.

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Are you dating or having a fight?

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're a man.

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're going to say two things in one go?

354
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can't win if I talk.

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Why are you talking to me?

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And you should care about the whole thing.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're always talking about the table.

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Wait.

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just wait.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll bring you a great table.

361
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A table?

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're so rich.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That's ridiculous.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I've never heard of that before.

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't have money.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Just wait.

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll bring you a great table.

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll bring it here by tomorrow morning.

369
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just wait.

370
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Don't be so stubborn.

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Just bring it.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll bring it.

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's the best.

374
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's perfect.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Welcome.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Did you make a reservation?

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Please give me the royal suite.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What's this?

380
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why is it so late?

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The director is taking care of the reserve.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The card is blocked.

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And he wants the car back.

384
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The car?

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes.

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
My car?

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Even the car?

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

390
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This is too much.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't drive.

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Darn it.

393
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Excuse me.

394
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What should I do?

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It was a great timing.

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was going to book a room.

397
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You're right.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We're here.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But we can't.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We should book a room in hanok.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What?

402
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes.

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We can't.

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a good idea.

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What?

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It was a great timing.

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Did you call the moon?

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's that?

412
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I usually use cards.

413
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But I don't have enough cash.

414
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So I'll be here for two days.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Or three days.

416
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Excuse me.

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

418
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Here.

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is a limited edition model.

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm not giving it to you yet.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you could take it for a while,

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll give it to you in two days.

423
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Or three days.

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I should change the sign.

425
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I only need the unemployed.

426
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You...

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You're from this city.

428
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're too mean to me.

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You're so mean.

430
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll give you something else.

431
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Really?

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That jacket is expensive.

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This jacket?

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Are you kidding me?

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't get this in Korea.

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Who would buy this cheap?

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm so embarrassed.

439
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

440
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Nothing.

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You look good in that jacket.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I like this room.

443
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's like a royal family.

444
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The room the royal family used to live in.

445
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The Crown Prince?

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The Crown Prince?

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He's so good at interior design.

448
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm tired.

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Go inside.

450
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Thank you.

451
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Go inside.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, no.

453
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You're so rich.

454
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You're always talking nonsense.

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're so rich.

456
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You're so rich.

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're so rich.

458
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Wait, wait, wait.

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Slowly.

460
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Straight.

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Left, right.

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Left, right.

463
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm going.

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay.

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Go ahead.

466
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is the curve line a little disappointing?

467
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If I had a little more time,

468
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'd have made it in time.

469
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
How is it?

470
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm so bad at it.

471
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What do you mean, Samsung?

472
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think I got a bad idea.

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's a love call.

474
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No, I mean, how's the table?

475
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's just...

476
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Just?

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hey, look at this.

478
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I worked so hard to get this.

479
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's a luxury.

480
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Use the table well.

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's a good thing.

482
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I know.

483
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's see.

484
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is this a good thing?

485
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The table fell off.

486
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Look at this.

487
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What are you doing?

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If you're going to work,

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
did you bring this to a house that sells muddler?

490
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Just put it in the house now.

491
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's right.

492
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What are you talking about?

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Excuse me.

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Be careful.

495
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah.

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's almost time to start a business.

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm not going out to play.

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Don't worry.

500
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You're going out to play.

501
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm going out to play.

502
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
How are you?

503
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I opened a restaurant.

504
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I guarantee you it will taste good.

505
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I hope you come.

506
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's been a while.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll say hello.

508
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm sorry I don't have time.

509
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm busy these days.

510
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll come again.

512
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't have time.

513
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm busy these days.

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll come again.

516
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think I've been eating a lot.

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to be bothered.

518
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm busy, but I'll try to make time.

519
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Where are you?

520
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The second alley of Hanok Village, which is close to Cheonbyun.

521
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The second alley of Hanok Village, which is close to Cheonbyun.

522
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The third house.

523
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm sorry, but it's too far to go to Hanok Village.

524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If you send me a picture, I'll promote it.

525
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
No, no, no, no.

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't go.

527
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Really, really.

528
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It's so gross.

529
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I have a guest.

530
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
How about serving?

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's so gross.

532
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Pay the bill.

533
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That hand.

534
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You pay.

535
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You're so cool.

536
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you.

537
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
No, sir.

538
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Eat slowly and pay the bill.

539
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wait a minute.

540
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You keep talking to customers.

541
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What do you think?

542
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What do you think?

543
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You think it's good, right?

544
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What?

545
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You're my friend.

546
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay, I understand.

547
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But isn't it really not a gift?

548
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It's comfortable and nice to use as a gift.

549
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Everyone used to do that in the bean sprout soup restaurant.

550
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This is not a bean sprout soup restaurant.

551
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I think you're ignoring my previous job.

552
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No, no, I'm not ignoring it.

553
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Excuse me.

554
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The probability of additional orders from the previous customer

555
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
to the next customer is 50% higher than the probability of additional orders and sales growth.

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This is the data analysis of this industry, including me.

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Data analysis?

558
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The previous customer's turnover rate is fast.

559
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That's what I mean.

560
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I feel like you're ignoring me.

561
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're ignoring me because you're not ignoring me.

562
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I was just playing with my phone and trying to help you.

563
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I've never been there.

564
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Do you know Viral?

565
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's viral marketing.

566
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Excuse me.

567
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, my God.

568
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
If you're done with viral marketing, go ahead.

569
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yes, sir.

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you need anything?

571
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Can I have a glass of water?

572
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.

573
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Plating, plating.

574
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Plating, plating.

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Plating is important.

576
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Who are you going to meet?

577
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, my God.

578
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, my God.

579
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You?

580
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You?

581
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Are you the baby's father?

582
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You're a jerk.

583
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Then you should have told me earlier.

584
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You're a man who makes me crazy.

585
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Can you focus on the dishes when you do the dishes?

586
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I have to do this to improve my ability.

587
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, my God.

589
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You're so stubborn.

590
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Don't just play with your computer.

591
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Leave your work alone.

592
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm in charge of the most important financial management in this company.

593
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh, my God.

594
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, my God.

595
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm really sorry.

596
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I made a big mistake this time.

597
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
How can this be a mistake?

598
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's stop.

599
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, my God.

600
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Why are you so stubborn?

601
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm sorry.

602
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sorry.

604
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm sorry.

605
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Why are you so stubborn?

606
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's perfect to eat with kimchi pancake.

607
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why are you thinking about eating kimchi pancake when you're working?

608
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't do it.

609
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Never.

610
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Don't do it.

611
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, my God.

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do you have any other pictures?

613
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
All right.

614
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The plating is pretty.

615
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
All right.

616
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know, the rice in the afternoon menu.

617
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Just make it quickly.

618
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Take care of the plating.

619
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I have a close influencer.

620
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But you're going to promote our restaurant.

621
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I have 1.3 million followers.

622
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Are you trying to make rice because of that?

623
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Isn't there a pretty plate to take pictures?

624
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You don't know that the food is life.

625
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I know.

626
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's for SNS pictures.

627
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You're going to poke a pot with a pot rice?

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's not bingu.

629
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm bingu.

630
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So, chef, please make a pretty plate.

631
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No.

632
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Should I change the pot to something that looks good?

633
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Look.

634
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What about Star Wars?

635
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You're so expensive because of that name.

636
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Are you kidding me?

637
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
All right.

638
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But please pay attention to the decoration.

639
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What should I do?

640
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Should I put flowers on the rice?

641
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't put food on the plate.

642
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What are you talking about?

643
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's really hard to say.

644
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have to send some pictures.

645
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just make something that looks pretty.

646
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Just make it.

647
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You don't have to do anything.

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Just make it.

649
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
All the famous restaurants in Seoul are like this.

650
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Don't you know viral marketing?

651
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You're really out of your level.

652
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You look like a big company.

653
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What did you say?

654
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Level?

655
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Medical level.

656
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What is he doing?

657
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:19,000
Goal现在 afar

658
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I told you not to make kimchi pancakes!

659
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
This place is not a place where you can eat whatever you want and play around in the emergency room.

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're a fool!

661
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You worked in a construction company for 15 years.

662
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I don't know what you learned there, but from my point of view,

663
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't think you're a complete fool.

664
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You're not feeling it!

665
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You're not feeling it!

666
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You're not feeling it!

667
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're not feeling it!

668
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Do you want to be in debt?

669
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You don't like the CIA, the influence, the publicity?

670
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Then what do you want me to do?

671
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This restaurant, this mess, is all because of your pride...

672
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
No, it's not.

673
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's because of your self-esteem!

674
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You two can do whatever you want.

675
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You can do whatever you want.

676
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't know.

677
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Shit.

678
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Shit!

679
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, shit!

680
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Let's just wait.

681
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
We just have to wait for a month and get the recipe and eat at the restaurant.

682
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's all we have to do.

683
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I should have had a glass of makgeolli.

685
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What do you want to drink?

686
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I want green onion.

687
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You have a sense of三식.

688
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What the hell?

689
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What? It's not samsik. Why are you hitting me?

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I said it's not samsik.

691
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Why are you hitting me?

692
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's samsik.

693
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What samsik?

694
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Oh, it's okay. Go.

695
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What is that?

696
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's a garbage.

697
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Garbage?

698
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's a garbage.

699
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Why are you picking up garbage?

700
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're fighting with Gak, aren't you?

701
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Gak?

702
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Did your mother-in-law come?

703
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
She's acting weird.

704
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, my God. It's raining so hard.

705
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
How far have we gone without an umbrella?

706
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What do you mean, how far have we gone?

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I think I've gone too far.

708
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I think I've gone too far.

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm just going to go home and cook.

710
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't worry.

711
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I have a contract.

712
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I won't ask you to do it.

713
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What?

714
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
There's something like that.

715
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There's something like that.

716
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
What I mean is...

717
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
What I mean is...

718
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm not doing this just because of the table.

719
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What kind of opportunity is that?

720
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not like the celeb who has a lot of followers is rejecting you.

721
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That's what I'm saying.

722
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Chef Mo's personality is a little weird.

723
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yes.

724
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
There's something weird about him.

725
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Did you see his eyes?

726
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He's crazy.

727
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He's very stubborn.

728
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Sometimes he's not stubborn, he's just stubborn.

729
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Four, four, four.

730
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But the food is so great.

731
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Is the food that good?

732
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's right.

733
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That's why the food is so good.

734
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's what anyone can do.

735
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Everyone doesn't know it's a restaurant.

736
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The people who know it are the ones who take their children to the family.

737
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But it's too hidden.

738
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's so hidden.

739
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Thank you for the food.

740
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Go home.

741
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Go home.

742
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Of course.

743
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's a law that people like yourself should be able to shine.

744
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
People like me?

745
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Chef Mo will know.

746
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What our newbie does is not meaningless.

747
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Newbie?

748
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
This...

749
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh, my.

750
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Is our manager here?

751
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What?

752
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Today, the kids are so tired.

753
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I just gave them dinner.

754
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Do you need more kids?

755
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then I'll give you some more.

756
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Thank you.

757
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You have a pretty plate.

758
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Really?

759
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think I should go get some green onions.

760
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's taking a long time.

761
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What?

762
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You want me to wear it?

763
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The first one is sanitary.

764
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
The second one is sanitary.

765
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And next to it is a stethoscope.

766
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
You made it so that you could at least reduce one penny.

767
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And that gift...

768
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

769
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm just saying.

770
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm just saying.

771
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm just saying.

772
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm just saying.

773
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm just saying.

774
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And that stethoscope,

775
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm just saying.

776
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Myung-sook thinks about the restaurant.

777
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm going in.

778
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Sorry, sorry.

779
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I came a little early.

780
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Nothing wrong, right?

781
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I think I need some red pepper powder.

782
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm so hungry.

783
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Ha, ha.

784
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Red pepper powder.

785
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
What is it?

786
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh, my.

787
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What is this?

788
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What is this?

789
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Red pepper powder?

790
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
How did you get this?

791
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Did you steal it from somewhere?

792
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
How can you speak so beautifully?

793
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's so sweet.

794
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's so sweet.

795
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What are you doing?

796
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Did you come home drunk?

797
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
During work hours?

798
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
No, no.

799
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's not that.

800
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I met the owner of the vegetable store and the owner of the beef restaurant.

801
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But this neighborhood has to drink a glass of labor wine when they work.

802
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I said, I don't drink, I don't drink.

803
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But they keep giving me a drink.

804
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I take a drink and another drink.

805
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, it's them.

806
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They.

807
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Seniors.

808
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Seniors?

809
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
How are you?

810
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Come in cheaply first.

811
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Come on.

812
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Are you coming?

813
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's more shiny here.

814
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Did you come with the vegetables?

815
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh, thank you.

816
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Sit down.

817
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Aren't you here to see me?

818
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Come on in.

819
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Come on in.

820
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Did you see?

821
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
This is marketing.

822
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Aren't you going to receive customers?

823
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Wait a minute.

824
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Wait a minute.

825
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Wait a minute.

826
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Come on in.

827
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
This is the last one.

828
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
This is real stone.

829
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This is stone.

830
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This way.

831
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This way.

832
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Good job.

833
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's easier to manage if you do this.

834
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Good job.

835
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Don't do it.

836
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Sister.

837
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Special Kimchi pancake.

838
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Service.

839
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The newbie.

840
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm a commoner.

841
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh, yeah.

842
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
We did a good job here.

843
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah.

844
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Get out.

845
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Get out now.

846
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We're almost there.

847
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:51,980
Two more

848
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
minutes.

849
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, yeah.

850
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Good evening.

851
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Good evening.

852
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,940
Good evening.

853
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,360
Please go

854
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:09,400
out with us.

855
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,680
Oh, yeah.

856
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
What's with the childishness? Okay.

857
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Now, up. One, two, three.

858
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,640
I'm so tired.

859
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,640
I'm so full.

860
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
I like the shirt.

861
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,520
Who are you?

862
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,840
This is different from when I get off work.

863
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Shop 55 TD.

864
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Shop Today's Fashion.

865
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Shop Leza Zamba.

866
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know, you can go to a club or something.

867
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What club?

868
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You should go on a weekend and shake it off.

869
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Like this?

870
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Stop it.

871
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What? You two came?

872
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Then, you've worked hard.

873
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
What if the three of you go somewhere and kill a mosquito?

874
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Dining out? Dining out?

875
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Dining out is a must if you're not at a restaurant.

876
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Or, if you're not at a restaurant,

877
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can call you.

878
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,160
You should make a guidebook instead of a kitchen.

879
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,160
You spend so much money as soon as you make money.

880
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
You don't want to?

881
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Forget it.

882
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
It's so nice.

883
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
It's nice, right?

884
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Let's go.

885
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
What's that?

886
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
What's that?

887
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Who is it?

888
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Oh, you're going to the club with me?

889
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,160
You're the one who took my employee.

890
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
You're so annoying.

891
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
What?

892
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,160
You?

893
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,160
You're so rude, rude, and senseless.

894
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
You?

895
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I'm sure you did.

896
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
What do you mean?

897
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,320
You took my employee for 15 years and you're so rude.

898
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Why?

899
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Sister.

900
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Sister.

901
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
What's wrong with your face?

902
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,320
You guys have been eating people for days.

903
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,320
You've ruined your face.

904
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Did I do something wrong?

905
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Go.

906
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Let's go talk.

907
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
I know everything about you.

908
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
I'm not going.

909
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
I'm sorry.

910
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
I'll be fine.

911
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
I'm not going.

912
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480
Go and talk.

913
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
Trust me.

914
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
Oh my.

915
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Why do you keep touching a woman?

916
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Let go.

917
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
Let go.

918
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
Oh, my.

919
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
Oh, my.

920
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,480
How much did you guys cook for?

921
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,640
It's not right to do this to people who sell food in the same neighborhood.

922
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,640
You're taking my employee for 15 years.

923
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Why are you saying that again?

924
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
You said you'd give me a million won more.

925
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,640
No, it's not that.

926
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,640
We?

927
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,640
You're a big shot.

928
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,640
Even if you're going to catch me at a hotel with a shiny hotel.

929
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
Oh, my.

930
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Don't stay still.

931
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
We?

932
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
And what?

933
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Chef?

934
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
You said you'd take me to the chef?

935
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
So.

936
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
We?

937
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,640
That's not it.

938
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Oh, my.

939
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,800
I don't know.

940
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,800
It's good to eat rolled omelet.

941
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,800
But it's important how many eggs are in the rolled omelet.

942
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,800
The white house tastes very good.

943
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
Look at the menu for 10 minutes.

944
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Tell me what happened.

945
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
One million won salary.

946
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Business.

947
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
Hotel accommodation.

948
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
Chef.

949
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Chef.

950
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
I'm going to order.

951
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
Sister.

952
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Oh, my.

953
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,960
I lied.

954
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,960
Lie?

955
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,960
I've been working at that house for years.

956
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
I just don't have any place to give it to.

957
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
I keep ignoring people.

958
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,960
As soon as I said, I don't want to work with you,

959
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,960
I just bragged about it.

960
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,960
I was looking for a place to live.

961
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
I was so angry that I suddenly said,

962
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,960
Oh, stop it.

963
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Why are you so angry?

964
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,120
What do you mean by that?

965
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,120
I have no choice but to make a big noise.

966
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,120
If I go there, I'll treat you like this.

967
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,120
You'll all regret it.

968
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,120
I made a big noise and left.

969
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
That's all.

970
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,120
There's information about Wonka.

971
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Oh, my.

972
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,120
I just have pride.

973
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,120
What's wrong with you?

974
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,120
I'm not going to tell you the truth.

975
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
I don't have any special skills to show to others.

976
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,280
I just want to be a good person.

977
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,280
I can't just go to a restaurant and work there.

978
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,280
Then I can't go somewhere and lie and make a big noise.

979
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
Oh, my.

980
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Why are you making a big noise?

981
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,280
The 15 years of experience itself is the ability itself.

982
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Forget it.

983
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,280
Be a chef from now on.

984
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,280
What's the problem with that?

985
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,280
Hey, that's a little...

986
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,280
Yeah, I'm not a chef.

987
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Why can't you do it?

988
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,280
What's not enough?

989
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
Just say you know.

990
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,280
I'm going to do it.

991
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,280
I'm going to be a chef.

992
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
Thank you.

993
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Now, chef.

994
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
Cheers.

995
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
Now, chef.

996
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
I'm going to do it.

997
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,440
But I saw that the owner of the restaurant was quite young.

998
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
He's not the owner.

999
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,440
He's just a Korean.

1000
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,440
He's just looking at the counter at the restaurant

1001
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,440
that his grandfather was assigned to his father.

1002
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,440
The restaurant's name is not Samdae, it's Weidae.

1003
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
I couldn't get it.

1004
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
It's not written in words.

1005
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
What are you worried about?

1006
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
There's a clear eye.

1007
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
What?

1008
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Why?

1009
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
What?

1010
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
I'm good at talking.

1011
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
We're just pretending.

1012
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
Let's not run too much.

1013
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Condition management is also part of skill.

1014
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
Part of...

1015
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,600
I have a health check tomorrow.

1016
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,600
Why did you come alone?

1017
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Why did you come alone?

1018
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
You didn't change your mind when you left.

1019
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
You're just a regular employee.

1020
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,600
You're the ace of the rice soup restaurant.

1021
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,600
And you went to someone else's restaurant and got a bad news.

1022
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,600
You're so frustrating.

1023
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,600
Father, I'm so sorry for your sister.

1024
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
I almost turned it upside down.

1025
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
And it's not a bad news.

1026
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
I'm just looking at the menu.

1027
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Shut up!

1028
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,760
I'm sorry.

1029
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
Please trust me and wait.

1030
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
I'll fix this.

1031
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
What am I expecting from you?

1032
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
Are you okay?

1033
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
You got a card.

1034
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
Why are you so pure?

1035
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
I'm just a regular employee.

1036
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
I'm just a regular employee.

1037
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
You're not okay.

1038
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Cheers!

1039
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
You're drunk, right?

1040
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
You're drunk, right?

1041
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
You're drunk, right?

1042
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,080
I'm not drunk.

1043
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,080
When I was in the car,

1044
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,080
there was no soju in the car.

1045
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,080
Why?

1046
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
Because I drank it all.

1047
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,080
You're so naughty.

1048
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,080
I'm not drunk. I'm just drinking.

1049
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,080
Drink it.

1050
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
You're not going to take it?

1051
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
Are you okay?

1052
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
I'm not drunk.

1053
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,240
Drink it.

1054
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
What are you thinking?

1055
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Your lips.

1056
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
You...

1057
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
You're so annoying!

1058
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
Hey,

1059
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
what do you mean my lips look like that?

1060
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
It's vibrating.

1061
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,240
Darn it.

1062
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Are you trying to take a picture with an axe?

1063
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,240
Take your time.

1064
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Okay.

1065
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Cute.

1066
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
Two stars.

1067
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
I'm sorry.

1068
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
I looked around the kitchen.

1069
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
Wow.

1070
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
It's so great.

1071
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
I'm glad you like it.

1072
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400
I look forward to your continued support.

1073
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
I'll do my best as much as you believe me.

1074
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Deep nose, three stars.

1075
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Three stars?

1076
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Do you think that Han Beom-woo

1077
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
who came out of the hole

1078
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
can focus on cooking even if he disappears from sight?

1079
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,560
He really didn't have a choice.

1080
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,560
He's your brother,

1081
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
but I talked too much.

1082
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
He doesn't have a choice.

1083
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
He's more powerful than you think.

1084
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,560
What?

1085
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
Do you know what's different between him and me?

1086
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
I really like

1087
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,720
you.

1088
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,720
So I can't do that.

1089
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
I did it in the past,

1090
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
and I will do it

1091
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
in the future.

1092
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,720
Hey, Jang Sang!

1093
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,720
Who is it?

1094
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
A voice message.

1095
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,720
A voice message.

1096
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
Hey, Jang Sang!

1097
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,720
Are you a human?

1098
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,720
Huh?

1099
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,720
Are you hitting me on the back?

1100
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Hey, Jang Hee-yeon!

1101
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,720
Young-ae!

1102
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720
This is not right.

1103
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,720
You're not a human.

1104
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,880
This is not right.

1105
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,880
I...

1106
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,880
I did...

1107
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,880
I did get a little bit of a bad feeling.

1108
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
I admit it.

1109
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,880
But how can you do this to me?

1110
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,880
You're a loser.

1111
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,880
You're dating.

1112
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,880
How can you leave me?

1113
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,880
Okay, I admit it.

1114
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,880
I can do that.

1115
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,880
But how can you go to my brother?

1116
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,880
This is not right.

1117
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Park Jang Hee?

1118
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Park Jang Hee?

1119
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,040
I'm going to destroy you.

1120
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040
You two.

1121
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,040
I'm going to take out all the recipes

1122
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,040
and

1123
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
destroy you two.

1124
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
What are you saying?

1125
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,040
I'm going to destroy you.

1126
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
Hey!

1127
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,040
Hey, where's my sister?

1128
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,040
I'm right here.

1129
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
What are you doing?

1130
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Me? Me?

1131
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
I've been thinking all day.

1132
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,040
I...

1133
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
I can't eat without my sister.

1134
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
You two are so

1135
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,040
like a drama.

1136
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
What?

1137
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,040
The boss said

1138
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,040
he wouldn't give you the soup.

1139
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Because you lost your job?

1140
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,040
I'm the boss!

1141
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
And my father is

1142
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,040
the president.

1143
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
You two are

1144
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
not going to be the boss.

1145
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,040
I'm the boss!

1146
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,040
Are you going to break your arm?

1147
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Are you going to pull your hair?

1148
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,040
Let go of me.

1149
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,040
Let go of me.

1150
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
Let go of me.

1151
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,200
Let go of me.

1152
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
What did you say?

1153
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,200
What?

1154
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
What?

1155
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Be honest.

1156
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,200
Why did you come here?

1157
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,000
Homicide

1158
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,040
I think I can do something for you.

1159
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,040
I'm really good at everything.

1160
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
I'm just worried.

1161
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,040
Do you know what kind of person this is?
