1
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,776
I meant to tell you the truth sooner.

3
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,069
The truth?

4
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,779
When?

5
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,781
When were you going to tell me?

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,743
After all the lying and stealing,

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,203
now you tell the truth?

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,038
Will you hear me out?

9
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,164
How…

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,835
How…

11
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,926
How could you toy with my sincerity?

12
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,474
Yeon-joo.

13
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,434
Get out.

14
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,437
Get out.

15
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,900
Please leave.

16
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,239
Please.

17
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,455
JUNGJAE

18
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,219
Just…

19
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,057
Just let me go.

20
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,774
Why don't you beat me up this time?

21
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
Come on.

22
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,159
If only you hadn't lied
and said you didn't need Hansang,

23
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,245
I wouldn't have gone this far!

24
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,545
Goddammit.

25
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,254
I never got to tell you.

26
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,674
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,938
TASTEFULLY YOURS

28
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,317
Oh my goodness.

29
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,528
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

30
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,238
It's all thanks to you, of course.

31
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,365
-Oh, thank you.
-Congratulations, ma'am.

32
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,658
Thank you.

33
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,993
Enjoy yourselves.

34
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,456
Our Hansang, our Motto got three stars.

35
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,292
Congratulations, Chairman Han.

36
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,128
It's the only three-star restaurant
in the country.

37
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,256
The media's in a frenzy too.
How about a round of applause?

38
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,011
Thank you.

39
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,890
I owe it all to you and the hard work
you put into making this happen.

40
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,600
You earned this.

41
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,477
I appreciate all your great work.

42
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,854
Shall we raise our glasses for a toast?

43
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,648
Hansang.

44
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,483
-Three stars!
-Three stars!

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,912
Oh, Producer Kim.

46
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,166
Our TV station's
cultural and informational department

47
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,085
wants to produce a documentary on you,

48
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,254
Hansang, and Motto.

49
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,339
A documentary?

50
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,675
Yes. You're the first Korean expert

51
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,054
to devote your life to your restaurant,
the business, and cooking,

52
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,348
and we'd like to focus on your life--

53
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,269
You just want to ride on
our three-star coattails.

54
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,646
That's way too complacent.

55
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,234
Well, that's not all we have in mind.

56
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
I'm busy right now, so maybe next time.

57
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,159
This is a good item though.

58
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,300
My goodness.
Will you check out the weather?

59
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,969
It's a perfect day to close up.

60
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,180
It is. That's just what I was thinking.

61
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,854
So, hey, Chef!

62
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,818
How about we close a bit early today
and go on a picnic?

63
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,487
An actual picnic this time
where we can see the ocean.

64
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,447
-Oh my. What? An ocean view?
-An ocean view!

65
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,283
We just got back yesterday,
and we're going away again?

66
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,410
-Hey, Chef Mo.
-Chef?

67
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,038
Chef Mo.

68
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,083
Chef Mo.

69
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,710
Hey, you!

70
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:04,966
You're here.

71
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,844
What are you doing
that's got you so zoned out?

72
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,595
It's nothing.

73
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,976
What were you talking about?

74
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,312
-Oh, about a picnic--
-Oh, well… No, hey.

75
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,730
Where are the pickles?

76
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,858
-Did you buy them?
-Right, the pickles…

77
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,153
Read the room, will you?
Don't you see the look on her face?

78
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,448
-The pickles…
-Yeah.

79
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,116
We should get more soon.

80
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,117
That's right.

81
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,036
Anyway, is Beom-woo not here yet?

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,747
Does he know what time it is?
He's so out of it.

83
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,791
That unbelievable fool.

84
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,918
One trip should be enough.

85
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,920
-He still thinks he's on vacation.
-Exactly.

86
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,298
We should work hard and play hard.

87
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,924
He lacks a professional mindset.

88
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,303
This won't do. I'll call him
and give him a piece of my mind.

89
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,971
Yeah, call him.

90
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,139
There's no need to call him.

91
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,516
Come on. Don't you say anything.
I'll put him in his place.

92
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,727
I said there's no need to call him.

93
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,359
It's just us three now.
That's all you need to know.

94
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,236
What?

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,237
Wait.

96
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,699
What do you mean it's just us three now?

97
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,702
Finish preparing this for me.

98
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,084
It seems they had another fight.

99
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,462
They talked about love and whatnot,
but the look on her face says it all.

100
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,713
No.

101
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,841
It feels a bit different
from just a fight.

102
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,843
No, you're wrong.

103
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,887
Soon enough, Beom-woo will go,
"I love you, Yeon-joo,"

104
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,932
and kiss and be all lovey-dovey.

105
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,600
Good for you for being in a relationship!

106
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,061
This is why you're still single.

107
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,024
I have a bad feeling about this.

108
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,906
Here's your food.

109
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,616
I apologize for the wait.

110
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,662
-Serve this.
-Okay.

112
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,460
Oh my.

113
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,088
This one has no sauce.

114
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,976
-We're ready to pay.
-Okay.

115
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,269
Beom-woo, they're ready to pay!

116
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,399
Hello, welcome.

117
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,483
-A table for three?
-Yes.

118
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,026
You can sit over here.

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,152
Sit down.

120
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,612
We have a cool young customer.

121
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,698
Should we get you three set meals?

122
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,782
-Yes.
-Okay.

123
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,908
Three set meals, please!

124
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,578
Mom, the food here looks really good.

125
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,870
One of them is a little kid.

126
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,623
Be sure to take out all the fish bones.

127
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,226
The young man gets his first.

128
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,311
It looks tasty.

129
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,520
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

130
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,063
It's really nice and tender.

131
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,148
Thank you.

132
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,027
Do you want me to help you?

133
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,944
Yes.

134
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,281
Hold the knife in your right hand
and the fork in your left,

135
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,533
and cut it right down the middle--

136
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,120
On second thought,

137
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,998
how about I take this back
and cut it up nicely

138
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
for our little gentleman?

139
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,127
Please wait. I won't be long.

140
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,211
Okay.

141
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,801
Look at this.

142
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,678
There's a fish bone.

143
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,640
It would've been really bad
if the kid had eaten it.

144
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,190
Gosh, that could've been a disaster.

145
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,485
Chef, honestly…

146
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,781
what's up with you today?

147
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,200
You made mistakes
that you never used to make.

148
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,370
Come on, stop it.
It's not like she did it on purpose.

149
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,829
Tell me.

150
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,499
What on earth did you two fight about?

151
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,167
What's the problem?

152
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,797
Oh goodness me!

153
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,173
You're really not going to tell me?

154
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,219
Okay then.

155
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,597
Let's close for the day.

156
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,935
If you cook for and serve customers
with that kind of mindset,

157
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,436
something bad will happen.

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,564
Come on. Don't be like this, Myung-sook.

159
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,149
We didn't fight. He deceived us.

160
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,739
What do you mean? How did he deceive us?

161
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,414
He was going to close us down.

162
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,999
What? He was going to do what?
Close us down?

163
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,835
Who?

164
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,172
He stole our recipes
and gave them to another restaurant.

165
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,926
Han Beom-woo has been deceiving us
the whole time.

166
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,847
What?

167
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:09,311
Come on, Chef Mo.
You're taking your joke too far.

168
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,896
I understand you two fought…

169
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,403
Are you serious?

170
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,702
I'm sorry, but we need to
close the restaurant for a while.

171
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,912
Oh dear.

172
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,414
Oh no.

173
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,103
Beom-woo. Is what Chef Mo said true?

174
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,521
It's not, is it?

175
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,231
Why won't you pick up?

176
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,134
Just because we got three stars
doesn't mean you'll get a dramatic rise.

177
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,177
You know that, right?

178
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,095
Director Han!

179
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,972
Why were you so hard to reach?

180
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,600
And why do you look like that?

181
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
-It's nothing.
-Okay, so anyway…

182
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,896
You heard, right?

183
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,316
Our Motto got three stars at last!

184
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,487
Congratulations.

185
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,696
What?

186
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,698
Did you finally come to your senses?

187
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,034
Did you wrap things up back there?

188
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,705
Anyway, thank you
for all your hard work until now.

189
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,873
Let's start anew.

190
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,106
OPENING THE ERA OF FINE DINING
DIRECTOR HAN: BUSINESSMAN OF THE WEEK

191
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,609
DIRECTOR HAN BEOM-WOO
SELECTED AS CEO OF THE MONTH

192
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,504
Sir.

193
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,755
Have you lost your mind?

194
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,719
We got three stars.

195
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,680
I know. We got three stars.

196
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,728
Yu-jin

197
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,314
and Chef Jang.

198
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,650
You did nothing wrong.

199
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,861
It's all on me.

200
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,280
This is me.

201
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,199
I'm sorry…

202
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,870
this is all I know to do.

203
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,416
Have you really lost it?

204
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,668
Was it something you ate?

205
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,312
But…

207
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,497
Why did you hide it from me?

208
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,000
I didn't hide it! I was going to tell you!

209
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,710
Nothing changes if you tell me now.

210
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,255
LOVELY JOGGER

211
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,008
Jun-hui's my brother, not my son.

212
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,010
The swordtip squid's good. Have some.

213
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,636
Okay.

214
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,642
Man, the swordtip squid's good,

215
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,854
but my life's boring.

216
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,069
For goodness' sake.

217
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,946
Will it be okay?

218
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
Will what?

219
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,953
Jungjae.

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,046
Us.

221
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,256
I mean us.

222
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,858
Jeez, it's raining a lot.

223
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,693
Damn it.

224
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,945
JUNGJAE

225
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,197
It's raining like hell outside…

226
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,658
CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING
DUE TO THE OWNER'S PERSONAL REASONS

227
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,284
They closed without a word?

228
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Darn it.

229
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,956
I can't believe
they're actually closed for once.

230
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,502
I brought a gift
because she's paid the overdue rent.

231
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,130
She just has no luck, huh?

232
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,510
Jeez.

233
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,348
Why do I feel so gloomy today?

234
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,777
SECRETARY KIM

235
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,613
DIRECTOR HAN BEOM-WOO
HANDED IN HIS RESIGNATION

236
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,755
Ma'am, Managing Director Han is here.

237
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
You asked to see me?

238
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,268
How does it feel?

239
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,854
Your younger brother dealt you a blow.

240
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,695
You take over Motto for the time being.

241
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,740
It'll take a while for Beom-woo to return.

242
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,701
You want me to take over Motto?

243
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,745
Sit down.

244
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,381
You don't want to?

245
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,842
It's not that.

246
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,386
Then…

247
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,306
what about my restaurant, La Lecel?

248
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,016
It will be shut down.

249
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
What?

250
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,193
Why should we keep
two fine-dining restaurants

251
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,195
when they suck up so much money?

252
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,238
Chairman Han.

253
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,991
My staff have worked their hardest,

254
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,035
and La Lecel has values
different from Motto--

255
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,119
You lost.

256
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,373
You lose, you die.

257
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,459
What should you do next?

258
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,838
The stars Beom-woo won.

259
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,299
Maintain them.

260
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,844
You'd better put your life on the line.

261
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,807
Ma'am.

262
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,395
Yeon-joo.

263
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,315
Venerable.

264
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,991
Who upset you?

265
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,245
I don't know what to do.

266
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,711
It's okay.

267
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,882
It'll all be okay.

268
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,462
It feels like
I'm always the one doing the talking.

269
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,006
What?

270
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,553
I want to hear your story too.

271
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,934
The thing is…

272
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,020
It's really

273
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,481
hard to tell.

274
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,655
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

275
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,907
You can tell me some other time.

276
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,902
Goodbye.

277
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,601
Yeon-joo.

278
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,646
You scared me.

279
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,481
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,286
I'm very sorry,

281
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,831
but would it be possible to make a change
before the announcement?

282
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,460
I would like to add
one restaurant to the list.

283
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,670
Could you do me the favor?

284
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,589
I'm extremely sorry.

285
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,258
The restaurant's not in Seoul.

286
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,801
All right.

287
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,970
I'll send you the details.

288
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,599
I'll return after my daughter's wedding.

289
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,393
Very well.

290
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,062
Thank you.

291
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,998
No! I don't want to eat vegetables!

292
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,291
Come on now.

293
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,420
Throwing a tantrum
isn't going to get you what you want.

294
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,797
I won't eat!

295
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,925
-I won't eat it!
-Okay, fine. Do as you wish.

296
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,386
Sit back down.

297
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,056
What do you want to eat then?

298
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,227
Cake! I want to eat cake!

299
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,981
Cake? You want to eat cake?

300
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,907
Okay, you want cake.

301
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,789
Cake?

302
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,917
Venerable, wait.

303
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,961
-Wait.
-Soybean milk and walnut oil.

304
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,629
Just a moment.

305
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,341
Did you swallow a horn?

306
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,010
I can hear you just fine.

307
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,846
How can we make a cake right now?

308
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,682
What do you mean how? We'll make it well.

309
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,687
-No, we can't do it.
-Goodness. Why can't we?

310
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,691
It's not like we have an oven or eggs.

311
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,235
How can we make it
when we don't have the ingredients?

312
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,361
I found them.

313
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,284
I thought you had nothing
but a creative mind.

314
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,161
I'm back here because I'm nothing.

315
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,413
You want a beating in front of the Buddha?

316
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,832
When was I ever creative?

317
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,916
Don't you remember?

318
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,294
When you were young,

319
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,756
you were just like that kid out there.

320
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,842
When I said
you couldn't get pizza at the temple,

321
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,635
you made potato jeon,

322
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,930
then covered it with tomato sauce
and called it pizza.

323
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,559
Then you invited all the young monks
and threw yourselves a pizza party.

324
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,561
Who was it that did that again?

325
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,855
You're talking about the distant past.

326
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,733
Are you going to say
it can't be done without even trying?

327
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,197
Is that how I raised you?

328
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,743
Fine.

329
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,912
Let's give it a go.

330
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,917
Let's do this.

331
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,055
What is it?

332
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm wondering if it needs something else.

333
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,394
Because of the smell?

334
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,396
I don't think kids
will like the smell of beets.

335
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,899
How about adding strawberry preserve?

336
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,609
I recently made a new batch.

337
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,126
Kids will love this.

338
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,210
Good.

339
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,692
I sense a change.

340
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,822
FINDING THE TASTE OF AWAKENING AND HEALING

341
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,449
Wow, it's a cake.

342
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,869
Thank you.

343
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,245
I hope you enjoy it.

344
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,477
It's really good! It's awesome.

345
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,561
Is it really?

346
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,318
That's a relief.

347
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,529
Take your time and eat it all.

348
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,453
Here. This is a gift from me.

349
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,541
Are you sure? Can I really take it?

350
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,294
It's my favorite stuffed animal,
but I'm giving it to you.

351
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,214
Thank you. It's so pretty.

352
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,424
It's really cute.

353
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,975
Having trouble sleeping?

354
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,228
No.

355
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:59,148
I was just counting the stars.

356
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,738
You still have a lot on your mind,
don't you?

357
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,826
You were always like this.

358
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,871
You counted the stars all night long
when you were frustrated.

359
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,543
There was this person I trusted…

360
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,963
but he deceived me.

361
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,136
I was really angry at first, but then…

362
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,721
But then?

363
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:35,226
I wonder if I was the only one
who was sincere about that doofus.

364
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,355
I feel wronged.

365
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,108
And I resent him.

366
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,449
When you came of age and left the temple,

367
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,369
I was very worried.

368
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,539
While living here,

369
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,375
you just happened to learn
how to cook from me.

370
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:05,006
So when you said you'd go into the world
and make that your job,

371
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,301
I got so worried.

372
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
But

373
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,099
after I tasted the cake you made today,

374
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,352
I could tell one thing.

375
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,273
Your food had changed a bit.

376
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,777
Rather than the one who cooks,

377
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,530
you now care more about the one who eats.

378
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,700
Think about how that came to be,

379
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,287
and you might find the answer
you're looking for.

380
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,224
BUSINESS CLOSED

381
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,394
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT
TOWARD LA LECEL THUS FAR

382
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:08,903
And now, the long-awaited three stars.

383
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,367
In 2025, the restaurant we awarded

384
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,787
the three stars to…

385
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,917
…in South Korea is…

386
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,169
Motto.

387
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,713
Congratulations, ma'am.

388
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,506
-Congratulations.
-It's just as expected.

389
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:36,180
There's one more thing
I would like to add.

390
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,226
The Diamant Guide 2025

391
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,981
would like to make a special addition

392
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:51,029
to the list of three-star restaurants
in South Korea.

393
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,824
The name of the restaurant is…

394
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,164
Jungjae.

395
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,165
What? "Jungjae"?

396
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,500
Isn't that where
Director Han Beom-woo was at?

397
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,210
I think so.

398
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,968
This is it.

399
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,096
Yeah, this is it.

400
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,515
Things are getting interesting.

401
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,476
-Call Producer Kim.
-Yes, ma'am.

402
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:28,191
People go nuts over a good narrative.

403
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,901
He's on the line.

404
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,362
Hi, Producer Kim.

405
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,657
The documentary you mentioned
the other day.

406
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,619
How about we take a different approach?

407
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,704
It'll be more entertaining
than a documentary.

408
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,347
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

409
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,359
MANAGER LEE YU-JIN

410
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,372
Director Han Beom-woo?

411
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,796
Yes, that's me. Han Beom-woo.

412
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,596
Chairman Han told us to come get you.

413
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,306
She has something urgent to discuss.

414
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:52,567
Tell her I have nothing urgent
to discuss with her.

415
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:58,739
She wants to discuss something
in regard to Jungjae

416
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,366
receiving three Diamant stars.

417
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,834
Jungjae…

418
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,546
got what?

419
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,802
The match won't take place on a set,
as it would be too cliché.

420
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,971
If you look on the second page,

421
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,890
we're planning on setting up cameras
in the restaurants

422
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,267
so we can show the establishments
in their entirety.

423
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,560
What about the evaluation?

424
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,147
Who are you considering as judges?

425
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,401
The cooking and eating show influencers
and vloggers we select in advance

426
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,862
will visit the restaurants.

427
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,364
The judges will be you, Chairman Han,

428
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,867
and a special guest.

429
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,079
You're here.

430
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:53,753
Meet Director Han, who brought Hansang
two three-star restaurants.

431
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,425
-Let's go ahead with this.
-Yes, ma'am.

432
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,472
Congratulations.

433
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,561
I came up with a fun idea.

434
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,731
A showdown between Motto and Jungjae.

435
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,235
Only one can sit on the throne.

436
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,486
Just like you and Sun-woo.

437
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,866
I have an idea

438
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,994
of what you're thinking.

439
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,540
But I'm not doing it.

440
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,128
The investments are finally bearing fruit,

441
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,256
and we just kicked off the marketing plan.

442
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,717
Fighting with Han Sun-woo.

443
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,306
Becoming the successor of Hansang.

444
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,893
I'm not interested in any of it anymore.

445
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,645
Jungjae.

446
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,857
What if I were to wipe out that place?

447
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,068
What?

448
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,028
You still won't do it?

449
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,868
Hansang bought the building
while you were out of it.

450
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,750
Why on earth…

451
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,088
Seriously…

452
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,926
why are you going this far?

453
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,141
Why?

454
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,978
Because from now on,

455
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,148
you two have to take on Hansang, not me.

456
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,734
No man of Hansang

457
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,778
is allowed to give up or back out

458
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,197
whenever they feel like it.

459
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,074
A man of Hansang?

460
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,957
Chairman Han.

461
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,294
You're really something.

462
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,881
If you don't cooperate
with the production,

463
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,510
I'll see to it that not just Jungjae

464
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,723
but the chef girl, too, won't be able to
step foot in this industry.

465
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,975
Got that?

466
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,248
Oh, thank you.

467
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,875
-Come by again. Bye.
-Thank you.

468
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,460
-The food was great.
-Thank you.

469
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,846
Hey, we're ready to pay.

470
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,558
Hi, sirs. Did you enjoy your meal?

471
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,726
Three of you, right?

472
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,938
My goodness.

473
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,190
Myung-sook.

474
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,484
I feel a bit uneasy now that we're here.

475
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,445
We can't waste the ingredients we bought.

476
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,322
I don't feel good doing this either.

477
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:10,950
My word.

478
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,035
What's going on?

479
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,829
They're outside our restaurant,
aren't they?

480
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,457
-Let's wait.
-For how long?

481
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,127
-What's going on here?
-Excuse me.

482
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:25,423
Is this, by any chance, Jungjae?

483
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,966
-Yes, it is, but…
-It is?

484
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,300
-Honey, this is it.
-What?

485
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,178
See? I told you we should wait.

486
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,598
Do you know when the place opens?

487
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,435
We waited for three hours
to taste the three-star food.

488
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,854
We absolutely must try it
since it's a three-star restaurant.

489
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,355
That's right. I bet it's good.

490
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,606
-"Three stars"?
-"Three stars"?

491
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
Yes.

492
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,825
Venerable.

493
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,035
Yes. Come in.

494
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,166
I didn't know temple food tasted so good.

495
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,209
I might gain weight by the time I leave.

496
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,713
It must be extra good
because we have a chef.

497
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,215
You're a chef?

498
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,551
I'm no chef.

499
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,678
I just cook.

500
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,638
Can you tell us where your restaurant is?

501
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,474
We'd love to visit if it's nearby.

502
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,643
Well, it's not nearby.

503
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,229
It's near Hanok Village.

504
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,148
-Oh, Hanok Village.
-Yes.

505
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,943
Wait, isn't that where that restaurant is?

506
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,237
The restaurant that got
three Diamant stars this year.

507
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,072
Three stars?

508
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,199
Yes, Venerable.

509
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,783
What was it called again?

510
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,912
A SHINING STAR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
JUNGJAE, DIAMANT 3-STAR RESTAURANT

511
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,747
Oh, Jungjae.

512
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,420
Are you sure it's Jungjae?

513
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,505
Yes.

514
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,632
I heard the two restaurants
that got three stars

515
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,550
are going to have a cook-off.

516
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,261
A cook-off?

517
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,179
Yes.

518
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,681
-Thanks.
-Bye.

519
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,476
2ND GEN. KONGNAMUL GUKBAP

520
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,354
It really is incredible

521
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,232
that our restaurant
is the best in the world.

522
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,441
My goodness.

523
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,110
So what if it is?

524
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,071
We can't open anymore,
so it's not even a restaurant now.

525
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,656
Hurry up and clean up.

526
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,378
Beom-woo.

527
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,054
Leave.

528
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,765
How dare you come here?

529
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,142
Go!

530
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,479
-Come on, Myung-sook.
-You thick-faced, shameless punk.

531
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,357
Myung-sook, wait.
Let's hear him out first.

532
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,483
What's there to listen to?

533
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,987
What is it? Why are you back?

534
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,197
Are you here to say you're sorry

535
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,324
and that you regret everything?

536
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,242
Go ahead then.

537
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,368
Regret?

538
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,161
Apologize?

539
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,164
If apologizing was good enough,
why would people be sent to prison?

540
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,126
If you stab someone and say you're sorry,

541
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,670
should you be let off
without being put behind bars?

542
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,173
Mr. Manager.

543
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,093
No, you're not even a manager now.

544
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,016
You're a horrible person.

545
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,606
In that restaurant, we…

546
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,027
We…

547
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,114
Together, we…

548
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,870
What I'm saying is,

549
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,956
you broke Chef Mo's heart,

550
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,459
so that makes you the worst of the worst!

551
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,132
You're right.

552
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,095
That's why I came back.

553
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,645
Help me just this once…

554
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,899
so I can protect Jungjae.

555
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,864
Jungjae…

556
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,867
might disappear.

557
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,204
Hang on.

558
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,331
What are you talking about?

559
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,668
Why would
a perfectly fine restaurant disappear?

560
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,004
Are you trying to deceive us all again?

561
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,923
Hansang Group,

562
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,883
the company I worked for.

563
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,303
You don't know how ruthless they are.

564
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,473
They're holding a cook-off,

565
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,185
and we have to win that in Jungjae's name

566
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,603
to protect it and keep it running.

567
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,441
I'm sorry.

568
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,779
-I know this is all my fault--
-A cook-off?

569
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,451
What? A cook-off?

570
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,203
What are you scheming now?

571
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,082
-You fraud! He's a fraud!
-Calm down, Myung-sook.

572
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,458
He's a con man.

573
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,504
Choon-seung, why are you stopping me
when you should be stopping him?

574
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,048
Shouldn't you be trying to
stop that fraud?

575
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,509
-Come on, please.
-Why should we help that fraud…

576
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,901
Have a bowl of gukbap and go on your way.

577
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,082
Looks like she's going to make
vegetables with rice.

578
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,097
Keep this a secret from the head monk.

579
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,690
A secret?

580
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,567
Yeah.

581
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,529
I got caught making pizza in secret

582
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,531
and got banned from the kitchen.

583
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,785
Do you like to cook?

584
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,286
Yeah, it's fun.

585
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,164
Cooking is my favorite thing to do.

586
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,336
By the way, what are you doing here?

587
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,382
I'm cooking too.

588
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,302
I know, but why are you cooking here?

589
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,388
You should cook at Jungjae.

590
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,139
Are you going to run away forever?

591
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,269
Why are you tearing up?

592
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,104
Are you hungry?

593
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,232
No.

594
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,276
I'm not hungry.

595
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,653
I'm talking about your heart,
not your stomach.

596
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,196
Is your heart empty?

597
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,855
JUNGJAE

598
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,233
You look like a mess.

599
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,361
-Shouldn't you start prepping?
-I'm not here because I like you.

600
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,572
-I had a real hard time convincing her.
-Don't.

601
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,910
How come you both…

602
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,579
You said our restaurant might disappear.

603
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,457
Who will fight for it if I don't?

604
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,919
That's right.
This place means a lot to us.

605
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,256
Beom-woo.

606
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,550
You're not alone anymore.

607
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,220
Let's all work together!

608
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,055
Choon-seung!

609
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,516
You reek of alcohol.

610
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,979
So…

611
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,232
I haven't completely forgiven you yet.

612
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,528
Don't get it wrong and go overboard
with the emotions or anything.

613
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,114
Right. Of course not.

614
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,158
I won't do that. I promise!

615
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:40,954
By the way…

616
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,961
Oh, Chef Mo?

617
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:51,131
We left her a message, but…

618
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,175
Would you come back if you were her?

619
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,223
Come in!

620
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,693
So our newbie's going to
be on some competition show, huh?

621
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,446
You'll need a lot of things to be on TV.

622
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,989
We'll provide whatever backup you need.

623
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,282
You just say the word.

624
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,535
You guys.

625
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:25,957
Sir.

626
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,669
-Isn't this heavy? No?
-Let me.

627
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,048
You guys!

628
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,591
-Don't you worry.
-You got this.

629
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,385
-I can do it!
-You can do it!

630
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,428
Let's go!

631
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,430
-You're hurting my ears!
-You can do it!

632
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,224
-Let's do it!
-Let's do it!

633
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,270
Yeon-joo.

634
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,397
Yeon-joo.

635
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,525
Yes?

636
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,825
How pretty.

637
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,537
You always craved these
around this time of year.

638
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,455
I realized that

639
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,584
the last time I made this for you
was when you left the temple.

640
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,837
Thank you.

641
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,477
It's so good.

642
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,819
I made plenty, so take the rest with you.

643
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,487
Where would I take them to?

644
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,614
He was here.

645
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,911
He didn't dare approach you.

646
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,461
Why are you just leaving?

647
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,923
Didn't you come here to see someone?

648
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:46,139
I just came to check…

649
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,643
if she's doing well.

650
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,652
Well…

651
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,029
Venerable.

652
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:05,700
I lived my life…

653
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,830
thinking I was a really cool, great guy.

654
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,584
But turns out…

655
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,466
I was just an uncool, pathetic guy.

656
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,809
I don't even have the guts
to spill my heart.

657
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,732
Why am I even saying this?

658
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,696
Well then.

659
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,084
I don't know much…

660
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,755
but he seemed sincere.

661
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,094
He didn't seem like
the worst doofus in the world.

662
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,813
Take them with you.

663
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,402
Do as your mom says.

664
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,579
It has to fit the angle of the camera.

665
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,706
Bring the table forward a bit.

666
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,249
Yeah, that's good.

667
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:37,250
Send it over quickly.

668
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,793
VOTE FOR YOUR TASTE
MOTTO VS JUNGJAE

669
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,047
There's no time. Hurry up.

670
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,519
It's overcooked.

671
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,274
Okay, put that down there.

672
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,901
It has to face the other way.

673
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,904
Move that slightly forward.

674
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,073
Please turn on Camera 3.

675
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,575
Check the monitors,

676
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,535
and check this too.

677
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,912
Thank you.

678
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,371
-Did you check it?
-Yes, I did.

679
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,707
This tiny thing is a camera?

680
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,376
Move the camera a bit to the left.

681
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,004
-Check the memory cards.
-Okay.

682
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,548
-We're ready.
-Oh, okay.

683
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,093
Okay, everyone. Let's stand by.

684
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,427
All right.

685
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,637
Ready,

686
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,347
action!

687
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,183
Motto is open for business.

688
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,895
Go, go. Let's go.

689
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,106
-Thank you.
-Please come in.

690
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,360
Service has begun.
Check the tickets carefully.

691
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,486
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

692
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,030
Let's gather around before we start.

693
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,324
-Okay.
-Okay. Jeez, the water's cold.

694
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,036
Gosh, my knees.

695
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,129
So…

696
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,340
I know

697
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,801
I don't have the right to say this,

698
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,429
but Jungjae's fate depends on this,

699
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,850
and we're missing Chef Mo
at this important time.

700
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,853
It's a shame and a pity.

701
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,440
However,

702
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,109
despite that,

703
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,819
in place of Chef Mo,

704
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,573
our Chef Jin prepped all the ingredients
and even selected the menu.

705
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,117
I'm not worried because we have Chef Jin.

706
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,201
Gosh, please.

707
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:40,331
My stomach hurts at the thought of cooking
in front of so many cameras.

708
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,168
I miss Chef Mo even more.

709
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,378
I'm just a stand-in today.

710
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,380
Oh, come on. You're no stand-in.

711
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,717
You're a chef who can hold her own
against the best of them.

712
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,801
That's right.

713
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,887
She has 15 years of experience
in the food service industry.

714
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,763
That kind of expertise speaks for itself.

715
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,098
That's right.

716
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,850
We're counting on you, Chef.

717
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,519
Myung-sook.

718
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:05,148
Goodness me, thank you all very much.

719
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,357
Okay then.

720
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:12,113
Let's use every ounce of our strength
and do this together, okay?

721
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,573
-Let's do it!
-Yeah, let's!

722
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,202
Here.

723
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,165
-What's this?
-Put your hands in the middle.

724
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,834
-Jungjae, on three.
-All right.

725
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:25,919
One, two, three.

726
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,295
-Jungjae!
-Jungjae!

727
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,195
TASTEFULLY YOURS

728
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,863
I don't care about the result.

729
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,365
It's chicken.

730
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,282
-Chicken?
-Chicken?

731
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,409
The chicken we want isn't available.

732
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,619
What do you mean?

733
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,954
I think someone messed with our supply.

734
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,664
How interesting.

735
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,165
This should be an opportunity.

736
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,875
You put on this show just to do this?

737
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,168
After pulling all this crap?

738
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,962
Do you think I'm joking around?

739
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,048
You can wipe out this place,
steal the recipes,

740
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,758
or do whatever you want.

741
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,718
But let's fight fair and square.

742
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:20,431
