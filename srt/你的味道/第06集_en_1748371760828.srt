1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm going to make a tree.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm going to make a tree.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to make a tree.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to make a tree.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to make a tree.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm going to make a tree.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to make a tree.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to make a tree.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to make a tree.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a tree

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The End

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't have a parent

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,000
Huh?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
When I was a kid, I didn't even remember

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
I just threw away the kids under the mountain

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I remember them when I was young

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Mountains, trees,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The monks, the monks, all of them

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,000
So I was old and I liked cooking

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,000
So I threw away the kids

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
And I studied in the C.I.A. and went to Japan

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
The glass that you know

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The glass that you don't

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,000
I met you there, John-min

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I really liked you

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's the first time I've ever felt so kind to you

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I see

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I didn't want to know that

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But anyway, we're breaking up now

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why did you come?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
To come back to Mury

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To go?

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To go to Mury

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Where are you going?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're working well in our restaurant

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Our restaurant is in the second floor

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It looks like we're all going to eat

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're going to eat

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeon-ju

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What I said was right

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Actually

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You're in a lot of pain

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It might be the last time

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll be waiting

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where are you going?

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
To Sapporo?

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Didn't you just leave the restaurant and leave?

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You two didn't even brush your nose in the morning

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was just preparing for business

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's this in the kitchen

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to Sapporo to get some urgent work

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think I'll leave three of my kitchen to you in a minute

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry for leaving a short letter without a warning

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hang on until I call you first

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What's this?

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Isn't it a window?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A window

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A window

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This isn't it

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is the window

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is the window

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A window

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's in the window?

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's in it?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hang on!

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What is this?

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What is this?

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Jeong Jae's practical explanation

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
First

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Jeong Jae is a restaurant that changes with the season

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The menu is a new season menu

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
With a new season menu

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
With a new season menu

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
With a new season menu

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
With a new season menu

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
With a new season menu

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
With a new season menu

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You have to face the customers

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Beom Woo

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you smoke again, you'll really die

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Second

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The ingredients that you're good at at the teapot

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please understand even if you're ugly

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is a chemical that doesn't have chemical or pesticide

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Jun Seung

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If you don't wash your hands while going to the teapot

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You'll really turn your wrist

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Third

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Other ingredients

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Use the Nambu Market that stores freshness

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And for Myung Soo

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please drink some of the food from the elderly

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This isn't right

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, this isn't right

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, no, no, no

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why isn't it working?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's wrong with you?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And the recipe that contains everything from Jeong Jae

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For now, Myung Soo will be the main chef of Jeong Jae

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fourth

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How many times are you going to do this?

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, my

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's 135 times

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If it's this much, we can't believe it

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The fire is itself

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I should have just said no

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did I make you feel guilty?

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is it five years?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That work

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What?

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The wrong thing you did

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I turned it upside down and quit?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look,

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Did you just quit?

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just got out of Burla

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hold on

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What about when I try to get out?

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,440
It was my fault.

129
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,940
I'm just going to see the teacher.

130
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,920
Why are you going there?

131
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Why are you not answering my calls?

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't think it's normal.

133
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
Sapporo..

134
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,260
He's a samurai.

135
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,560
He as well.

136
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,900
What do you do for a victim of the chance?

137
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,280
Get off!

138
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I'm not a man.

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm fighting with my abilities.

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Ability.

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I'll show you my abilities.

142
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Look at this.

143
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm not a man.

144
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I'm not a man.

145
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm not a man.

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm not a man.

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm not a man.

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm not a man.

149
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm not a man.

150
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm not a man.

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm not a man.

152
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm not a man.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I'm not a man.

154
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm not a man.

155
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm not a man.

156
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm not a man.

157
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm not a man.

158
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm not a man.

159
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm not a man.

160
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I'm not a man.

161
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
I'm not a man.

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm not a man.

163
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm not a man.

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
I'm not a man.

165
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I'm not a man.

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm not a man.

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm not a man.

168
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
I'm not a man.

169
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm not a man.

170
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I'm not a man.

171
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Oh, no.

172
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Excuse me.

173
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Oh, yes.

174
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
It's not cooked yet.

175
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
No, it can't be.

176
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
No, it's not cooked yet.

177
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

178
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Shap, shap, shap, shap, shap, shap.

179
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
It's not cooked yet.

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Why is it so...

181
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I don't know. I don't know.

182
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
I heard there's a recipe for it.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Just make one new one.

184
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
New one?

185
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
New one?

186
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm sorry. We'll prepare a new one.

187
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
Oh...

188
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
No, we'll calculate it.

189
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
I'll make it soon.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I can make it soon.

191
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
I can't.

192
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
This is a fake.

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
We just did a full assessment.

194
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
What?

195
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,280
It's not 3, it's 5.

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Look, it's 3 or 5.

197
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
It's my fault.

198
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Is it my fault?

199
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
It's not 5, it's 3.

200
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
It's not 5, it's 5.

201
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
It's not 5, it's 5.

202
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
It's not 5, it's 5.

203
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Let's wrap up today.

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
You can't go in with the manager.

206
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Can you talk to Han Sun-sang?

207
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Please leave us alone.

208
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
I heard something ridiculous.

209
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
It's not a rumor.

210
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
What?

211
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
It's true.

212
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I got a new head chef instead of you.

213
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,280
How can you say that without any discussion?

214
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,280
To be honest, it's hard to be a 3-star with your skills.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Crazy.

216
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I brought you here so hard.

217
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
How about you learn from below?

218
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,280
This is a psychopath.

219
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Do you think I'll just let it go?

220
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
What are you going to do?

221
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
What are you going to do?

222
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
You were aegyo to Han Beom-hoon compared to you.

223
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Thank you for your compliment.

224
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
If you don't want to, just quit.

225
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Get ready for your comeback.

226
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
What? All of a sudden?

227
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
What about Larsell?

228
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Larsell?

229
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
It's not my business anymore.

230
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Anyway, I'm preparing for that after I tell them.

231
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Are you going to stay still?

232
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
You don't have to do anything.

233
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
What do you mean?

234
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I don't understand.

235
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Let's do it.

236
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Let's do it.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,280
We're not too late.

238
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
We can get back to you.

239
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Shin-yo!

241
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
Come out!

242
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
No.

243
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
The tiger is here.

244
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
Really?

245
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Good night.

246
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Did you leave it there?

247
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
You're here.

248
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Who?

249
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Hey!

250
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
What's wrong?

251
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
You?

252
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I think it's a girl.

253
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
It's you.

254
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Hello, I'm Beom-woo's close friend, Lee Yu-jin.

255
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Nice to meet you. I'm Shin-jun.

256
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
You look familiar with masks.

257
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,280
I was going to go to the market and I saw a doll.

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
She suddenly told me about it.

259
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
She said she saw me at the food truck event.

260
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
What exactly did she say?

261
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I think she remembers my beauty.

262
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
What do you mean?

263
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
What a beauty.

264
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Do you like Yeon-sang?

265
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Pardon?

266
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Beom-woo!

267
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
How have you been?

268
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
I missed you so much.

269
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Beom-woo!

270
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
You missed me?

271
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeon-yeol!

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Are you mad?

273
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Hey!

274
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
You're so funny.

275
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm trying to help you.

276
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Why are you my brother?

277
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
I told you to tell me that.

278
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
But you can't tell me that now.

279
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
That's right.

280
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
I have a motorbike.

281
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Motorbike?

282
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Motorbike?

283
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
I think the recipes here are amazing.

284
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Let's bring them here and make it a little more expensive.

285
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Yu-jin.

286
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Let's stop the recipes at other restaurants.

287
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Huh?

288
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Are you suddenly nice?

289
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
You're making trouble?

290
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm not kidding.

291
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I think I'm going to break my head every day.

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm going to cry every day.

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm going to die every day.

294
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm going to die every day.

295
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm going to die every day.

296
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
No, no, no.

297
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
It's okay.

298
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm going to come here and make it a little more expensive.

299
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Hey, guys!

300
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Do you know why we're here?

301
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Here.

302
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
What's wrong?

303
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Do you know why he's here?

304
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,280
He came here to bring all the recipes.

305
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,280
He came here to bring all the recipes.

306
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Brother?

307
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
What do you mean?

308
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
What do you mean?

309
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
What do you mean?

310
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
It's not a kid.

311
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
It's not a kid.

312
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Brother!

313
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Don't you know why I'm here?

314
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Huh?

315
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
What?

316
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
What?

317
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Huh?

318
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
What?

319
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
What?

320
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
What?

321
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Me?

322
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
What?

323
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
You...

324
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Youjin, you...

325
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Who's going to solve this?

326
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Come in.

327
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Come in.

328
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
You...

329
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm going to get you.

330
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Seoul's team!

331
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I told you I'd help you when you're here.

332
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Why are you here?

333
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Oh, my.

334
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
Did I hide it like that?

335
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Right.

336
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Let's have a good night.

337
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Let's have a good night.

338
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Let's have a good night.

339
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Let's have a good night.

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Sweet potato.

341
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Sweet potato.

342
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I'll make sure you're well.

343
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
No.

344
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Let's have a good night.

345
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
It's 100 days.

346
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
It's a day.

347
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Come here.

348
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
What's this?

349
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
What's this?

350
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
What's this?

351
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
It's a plum extract instead of sugar.

352
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Oh, plum extract?

353
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
What's this?

354
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
What's this?

355
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
This is...

356
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Brother.

357
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,280
What are you going to do?

358
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
What?

359
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
You can ask me if you're curious.

360
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Right.

361
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
And if you see a guy like him, you'll be curious.

362
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I'll pull it with my hands.

363
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Give it to me.

364
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,280
This is a plum extract.

365
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
What's going on?

366
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Did you use ginger?

367
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I usually just add the right amount of it.

368
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,280
But the chef told me to add the ginger himself.

369
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
And I wrote it down on the recipe book.

370
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Recipe book?

371
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Mom.

372
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Where's the recipe book?

373
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
I put it here.

374
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Recipe book?

375
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
What?

376
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
What?

377
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
What's the recipe book?

378
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Where did you put it?

379
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
What's this?

380
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Where did you put the recipe book?

381
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Sister, here's the soy sauce.

382
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Sister, I'll do it.

383
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
What's this?

384
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
This cold hand?

385
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Did you make it yourself?

386
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
No, my chef.

387
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Sister?

388
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
The color is different.

389
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
The color, the smell, and the taste are completely different from the one sold in the market.

390
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Taste it.

391
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Taste it.

392
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
This is our secret sauce.

393
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Just eat it.

394
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It's so good, right?

395
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Yes.

396
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Isn't it amazing?

397
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
The chef made it with a time stamp of 200 years.

398
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
200 years?

399
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
It's made in Joseon.

400
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Why is it so funny?

401
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
It's a comedian.

402
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Seoul comedian?

403
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Why is it so funny?

404
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
We're here, right?

405
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Try looking at the situation.

406
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Yes.

407
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,280
I think the recipe will be available today.

408
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I mean, there's a recipe book.

409
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Bring it here.

410
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
What about the one-time order?

411
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
You're not in the mood right now.

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I'll be back soon.

413
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Yes.

414
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll be back.

415
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
What should I do with that guy?

416
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
What should I do?

417
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Hey.

418
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Hey.

419
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Hey.

420
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Hey?

421
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Isn't that crazy?

422
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I can't believe it.

423
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I'm so scared of the sound of the door opening.

424
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I don't want to see it.

425
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
I don't want to see it.

426
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
That guy.

428
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Should I take him?

429
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
A person?

430
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
What are you talking about?

431
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
What are you thinking about?

432
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
That's not it.

433
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
You're a genius.

434
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
You're going to get drunk again.

435
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Is this okay?

436
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
You said you're drunk.

437
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll be waiting.

438
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Give me your call.

439
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm doing my best to protect justice.

440
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Can you answer me?

441
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I think I'm wrong.

442
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I don't want to see it.

443
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
I don't think so.

444
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Hey.

445
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Hey.

446
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,280
You can make trouble in our restaurant with that foreigner.

447
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
But it's okay.

448
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Then it's okay.

449
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
You're a foreigner too.

450
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm a local.

451
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Natural born local people.

452
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Hey, be quiet.

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Good job.

454
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm a P.A.

455
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Junsu, you only remember that.

456
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
You're going to get drunk and get drunk.

457
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Get drunk.

458
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Wait.

459
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Wait.

460
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Okay.

461
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Don't worry.

462
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
I have a secret weapon.

463
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Shin Chun-seung Correction.

464
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Welcome.

465
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
Have a seat.

466
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Look at my mind.

467
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Look at this.

468
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,280
This is the traditional mojoo and damgeumju collection

469
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
made by Shin Chun-seung.

470
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,280
It's a different dimension than what you think.

471
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,280
And this damgeumju will be very surprising.

472
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Here you go.

473
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,280
The first one is from heaven.

474
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,280
The second one is from hell.

475
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,280
And the third one is from hell.

476
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Here you go.

477
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Here you go.

478
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Here you go.

479
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Come back.

480
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Come back.

481
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Come back.

482
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
One, two, three.

483
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
One, two, three.

484
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
One, two, three.

485
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
One, two, three.

486
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
One, two, three.

487
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
One, two, three.

488
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
This is the beginning.

489
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
The beginning?

490
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
What is this?

491
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
What?

492
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,280
This is the secret weapon that I gave my father.

493
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Sosa.

494
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Let's go to the class.

495
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Let's go to the class?

496
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Let's go to the class.

497
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Come on.

498
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Come on.

499
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Come on.

500
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
One shot!

501
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
One shot!

502
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
I

503
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Hey, you're really

504
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I'm serious.

505
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Good job.

506
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Good job.

507
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Good job.

508
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I know you're having a hard time.

509
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
That's a lot of work.

510
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
You're going to be a pig for three days because of the forest.

511
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Let's go.

512
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Let's go.

513
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Come out.

514
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
You should come out.

515
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
You should come out.

516
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Since the line is good,

517
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
our restaurant won't be able to do much.

518
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
To your eyes.

519
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Yes.

520
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Hey, you.

521
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
Good job, bro.

522
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Yeah, baby.

523
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I'll take a look.

524
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Hello?

525
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Where are you?

526
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Are you in Sapporo?

527
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Hey, do you know how worried I am?

528
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
I should at least say where I'm going.

529
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
How's the restaurant?

530
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Are you okay?

531
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
You're a restaurant.

532
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Aren't you curious about me?

533
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I think it's okay to see you getting a call.

534
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
It's done.

535
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Come to the restaurant when you're worried.

536
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeon-ju.

537
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Okay, okay.

538
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Who's next to you?

539
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Hello?

540
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Did you hang up?

541
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Did you hang up?

542
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Did you hang up?

543
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Hey!

544
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Hey!

545
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
This is his voice.

546
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Why is he with him in Japan?

547
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I shouldn't do this.

548
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
He's with him.

549
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Then...

550
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
No...

551
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Where are you?

552
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
What are you doing?

553
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
This is a prison.

554
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Listen carefully.

555
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Hey, this isn't a prison.

556
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
This isn't a prison.

557
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
This is a vacation.

558
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Follow me.

559
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
A vacation.

560
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Ye-jin.

561
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Stay here.

562
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I'll go and open it for you.

563
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Have fun.

564
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Chun-seung.

565
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
Yes?

566
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
You're a hero in our restaurant.

567
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I'm not a hero.

568
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
You're a hero.

569
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
What are you doing sitting here?

570
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Get up.

571
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Chun-seung.

572
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Yes?

573
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I think I should go to Sapporo.

574
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Oh, Sapporo!

575
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Hero!

576
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Yes?

577
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
That's why I'm saying this.

578
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Are you making money?

579
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Wait a minute.

580
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
When did you see me?

581
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
I'm asking for money.

582
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
You bastard!

583
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
You bastard!

584
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I love you!

585
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
I love you.

586
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
So...

587
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Shouldn't you go to Sapporo?

588
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Cool.

589
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Oh, my brother is cooler than that.

590
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
He's a hundred times better than me.

591
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll save you.

592
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Trust me.

593
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Trust me.

594
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Trust me.

595
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Trust me.

596
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Trust me.

597
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Trust me.

598
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
You bastard!

599
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
You bastard!

600
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Wait, I'm sorry.

601
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
I'm sorry.

602
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
You bastard!

604
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Oh, my brother is a champion.

605
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Oh, my brother is a champion.

606
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Oh, my brother is a champion.

607
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Oh, my brother is a champion.

608
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
Think about your body.

609
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Teacher, please eat.

610
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
No, no!

611
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm not saying this.

612
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
This is not my dish.

613
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
No, no.

614
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Who are you?

615
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Who are you?

616
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Who are you?

617
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Who are you?

618
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Who are you?

619
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
You bastard.

620
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,280
The world's best chef is...

621
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
in the bedroom.

622
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,280
If you don't want to eat,

623
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
you can't eat anything.

624
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
I thought I'd come back to you

625
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
before I get worse.

626
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm sorry.

627
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,280
I didn't think of you.

628
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I don't know if it's the last time.

629
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Aren't you tired?

630
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
What about you?

631
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,280
You haven't eaten anything yet?

632
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I haven't eaten anything.

633
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I can't eat anything

634
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,280
and I can't even make a few.

635
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
I can't communicate

636
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
what you want to eat.

637
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
I can't eat anything

638
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
so I think you're getting worse.

639
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
What about the hook?

640
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I made it for you first.

641
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I don't think so.

642
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
What do you want to eat?

643
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,280
If it's the food you made,

644
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
you might like it.

645
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,280
You don't even recognize me.

646
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
You'll remember your food

647
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,280
even if you don't know it right now.

648
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,280
You really like Sophie's food.

649
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,280
It's not that I'm trying to burden you.

650
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
I'm not trying to burden you.

651
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Do you want to hear a story

652
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,280
before I come here?

653
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,280
What do I do after I go there?

654
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
We were like this.

655
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Maybe it's the last time.

656
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,280
How do you feel?

657
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
I'm sorry.

658
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
It's good.

659
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I'll go to the kitchen.

660
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
You're here?

661
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm fine.

662
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
I know what kind of people

663
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,280
you're talking about.

664
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm the teacher of the D-Aman.

665
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,280
Please hold onto me and take care of me.

666
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
I'm going to teach you

667
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,280
how to be a good person.

668
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I'm counting on you.

669
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Let's go!

670
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
I'm sorry.

673
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
I'll bring the table.

674
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I'll bring the table.

675
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I'll bring the table.

676
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
What's the matter?

677
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
I'm worried.

678
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
It was a dangerous place.

679
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Who was it?

680
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Who's the witness?

681
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Who's the witness?

682
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm asking you who's the witness!

683
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Who's the witness?

684
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm asking you who's the witness!

685
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Who's the witness?

686
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm...

687
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
I'm here.

688
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Do you know what you did?

689
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I've done everything I could

690
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
to get you to know

691
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
what I did.

692
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,280
What you did was wrong

693
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,280
is what you did to me.

694
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
It's your fault.

695
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
It's your fault!

696
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Please let me take responsibility.

697
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I'll take responsibility

698
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
and stop the trial.

699
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'll take responsibility.

700
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
I'll take responsibility.

701
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
You're old.

702
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,280
I'm a head chef now.

703
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,280
I wanted to change everything

704
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,280
but you know

705
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,280
what I'm like.

706
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I cried and had a lot of things to do.

707
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
You and I

708
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,280
learned a lot from you.

709
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
Right?

710
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Let's find out.

711
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
What?

712
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Let's do something

713
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
that you can eat.

714
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm going to be a head chef

715
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
soon.

716
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
You're going to be a head chef

717
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
and a owner chef?

718
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Did you get your teacher's consent?

719
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
I did.

720
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I was a little bit difficult

721
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
to get her to come.

722
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I had to watch the whole restaurant.

723
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Cooking or operating...

724
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
It won't be easy.

725
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Do you want to come back

726
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
and do it with me?

727
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
I can take responsibility for what I did wrong.

728
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I think that's already over in Korea.

729
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm not done yet.

730
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
We can start over.

731
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Hey!

732
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,280
What are you doing at a late night restaurant?

733
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280
I know why you're doing that.

734
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm doing this for you.

735
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
You need me.

736
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Stop!

737
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,280
You're just wasting your time.

738
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,280
What are you doing at a three-star restaurant?

739
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
You're making a mess.

740
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,280
I'm not doing it.

741
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm just doing it.

742
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I'm not doing it.

743
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm just doing it.

744
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
I'm not doing it.

745
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
I'm doing it.

746
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
I'm not doing it.

747
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I'm just doing it.

748
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I'm done with you.

749
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
You...

750
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,280
How did you get here?

751
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Our restaurant is safe for our family.

752
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Before we start the restaurant,

753
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,280
the person who worked with me...

754
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
I think we need to start worrying about him.

755
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,280
He keeps trying to cross the line.

756
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
I don't think he knows.

757
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,280
We've already crossed the line.

758
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Stop talking nonsense.

759
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
If I think of cooking, I'll call you.

760
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Go.

761
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Let's go.

762
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Chef, I came here because I was curious.

763
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,280
How did you get here so easily?

764
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I came here because I was curious.

765
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
What?

766
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
You kept kissing me and dating me.

767
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Are you done?

768
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,280
I'm a bad person, so I got hit hard.

769
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,280
What?

770
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,280
Suddenly?

771
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
I was about to ask.

772
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Why didn't you tell me that you were on the show?

773
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,280
I was going to ask you.

774
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
The restaurant is on my side.

775
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I can't go this far.

776
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Why did you come here?

777
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,280
You came here because you didn't want to come back.

778
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Who doesn't want to come back?

779
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,280
I?

780
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Jung Jae-reul?

781
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
I didn't want to come back.

782
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,280
I know you're not the person who will leave the restaurant.

783
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,280
But if you come here, you'll be more excited to see the past.

784
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,280
And you'll have to decide with objective eyes.

785
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
I missed you!

786
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Are you out of your mind?

787
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,280
I'm out of my mind.

788
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Where are you going?

789
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Why are you here?

790
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
To organize the meeting.

791
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm going to organize it.

792
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,280
What are you organizing?

793
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,280
You don't have to know.

794
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm not going to be in the same class as you.

795
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
Do you want to go?

796
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
Okay.

797
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
How did you come?

798
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
We're running out of time.

799
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Who are you?

800
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
It's your first time seeing me.

801
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
What?

802
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,280
You're picking on three people?

803
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Oh, my.

804
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,280
It's done, right?

805
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Oh, how did you come?

806
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,280
This is the head chef.

807
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
I came to find him.

808
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,280
I'll be back in a minute.

809
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
No.

810
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,280
The CEO told me not to bring the person I don't know.

811
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,280
The person I don't know?

812
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Search for Jang Yong-hae.

813
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Han Yuju is prettier than an actor.

814
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Did you hear that?

815
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,280
Oh, he said he'd bring Han Sang-mu to the warehouse.

816
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,280
What? The warehouse?

817
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,280
I think I'll call the manager.

818
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
You're Jang Yong-hae.

819
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Who's coming for me?

820
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
What?

821
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,280
What's this?

822
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,280
Han Sang-mu, Lim Yuri, In-seo, and Byung-jae?

823
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,280
You seem to be having a good time.

824
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,280
He didn't eat anything today.

825
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
I'll be back.

826
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,280
Shall we go to the market first?

827
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,280
Or the second floor market?

828
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,280
Since it's a water supply, let's go to the second floor that we often go to.

829
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
It's uncomfortable.

830
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,280
Is it uncomfortable? Do you want me to do it again?

831
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,280
No.

832
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
You said it's uncomfortable.

833
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,280
What's this?

834
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,280
It's something you should do well like before.

835
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,280
Then is it okay if it's not the old thing?

836
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
I'll leave.

837
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
That's going to be a big deal.

838
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Are you crazy? Are you trying to die?

839
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
Hey, Mo Hyun-joo, you're out of your mind.

840
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,280
What are you going to do with those two?

841
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Did you put something in there?

842
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,280
I didn't put anything in there.

843
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Take care of me.

844
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,280
This is really famous for the Takoyaki.

845
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,280
Do you want to eat it?

846
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,280
You're driving so fast.

847
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,280
Your first delivery to charge is that of Saturn?

848
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,280
How about Liotherm?

849
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,200
They give good conditions.

850
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,540
Are you good?

851
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,280
He's eating here.

852
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,220
It looks very tasty.

853
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,520
I like the food.

854
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,620
Is it delicious?

855
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,580
Wow, there areی repository.

856
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,860
This Fridges seems very refreshing.

857
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,300
It's perfect for a day like this.

858
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,180
I'll put the biscuit powder on top of it,

859
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,100
and then I'll make the kegani juice.

860
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,180
You made the biscuit in advance.

861
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,820
You were the fastest.

862
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,380
But it's hard to make it easy.

863
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,540
Right.

864
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,060
You make it with the flour and boil it.

865
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,180
What? Biscuit? Biscuit?

866
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,780
How do you know I like biscuits?

867
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,900
I used to eat biscuits in the kitchen when I was a kid.

868
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,580
Why biscuits?

869
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,340
I was looking for food that you like.

870
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,580
What? What do you like?

871
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,300
I don't know.

872
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,860
I've never seen anyone make food.

873
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,700
It's been a while.

874
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,580
Yes, it's been a while.

875
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,780
How is the chef?

876
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,780
Is he still not eating?

877
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,700
Yes.

878
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,780
I see.

879
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,220
I've prepared a lot of trucks for you.

880
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,820
I'll give you some.

881
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,260
Is it good?

882
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,260
Yes.

883
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,740
Is there anything that you like?

884
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,260
No, there isn't.

885
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,140
Okay.

886
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,100
Okay.

887
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,980
Okay.

888
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,060
Shall we go have dinner?

889
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,500
Yes.

890
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,580
What do you want to eat?

891
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,420
Let's go together.

892
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,820
Japanese restaurants are convenient.

893
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,500
Right?

894
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,260
Do you want to go to our restaurant?

895
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,460
I'm here to buy some food.

896
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,060
You can't buy food.

897
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,860
You're a dog.

898
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:30,100
You're a dog.

899
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,540
You remember, right?

900
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,300
You tried it and you fell in love with it.

901
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,540
You said you'd steal the recipe and put it in front of the store.

902
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,340
Me?

903
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Yes.

904
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,100
I think so.

905
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,220
But I don't want to go today.

906
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,820
Right?

907
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,780
You're a dog.

908
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,980
You want to go to the convenience store?

909
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,340
Do you want to go to our restaurant?

910
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,260
What?

911
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,460
I want to drink some hybrid.

912
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,100
I'm going to the bathroom.

913
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,500
Don't fight.

914
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,420
Okay.

915
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,220
What's fighting?

916
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,100
I'm going to care for our family.

917
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,420
Don't call me, okay?

918
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,100
I'm your age isn't it?

919
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,540
Don't be silly.

920
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,320
I feel amazing working with my lover,

921
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,120
pushed out by everyone.

922
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,580
Yes.

923
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:49,660
Dad!

924
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,620
Yes?

925
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
Ah...

926
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,620
You've been so stubborn since before.

927
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,620
You've been saying that you've been in a relationship for years.

928
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,620
Not like I know everything.

929
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,620
I really know everything.

930
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,620
Didn't you say that?

931
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,620
We...

932
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,620
Hey, hey, hey.

933
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,620
Wait.

934
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,620
We've met for a very long time.

935
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,620
Wait.

936
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,620
It won't be a three-year-long wait.

937
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,620
Whether it's three years or 365 years,

938
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,620
the important thing is the past.

939
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,620
The past.

940
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,620
I'm sorry.

941
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,620
Do you know why Yeonju...

942
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,620
made a restaurant in Jeonju?

943
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,620
Why? What else?

944
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,620
Why is the restaurant name Jeongjae?

945
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,620
Jeongjae Salt.

946
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,620
Isn't that what you call Jeongjae?

947
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,620
I promised.

948
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:32,620
We'll meet somewhere else in Seoul.

949
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,620
Jeongjae is a restaurant...

950
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,620
Hey, hey.

951
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Thank you.

952
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
I'll be back.

953
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
What?

954
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
I can't hear you.

955
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,620
I'm sorry.

956
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,620
I'm sorry.

957
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,620
I can't hear you.

958
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,620
What is it?

959
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,620
You ordered a lot of flowers.

960
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,620
Did you order this?

961
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,620
I'm going to eat it.

962
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,620
Who's the food in front of you?

963
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,620
Are you going to eat it now?

964
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Yes.

965
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,620
It's cold!

966
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,620
What? What?

967
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,620
The customer can't call.

968
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,620
Then you should stop calling.

969
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,620
Are you my ex-girlfriend?

970
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,620
What are you talking about?

971
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,620
Don't you know I'm a motorbike?

972
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,620
Are you Batman?

973
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,620
When did you start to have that face?

974
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,620
What?

975
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Oh, okay.

976
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
You went there, right?

977
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,620
Why can't you call?

978
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,620
I don't know.

979
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,620
I don't know.

980
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
Why are you asking me?

981
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,620
I'm busy.

982
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,620
I can't call you.

983
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,620
I'm so busy that I'm dying.

984
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,620
Just think about it.

985
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Are you out of your mind?

986
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,620
Then we can all be in trouble together.

987
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Hello?

988
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,620
It's us.

989
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
It's us.

990
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,620
Since when have you been with me and us?

991
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
Okay.

992
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,620
I'll hang up now.

993
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,620
It's noisy.

994
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,620
Did you see me send it?

995
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,620
Hurry up and see it.

996
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,620
It's noisy, but you're much more...

997
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,620
It's noisy.

998
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,620
Your brother...

999
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,620
I jumped over and got into the water and scouted the other guy.

1000
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,620
We really ended up together.

1001
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,620
What's this?

1002
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,620
Han Sunwoo.

1003
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,620
You got him after you had a good meal.

1004
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,620
You always used a toothbrush to tell me to fly.

1005
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,620
What's the relationship between you and Han Sunwoo?

1006
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,620
Hello?

1007
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,620
Han Bermou.

1008
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,620
Han Sang, Le Mulee.

1009
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,620
Le Mulee, Han Sang.

1010
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,620
What are you talking about?

1011
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Hey, Han Bermou!

1012
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,620
What's that?

1013
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Hey, Han Bermou!

1014
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,620
How do you remember that?

1015
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,620
I don't remember.

1016
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,620
It's ridiculous.

1017
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,620
I know.

1018
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,620
I used to have a lot of things to do.

1019
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,620
I raised a little boy who could hold a knife.

1020
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,620
I didn't think I would have a friend like you.

1021
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,620
I'm a little boy.

1022
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,620
I'm a little girl.

1023
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,620
I'm a little boy.

1024
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,620
I'm a little girl.

1025
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,620
I'm a little girl.

1026
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620
I'm a little girl.

1027
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,620
I'm a little girl.

1028
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,620
You betrayed us and went to the beach to date you.

1029
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,620
I thought we could give each other what we wanted.

1030
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,620
Isn't it more suspicious that you're stuck in a restaurant like that?

1031
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,620
I'll find the recipe.

1032
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:24,620
I think my dream is coming true now.

1033
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,620
Do you know what you're doing?

1034
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,620
You can't be right.

1035
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,620
I'm a little girl.

1036
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,620
I'm a little girl.

1037
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,620
I'm a little girl.

1038
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,620
I'm a little girl.

1039
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,620
I'm a little girl.

1040
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,620
I'm a little girl.

1041
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,620
I'm a little girl.

1042
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,620
I'm a little girl.

1043
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,620
I'm a little girl.
