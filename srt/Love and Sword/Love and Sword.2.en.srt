00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 2=

19
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,280
The two of you won't last long.

20
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,890
The cold energy
inside your body is suppressing it.

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,450
You can only use this method
to restrain the poison.

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,250
You've tried so many ways to save her,

23
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,730
risking your own life.

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,640
Does she even know?

25
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,810
I just hope she never finds out.

26
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,450
The martial world
never lacks fools in love.

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,760
Finding the right person,

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,890
even if it means dying, so what?

29
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,730
But dying without knowing the truth

30
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,730
would be a real loss.

31
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,920
Everything has its counter.

32
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,200
I refuse to believe
there's a poison in this world

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
without a cure.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,130
As long as I'm here,

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
I'll keep drawing the poison for her.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,290
Everything has its counter.

37
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,850
Are you talking about poison or people?

38
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,640
The poison in Miss Rong's body

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,480
isn't something accumulated overnight.

40
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,200
You mean...

41
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,570
Someone has been
poisoning her all along?

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,680
Otherwise, the poison
wouldn't have taken so long to act.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,200
What's happening?

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,760
Come here!

45
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,130
Everyone, move!

46
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:03,640
- Hurry up!
- Who are these people?

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,520
What's going on outside?

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,290
Let's go.

49
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,410
Why are you stopping us?

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,570
Wait, my legs are numb.

51
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,130
You two...

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,610
Why are you completely soaked?

53
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm hot.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,960
Who are you people?

55
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:23,610
Take them all over there.

56
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,960
Move!

57
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,010
Hurry up!

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,850
You too, move!

59
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,290
The Ghost Valley Sect is here.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,360
Yeah.

61
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,680
What's wrong?

62
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,290
I think

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,760
if I were to die here

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,330
in the desert with you,

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,050
it might actually be kind of fun.

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,640
If it weren't for the smell of camels,

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,170
then...

68
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,760
Shut up.

69
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,290
Brothers in arms,

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
feasting across the lands.

71
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,360
Walking side by side.

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,730
May we meet again someday.

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
Chief.

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,560
You lit the fire

75
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,610
and signaled the move.

76
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,210
Since when did Ghost Valley Sect

77
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,800
have a feud with the merchant caravans?

78
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,360
It's just that the leader
got a little paranoid.

79
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,410
So we have no choice
but to search carefully.

80
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,050
Merchants passing through.

81
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,360
Seeking shelter from the sandstorm
at the Immortal Spring.

82
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,970
I haven't seen any unfamiliar faces.

83
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,290
However...

84
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,850
You seem to have a fever.

85
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,210
Heatstroke and exhaustion.

86
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,071
Then drinking cold wine
on top of that...

87
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,410
Your energy is weak.

88
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,770
I'm afraid your waist won't hold up.

89
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,290
You shouldn't force yourself.

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
This is my family's medicine.

91
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
One pill a day.

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Stay away from alcohol.

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,170
You'll recover soon enough.

94
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,240
Merchants come
and go through the desert.

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,240
We naturally appreciate
the Ghost Valley Sect's protection.

96
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,610
Just a small token of gratitude.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,800
All right, that's it for tonight.

98
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,730
Move out.

99
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,970
That was terrifying.

100
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,360
Many thanks to the Master Healer
for saving us.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,650
Thank you, Master Healer! Thank you!

102
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,920
That sister may look delicate,

103
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,970
but surviving in

104
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,850
a place like this,

105
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,800
she's remarkable.

106
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,320
She is indeed not an ordinary woman.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
You know her?

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,610
I know many secrets.

109
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,610
Some secrets
in the martial world can save lives.

110
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,530
Some can get you killed.

111
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,210
What about mine?

112
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,730
Do you know my secrets?

113
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,610
Tell me.

114
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,610
Your secrets...

115
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,170
I'll find out.

116
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,410
You're bluffing.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
Beyond these mountains
lie endless paths,

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,170
winds and storms ahead.

119
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,210
Take care.

120
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:19,410
Thank you, Senior, for your assistance.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,850
I'm deeply grateful.

122
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,170
Miss,

123
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,650
come over here and have some fruit.

124
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,530
You already know,

125
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,530
once I intervene,

126
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,800
I will see it through to the end.

127
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,850
Once you find out what poison was used,

128
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,240
contact me.

129
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,610
I will seek the antidote.

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,480
Much appreciated.

131
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,850
If you ever need my help,

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,050
I am at your service.

133
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:49,360
(Tiangang)
As expected.

134
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,970
If you weren't from Tiangang,

135
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,730
how could you
have schemed so meticulously?

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,480
Thank you, Senior.

137
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,170
Miss Rong.

138
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,440
Senior.

139
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:03,210
The martial world is dangerous.

140
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,440
You must be extra cautious.

141
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:05,770
Take good care of yourself.

142
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,360
Senior.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,610
Take care.

144
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,880
Come on, let's go.

145
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,850
Watch your step.

146
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,730
Aren't you leaving?

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,410
Where to?

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,650
The Ruthless Parlor.

149
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,850
Doesn't seem that heartless to me.

150
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,360
Why are we going there?

151
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,210
Have you

152
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,320
ever been there?

153
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,290
Do I seem reckless like you?

154
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,920
I always plan things out.

155
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,000
Leader.

156
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,182
They've headed
towards the Ruthless Parlor.

157
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,170
Move out.

158
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,650
Let's go see what all the fuss is about.

159
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,760
(Ruthless Parlor)

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,240
(A hundred gold to buy a life,
even the heartless have feelings)

161
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,650
Do they sell weapons here?

162
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
You just hang your sword like that?

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
This is the most rule-abiding place.

164
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,370
Though it's filled
with the most lawless people.

165
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,493
I, Jin Buyao, Lord
of the Ruthless Parlor, welcome.

166
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,680
(Jin Buyao, Lord of Ruthless Parlor)

167
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,800
I ask that you lay down your weapons

168
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,410
before entering the Ruthless Parlor.

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,250
So it's Yan Shao.

170
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,320
Your entrance fee has already been paid.

171
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,010
Please, enter the Ruthless Parlor.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,770
We're together.

173
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,680
A hundred gold to buy a life,

174
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
even the heartless have feelings.

175
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,800
What does that mean?

176
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,200
Do I have to pay
a hundred gold just to enter?

177
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
That's robbery.

178
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,890
Not at all.

179
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,920
A life is worth a thousand gold.

180
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,490
So this place

181
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,410
is a sanctuary for people
in the martial world?

182
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,493
Follow the contract,
and hang up the truce plaque.

183
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:57,515
Turn swords into peace.

184
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,515
That's the idea, right?

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
You're quite sharp, Miss.

186
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,250
So if I go in,

187
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,560
do I really have to pay a hundred gold?

188
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,680
You are exceptionally clever.

189
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,200
Fine. Then I'll just

190
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,050
be here and wait to die.

191
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,680
Someone will pay for you.

192
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,800
Jin Buyao.

193
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,440
This is Rong Shukuang from Yuchi Manor.

194
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,530
So you brought her here

195
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,800
to claim the bounty?

196
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,250
Huo Xiang. Chai Hu.

197
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,130
Please.

198
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,800
(Huo Xiang. Chai Hu.)

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,290
(Those names)

200
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,170
(sound soothing.)

201
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,250
Chinese motherwort mixed
with pearl powder for a bath

202
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,490
can nourish the skin.

203
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,204
While peach blossom powder combined
with black-bone chicken blood

204
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,250
can enhance the complexion.

205
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,050
More. I want more.

206
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,370
(Exactly.)

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,200
(This is how you truly live
the martial world dream.)

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,170
(Looks like I made the right choice.)

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,600
I could stay here for a long time.

210
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Miss, you're from Yuchi Manor?

211
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,960
Then, naturally, your things

212
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,250
are different from ours.

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,530
You sure know a lot.

214
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,770
What else do you know about Yuchi Manor?

215
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,800
Tell me.

216
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Yuchi Manor?

217
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,090
It's the number one manor
in the martial world.

218
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,320
From the Manor Lord down,

219
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,530
there are four divisions.

220
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,320
Each is ruled
by the heads of Hai, Feng, Lu, and Song.

221
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,537
The four great hall masters.

222
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,440
Their businesses stretch far and wide.

223
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,760
They are wealthy beyond measure.

224
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,490
After you were taken
by Ghost Valley Sect,

225
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,050
Yuchi Manor placed the reward

226
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,200
in Ruthless Parlor
to secure your rescue.

227
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,440
That hero who brought you here

228
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,370
must have already collected the reward.

229
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,770
Miss, that tattoo on your body

230
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,920
is quite unique.

231
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,320
It's rare for a woman

232
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,770
to have such a tattoo.

233
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,410
A tattoo?

234
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,720
Where?

235
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,920
What is this?

236
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,050
A moth?

237
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,410
Does it still hurt?

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,600
No.

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
But, Master,

240
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,370
what does this tattoo mean?

241
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,050
Yan'er.

242
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,840
You'll understand when you grow up.

243
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Swear to me,

244
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,530
no matter what happens in the future,

245
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,050
you must protect Fang Yi with your life.

246
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,370
Protect her for life

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
and keep her safe.

248
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,680
(Feng Ming)

249
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,960
Who injured Yan Shao so badly?

250
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,715
(Fei Wu)
How could this happen?

251
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,010
With his skills,

252
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:12,200
how is this possible...

253
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Did the letter
to Yuchi Manor get delivered?

254
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,770
Yes.

255
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,848
I need a few days
to recover my internal energy

256
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:18,050
before I can set out.

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,370
There's no need for you to stay.

258
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,200
Carry out my instructions.

259
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:22,960
Yes.

260
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,600
I'm not leaving.

261
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:26,920
I don't feel safe
leaving you here alone.

262
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,440
A few days of rest will do.

263
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:31,170
Besides, this is the Ruthless Parlor.

264
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,490
There is no place

265
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,650
safer than this.

266
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,170
Your mission is just as important.

267
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,960
Are you really willing to make an enemy

268
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,530
of Ghost Valley Sect for a woman?

269
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,370
Do I need a reason

270
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,250
to oppose the Ghost Valley Sect?

271
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,930
(Ruthless Parlor)

272
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,848
(Each time you channel your energy
to draw out the poison,)

273
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,490
(the damage to your body worsens.)

274
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,170
(Your martial strength
will also weaken.)

275
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
(Can the poison be completely expelled?)

276
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,250
(It's unlikely.)

277
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,890
But at the very least,
it can slow the effects.

278
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,026
She could last
another three to five years.

279
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,170
That's good.

280
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,650
No matter what,

281
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,890
expelling even a little of the poison

282
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,050
gives her a better chance to survive.

283
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,010
But the poison will also seep
into your bloodstream

284
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,515
and it could cost you your life.

285
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,370
Two people

286
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:48,671
bearing it together
is better than her facing it alone.

287
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,600
We endure for as long as we can.

288
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,010
Why?

289
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,050
A promise.

290
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,200
To protect her for a lifetime.

291
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,540

292
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,050

293
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,840
Just go.

294
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Where is Yan Shao?

295
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,200
Yan Shao?

296
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,530
Are you there, Yan Shao?

297
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,440
I know you saved me for the money.

298
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,010
But you've protected me all this way.

299
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,050
I am still grateful.

300
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,490
If you ever visit Yuchi Manor
in the future,

301
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,200

A blade master from southwestern region.

But...

334
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,320
He's expensive?

335
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:13,337
A few years ago
at the Martial Arts Assembly,

336
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,080
his junior was defeated by your blade

337
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,471
and unable to bear the shame,

338
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,715
so he took his own life.

339
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,450
Forget it.

340
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,360
Master Jiang is not an option.

341
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,490
What about that lady?

00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:25,160
(Yu Linglong, Spirit Fox Sect)
Yu Linglong, the Twin Autumn Swords

343
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,320
of the Spirit Fox Sect.

She also has ties to you.

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,600
She does?

346
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,290
She once publicly declared

347
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,450
her love for Yuchi Manor's
Young Master Lin Shaoci.

348
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,770
Said he was hers to take.

349

But rumor has it

350
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,360
she's a notorious seductress.

351
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,840
Many young men have lost their innocence

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,320

353
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,730
What a playboy.

354
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,360

Well...

357
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,530
Either way, she's bad news.

358
00:17:58,671 --> 00:17:59,690
Definitely not an option.

359

374
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,360
What, are you being hunted?

375
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,450
Shen Zuitian of the Ghost Valley Sect

376
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,770
and his lackeys

377
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,320
have been chasing me relentlessly.

378
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,010
Well, hero.

379
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,315
Do you have the guts to take the job?

380
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,730
I heard

381
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,600
you took a hit from Shen Zuitian's
Mystic Ice Jade Palm.

382
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,690
How does it feel?

383
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,840
Chills to the bone.

384
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,530
Sleepless nights.

385
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,010
Not pleasant at all.

386
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
That sounds about right.

387
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,360
It also messes with my head.

388
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,120
Sometimes, I lose control
and do unexpected things.

389
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,490
That explains a lot.

390
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,690
I haven't asked. Who are you?

391
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,800
Ghost Valley Sect,

392
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:51,271
(Shen Zuitian, Leader of Ghost Valley Sect)
Shen Zuitian.

393
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,600
Excuse me!

394
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Rong Shukuang.

395
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,210
What happened to you?

396
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,560
You can't even walk straight?

397
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,800
You're a disgrace to Yuchi Manor.

398
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,730
H... Hey.

399
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,690
That's a bit harsh.

400
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:09,048
Leave some room for dignity.

401
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:10,120
We might meet again.

402
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,450
Sister Rong.

403
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:12,880
Seeing you safe and sound,

404
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,640
it's such a relief.

405
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,400
Don't worry.

406
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
Brother Shaoci told us

407
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,970
to keep you safe.

408
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,982
(Tang Yingluo, Tang Clan)

409
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,010
Rong Shukuang never cared for you.

410
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,450
Does she appreciate

411
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,770
your kindness?

412
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,930
I do.

413
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,360
When I see Brother Shaoci,

414
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,930
I'll make sure he thanks you properly.

415
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,450
Tang Yingluo.

416
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,490
I warned you.

417
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,930
Don't call him Brother Shaoci.

418
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,120
Some people have lost their prime

419
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
and faded with age.

420
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,648
They can't call the "brother" anymore,

421
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,737
yet they just won't give up.

422
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,782
- Ow...
- So pathetic.

423
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,600
You wench!

424
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,560
Looking for a beating?

425
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,730
Who are you calling old?

426
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,290
Ow!

427
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,050
Stop!

428
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,970
Stop.

429
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,250
You two can argue all you want.

430
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,490
Just don't drag me into it.

431
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,530
Go on, keep at it!

432
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,970
Hey!

433
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,826
What do you want?

434
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,137
You already need a lesson?

435
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,600
Yan Shao!

436
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,210
Help!

437
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,290
Save me! Someone's going to die!

438
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,010
I asked Boss Jin to find me a bodyguard,

439
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,210
and guess what happened?

440
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,120
I ran into Shen Zuitian.

441
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Then I bumped into two strange women.

442
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,530
I nearly drowned
in their endless chatter.

443
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,250
The one
with dual swords and a nasty temper,

444
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,080
that's Yu Linglong.

445
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,840
The other is Tang Yingluo,
the Tang Clan's thirteenth lady.

446
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,915
She's skilled with poison.

447
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,600
They're both love rivals.

448
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,210
You'd better keep your guard up.

449
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,050
They said

450
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,730
they were here to protect me.

451
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,730
But something feels off.

452
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,250
They claim it's for your safety,

453
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,290
but they're really here for Lin Shaoci.

454
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,560
You don't matter to them.

455
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,080
I've already sent word.

456
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,490
People from Yuchi Manor
will be here soon.

457
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,050
You'll have to go back eventually.

458
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,450
Why rush it?

459
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,970
(After all this time,)

460
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,210
(Yan Shao's knowledge,)

461
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,050
(martial skills, insight,)

462
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,640
(are all impressive.)

463
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,600
(Why should I look elsewhere?)

464
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,320
(I need help, and he needs money.)

465
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,320
(Isn't this the perfect solution?)

466
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,050
All right.

467
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,400
Smart thinking.

468
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,160
Fine, I'll be back to Yuchi Manor.

469
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,530
But,

470
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,360
you're coming with me.

471
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,730
Why should I go with you?

472
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,250
You're the only one I know.

473
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,930
It's not like I have many choices.

474
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,450
And I've lost my martial arts.

475
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,530
I can't survive
the martial world on my own.

476
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,840
I need someone,

477
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,320
a personal bodyguard.

478
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,840
I've looked around outside.

479
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,880
None of them seem reliable.

480
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
You're the only option.

481
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,690
Barely trustworthy, but passable.

482
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,800
Relax.

483
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,290
I'll pay you.

484
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,840
Leaving Ruthless Parlor is dangerous.

485
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,400
You won't survive out there.

486
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,560
How much do you want?

487
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,840
You saw it yourself.

488
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,640
This is a life-risking job.

489
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,530
Two hundred a month.

490
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,880
Not a coin anymore.

491
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,360
Forget it. You're on your own.

492
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,120
Wait!

493
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,320
Name your price, hero.

494
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,770
I changed my mind.

495
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,050
I'm not taking this job.

496
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,880
No, wait!

497
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,880
Shen Zuitian is
in Ruthless Parlor right now.

498
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,290
Are you just going to
let him take me out?

499
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,050
Ruthless Parlor has its rules.

500
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,210
He won't touch you here.

501
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,160
You can just wait for Yuchi Manor

502
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,080
to fetch you.

503
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,010
No way.

504
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,210
Even if I return,

505
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,770
Yuchi Manor isn't entirely safe either.

506
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,120
Hero,

507
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,080
after all we've been through,

508
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,210
risking our lives together,

509
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,730
don't we share a deep bond?

510
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,471
Do I look like I share a bond with you?

511
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,490
Fine.

512
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,400
Heartless and ruthless.

513
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,690
You win.

514
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,730
Coming at night, clearly unfriendly.

515
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,010
Show yourself.

516
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,080
In Ruthless Parlor,
there are no enemies or friends.

517
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,120
Why the need to meet?

518
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,530
Do you think my room
is open to everyone?

519
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,970
Barging in uninvited?

520
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,360
Meeting someone unclothed
would be improper.

521
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,210
Would you allow me
to put on some clothes first?

522
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,160
Bare honesty reflects true sincerity.

523
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:40,600
We're all people of the martial world,
so no need for formalities.

524
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
With such fair skin,

525
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,930
why are you acting like a woman?

526
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,930
Barging into
a man's room while he bathes,

527
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,210
does that make you a hero?

528
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,400
Leader Shen, impressive skills.

529
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,560
But it seems Yan Shao
has the upper hand.

530
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,010
To receive your praise,

531
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,930
what an honor.

532
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,400
Are we really going to waste the night

533
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,770
exchanging such
meaningless pleasantries?

534
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,490
Leader Shen, have you come tonight

535
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,320
to uncover the identity of the one

536
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,400
who rescued Rong Shukuang?

537
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,880
Sharp as ever.

538
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,137
I'm just in it for the money.

539
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,800
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

540
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,600
What if I say it's for the person?

541
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,730
Rong Shukuang does have a certain charm.

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,250
Heroes think alike.

543
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,490
To win a woman's heart,

544
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,490
you must first place her in danger,

545
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,320
and then be the one to save her.

546
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,450
If it were really about her,

547
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,640
you wouldn't have brought her here.

548
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,690
You'd have taken her far away instead.

549
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I changed my mind.

550
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,450
Is that a crime?

551
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,210
The name Yan Shao

552
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,010
didn't just appear
in the martial world without reason.

553
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,120
I suspect

554
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,560
you're using Rong Shukuang

555
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,210
to get close to Yuchi Manor.

556
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,930
Targeting Yuchi Manor

557
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,530
means targeting its treasure.

558
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,840
Since that's the case,

559
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
why not join forces with me?

560
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,770
We could storm Yuchi Manor,

561
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,320
take the key to the treasure,

562
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,970
and split the spoils.

563
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,930
Wouldn't that

564
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,490
be better?

565
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm not fond of sharing.

566
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,400
Women, wealth...

567
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
I prefer to keep them to myself.

568
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,800
Being an ally of Ghost Valley Sect

569
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,400
is far better than being its enemy.

570
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,640
Yan Shao,

571
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,320
think it over.

572
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,490
If you ask me,

573
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,490
you've never seen him wield that staff.

574
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,930
It's like a work of art.

575
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,800
I'll drink to that.

576
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,770
When will we

577
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,640
get a chance to see it in action?

578
00:28:09,915 --> 00:28:11,120
What are you looking at?

579
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,160
Look.

580
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,360
If he catches me,

581
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,690
the next meal for that dog
will be my flesh.

582
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,930
To Shen Zuitian,

583
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,210
Lie is more than just a dog.

584
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,800
Does it matter?

585
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,450
Isn't my life

586
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,450
more important right now?

587
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,210
Fine, I get it.

588
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,320
You don't care whether I live or die.

589
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,120
Beg me.

590
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,290
Maybe if I'm in a good mood,

591
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,120
I'll take your job offer.

592
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,930
Keep dreaming.

593
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,600
Young Master Lin, this way.

594
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:42,690
Young Master Lin is here?

595
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,640
Is it really him?

596
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,450
Young Master Lin!

597
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:46,760
(Lin Shaoci, Yuchi Manor)
Let's go take a look.

598
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,179
All right.

599
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,915
Young Master Lin.

600
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,120
This gentleman has quite
an extraordinary presence.

601
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,120
Could he be

602
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,840
the young master of Yuchi Manor himself,

603
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,160
Lin Shaoci?

604
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,690
Young Master Lin

605
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,800
is a true gentleman.

606
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Among the younger generation
of martial families,

607
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:04,250
he's considered a role model.

608
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,360
Admired by all,

609
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,530
I suppose it's no surprise.

610
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,290
You seem quite familiar with him.

611
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,490
Yuchi Manor has been famous for years.

612
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,770
Everyone knows of it.

613
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,730
Looks like my cover
won't be easy to maintain.

614
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,600
Aren't you going down to greet him?

615
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,450
He already rejected
my marriage proposal.

616
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,050
If I rush over to him now,

617
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,010
wouldn't that just make
me look desperate?

618
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,880
Fair point.

619
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,690
By the way, Brother Shaoci,

620
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,290
