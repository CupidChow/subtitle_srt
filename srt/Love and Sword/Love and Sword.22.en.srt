Sister Rong...

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,900
Put it on the table.

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,510
On the table?

24
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,460
Yes.

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,626
Let me take a look at them.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,310
My goodness.

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,380
I've already found
so many medical books for you.

28
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,900
Why do you still want so many?

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,460
I told you, didn't I?

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,150
My husband likes well-read women.

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,940
I have to catch up on my studies.

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,780
All of these?

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,940
Are you sure
you can finish them in time?

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,830
I still have to try.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,780
Never mind. You wouldn't understand.

36
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,660
Go find me some more.

37
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,390
Go, go, go...

38
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,180
More?

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,220
Go on!

No, this won't do.

Time is tight.

44
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:18,390
I'll read these medical books at night.

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,030
I have to make
the most of our time together

about the poison.

00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,870
Why go to such lengths?

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,710
and all she remembers

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
is how sickly I looked,

54
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,710
what a dull memory that would be.

55
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,310
I just want

56
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,430

It's not about the wine.

78
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,900
It's about us being together.

79
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,070
That makes sense.

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,630
Wine lasts the longest.

81

82
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,270
the richer the taste.

00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:42,830
to enjoy the wine you brewed yourself

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,220
Stop!

90
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,248
- Come here!
- I... I shouldn't...

91
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,100
Look!

92
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,710
What's that?

93
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,390
Try it.

94
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,093
I'll pass...

95
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,160
- Give it a taste.
- No...

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,471
- No...
- It's hot out of the pan!

97
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:02,960
Come on!

98
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,750
The beef tastes nice.

99
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,270
We could use better utensils, though.

100
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,190
All right.

101
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,150
The beef's a success.

102
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,460
But the ambiance...

103
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,710
Ambiance?

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,300
Feng Ming.

105
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,270
Do you play any musical instruments?

106
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,950
Music...

107
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,510
I can play the dizi.

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,950
Perfect!

109
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,510
Let's move. Lift your foot.

110
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,300
Good.

111
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,780
No peeking. You promised.

112
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,780
All right.

113
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,190
Up the steps.

114
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,420
Good.

115
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,100
We're almost there.

116
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,030
Lovely.

117
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,100
Turn.

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,220
Right here.

119
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,660
Good.

120
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,300
Sit down.

121
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,220
Now, let's immerse ourselves

122
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,390
in a romantic atmosphere.

123
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,737
I don't know how to play ambient music.

124
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,420
Your hometown's ambiance
is certainly unique.

125
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,900
What's your problem?

126
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,871
This isn't my fault.

127
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,340
I can play the dizi, not the xiao!

128
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,590
Seriously! The fire stick!

129
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,070
I have it. Here.

130
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,540
Go on...

131
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:55,382
- I can explain...
- Get out!

132
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,660
I... I know how to play the dizi,

133
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,130
but you insisted that I play the xiao!

134
00:07:58,137 --> 00:07:59,493
I was just out of practice!

135
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,337
You've never been musically inclined.

136
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,710
Just let it go.

137
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:05,340
You don't appreciate my music.

138
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,782
A true kindred spirit is hard to find.

139
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,537
Is there anything else you want to do?

140
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,300
If you want to marry me,

141
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,470
you need to formally propose.

142
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,580
All right.

143
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,470
As you wish.

144
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,271
What are you looking at?

145
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,750
He said

146
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,510
he was making something for someone.

147
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,630
For Shukuang?

148
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,060
Who else?

149
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,780
Men and women on dates
always end up in the kitchen.

150
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,540
It's normal.

151
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,750
Food and love go hand in hand.

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,820
What's he cooking up?

153
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,900
You're just like me.

154
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,540
Always thinking about food.

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,660
A marriage proposal

156
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,115
should follow local customs.

157
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,270
I've already sent

158
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,270
the Three Letters and Six Rites
to Yuchi Manor.

159
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,040
The formal proposal,
engagement rites, the betrothal gifts,

160
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:35,226
and the ceremonial wild goose.

161
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,420
The betrothal gift was supposed
to be a live goose,

162
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,248
but Mount Moye
doesn't have geese right now.

163
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,470
So I had to make one as a substitute.

164
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,890
(Goose)

165
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,510
It's not perfect,

166
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,060
but...

167
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:54,900
(Goose)
It is a goose.

168
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,390
You did a great job.

169
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,700
My husband is so skilled.

170
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,940
It is whatever you say it is.

171
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,150
So what should I do next?

172
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,700
According to my hometown's traditions,

173
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,780
the man proposing

174
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,750
should kneel on one knee
and make a declaration of love.

175
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,940
But since you're the Leader of Tiangang

176
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,937
and you're not in the best condition...

177
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,293
right now...

178
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,630
I, Chu Tianyao, Leader of Tiangang,

179
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,150
guided by fate,

180
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,737
wish to be joined in marriage
with Rong Shukuang.

181
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,780
I vow to hold your hand
through all of life's ups and downs.

182
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,350
Will you stay with me forever,

183
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,182
and never let go of my hand?

184
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,060
I will.

185
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,540
Stop chasing me!

186
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,580
You...

187
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,180
We just wanted to see

188
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,350
what you guys made.

189
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,390
Why are you both kneeling?

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,750
Standing while talking is tiring.
Is there a problem?

191
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,780
I see.

192
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,030
Leader Chu.

193
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,510
Master Lin of Yuchi Manor has arrived.

194
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
I told you not to...

195
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,820
Should we go greet Father?

196
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:41,248
Have Young Master Lin and the others
meet us at the mountain gate.

197
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:41,940
Yes.

198
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,493
Come on. This is all your fault.

199
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,270
Young Lady Lin is here too.

200
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,750
She came with Master Lin.

201
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,060
We promised

202
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,510
to face this together.

203
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,060
All right.

204
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,580
No one will hurt you in Mount Moye.

205
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,470
Master Lin, your presence graces us.

206
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,940
Mount Moye is honored by your visit.

207
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,470
I, Chu Tianyao, greet Mr. Lin.

208
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,630
Leader Chu, a pleasure to meet you.

209
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,248
Father, you have traveled a long way.

210
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,540
Wanci is here as well.

211
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,900
You look much better now.

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,820
Brother Shaoci,
you can finally stop worrying.

213
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,915
Greetings, Father.

214
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,004
Wanci, are your injuries better now?

215
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,123
I'm well.

216
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,470
Leader Chu.

217
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,060
This is my daughter, Wanci.

218
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,580
She has come to Mount Moye

219
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,470
for the wedding ceremony.

220
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,515
My respects to you, Leader Chu.

221
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,820
Seeing that you are all safe and well

222
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
puts my heart at ease.

223
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,110
Mr. Ye,
arrange accommodations for everyone.

224
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:57,990
Yes.

225
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,750
Accommodations have been prepared.
Please follow me.

226
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,540
Master Lin, please come with me.

227
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,300
After you.

228
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,270
I heard that Shaoci and Shukuang
had a tough time

229
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,470
getting here.

230
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,510
They made it safely
thanks to Tiangang's protection.

231
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,671
My daughter Wanci was in trouble

232
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:29,248
and stranded at Ruthless Parlor.

233
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,660
It was Tiangang who sent word.

234
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,582
You're too kind, Master Lin.

235
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,804
With the alliance
between Yuchi Manor and Mount Moye,

236
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,893
we are now family.

237
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,030
In your letter,

238
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,820
you mentioned gathering
the Six Great Sects at Mount Moye

239
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,871
to discuss forming an alliance.

240
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,510
The alliance will need
an alliance leader.

241
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,439
Tiangang is willing to support you

242
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,550
in becoming the alliance leader
of the martial world.

243
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,782
The legend of the treasure

244
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,982
and the greed for the keys

245
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,937
will only bring disaster
to the martial world.

246
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:56,580
At the alliance formation gathering,
you'll be in charge.

247
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,700
In front of all the sects,

248
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,820
we will destroy the keys
to the treasure,

249
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,782
putting an end to any future searches.

250
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,030
The treasure will vanish from the world,

251
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,540
and no one will be able to find it.

252
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,900
So many

253
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,750
lives and families have been lost

254
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,871
because of this treasure.

255
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,390
Have you discussed this with Shukuang?

256
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,300
Not yet.

257
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,510
But I believe

258
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,820
she won't object.

259
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,470
If you both agree to this,

260
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,700
then I'll join you in destroying it

261
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,940
so the martial world
can finally find peace.

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,315
You have a heart for the world,
Master Lin.

263
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,700
It is admirable.

264
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,537
Are your injuries healing well?

265
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,540
At Ruthless Parlor,

266
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,160
Shen Zuitian took you hostage,

267
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,871
and I was powerless to stop him.

268
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,350
Don't blame yourself.

269
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,700
Thankfully, Yan Shao saved me.

270
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,300
He's been looking

271
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,660
after me ever since.

272
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,630
Shukuang,
aren't you going to ask about Yan Shao?

273
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,390
He's part of Tiangang,

274
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,060
so he will return eventually.

275
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,630
Since you're here

276
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,390
for my wedding with Leader Chu,

277
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,648
it would be nice
if you stayed a bit longer.

278
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,004
I will make sure
you are well taken care of.

279
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,390
Young Lady Lin,

280
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,510
would you like me to show you

281
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,350
to your quarters now?

282
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,780
If you have any requests,

283
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,540
just let us know.

284
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,540
Thank you.

285
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,420
Please.

286
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,230
You should go rest.

287
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,470
Shukuang seems to be
quite fond of Leader Chu.

288
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,871
She seems to have
long forgotten Yan Shao,

289
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,230
who once protected her.

290
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,990
Rong only has Leader Chu
in her heart now.

291
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,470
After all, he is her future husband.

292
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,660
Shukuang sure changed her mind quickly.

293
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,350
I always thought

294
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,750
she was devoted to Yan Shao.

295
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,510
We should leave the past in the past.

296
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,420
Shukuang is about to marry Leader Chu.

297
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,137
She shouldn't be thinking
of anyone else.

298
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,470
But knowing Shukuang,

299
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,300
I don't think
she would change this fast.

300
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:04,820
That reminds me.

301
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,404
Have you ever seen
Leader Chu's true appearance, Shaoci?

302
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,300
Never.

303
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,700
Has Shukuang ever seen him?

304
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,750
Well, I'm not sure.

305
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,300
But Sister Rong often
goes to see Leader Chu,

306
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,700
and they seem to get along well.

307
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,060
Wanci, you've had a long journey.

308
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,940
Get some rest.

309
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,900
Yes, Wanci.

310
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,540
Rest early and gather your energy.

311
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,630
Prepare for Leader Chu
and Rong's wedding.

312
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,420
All right.

313
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,560
- Let's go.
- We'll take our leave now.

314
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
Rest well.

315
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,350
Come in.

316
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,270
Young Lady Lin.

317
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:51,870
Be careful when you're appearing
over the next few days.

318
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:52,937
They might recognize you.

319
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,630
Understood.

320
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,990
Moye Manor is full of suspicion.

321
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,540
What secret is hiding behind that mask?

322
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,180
Why won't he show his true face?

323
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,230
Do you suspect something

324
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,820
about Chu Tianyao's identity?

325
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,270
I don't know.

326
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,950
I just feel like

327
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,140
his figure looks very familiar.

328
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,620
And I feel like

329
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,580
he's hiding many secrets.

330
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,100
Scout around the manor carefully.

331
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,990
I'll go meet Rong Shukuang.

332
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,950
Understood.

333
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,370
(Shuxin Pavilion)

334
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,270
Your chambers
are so thoughtfully arranged.

335
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,030
As expected,
Leader Chu truly cares for you.

336
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
I am his future wife, after all.

337
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,140
I envy you.

338
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,270
First,
Yan Shao risked his life to save you,

339
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,140
and now you're marrying
an ideal husband.

340
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,060
You've got all the good men in the world

341
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,150
wrapped around your finger.

342
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,270
Look at you saying that.

343
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,820
With your beauty and family background,

344
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,620
you could easily marry a great man.

345
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,380
Besides,

346
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,950
you are keen and perceptive,

347
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,060
skilled at understanding people
and captivating hearts.

348
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,710
Anyone you set your sights on

349
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,540
wouldn't be able to escape.

350
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,710
Yes.

351
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,470
I risked my life at Ruthless Parlor
to save Yan Shao.

352
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,340
And after that,
he became devoted to protecting me.

353
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,182
A heart for a heart.
That's the only way to make it last.

354
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,670
But I'm curious.

355
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,190
How did you and Leader Chu

356
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,860
connect so quickly?

357
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,710
Have you already forgotten

358
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,470
the person who was once
by your side day and night?

359
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,300
Day and night?

360
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:31,757
Yan Shao was merely my guard.

361
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,430
He was devoted to me,

362
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,380
and I cared for him.
That was only natural.

363
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,430
Leader Chu is bold and free-spirited.

364
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,730
When we met, it felt like
we'd known each other for years.

365
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:41,782
We've been

366
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,580
inseparable ever since,

367
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:45,760
getting to know
each other better every day.

368
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,380
Now, I'm eagerly looking forward

369
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,819
to marrying him with all my heart.

370
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,340
From then on, I'll become his wife

371
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,300
and oversee Tiangang with him.

372
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,582
Isn't this the kind of future

373
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,540
you should be happy for me about?

374
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:57,990
You've always had the best

375
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,430
of everything since we were children.

376
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,580
I'm sure Leader Chu must be handsome

377
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,430
and charming too,

378
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,030
for you to fall for him
so easily and quickly.

379
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,620
Since you and Yan Shao
share such a deep bond,

380
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,820
why don't you stay here
and wait for him?

381
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,230
I should go talk to Leader Chu

382
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,470
about the wedding.

383
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,540
Now that you're at Mount Moye,

384
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,190
try not to worry

385
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,470
too much.

386
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,960
Just focus on resting
and getting better.

387
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,510
Go back and get some rest.

388
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,910
Thank you for your concern.

389
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,620
Am I disturbing you?

390
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,860
What's wrong?

391
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,990
Ever since Father and Lin Wanci

392
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,750
arrived at Mount Moye,

393
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,470
I've been feeling uneasy.

394
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,648
I can't shake the feeling
that something will go wrong

395
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,760
and ruin our wedding.

396
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,540
Don't worry. You have me.

397
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,670
I want us to get married
as soon as possible.

398
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,510
Can we?

399
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,204
The guests from the various sects
haven't all arrived yet.

400
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,860
We're the ones getting married.

401
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,230
Why does it matter
if they're here or not?

402
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:50,760
I don't particularly care
about their presence.

403
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,093
Then it can be just the two of us.

404
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,915
We don't need any guests at the wedding.

405
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,871
You're in such a hurry
to marry yourself off.

406
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,470
Are you afraid you won't be able to?

407
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:02,515
Wouldn't that be too rushed?

408
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,960
I only want the best for you.

409
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:05,300
I only need us to be there,

410
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,300
and with heavens and earth
as our witnesses.

411
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,270
That is a unique perspective.

412
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,893
I've never seen
a wedding like that before.

413
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,470
Lin Wanci came to see me.

414
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,780
Every word she spoke was a test.

415
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,270
She's sharp and calculating.

416
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,620
She'll figure it out eventually.

417
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm just afraid
that if we delay too long,

418
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,910
she'll discover that you're Yan Shao

419
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,620
and ruin our wedding.

420
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,430
Then we'll do it your way.

421
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,871
I'll have Feng Ming and Fei Wu
make the arrangements.

422
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,620
It'll be just the two of us, all right?

423
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,780
Sure.

424
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,910
I call this place Fengxi Abode.

425
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,426
Every year around this time,
all the flowers bloom.

426
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,100
Does this please you,

427
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,620
Young Lady Rong?

428
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,910
It does, very much.

429
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,182
This is exactly what I was imagining.

430
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,230
I haven't been inside yet.

431
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,060
Take me in.

432
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,620
Of course.

433
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,380
I think I have

434
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,820
the same butterfly tattoo on my back.

435
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,493
That's a Ghost-Eye Butterfly.

436
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Ghost-Eye Butterfly?

437
00:22:09,248 --> 00:22:10,737
What's the secret behind it?

438
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,100
Master said
the Fuxian treasure's mechanisms

439
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,648
are connected to this tattoo.

440
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,750
If we follow it,

441
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,860
we can avoid the traps inside.

442
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,760
We should draw it down on some paper.

443
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,848
I've been thinking...

444
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,230
When Master put this map

445
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,060
on both of us,

446
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,950
it felt like we were meant
to protect the treasure together.

447
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,340
So what do you plan to do?

448
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,293
The entire martial world
is after the treasure,

449
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,710
driven by ambition and bloodshed.

450
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,270
I want to discuss

451
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,960
destroying the key in front of everyone

452
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,626
at the alliance formation gathering.

453
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:50,626
Doing so will allow the martial world
a few years of peace.

454
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,580
Destroy it?

455
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,620
That sounds like a bit of a waste.

456
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:55,782
You don't want it destroyed?

457
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,100
Wealth can't be taken to the grave,

458
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,820
and I have no interest
in the secret arts of martial.

459
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,300
Whatever the treasure is,

460
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,820
it matters little to me.

461
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,990
If destroying it means these people
will give up their greed

462
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,820
and stop the bloodshed,

463
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,470
then it wouldn't be a bad thing.

464
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,710
It would give us peace.

465
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,060
We wouldn't have to deal
with their schemes anymore.

466
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,670
Why not do it?

467
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,990
I thought you would oppose this.

468
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,780
I even prepared
a whole argument to persuade you.

469
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,470
Do you really think
I'm that obsessed with wealth?

470
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,030
You wound me.

471
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,750
And most importantly,

472
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,860
I have you.

473
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,780
You are my greatest treasure.

474
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,693
So whether the keys stay or go,

475
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,337
I'll leave that decision to you.

476
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,580
What if the day comes

477
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,230
that I can no longer protect you?

478
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,510
That's fine.

479
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,950
I won't need you to protect me.

480
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,860
I'll be the one to protect you.

481
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,780
All right.

482
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,190
Tomorrow's wedding
will be just the two of us.

483
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:12,226
I hope you won't feel disappointed.

484
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,182
It doesn't matter.

485
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,580
Marriage is about two people.

486
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,340
As long as I have you,

487
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,100
that's enough.

488
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,430
Strange.

489
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,300
Sister Rong is missing again.

490
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,270
I just asked Leader Chu's maid.

491
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,230
Leader Chu is gone too.

492
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,140
What's going on?

493
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,030
The last time Sister Rong disappeared,

494
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,990
we later found out

495
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,710
she spent the night
at Leader Chu's place.

496
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,820
Shukuang has been gone all day again.

497
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,230
And now even Leader Chu
is missing as well.

498
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,300
I'm sure those two get along very well.

499
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,100
Since they disappeared together,

500
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,300
they must be together.

501
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,950
There's no need to worry too much.

502
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:10,537
They're probably just having
a private meeting somewhere.

503
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,204
Brother Shaoci, you don't need to worry.

504
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,115
The Six Great Sects will arrive soon.

505
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,093
I'm more concerned
that Ghost Valley Sect

506
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,580
will sneak in and cause trouble.

507
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,669
Shaoci, how do you plan to handle
the alliance formation gathering

508
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,990
of the Six Great Sects?

509
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,137
I will follow
Father's arrangements, of course.

510
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:27,510
He already has a plan in place.

511
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,093
I'm surprised you can still smile.

512
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,820
Why wouldn't I smile

513
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:57,620
when I'm marrying the one I love?

514
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,580
He's done so much for you.

515
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,140
He nearly lost his life saving you.

516
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,270
You...

517
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,382
So what should I do?

518
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,340
Cry with him every day?

519
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,540
He's already done so much for me.

520
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,860
He wants me to live well.

521
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,030
So

522
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,910
I should cherish

523
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,620
every day I have with him even more.

524
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,190
Do you genuinely think

525
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,710
I feel no pain or sorrow?

526
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,750
What good will being sad do for us?

527
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,910
Will it cure his Crimson Lotus Heart?

528
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,950
Will it help him live longer?

529
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,860
If it won't,

530
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,950
then what's the point
of drowning in sorrow every day?

531
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,670
I know you,

532
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,820
Feng Ming, and he grew up together.

533
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,910
You share a bond like no other.

534
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,620
Whether you like me

535
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,270
or hate me,

536
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,580
I will marry him.

537
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:03,093
So instead of resenting me,

538
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,030
why don't we try to get along?

539
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:06,780
At least that way,

540
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:09,382
he'll have one less thing
to be sad about.

541
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,910
Come on.

542
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,710
Let's not keep him waiting.

543
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,060
It's your wedding day,

544
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,510
and I'm happy for you.

545
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,780
Then why do you look so down?

546
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,300
Are you worried
I don't have much time left?

547
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,190
Don't say such things.

548
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,160
You and Miss Rong
have been through so much together.

549
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,990
I sincerely hope
you can spend your lives together

550
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,115
and have the perfect ending.

551
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,910
Enough.

552
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,230
As long as I have today,

553
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,270
I have no regrets in this life.

554
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,430
It's a joyous occasion.

555
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,782
Can't you look happier for me?

556
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,430
At least give me a smile.

557
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,190
If anything happens to me,

558
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,430
you and Fei Wu have to take care of her.

559
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,780
We will.

560
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,750
Is this part of your customs too?

561
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,190
That's the flower boy.

562
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,426
It's rare to see him
act like a real child.

563
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,839
You have no idea
how long I had to plead with him.

564
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,470
He polished off many of my rainbow cakes
before he finally said yes.

to have married such a beautiful bride?

From the moment I met you,

594
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,230
I have been the luckiest.

00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,230
Good.

Then let's begin.

Have you finished drawing yet?

My legs are going numb.

601
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,470
It's just a drawing.

602
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,910
Why is it taking so long?

603
00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:34,760
This butterfly tattoo is connected
to the treasure's mechanisms.

604
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,582
We can't rush it or make mistakes.

605
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,820
Wait.

606
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:41,915
Did you make a mistake?

607
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,580
No.

608
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,300
If we've already decided
to destroy the keys

609
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,826
and never open the treasure,

610
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,426
why are we spending so much effort

611
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,493
drawing the mechanism?

612
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,470
You're right.

613
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,782
A wedding night is worth
a thousand pieces of gold.

614
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:59,604
Why are we wasting time
drawing butterflies?

615
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,820
What are you doing?

616
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,750
It's getting late.

617
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,580
We should rest.

618
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,670
You shouldn't overexert yourself.
It's not good.

619
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,100
Who says it's not? I'm fine!

620
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,915
Even if you're fine,
you shouldn't force it.

621
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,270
Your health comes first.

622
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,620
I said I'm fine!

623
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,580
I don't mind even if you're not.

624
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,430
It's fine.

625
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,820
No, it's not.

626
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,030
It has to be fine
on such an important night.

627
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,337
I won't accept anything else.

628
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,750
Are you using

629
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,750
an adjective or a verb right now?

630
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,470
A verb!

631
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:43,715
Wait, what does it mean?

632
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,430
I'll explain it another day.

633
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,510
Another day?

634
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:49,560
Why wait when we can settle it now?

635
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,990
So, can you handle it or not?

636
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,860
I can.

637
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,190
Stop messing around!

638
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,060
Young Lady Lin,

639
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,780
we've made contact with Leader Shen.

640
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,270
Did you find any traces of them?

641
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,100
Yesterday, I only saw Rong Shukuang

642
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,510
enter Chu Tianyao's room.

643
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,270
But today,

644
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,030
even Feng Ming and Fei Wu
have disappeared.

645
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,910
Did they slip away from the mountain
without anyone noticing?

646
00:33:37,004 --> 00:33:39,137
The wedding
and the alliance formation gathering

647
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,620
are just around the corner,

648
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:43,190
so it's unlikely
they'd leave at a time like this.

649
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,893
There might be some hidden locations
on Mount Moye.

650
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,780
I'll keep searching.

651
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,140
They are the key
to finding the Fuxian treasure.

652
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:50,493
We can't take this lightly.

653
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,580
Have you confirmed
Chu Tianyao's true identity?

654
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,048
The Leader of Tiangang rarely appears
in the martial world.

655
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,430
No one knows his origins.

656
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,750
But from my observations,

657
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,137
he and Rong Shukuang
have a strong connection.

658
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:03,893
This doesn't seem like a blind marriage.

659
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,140
I have a feeling

660
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,100
that his true identity is...

661
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,870
Forget it.

662
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,220
Keep investigating.

663
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,700
